		<title>Ross [Samford]: Rehnquist&#039;s hospitalization</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://cumberland.samford.edu/cumberland_people.asp?ID=175">William G. Ross</a>, Cumberland School of Law, Samford University: <br /><br />&quot;Chief Justice Rehnquist&#39;s hospitalization for thyroid cancer treatment has provided a sudden and poignant reminder to many voters that the winning candidate in next Tuesday&#39;s election is likely to make US court appointments that could have profound political consequences. The future of the Supreme Court, which has barely registered with most voters, may now become an important campaign issue. <br /><br />Rehnquist&#39;s illness is no more than a catalyst for activation of this issue since the advanced ages of the Justices made vacancies likely before Rehnquist&#39;s illness, and there is no reason to suppose that Rehnquist&#39;s resignation is imminent since Rehnquist is scheduled to return to the bench next week. It is impossible to predict which, if either, candidate will benefit from the renewal of interest in the Court, although a recent Time Magazine poll indicated that the prospect of Supreme Court appointments made voters slightly more inclined to vote for Kerry. At the very least, both parties are likely to use the newly emergent judicial issue as a means of energing their political bases, particularly those voters who have strong opinions about abortion. Since pro-choice voters already are likely to vote for Kerry and pro-life voters are generally committed to Bush, however, the judicial issue is not likely to sway many votes among abortion activists. By distracting attention from national security, though, it may stimulate support for Bush among antiwar conservatives and moderates, while helping Kerry among liberals who trust Bush more than Kerry on foreign policy issues. <br /><br />It is interesting to note that Roger B. Taney, the only Chief Justice to serve at a more advanced age than Rehnquist, died three weeks before the 1864 election, at age 87. Preoccupied with the Civil War, voters do not appear to have allowed the vacancy on the Court to have influenced that election, although Taney&#39;s death may have stimulated support for Lincoln insofar as it stirred up bitter memories of Taney&#39;s Dred Scott opinion and similarly provided a timely reminder of the Court&#39;s political influence.&quot; [October 26, 2004]]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/fac/chemerinsky/">Erwin Chemerinsky</a>, Duke Law School:<br /><br />&quot;It is hard to imagine a more conservative or more repressive attorney general than John Ashcroft. The Ashcroft Justice Department took the unprecedented position that the government could hold human beings, including American citizens, forever as enemy combatants without judicial review. Ashcroft rescinded regulations limiting surveillance of peaceful religious and other groups. The Ashcroft Justice Department subpoenaed medical records of women who had abortions. Ashcroft created a unit in the Justice Department to bring obscenity prosecutions against adult films. Perhaps Ashcroft will be most remembered for ordering that the statues in the halls of the Justice Department be covered because they were nude forms. Ashcroft was every bit as conservative as his opponents feared.&quot; [November 10, 2004; Duke News has <a href="http://www.dukenews.duke.edu/news/tip_ashcroft_1104.html">more</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="">Jeff Cooper</a>, Indiana University School of Law, Indianapolis:<br /><br />&quot;According to John Ashcroft, &quot;[t]he objective of securing the safety of Americans from crime and terror <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/11/09/ashcroft.text.ap/index.html">has been achieved</a>,&quot;.  Well, I feel better.<br /><br />Actually, I do feel better knowing that Ashcroft will shortly be leaving DOJ.  There may not have been a terrorist attack in the US since <a href="http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/07/05/la.airport.shooting/">July 2002</a>, but Justice&#39;s record in fighting terrorism has been deeply flawed.  There have been widely trumpeted announcements of arrests, suspiciously timed for maxiumum political advantage.  But there have been no actual convictions in the cases Ashcroft has publicized, and the court&#39;s have rejected Justice&#39;s asserted power power to detain terrorism suspects without charges and without access to counsel for indefinite periods of time.  Indeed, the assertions of power put forth by the Ashcroft DOJ--sometimes under cloak of statutory authority, sometimes simply through creative argumentation, have been truly alarming.  Yet those assertions of power haven&#39;t produced results.  Most notably, the department has yet to solve the case of the anthrax letters mailed to media and political figures in September and October 2001.  <br /><br />Add to these failings the downright weirdness--the covering of the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2002/01/29/statues.htm">Spirit of Liberty</a> in the DOJ headquarters because the statue&#39;s partial nudity made Ashcroft uncomfortable, the aggressive singing of Ashcroft&#39;s cornball patriotic song, &quot;Let the Eagle Soar&quot;--and you have the makings of a truly awful attorney general.&quot; [November 10, 2004; <a href="http://www.jeffcoop.com/blog/">Cooped Up</a> has <a href="http://www.jeffcoop.com/blog/archives/002327.html#002327">more</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Bainbridge [UCLA]: The AG and the Blogs</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.ucla.edu/faculty/bios/bainbridge/">Stephen Bainbridge</a>, UCLA School of Law:<br /><br />&quot;Cruising around the blogosphere, one notes proposals that John Ashcroft be replaced by as Attorney General such legitimate luminaries as <a href="http://volokh.com/archives/archive_2004_11_07.shtml#1100102716">Randy Barnett</a> or <a href="http://billhobbs.com/hobbsonline/004833.html">Fred Thompson</a>. Sorry, guys. Blogospheric prognostication has proved fallible. Bush just went with the conventional wisdom pick: <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20041110/D8694G201.html">White House counsel Alberto Gonzales</a>. No real surprise there. Bush tends to be very loyal and he goes a long way back with Gonzales. Bush&#39;s willingness to go out on a limb for old friends is especially relevant in this case, given Gonzales&#39; involvement in the so-called torture memos and long-ago representation of Enron, which will prove more than a little controversial. Note, however, than an appointment fight now over the AG slot will defang those issues for what I believe is Gonzales&#39; inevitable eventual Supreme Court nomination. Because those issues will have been ventilated this time around, next time Gonzales and his supporters can brush them aside as &quot;asked and answered.&quot; In addition, of course, having spent time as AG will add to Gonzales&#39; stature. There&#39;s no guarantee that this approach will work, of course, but I&#39;d bet quite a lot that it is part of the White House strategy in naming Gonzales.<br /><br />If so, they don&#39;t need Gonzales to spend a lot of time as AG. If all the current justices hold on to the end of this term (next June) and some then step down, Gonzales will have been AG for six months or so, and be well positioned for one of the resulting slots. The bad issues on his resume will have been recently dealt with, and thus difficult to justifiably rehash (not that that will necessarily stop some from trying), while he will have enough time in the new job for some added resume luster....&quot; [November 10, 2004; <a href="http://www.professorbainbridge.com">Professor Bainbridge.com</a> has <a href="http://www.professorbainbridge.com/2004/11/the_ag_and_the_.html">more</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

Surely this country also should adhere to treaty obligations that are designed to deter torture of our POWs, including the obligation in the POW convention never to &quot;absolve&quot; a torturing state of &quot;any liability.&quot; Indeed, in the aftermath of the detainee abuse scandal at Abu Ghraib prison, President Bush has reaffirmed our national commitment to this convention. Shockingly, however, while the administration pours billions into Iraq, it continues to stiff the American POWs tortured by Iraq. <br /><br />During the Persian Gulf War, Iraq brutally tortured U.S. prisoners of war. Saddam Hussein&#39;s secret police broke bones; shattered skulls and eardrums; and whipped, burned, shocked, beat, starved and urinated on our POWs. Yet these brave Americans, as did generations of POWs before them, refused to give in to their captors. One extraordinary Marine was knocked unconscious so many times he lost count; he returned home with a fractured skull for refusing his captors&#39; orders to criticize President George H.W. Bush. Because Iraq would not notify families of POWs, spouses did not know whether they were wives or widows. The result was serious and lasting injury to the POWs and their families....&quot; [November 10, 2004; the <em>Washington Post</em> has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A38242-2004Nov9.html">more</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Ribstein [Illinois]: The SEC and the SROs</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://home.law.uiuc.edu/~ribstein/">Larry Ribstein</a>, University of Illinois College of Law:<br /><br />&quot;The SEC announced yesterday rulemaking initiatives aimed at so-called &quot;self-regulatory organizations&quot; such as stock exchanges.  These include specific proposals to change the rules on ownership, governance, reporting and transparency by these organizations. The governance proposal would, consistent with many other SEC moves, require more independent directors.  The ownership proposal would limit ownership of exchanges by broker-dealer members. <br /><br />The most interesting part of the release was a so-called &quot;concept release&quot; that calls for comments on pursuing an &quot;alternative&quot; to the SRO regulatory model. <br /><br />The SEC apparently fails to see the irony in its release: in proposing detailed and sweeping changes in how exchanges are run, it demonstrates how little &quot;self&quot; there is in &quot;self-regulation.&quot; <br /><br />True self-regulation would involve permitting firms to opt out of federal regulation.  They could, in effect, bond their behavior through a variety of competing certification regimes, including listing on true self-regulating securities exchanges.  See, e.g., Paul Mahoney, The Exchange as Regulator, 83 Virginia Law Review 1453 (1997).  <br /><br />Would this be a &quot;race to the bottom&quot;?  Not necessarily.  Firms could reduce their cost of capital by accepting enough regulation to comfort investors, while having an opportunity to avoid excessive regulation.  Exchanges would have an incentive to compete for regulatory business because more listings means more listing fees for their owners.  Also, more investor trust means more market liquidity, which helps the exchanges&#39; broker-dealer members (whose ownership the SEC is considering capping).  <br /><br />True, this regime poses some risks of conflicts.  Perhaps these risks are increased by broker-dealer membership, and by combining regulatory and trading arms under a single umbrella.  But if these risks are apparent to the SEC, they are also apparent to sophisticated securities markets, and therefore can be expected to show up in the prices of firms that trade on the exchanges.   These firms, in turn, have every incentive to reduce their cost of capital.  <br /><br />But this is obviously not the direction in which the SEC is moving.  We shouldn&#39;t be surprised -- this is just a continuation of the federalization of corporate governance that was accelerated with Sarbanes-Oxley (some of my thoughts on that Act are here).  <br /><br />There is something to be said for the honesty of getting rid of the sham of &quot;self-regulation&quot; and owning up to the fact that we&#39;re really talking about SEC regulation.  Particularly since the SEC uses this sham to expand its role beyond regulation of disclosure to regulation of the internal governance of firms under &quot;SRO&quot; listing rules.<br /><br />It&#39;s too much to hope that this system is going to change drastically (see my exchange with Professor Bainbridge on this).  In the meantime, we can hope that reason will prevail before this &quot;concept&quot; becomes law.&quot; [November 10, 2004; <a href="http://busmovie.typepad.com/ideoblog">Ideoblog</a> has <a href="http://busmovie.typepad.com/ideoblog/2004/11/the_sec_and_the.html">more</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.miami.edu/~froomkin/welcome.html">Michael Froomkin</a>, University of Miami School of Law:<br /><br />&quot;[T]he White House may be thinking of White House counsel Alberto R. Gonzales as the next Attorney General.<br /><br />That would be the same Gonzales who is up to his eye teeth in not just the torture memos, but also the idea that the US can unilaterally decide that the Geneva convention doesn&rsquo;t apply to people we designate as &lsquo;terrorists&rsquo; even if they are captured on a battlefield. <br /><br />I find this rumor very plausible.  From the White House&rsquo;s perspective it&rsquo;s a can&rsquo;t-lose proposition.  It makes a great trial run for Supreme Court nominations on multiple dimensions. <br /><br />If the Democrats lie down on this one, it signals they may be patsies on far-right Justices.  And, it substantially inoculates Gonzales himself if he turns out to be the Hispanic appointee the White House is said to desire: after all, if he was kosher enough to be the <span class="caps">AG, </span>why all of a sudden object to him on the Court? <br /><br />On the other hand, if the Democrats dare to act like an opposition party faced with the most ideological and extreme government in the history of this nation, then the <span class="caps"><acronym title="Grand Old Party - Republicans">GOP</acronym> </span>can try to tar them as anti-Hispanic.  Plus, when they filibuster a future paleoconservative Supreme Court nominee, the fight over Gonzales can be cited as evidence that those poor benighted Democrats just don&rsquo;t like anyone and are being continually obstructionist.<br /><br />The lesson for the Democrats seems clear to me: if you are going to take damage either way, better to be hung for a lion than a lamb.  Not to mention that Gonzales&rsquo;s conduct in office has been immoral.  To allow him to hold office requiring confirmation is to partake of his taint.&quot; [November 10, 2004; <a href="http://www.discourse.net">Discourse.net</a> has <a href="http://www.discourse.net/archives/2004/11/confirmation_blitzkrieg_alert.html">more</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Henning [Wayne State]: Enron/Merrill Lynch Jury Findings for Sentencing</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.wayne.edu/faculty/profiles/henning_peter.html">Peter Henning</a>, Wayne State University Law School:<br /><br />&quot;On Tuesday, November 9, the jury in the Enron/Merrill Lynch trial concluded that the loss caused by the defendants&#39; fraudulent misconduct was $13.7 million. A story in the <a href="http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/business/2893726">Houston Chronicle</a> (Nov. 10, 2004) reviews the jury&#39;s verdict. The government argued for a loss calculation of $43 million, and the defendants who participated in the sentencing phase (two opted out) presented an expert who quantified the loss at approximately $125,000. In addition to the loss calculation, &quot;The jurors made additional determinations that could lengthen three of the defendants&#39; sentences: Bayly, Brown and Furst all broke a private trust with Merrill Lynch; Brown and Furst had managerial or leadership roles; and Brown and Furst used more than minimal planning in the deal.&quot; The sentencing phase was the result of the uncertainty created by the Supreme Court&#39;s decision in <em>Blakely</em> that throws into doubt whether the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which rely on an assessment of the effect of the defendant&#39;s conduct and the person&#39;s role in the offense to determine the ultimate sentence, are constitutional when the judge makes those decisions. Whether the jury can&#8212;and should&#8212;play the deciding role will be determined by the Court in the near future. <br /><br />Based on the jury&#39;s verdict and loss determination, a rough estimate of the likely sentence range is: the base offense level for an economic offense (&Acirc;&sect; 2B1.1 of the Guidelines) is 6, and then the $13.7 million loss adds 20, resulting in an offense level of 27. Assuming the judge accepts the jury&#39;s loss determination and the defendants are in Criminal History Category I&#8212;which is likely&#8212;then the sentencing range would be 70 to 87 months. A defendant would have to serve at least 85% of the sentence, meaning that he would be in a federal correctional institution for at least 5 years, give or take a couple months and the possibility of serving the last few months in a halfway house. The additional jury findings regarding certain defendants can increase the offense level by an additional two to six points, again assuming the judge accepts them, resulting in a sentence as high as 135 to 168 months. Two defendants were also convicted of false statement (&Acirc;&sect; 1001) charges, which may affect their sentences. Given that the defendants went to trial, an Acceptance of Responsibility credit is off the table. If the Feeney Amendment restrictions on downward departures still apply when the sentencing occurs, then the judge will likely have to give the Guidelines sentence prescribed by the Sentencing Table. The sentencing is set for next March, by which time the Supreme Court should have decided, at least generally, the issues related to the constitutionality of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines procedures. All of this may go out the window and U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein could have complete discretion to sentence them within the statutory maximum set by Congress.&quot; [November 10, 2004; <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog">White Collar Crime Blog</a> has <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/2004/11/enronmerrill_ly.html">more</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Sandra Jordan of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law  considers what might happen if, as anticipated, the US Supreme Court applies its reasoning from its June 2004 <u>Blakely</u> ruling to the federal sentencing guidelines in two companion cases set to be argued in October.<hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/jordan.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=1></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>F</strong></font>or thousands of defendants now serving prison time in federal institutions, the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <u>Blakely v. Washington</u> ushered in hope for reconsideration of their sentences.  Observers anticipate that the High Court will apply the reasoning of <u>Blakely</u> to the federal sentencing guidelines in two companion cases set to be argued on October 4, 2004.  If the Court determines that <u>Blakely</u> applies to the federal sentencing guidelines, this conclusion promises to be as monumental as the passage of the sentencing guidelines in 1987.<br /><br /> 	The decision in <u>Blakely v. Washington</u> was issued on June 24, 2004.  Blakely involved an unsympathetic defendant who kidnapped his wife, held her at gunpoint and threatened both his wife and son with bodily harm.  Blakely entered into a plea agreement with the government and pled guilty to a lesser crime of second degree kidnapping rather than the more serious first degree kidnapping charge.  As a result of the plea arrangement, the anticipated sentence under the Washington State guidelines was 53 months in prison.  The statutory maximum for this category of kidnapping was 10 years.<br /><br />	At the sentencing hearing, the judge received evidence of the specific nature of the offense, including the extreme circumstances under which it occurred.  After a three day hearing, the judge determined that Blakely acted with &quot;deliberate cruelty because of the way in which he maneuvered the kidnapping,&quot; and imposed a sentence of 90 months. On appeal, the Washington Court upheld the sentence, finding that the 10 year statutory maximum was sufficiently broad to encompass a guidelines range of 53 months.  Thus, the sentence did not violate Apprendi which dealt with statutory maxima, not guideline ranges.<br /><br />	The United States Supreme Court reversed Blakely&#39;s sentence.  In a 5-4 opinion, Justice Scalia concluded that the sentence was improper in light of the Court's earlier decision in <u>Apprendi v. New Jersey</u>.  Scalia held that a sentence cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny if it is based on information not admitted by the defendant or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.  Because Blakely did not admit to deliberate cruelty, his sentence fell within the reasoning of Apprendi.<br /><br /><u>Blakely</u> threatens the federal guidelines because the same analysis used to dismantle the Washington sentencing scheme cripples the federal system.  Although the <u>Blakely</u> majority expressly stated that &quot;[t]he Federal Guidelines are not before us, and we express no opinion on them,&quot; it is evident that the guidelines or some aspect of their application may be vulnerable under <u>Blakely</u> review.  The key section of <u>Blakely</u> that threatens the federal guidelines is the reasoning that defines the "statutory maximum.&quot;  <u>Blakely</u> announced a radically different definition of statutory maximum: &quot;the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.&quot; <br /><br /> 	The trouble is that over 44% of sentences in federal court are based on sentencing enhancements that are not proven to a jury or admitted by the defendant.  These enhancements, also known as &quot;relevant conduct&quot; in federal court, have the practical effect of increasing, even quadrupling, federal prison time to be served.  Relevant conduct can increase a sentence many years, and it need never be proven to a jury or established beyond a reasonable doubt.  As a result, thousands of federal sentences are based on information that may be determined to be unconstitutional in light of the <u>Blakely</u> ruling. If the Court holds the federal guidelines to the same standard as it applied to the Washington sentencing scheme, as expected, then Blakely review can potentially disrupt the sentences of thousands of federal prisoners. <br /><br />	Besides the logistical problems that will result if the federal guidelines are struck down or held to the <u>Blakely</u> microscope, legal observers are watching closely to discern what guidance the Court will lend to the sentencing process. If the Court elevates the role of the jury to include fact-finding obligations, jurors could then assume much more power in the trial of criminal cases.  This result brings its own set of problems, notably the consideration of information that would otherwise be excluded during the guilt phase of a trial. <br /><br />	The current interpretation of the federal sentencing guidelines allows the government to enhance the defendant&#39;s sentence by incorporating &quot;relevant conduct&quot; information that would otherwise be excluded from the trial and use this same information at the time of sentencing.  This strategy, condoned by the courts until now, has contributed to our swelling prison population in the United States.  <u>Blakely</u>&#39;s rationale is sound and founded on the principle that punishment should be based only on the facts of the case under deliberation. <br /><br /> 	The rules of evidence traditionally keep certain types of information away from the jury, such as prior bad acts, because of the potential for mishandling.  Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence is designed to ensure that the conviction is based solely on the information presented at trial, and not other information from prior criminal activity or conduct for which the defendant has been acquitted.  The prosecutor certainly wants to introduce 404(b) evidence precisely because of the potential jury misuse.  Currently this information is available as relevant conduct at sentencing. If this type of evidence is considered to be Blakely information that elevates the punishment, then the government must both allege and prove their existence to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.  Jurors will then decide a variety of prior wrongs in addition to the present charges.<br /><br />	Interestingly, the federal sentencing guidelines were established after the state of Washington constructed its sentencing scheme designed to guide judicial discretion.  The federal government and other states followed with their own sentencing guidelines systems.  In other areas of law states have followed the federal standard as with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Evidence.  This modeling is absent in the area of sentencing mainly because the federal guidelines are despised by almost all who have intimate working knowledge of their deficiencies, inflexibilities and harshness.  Judges, defense counsel, the public, and even some prosecutors have voiced their displeasure with the harshness of the guidelines and the manner in which they impose punishment without regard to individual situations.  The most hard-core supporter of the guidelines is the Department of Justice which continues to retain the most power under the sentencing scheme as it is currently constructed. <br /><br />	Perhaps for the first time since the passage of the federal guidelines in 1987, there is an opportunity to re-evaluate their actual effectiveness as they currently operate.  Granted, the guidelines standardized the sentencing process.  However, one unanticipated result of the guidelines was that they shifted sentencing power from the judicial branch to the executive branch.  Prosecutors now control the entire criminal prosecution, including sentencing, by negotiating the plea and any crime-specifi
c or extraneous factors which determine the ultimate sentence.  Most observers would agree that the result has been a skewed sentencing jurisprudence which certainly was not contemplated by the drafters of the guidelines system.  Judges have resigned themselves to the reality that the guidelines leave no room for debate or compromise. Now <u>Blakely</u> opens the dialogue on sentencing once again, something that is certainly overdue. If the guidelines do not survive in their entirety, it presents an opportunity to revamp sentencing policy and to factor out all of the troubling concerns with the guidelines.  With an open and inclusive dialogue, change can reflect that which is desirable in sentencing and ferret out the overly formulistic approach that troubled so many guidelines experts.  This is a welcome scenario.<br /><br /><br /><em>Sandra Jordan is an Associate Professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.

		<title>Blocking Nader: This Time, Democratic Dirty Tricks?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Mark Brown, holder of the Newton D. Baker/Baker and Hostetler Chair at Capital University School of Law, says today&#39;s Democrats should take note of the fact that in electoral contests as elsewhere, two wrongs don&#39;t make a right.<hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/mbrown.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=1></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>D</strong></font>irty tricks.  That&#39;s what Democrats called Nixon&#39;s campaign tactics in 1972, when he unleashed his Committee to Re-elect the President (CREEP) on George McGovern.  CREEP&#39;s crusade, which included lies, forgeries, disruptions and at least one burglary, was designed to insure McGovern&#39;s defeat.  Nixon, after all, was America's savior. McGovern was dangerous.  CREEP&#39;s means were thus justified by its end. <br /><br />Ironically, today&#39;s Democrats are playing their own dirty tricks in an effort to win back a stolen Presidency.  And just as ironically, their many justifications mimic Republican excuses for CREEP.<br /><br />The <em>New York Times</em> reported on August 19 that the Democratic Party has gone to great lengths to prevent Ralph Nader from appearing on the 2004 Presidential ballot.  Tactics range from formally challenging thousands of signatures collected by Nader to threatening Nader supporters with jail-time for collecting &quot;fraudulent&quot;" signatures.  Local Democratic operatives - with the National Party&#39;s knowledge and blessing - unabashedly boast that they are "doing everything we can&quot; to stop Nader.  Democrats in Ohio, the Columbus Dispatch reported on August 30, are filing a legal challenge to Nader&#39;s candidacy.<br /><br />Of course, these tricks are not as dirty as those unmasked by Watergate.  But they are dirty nonetheless.  <br /><br />Accessing the American Presidential ballot is a daunting task.  States routinely employ tedious rules and demand thousands of signatures.  So long as these rules are engineered to screen out &quot;frivolous&quot; candidates - those who have no or little support - and are evenly applied, the Supreme Court has found they pass constitutional muster.  Rules designed to exclude parties that have too much support - and disenfranchise their supporters - are clearly illegal.  <br /><br />Given the fact that election officials, who are generally members of the two major parties, zealously scrutinize third-parties&#39; compliance with election laws, one wonders what Democrats are up to.  Third-party Presidential candidates rarely access more than a handful of states&#39; ballots.  (Nader made it onto only 43 ballots in 2000.)  Shenanigans are hardly necessary to &quot;manage&quot; the Presidential ballot.  More importantly, third parties have often added a great deal to the national debates.  Sometimes they have gone so far as to alter Presidential outcomes, either by forcing changes in party platforms &#8212; as was true in 1912 when Roosevelt's &quot;Bull Moose&quot; candidacy forced Wilson to move to the left - or by earning enough votes to shift outcomes - Lincoln&#39;s success in 1860 is probably best known, though Nixon&#39;s victory in 1968 and Clinton&#39;s in 1992 likely owe much to third-party candidacies.<br /> <br />The Democratic answer seems to be twofold:  First, Democrats believe Nader was complicit in stealing their Presidency in 2000; second, they suspect he will do it again in 2004.  In sum, Democrats believe they were entitled to Nader&#39;s votes in 2000 and are entitled to them now.  Nader, like Bush, is a thief.  Democratic self-help to recover the Presidency is thus necessary and justified, even if it is a bit dirty. <br /><br />The argument, of course, proves too much.  Ends do not justify means.  Dirty tricks were wrong in 1972 and are wrong in 2004.  In the eyes of Democrats and Republicans, third parties always &quot;steal&quot; votes.  Must Lincoln and Clinton give back their Presidential victories?  <br /><br />The Democrats&#39; frenzy to beat Bush has caused it to let loose its historical grounding.  First and foremost, the Democratic Party is not entitled to anyone&#39;s vote.  Second, it is not entitled to singularly battle the President.  Third, Nader was not responsible for Gore's defeat.  (If a scapegoat is needed for the 2000 debacle, the Constitution's Electoral College, winner-take-all elections, the Supreme Court, the Republican Party, and George W. Bush offer more promising targets.)<br /> <br />Democrats claim that their tactics are technically legal.  Signatures must be perfect.  Names, addresses, counties of residence have to each be perfectly legible.  T&#39;s must be crossed and I&#39;s dotted.  And canvassers can be sent to prison.  Legality, however, does not imply cleanliness.  Even if technically legal (which may not be completely true) Democrats' efforts to keep Nader off the ballot are dirty.  They are dirty because they are designed to disenfranchise voters.  Nader is being challenged not because he is frivolous, but because he matters.  The Democratic Party wants his votes.  Having conceded Nader&#39;s support (and relevance), the Democrats have confessed their sins.<br /><br />Some may call this argument na&Atilde;&macr;ve.  Parties manipulate ballots (and votes) all the time.  The Republicans are helping Nader gain access right now.  Democratic interference merely levels what has become an uneven playing field.<br /><br />Two wrongs, however, do not make a right.  One would hope that at least one of the two major parties that control American government would exhibit scruples.  The American ideal is democracy, which assumes that people have a right to vote for candidates of their choosing.    <br /><br />There is a huge difference, moreover, between helping and hindering candidates (and voters).  The former is noble, the latter is dirty.  <br /><br />Consider, for example, two robbers who bind and throw their victim into a lake.  One of the robbers recants and jumps in to rescue the drowning man.  All would agree that the unrepentant bandit has no moral (or legal) authority to complain about his conspirator&#39;s change of heart.  <br /><br />Similarly, Republicans and Democrats jointly shoulder responsibility for the draconian restrictions presently placed on third-parties throughout the United States.  Unrepentant Democrats have no quarter to complain, let alone veto, a Republican change of heart. <br /><br />Election laws distinguish between assisting and interfering with voting rights.  One can legally drive a friend to the polling place.  One cannot, however, imprison a neighbor to stop him from voting.  Assistance is lawful (and noble), while interference is illegal (and dirty).  This same logic distinguishes Republican assistance from Democratic interference.  Democratic efforts may be technically legal, but the resulting disenfranchisement of millions of Americans is nothing but a dirty trick.<br /><br /><br /><em>Mark R.

		<title>The Murder They Wrote: US Plots to Assassinate Pakistani Ambassador</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contibuting Editor Ali Khan of Washburn University School of Law says that a recent USDOJ plan to encourage two Muslims to provide funds to assassinate Pakistan&#39;s UN Ambassador shows disrespect for international law and may also violate laws against entrapment.<hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/khan2.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>C</strong></font>all it creative law enforcement. Call it the murder they wrote. A few days ago, the FBI arrested the founder and the Imam of a New York mosque on charges of money laundering tied to a terrorist plot aimed at assassinating Pakistan's UN ambassador. The plot to kill, however, was not a true crime; nor was it hatched by the persons arrested. It was indeed pulp fiction, a thriller, a murder that the US Justice Department wrote to entrap the two Muslims.<br /><br />The central idea of the plot was something like this: &quot;Let&#39;s use the Pakistani criminal who has been convicted of selling fraudulent driver&#39;s licenses to immigrants. Plant him in the mosque. Tell him to act pious and be militant. But stick a wire under his shirt - to record everything he says and hears. Yes, cut his prison term if does the job.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;And the job he needs to do is this: he must come across as a Jihadi, someone devoted to Islam, someone who wants to teach a lesson to President Musharraf for supporting the US against Muslim brothers. This is what the informant should say to the founder and the Imam of the Albany mosque, something like this: &#39;Brothers, Assalam ulalikum. I want your help. I am buying a missile, yes a shoulder-fire missile. I can do it, I have contacts, but I need money, about 40 thousand dollars. I have the people who can kill Munir Akram, you know that ambassador at the UN. Him, he needs to go. And brothers, if you raise this money for the sake of Allah, you get 5 thousand dollars. Maybe you can send this money to Bangladesh children for memorizing the Quran. All praise to Allah. Brothers, can you help raise the money for the missile?&#39;&quot;<br /> <br />Touched by the informant&#39;s sincerity, the founder and the Imam fell for the plot. In law, such state-sponsored plots are known as entrapments.<br /><br />On the surface, entrapment seems a clever way to catch potential criminals. In this case, the informant was an actor, but the founder and the Imam were acting with true hearts. They knew what they were doing was reality, not theater. The inducement was state-sponsored, but the response was authentically criminal. Response rather than inducement has been the staying logic of entrapment.<br /><br />Yet, the American legal system views entrapments as morally odious. Law enforcement officials cross the acceptable line, the courts have held, when they prey upon human vulnerabilities and &quot;implant in the mind of innocent persons the disposition to commit the alleged offense and induce its commission in order that they may prosecute.&quot; American courts have often dismissed criminal cases involving entrapments and let the defendants go.<br /><br />The Albany entrapment case is bizarre even under international law. The United States government -- including its law enforcement agencies -- is under a treaty obligation to safeguard the dignity of foreign ambassadors. A hypothetical attack on the life of an accredited diplomat, conceived behind closed doors in the Justice Department, promotes little respect for international law.  If anything, the plot harbors disrespect for envoys accredited to the United Nations&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;an institution for which Al-Qaeda has no respect either.<br /><br />Despite this repulsive international dimension to the fake terror plot, it is too early to tell how the courts would handle the entrapment case against the Bangladeshi founder and the Iraqi Imam of the Albany mosque. Right now they are in jail and bail seems unlikely. The prosecution seems determined to send these men to prison for the rest of their lives. These terror charges &quot;represent our commitment to infiltrate and expose those who seek to do us harm,&quot; Deputy Attorney General James Comey said at a Justice Department press conference.<br /><br />The Justice Department&#39;s goal of finding terrorists is legitimate, since America must be protected from internal enemies. But the end does not justify all means - not in law. The Muslim community of many millions living all over the United States need not be placed under psychological detention, fearing each other; nor need American mosques be infested with state-sponsored criminal spies.<br /><br /><em>Ali Khan is a professor at Washburn University School of Law in Kansas.

		<title>High Stakes in November: George W. Bush and the Future Federal Judiciary</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor Marjorie Cohn of Thomas Jefferson School of Law in San Diego says that perhaps the most far-reaching impact of the upcoming November election is who will get to appoint the nation&#39;s judges - including its Supreme Court justices - beginning January 2005.<hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/cohncolor.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>G</strong></font>eorge W. Bush, while trying to convince skeptical conservative activists of his father&#39;s Christian bona fides in 1988, reassured them that George I was with them on judicial nominations, as well as abortion.  Then he punctuated his declarations with six words that would ensure their support for him 12 years later: &quot;Jesus Christ is my personal savior.&quot;<br /><br />Bush&#39;s religiosity permeates his national policies.  When Bob Woodward asked him whether he consulted his dad before invading Iraq, Bush said, &quot;He is the wrong father to appeal to for advice; there&#39;s a higher Father that I appeal to.&quot;<br /><br />George W. Bush&#39;s sort of Christianity also guides his judicial nominations for lifetime appointments to our federal courts.  They are judges who would eviscerate civil rights, workers&#39; rights, and the environment.  Their agendas are anti-choice and pro-corporate.<br /><br />Perhaps the most far-reaching impact of the November election is who will appoint the nation&#39;s judges beginning January 2005.  Although a one-vote margin of the Supreme Court anointed George W. Bush president in 2000, the Court has not voted in lockstep this term.  In the Guantanamo and U.S. citizen detention cases, the Court made clear that the President&#39;s power is not absolute.  It upheld the rights of the disabled, and non-citizens to recover for human rights violations.<br /> <br />The political balance on the Supreme Court hangs by a slender thread.  Rehnquist, who has been on the Court for 32 years, is 79 years old. Stevens, a member of the Court for 29 years, is 84.  And O&#39;Connor, on the Court for 23 years, is 74 years old.  Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 71 years old, is a cancer survivor in frail health. The next President of the United States may have the opportunity to appoint four new justices to the Supreme Court, radically altering the complexion of the precariously divided Court.<br /><br />It is common for a Supreme Court justice to serve for at least 20 or 30 years.  That means the man elected in November will likely determine the fabric of the law in America for the next 40 years.  Ralph Neas, executive director of People for the American Way, says &quot;more than 100 Supreme Court precedents would be overturned with one or two more right-wing justices like Thomas and Scalia.&quot;<br /><br />If Bush is elected, we can expect his Supreme Court picks to mirror his choices for our nation&#39;s lower federal courts.  Two of his nominees have made news recently for their advice on how Bush&#39;s interrogators can torture prisoners without risking criminal prosecution.<br /><br />Former Assistant Attorney General Jay S. Bybee prepared a 50-page document that defied U.S. statutory and treaty law by defining torture so narrowly, it would permit horrific treatment as long it wasn&#39;t life-threatening.  Bush rewarded Bybee for his legal creativity with an appointment-for-life to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, the federal court with the largest caseload in the country.<br /><br />Pentagon General Counsel William Haynes II is a career military lawyer with almost no courtroom experience that would qualify him for a lifetime seat on the Fourth Circuit.  Yet after Haynes supervised the preparation of a report advising that the President&#39;s Commander-in-Chief authority would trump the prohibition against torture, Bush nominated him for a federal judgeship.<br /><br />The revelations of Haynes&#39; apologies for torture may not resonate with U.S. Senators, who must give their advice and consent to Bush&#39;s nominees.  The torture at Abu Ghraib prison, Guantanamo Bay and Afghanistan may have poisoned the well for William Haynes.<br /><br />The Senate has confirmed 198 of Bush&#39;s judicial nominees, bringing the vacancy rate to its lowest level in years.  Nevertheless, in a campaign trip to Senator John Edwards&#39; home state of North Carolina and to Michigan, Bush claimed that Democrats were unfairly obstructing his judicial nominations.<br /><br />Edwards&#39; tough questioning of Charles Pickering, Bush&#39;s nominee to the Fifth Circuit, was instrumental in the defeat of Pickering&#39;s nomination.  Bush, however, circumvented the Senate&#39;s constitutional role in the selection of judges by appointing Pickering anyway during a Congressional recess.<br />  <br />Pickering&#39;s checkered past includes his article explaining how to strengthen Mississippi&#39;s statute criminalizing interracial marriages.  As a federal district court judge, he engaged in threats and unethical communications to force prosecutors to drop a charge against a man convicted of burning a cross on the lawn of an interracial family.<br /><br />Bush also ran an end run around the Senate by appointing Bill Pryor to the Eleventh Circuit.  Pryor has expressed extreme hostility to a woman&#39;s constitutional right to reproductive choice.  He called Roe v. Wade &quot;the worst abomination of constitutional law in our history.&quot;<br />  <br />But Pryor&#39;s contempt isn&#39;t limited to women.  When he went to federal court to try to overturn a consent decree protecting abused and neglected Alabama children, he told reporters: &quot;It matters not to me whether or not [my actions protect children].  My job is to make sure the state of Alabama isn&#39;t run by [a] federal court.&quot;<br /><br />Pryor fits nicely into Bush&#39;s mold for right-wing Christian ideologues.  The judge said that the challenge of this millennium will be to &quot;preserve the American experiment by restoring its Christian perspective.&quot;<br /><br />Bush&#39;s recess appointments of Pickering and Pryor so incensed Democratic senators that they held up several of Bush&#39;s other pending judicial nominations.  In May, Bush struck a deal with the Democrats.  He agreed not to make recess appointments; the Democrats consented to allowing the votes to proceed on the 25 mostly &quot;noncontroversial&quot; pending nominees.<br />  <br />Three weeks ago, however, by a vote of 51-46, the Senate confirmed James Leon Holmes for a seat on the Eastern District of Arkansas, a federal district court.  Bush&#39;s nomination of Holmes became a lightning rod because of his views on the subservience of women.  In a 1997 article in a Catholic newspaper, Holmes wrote: &quot;The wife is to subordinate herself to her husband&quot; and &quot;the woman is to place herself under the authority of the man.&quot;  He has even dismissed the rape and incest exception with the preposterous claim that &quot;the concern for rape victims is a red herring because conceptions from rape occur with approximately the same frequency as snowfall in Miami.&quot;<br /><br />But Senate Democrats had earlier used the threat of a filibuster to block the nomination of William G. Myers III, which The New York Times called &quot;the starkest example yet during the Bush administration of the debate over whether someone who has spent a career vigorously advocating a particular ideological viewpoint is an appropriate candidate to be a federal judge.&quot;  Myers, a lobbyist and lawyer for grazing and mining interests, and top official at the Department of the Interior, has demonstrated his contempt for environmental protection and trampled on the rights of Native Americans.  Myers once wrote that federal land regulations were akin to King George&#39;s &quot;tyrannical&quot; rule over the colonies and could lead to a &quot;modern-day revolution&quot; in Western states.  Moreover,
the American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary gave Myers its lowest passing rating.  A bare majority of committee members found him qualified, and none found him well qualified for a seat on the Ninth Circuit.<br /><br />Bush&#39;s pending judicial nominees also include Texas Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen, who voted to benefit Halliburton and Enron after taking campaign contributions from them.  He also nominated California Supreme Court Justice Janice Rogers Brown, whose decisions have shown great hostility to affirmative action, the rights of workers, gays, senior citizens and the disabled, and to protecting children from lead poisoning.  Two hundred-fifty law professors, including this writer, signed a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee urging rejection of Brown&#39;s nomination.<br />The Alliance for Justice, which monitors Bush&#39;s nominations for federal judgeships, has set forth alternative criteria for evaluating the record of a judicial nominee:  He or she should have demonstrated a commitment to protecting the rights of ordinary Americans, rather than placing the interests of the powerful over those of individual citizens; worked on behalf of the disadvantaged; shown a commitment to the progress made on civil rights, reproductive freedom, and individual liberties; or manifested a respect for the constitutional role Congress plays in promoting civil rights and health and safety protections and ensuring recourse when these rights are breached.<br /><br />Many of George W. Bush&#39;s nominees fail to satisfy any of these requirements.  He has sought out ideologues who meet a litmus test for pleasing his right-wing religious backers.  If Bush is elected president in November, we can expect him to mold the federal judiciary - and probably the Supreme Court - in his own image.  A frightening thought.<br /><br /><em>Marjorie Cohn, a professor at Thomas Jefferson School in San Diego, is executive vice president of the National Lawyers Guild, and the US representative to the executive committee of the American Association of Jurists.</em><br /><p><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist LTC John M. Bickers, a law professor at the US Military Academy at West Point, says that two recent decisions regarding the death penalty show that the Supreme Court seems to accept capital sentencing as a punishment, as long as they can set the boundaries for sentencing.<hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/bickers.bmp" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>n a pair of cases released last month, the Supreme Court considered the applicability of retroactivity rules to aggravating and mitigating factors in death penalty cases. Although the subject is of sufficiently limited technical nature as to be of value primarily to practitioners in this area, the cases do seem to reflect a new and fundamental decision of the Court that there is nothing particularly unusual or different about capital sentencing. <br /><br />The course of death penalty law under the Constitution has been an odd and wandering one since 1972, when a badly divided Court was able to agree only that the manner in which capital sentences were arrived at was unconstitutional (see Furman v. Georgia). Four years later the Court approved Georgia&#39;s attempt to revive the death penalty by requiring the sentencing authority to consider both aggravating and mitigating circumstances before imposing such a punishment (see Gregg v. Georgia). <br /><br />That case began, rather than ended, the Court&#39;s foray into specific death penalty rules. For almost three decades, the Supreme Court has weighed and evaluated the schemes developed by the states for capital sentencing. The area has represented a version of federalism as it is understood by many modern observers: the states operate as laboratories, resolving common problems in diverse ways. The Supreme Court acts as a boundary judge, striking down those experiments which exceed Constitutional tolerance. <br /><br />In two relatively recent cases, the Court announced just such Constitutional limits on state authority. In an unintentional but fitting symmetry, one dealt with each side of the Gregg equation: <em>Ring v. Arizona</em> required that juries, not judges, find the aggravating factors necessary before a sentence of death could be imposed, and <em>Mills v. Maryland</em> rejected a rule that permitted juries to consider mitigating factors only when they were found unanimously. Both cases served to slow but not stop capital sentencing, but each was well enough grounded in the fundamental role of the jury that they were not exceptionally controversial. The affected states changed their rules and procedures, and the criminal justice system resumed its operation. <br /><br />Enter the retroactivity problem. To oversimplify slightly a complex area, constitutional decisions of the Supreme Court in the criminal law apply immediately to all ongoing cases. This includes, perhaps unsurprisingly, those cases pending on direct appeal. When the Court announces as a Constitutional a principle that had not previously been recognized&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;such as the rule that peremptory challenges may not be used in a race-conscious way (<em>Batson v. Kentucky</em>) &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; that rule affects those cases which are at trial, or in which an appeal is still possible. <br /><br />A different rule exists where those appeals are over and the sentence is subject only to collateral attack. In a nod to the special importance of finality in the criminal law, the Court in <em>Teague v. Lane</em> limited the applicability of its own holdings when cases appear in federal court in the form of a habeas corpus proceeding. Because the writ of habeas corpus, the Great Writ, allows anyone to challenge the conditions of their custody, for the duration of that custody, the Court in Teague established limits to retroactivity during such collateral attacks on sentences. When a prisoner seeks release or retrial in the habeas setting, says Teague, the court must first discover the date at which the sentence became final&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;that is, the date on which the direct appeal routes were exhausted, either by decisions against him or be the expiration of time limits in which he might file for further review. Then that date is compared to the date of the announcement of the constitutional rule the prisoner seeks assistance from: if the constitutional ruling by the Supreme Court came after the date the sentence became final, it will not be applied to his case. <br /><br /><em>Teague</em> itself recognized two general exceptions to this rule. The first is when the announced constitutional rule changes the criminal law substantively. For example, the recent landmark case of <em>Lawrence v. Texas</em> held that the Constitution prevents states from criminalizing certain personal sexual choices. This is clearly a substantive change. While it is unlikely that any states contained a large population confined after conviction for adult, private, noncommercial, consensual sodomy, it is equally clear that a habeas petition brought after Lawrence would secure the freedom of any person so confined. The <em>Teague</em> limit on retroactivity will not serve as a barrier keeping anyone in prison once the Supreme Court has held that the conduct for which he was imprisoned is constitutionally protected. <br /><br />The second exception to the Teague bar is where the change is a procedural one, but is such a &quot;watershed&quot; change that it fundamentally alters our understanding of "bedrock" principles of criminal justice. In commenting on this rule, the Court has noted that these watershed changes must implicate fundamental fairness or substantially increase the accuracy of the proceedings. Where there has been such a procedural change in the criminal law&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;and the Court always cites the <em>Gideon v. Wainwright</em> requirement of providing defense counsel for the indigent as an example&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;the change will be applied on habeas as well as direct review. <br /><br />The death sentences of George Banks (<em>Beard v. Banks</em>) and Warren Summerlin (<em>Schriro v. Summerlin</em>) provided the Court the opportunity to apply the complicated Teague formula to the holdings of <em>Mills</em> and <em>Ring</em>. In both cases, they found that extension of their recent death penalty decisions to habeas proceedings was barred by <em>Teague</em>. Neither result, in analytical legal terms, was particularly surprising. Both results, on a broader view of the nature of the Constitution, prove troubling. <br /><br />In September, 1982, George Banks slaughtered thirteen people (mostly girlfriends, ex-girlfriends, and their children) in a terrible hour. The following year he received twelve death sentences from a Pennsylvania jury. The jury found that the aggravation of multiple offenses outweighed the only mitigating factor they found unanimously: extreme mental or emotional disturbance. Significantly, Banks had offered two other mitigating factors, substantial impairment of his ability to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or conform it to the requirements of the law, and a general, catch-all that Pennsylvania defined as &quot;any other evidence of mitigation concerning the character and record of defendant and the circumstances of his offense.&quot; These two submissions became the basis for the claim which the Supreme Court resolved last month. Banks noted that Pennsylvania law required the jury to weigh only the mitigating factor found unanimously. Thus those other two potentially mitigating factors might have been disregarded even by jurors who found them to be quite compelling. Because such a scheme violates the holding of Mills, Banks asked the Court to overturn his sentence. <br /><br />Two months before Banks committed his crimes, Warren Summerlin was sentenced to death for the murder of Brenna Bailey, an employee of a finance company. Unlike Banks, Summerlin's senten
cing was done by a judge. Under the Arizona law of that time, the judge alone evaluated the sentencing evidence, found the required aggravating factors, and sentenced Summerlin to death. On the same Monday that he pronounced the sentence, Summerlin&#39;s judge, who was later removed from the bench for his heavy marijuana use, sentenced a second man to death after finding identical aggravating factors. Summerlin contended, among his many arguments, that the finding of sentencing factors by a judge alone was a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury. Like his other contentions, the courts rejected his claim, and his sentence became final, for <em>Teague</em> purposes, in 1984. <br /><br />As the Supreme Court viewed these two cases, Teague barred the application of Mills to <em>Banks</em> and <em>Ring</em> to <em>Summerlin</em>. Opinions of the Court by Justices Thomas and Scalia, respectively, analyzed the Teague issues in a direct and straightforward way. In both cases the sentences were final before the case they sought to have applied to them. In both cases the rule was new. In neither case was there a serious argument that the criminal law had been changed substantively, that the state was now precluded from punishing an offense that heretofore might be prohibited. Finally, said the Court opinions, in neither case was the procedural change a watershed of a similar magnitude to <em>Gideon</em>. <br /><br />Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer dissented in both cases. In Banks, Justice Stevens argued that the holding in <em>Mills</em> was not new. Rather, he said, the Teague bar did not apply at all. He viewed the procedure by which a single juror could control a sentence simply by rejecting a mitigating factor as a holdout (and thus preventing the jury from weighing it against any aggravating factors) as utterly arbitrary. Its rejection as unconstitutional was therefore a "natural outgrowth" of Court decisions prohibiting mandatory imposition of death for particular offenses. <br /><br />In Summerlin, Justice Breyer's dissent conceded the newness of the <em>Ring</em> rule. Indeed, it would be virtually impossible to do otherwise, as the Supreme Court had held precisely the same sentencing scheme to be constitutional a decade earlier in <em>Walton v. Arizona</em>. Instead, he argued that use of the jury in sentencing in capital cases was precisely the sort of enhancement in the accuracy of the process contemplated by Teague. Although he acknowledged that he had previously been alone in believing that the Sixth Amendment requires jury sentencing for the death penalty to occur, Justice Breyer persisted in arguing that such a sentence &quot;must reflect a community based judgment.&quot; <br /><br />In both cases, the majority probably have the more compelling view of the state of the law. In neither Banks nor Summerlin is the dissent truly successful in fitting their opposition to the procedure at issue within the retroactivity limitations set forth by Teague. Within the framework of established precedent, Justices Scalia and Thomas are quite convincing in arguing that the changes announced in Mills and Ring were new, and that they were far less significant than some of the other changes announced by the Court and found to be non-retroactive. Indeed, the very requirement of trial by jury was not held to be a retroactive one. Given that fact, it is hard to understand why the finding of a particular aggravating factor or consideration of particular mitigation should be applied retroactively. Yet the application of that very analysis creates a troubling dilemma when considering what the Constitution means in our society. <br /><br />As Justice Breyer notes in his <em>Summerlin</em> dissent, death as a penalty is different from imprisonment. Although the majority categorically rejects the notion that the rules for retroactivity should differ in the capital context, they do not respond to Justice Breyer's observation that an unexecuted death sentence is &quot;an entirely future event.&quot; Indeed, it is difficult to see how they could: whatever may be said of the importance of finality for decisions which confine people for a period of time, the common understanding of finality would preclude the use of that term about a death sentence while the sentenced prisoner remains alive. The only response the otherwise-persuasive majority opinion makes is to note that such an argument calls for a rejection of <em>Teague</em>, and that &quot;we would not agree with the dissent's conclusions.&quot; <br /><br />The majority opinions in both Summerlin and Banks comport with stare decisis. Both cases treat the precedent of <em>Teague</em> in a fair way, and in neither case is the Court forced to make particularly complex legal arguments to set out their position. Those positions, however, do require the majority to reject the notion that death is different. That they are willing to do so does not necessarily reflect a sea change in the law; it does, however, highlight the disturbing premise which underlies the Court&#39;s retroactivity jurisprudence. <br /><br />This is because, ultimately, the continued acceptance of the <em>Teague</em> rules, with the value they place on finality, diminishes the Constitution. If the Court is to retain moral force as the final interpreter of the Constitution, it must confront the dilemma which the retroactivity rules present: if it is an enduring Constitution the Court interprets, why should a new rule not affect all cases? When Congress acts only prospectively, that is one thing: they are announcing a policy change. When the Court acts only prospectively, it is harder to define what they are doing as interpretation of a constant standard. It is easy to understand why a new invention is not applied to old cases; it is not so easy to explain why a new discovery is not. <br /><br />In most cases, perhaps, the need for stability within the field of criminal law justifies the ideological cost of the dilemma. Perhaps it is simply too horrific to think of retrying or releasing vast numbers of prisoners each time the Court announces a new rule. Perhaps, too, the lack of a <em>Teague</em> bar would be counterproductive to the Constitution: it might well be that the Court would avoid the retrial problem by simply refraining from ever recognizing a procedural right which some states had previously not allowed. Fear of opening the prison doors might tie the Court&#39;s hands even where they saw what they believed to be a Constitutional wrong. <br /><br />In death cases, though, that price seems unacceptably high. As Judge Reinhardt of the Ninth Circuit asked in his concurrence when the Summerlin case was before that court, &quot;is it possible that prisoners will now be executed by the state solely because of the happenstance that the Supreme Court recognized the correctness of their constitutional arguments too late?&quot; Until the Court can remove that unanswerable question by eliminating the &quot;finality&quot; rules of Teague from death penalty litigation, the judiciary will continue to run the risk of being thought to be making rules rather than discovering principles. <br /><br /><em>John M.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist and constitutional law scholar Thomas E. Baker of Florida International University College of Law says that the US Supreme Court&#39;s 2000 ruling in <em>Bush v. Gore</em> is a precedent that could be repeated after the presidential election this fall.<hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forum/thomasfbaker.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>G</strong></font>oing into the presidential election with an uneasy feeling of <em>deja vu</em> reveals that the absolute worst thing about the Supreme Court&#39;s decision in <em>Bush v. Gore</em> is that it is <em>stare decisis</em>, or precedent. That means it could happen again. <br /><br />Suppose that history repeats itself in a closely-divided popular vote in the November 2004 election&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;a hypothetical that has to be taken seriously, given recent polling numbers and the lengthy list of contested states. Suppose that neither John Kerry nor President Bush has the necessary 270 vote majority in the electoral college and so the outcome depends on the electoral votes of a single state and suppose that once again that particular state&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;Florida or some other state&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;is simply &quot;too close to call.&quot; Under the law of every state, there is some procedure for a recount. Lawsuits and legal challenges would follow and there would be appeals to the state supreme court. The precedent of <em>Bush v. Gore</em> is that no matter how the state supreme court decides the case, <em>Kerry v. Bush</em> is going to be decided by the Supreme Court of the United States. <br /><br />Before <em>Bush v. Gore</em>, jurists and academics would have confidently explained that the legal issues in a presidential election undergoing a contested recount were a matter of state law and the federal courts could not hear and decide the appeal in the first place, because the issues on the merits were nonjusticiable, i.e., political questions that were beyond the ken of Article III courts. Indeed, in December 2000 the experts and the pundits were all over the newspapers and cable news shows predicting that the Supreme Court of the United States would not take the Florida case. That their predictions proved to be mistaken, that the Supreme Court took the case on appeal from the state high court&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;two times, no less&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;highlights how much <em>Bush v. Gore</em> changed election law and the Constitution. <br /><br />Not a single one of the nine Justices seriously argued that the case should not have been heard because under the Constitution those issues were committed to the political process and therefore for the elected branches to resolve. Sure, the per curiam opinion said the decision was &quot;limited to the present circumstances,&quot; but the not-so-far-fetched hypothetical is the identical situation. Sure it takes four votes to grant review in the Supreme Court, but Bush v. Gore itself is evidence that there will be four Justices willing to take the next case. <br /><br />The fact that what the Justices did in Bush v. Gore amounted to an amendment to the Constitution is demonstrated by a &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after.&quot; Before: the federal courts would have left the issues to the political branches. The contested election would have played out in the state courts and state legislature and in Congress. That is what happened the only time this has ever happened before, in the Hayes-Tilden election of 1876: Congress created a commission, consisting of members of both houses plus five justices of the Supreme Court, that divided along party lines and awarded the disputed electoral votes to Hayes. The text of the Constitution and the consensus understanding of constitutional law was that it was for Congress ultimately to resolve the election dispute. <br /><br />After: never mind the state courts and the state legislature or the Congress for that matter, and paraphrasing the movie line, &quot;We don&#39;t need no stinking commission.&quot; Forget that the Constitution says that Presidents are supposed to choose Justices, not the other way around. Justice Jackson was wrong: the Supreme Court is final and infallible. <br /><br />Thus, the worst thing about <em>Bush v. Gore</em> is not that Bush won or that Gore lost, but rather that the Supreme Court took it upon itself to decide the case, in the first place, and established itself as the presidential election commission. Indeed, after <em>Bush v. Gore</em>, the set of issues that are political questions&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;the kinds of issues that used to be off-limits for judges and courts to decide&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;is a null set. Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes once observed: &quot;We are under a Constitution, but the Constitution is what the judges say it is &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;.&quot; Judicial review has metastasized into judicial supremacy. &quot;One person, one vote&quot; sounds good on paper, but in practice all you need is five votes out of the nine. <br /><br /><br /><em>Thomas E.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor William G. Ross of Cumberland Law School at Samford University says that although the US Supreme Court has not been a significant issue thusfar in the current Presidential campaign, the likelihood of Presidential appointments to the Court in the next four years, combined with all the high-profile issues the Court addresses, makes it something that voters should be thinking about.<hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/images/ross3.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=1></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>n contrast to the 2000 presidential election campaign, when federal judicial appointments were a major issue, voters and candidates this year have largely ignored the courts. This is ironic, for the 2004 election will almost certainly have far more impact upon the federal judiciary than did the 2000 election. Contrary to widespread expectations during the 2000 campaign, no U.S. Supreme Court vacancies have arisen during the current presidential term. Since the advanced ages and uncertain health of many Justices practically ensure that vacancies will occur during the next four years, the election could profoundly affect the Court's ideological direction for decades.<br /><br />	Although both candidates briefly commented on Supreme Court appointments in response to questions during the second and third presidential debates, neither has emphasized the issue on the campaign trail. Kerry, who declared during the second debate that "the Supreme Court of the United States is at stake in this race," has only recently begun to make regular references to judicial appointments in his public addresses. Bush has largely ignored the issue, aside from his frequent criticism of the Massachusetts judges who held last summer that their state constitution required same-sex marriage. He appealed to his conservative constituents in the second debate by promising that he would not appoint "activist judges." <br /><br />Many political activists and commentators are less reticent. Various Kerry supporters, including Hillary Rodham Clinton, Jesse Jackson, and Al Sharpton, have recently made speeches warning that the coming election could profoundly influence the Court. Several liberal groups have made similar appeals. People for the American Way, for example, has issued a report entitled Courting Disaster 2004, which argues that a Bush victory would have dire consequences for civil liberties because Bush would make reactionary judicial appointments. On the other end of the political spectrum, Pat Buchanan and many other traditional conservatives are supporting Bush, despite their intense opposition to many of Bush's policies, because they believe that Bush would make sound judicial nominations. Many newspaper endorsements of Kerry and Bush have emphasized the impact that the election may have upon the courts. These and other efforts to interject judicial politics into the campaign, however, remain the exception.<br /><br />	This year's apathy about judicial issues is more consistent with historical patterns than was the high level of interest that marked the 2000 campaign. Only four times during the past century &#8212; in 1924, 1964, 1968, and, to a lesser extent, 2000 &#8212; has the federal judiciary emerged as an issue that may have influenced significant numbers of votes. Even in those elections, however, the impact of judicial issues is uncertain. <br /><br />	The most obvious reason why the Court is not an issue in the present presidential campaign is that this year's election has an unusually tight focus, with national security and the economy dominating the political agenda. In contrast, the Court may have become uncommonly salient during the 2000 campaign because, during a time of peace and prosperity, there were no overriding election issues. <br /><br />	Judicial issues tend to have a low profile in most presidential campaigns because these contests do not encourage the serious discussion of public affairs. Since many of the most significant and divisive issues that federal courts decide are too complex and nuanced for many voters to comprehend, the major parties naturally tend to ignore such issues. As the Des Moines Register observed in lamenting that the Court was "the forgotten issue" during the 1992 presidential campaign, voters and candidates were tempted to 'shrug off' judicial issues "as arcane in a campaign of erupting bimbos and waving flags." Serious discussion of judicial issues is made even more difficult by widespread ignorance about constitutional questions. Although there appears to be growing recognition of the judiciary's political importance, most voters seem to remain uninformed about the work of federal judges. Surveys indicate that even the names of most Supreme Court Justices remain unknown to the overwhelming majority of Americans.<br /><br />	In discussing the Court, candidates must therefore speak about simple issues that resonate with a broad spectrum of voters. It was not surprising, for example, that Bush during the second debate indicated that he would not appoint judges who would remove the words "under God" from the Pledge of Allegiance. Similarly, one study has indicated that Barry Goldwater's 1964 attacks on the Court for its 1962 decision banning state-sanctioned prayer in public schools struck far more chords with voters than did his criticism of the Court's recent reapportionment decisions, which had far more political significance than school prayer but ignited less passion and were more difficult for voters to understand. Since abortion is a hot-button issue, many Republicans and Democrats during recent presidential campaigns have made the future of legalized abortion the focal point of efforts to rally voters around the issue of judicial appointments. To a lesser extent, Democrats have also highlighted the judiciary's role in promoting racial equality. In 2000, for example, Democrats emphasized that Bush's election could result in the Court's rejection of Roe and civil rights precedents, while largely refraining from criticism of the Court's recent nullification of federal legislation on domestic violence, handgun regulation, and age discrimination. <br /><br />	The Court is especially difficult to transform into a campaign issue when, as now, its decisions are not broadly controversial. It is no accident that the Court has emerged as a significant election issue primarily when the Court's general direction was broadly unpopular with significant numbers of voters. In 1924, for example, Senator Robert M. LaFollette, the third party Progressive candidate for President, attacked the "conservative" Taft Court for its nullification of economic regulatory legislation. The decisions of the "liberal" Warren Court &#8212; particularly those involving the rights of criminal defendants, school prayer, and reapportionment &#8212; emerged as election issues in 1964, when Republican nominee Barry Goldwater promised to appoint "conservative" Justices to the Court. In 1968, after the Court had continued to protect the procedural rights of defendants in such cases as Miranda v. Arizona, both Republican nominee Richard M. Nixon and American Independent nominee George C. Wallace repeatedly promised to appoint judges who would protect "law and order." <br /><br />	Since the present Court is not easily tagged as "liberal" or "conservative" and its recent decisions have variously both pleased and offended voters of nearly every political persuasion, the general direction of the Court provides no lightening rod for criticism. In this context, both parties are reduced to warning voters about the danger that their political opponents will "capture" the Court, a strategy which is less likely to inspire voter enthusiasm than is a clarion call to reverse the Court's direction. <br /><br />	Judicial issues also tend to have a low profile in presidential campaigns to the extent that they are redundant insofar
as voters' attitudes toward judicial appointments merely reflect how they already feel about a presidential candidate. For example, a voter whose support for Kerry is based significantly on his or her perception that Kerry is more pro-choice than Bush is not apt to have his or her support for Kerry enhanced by the perception that Kerry is more likely to appoint pro-choice judges to the federal bench.<br /><br />	Moreover, voters may ignore judicial issues to the extent that they are sophisticated enough to know that many Supreme Court justices have frustrated the expectations of the presidents by whom they have been appointed. Informed voters should understand, however, that the ideologies of Justices generally satisfy the appointing presidents and that there is a rough correlation between the outcome of presidential elections and the Court's decisions. Moreover, the increased scrutiny of candidates for all levels of federal judgeships by the President, the Senate, the news media, and public interest groups may have reduced the risk that Justices will not conform to presidential expectations.<br /><br />	The Court likewise is difficult to bring into focus as an election issue since it is unclear which Justices will leave the Court at what time. The Court would likely remain much the same, for example, if only "liberal" Justices left the bench during a Kerry presidency or if only "conservative" Justices departed during Bush's second term. Similarly, the Court may seem like an abstract election issue because it is impossible to predict what types of cases the Court will agree to hear. Moreover, the Court's work also may lack immediacy and relevance to many voters because cases take so long to reach the Court and often result in ambiguous decisions<br /><br />	Candidates also often have ignored judicial issues for fear of alienating voters. In the present campaign, some commentators believe that Bush fears that he would drive away moderate voters if he pledged to appoint raw-meat conservatives to the Court. Even though Bush  during the second debate denounced "activist judges" and his garbled reference to the Dred Scott decision  has been interpreted as an effort to re-assure pro-life voters that he would not appoint pro-choice judges, his rejection of a litmus test for judicial appointments during the third debate may have been intended to reassure moderates that he did not intend to appoint judges who would roll back civil liberties, including abortion. Since polls show that most Republican voters favor legalized abortion but that many pro-life G.O.P. voters regard abortion as the paramount political issue, Bush is prudent to remain relatively reticent about Supreme Court appointments. Kerry's announcement during the second debate that he would not appoint a Justice who opposed legalized abortion was a surprising departure from the general tendency of presidential candidates to refrain from making specific commitments with regard to judicial nominations. It may have reflected both his perceived need to re-assure his pro-choice base and his belief that he already had little hope of winning support from strongly pro-life voters.<br /><br />	Similarly, candidates also may avoid attacks on the courts and judicial decisions, or refrain from making promises about the kind of judges they would appoint, for fear of running afoul of the widespread public respect for the judiciary and the perception that the judiciary is generally above politics. In contrast to the critics of the courts during the nineteenth and early twentieth century, who frequently called for curtailment of judicial review, no major political candidate or  movement today questions the validity of judicial review or attacks the Court as an institution. Not since 1924, when LaFollette may have lost votes by advocating legislation to allow Congress to overturn Supreme Court decisions, has any major presidential candidate frontally attacked judicial review. Goldwater's 1964 support for a constitutional amendment to relieve one house of state legislatures from the "one person, one vote" rule  and Bush's support for a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage would affect judicial review only over discrete subjects, leaving the basic power in tact. <br /><br />	Notwithstanding the same-sex marriage amendment proposal and the movement to strip federal courts of jurisdiction over Pledge of Allegiance cases, the present focus of Court critics of all political stripes is to influence the selection of those who will exercise judicial power rather than to curtail judicial power itself. The growing contentiousness of lower federal judicial nominations, together with the immense public attention that the most recent Supreme Court appointments have attracted, indicates that voters are increasingly aware of the profound influence of the federal judiciary over a wide array of public issues. Voters therefore should take judicial appointments into account in deciding how to vote in the upcoming presidential election &#8212; and in Senate elections, too. Public concern should be especially intense because of the likelihood of Supreme Court appointments during the next presidential term. At least one vacancy is likely because the average age of the Justices is nearly 78, and only Justice Thomas is younger than sixty-five. Several Justices have suffered at times from severe ill health, and there has been no vacancy for eleven years &#8212; the longest stretch of stable membership since the period from 1812 to 1823. And, of course, the president is certain to make a substantial number of lower federal court appointments during the next term. Bush already has appointed more than two hundred lower federal judges.<br /><br />	Some scholars and commentators have questioned whether the election is likely to have much impact upon the Court. They argue that since the Senate is likely to remain closely divided between Republicans and Democrats, either Bush or Kerry might need to appoint judicial moderates in order to avoid a bitter confirmation fight that could result in an embarrassing rejection of a nominee.  The close partisan division in the Senate, however, actually might encourage the next president to make judicial nominations that represent the viewpoints of the less moderate elements of his party.  Since the alignment of the Senate and House might prevent either Bush or Kerry from obtaining legislation that appeals to Republican conservative activists or Democratic liberal activists, the victor in the election might try to use Supreme Court appointments as a means of rewarding and satisfying these elements. While the prospect of Senate opposition might indeed daunt either man from nominating persons of extreme views, powerful interest groups in both parties are likely to lobby for nominees whose ideologies may veer beyond commonly accepted definitions of moderation. Since Bush certainly has not shrunk from controversy and confrontation in both foreign and domestic affairs during his first term, he might be similarly bold in making Supreme Court nominations. <br /><br />	Despite the impossibility of predicting which, if any, Justices will leave the Court during the next four years and which types of cases the Court will agree to hear, the election could affect  a wide range of issues. The exact effects, of course, are beyond prediction. Since Justices tend to abide by precedent and prefer to avoid unnecessary controversy, it is far from clear that even the appointment of several new "conservative" Justices would result in the rejection of such landmark decisions as Roe v. Wade (1973) (which appears to have the support of six of the present Justices); Grutter v. Bollinger (2003), in which the Court by a five-to-four vote upheld affirmative action in university admissions; or Lawrence v. Texas (2003), in which the Court by a six to three vote held that state sodomy laws are unconstitutional. Similarly, it is hardly certain that even new "liberal" Justices would reverse the Court's decision in Zelman v. Simmons-Harris (2002), which upheld the constitutionality of a school voucher program, or reject the the
ories of federalism which led the Court during recent years to strike down the federal domestic violence statute and gun regulation laws by five to four votes. <br /><br />	It is almost impossible to deny, however, that there is a high likelihood that Justices appointed by Bush appointees would differ significantly from Kerry appointees in their views on a wide range of issues, including federalism; abortion; separation of church and state; school vouchers; gay rights; affirmative action; the rights of criminal defendants; and regulatory takings that affect environmental law. Even if the Court continues to adhere to Roe v. Wade, for example, Bush appointees would seem more likely than Kerry appointees to narrowly interpret Roe in the many unresolved issues involving abortion, including the constitutionality of the Partial Birth Abortion Act. Moreover, it is possible that the Justices appointed during the next four years will consider issues which are not yet foreseen, but upon which the Court's decisions will divide along lines that reflect the ideological differences between Bush and Kerry. Indeed, voters who have strong views about individual issues may find judicial appointments a more reliable compass for selecting a president than the often deliberately ambiguous pronouncements of presidential candidates and party platforms since voters can more easily predict what a president's judicial nominees would do on the Court than what the president would do in the Oval Office, particularly if the president faces a hostile Congress. <br /><br />	Since the decisions of the Supreme Court and other federal courts have such a profound impact upon American life, voters should consider how the election will affect judicial decisions. Even though such decisions are often abstract, complex, and unpredictable, voters can rationally make general assumptions about how Bush or Kerry nominees would rule on a wide range of critical issues.<br /><br /><em>William G.

		<title>Reaping the Whirlwind: Departures from International Law Helped Create Climate for Iraq Prison Abuses</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://culaw2.creighton.edu/index.aspx?p=38&amp;e=26">Michael Kelly</a> of Creighton University School of Law says the Bush Administration's general disregard for international treaties and standards facilitated an atmosphere in which US personnel could flout the Geneva Conventions and abuse Iraqi prisoners...

<hr size="1" />

<span style="font-size: medium;"><b>T</b></span>he Bush Administration has consistently signaled for three and a half years that international law does not matter. The American military and civilian personnel at Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad apparently received that signal loud and clear. Not only did they fail to follow the requirements of the Geneva Convention on Treatment of POW's, according to the Red Cross, no copies of the treaty were to be found on-site.

The list of high-profile treaties broken or withdrawn by this government is a long one that includes denunciation of the Rome Statute creating the International Criminal Court, pulling out of the Kyoto Protocol to diminish ozone-depleting gases, and unilateral withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty over initial Russian objections. An overwhelming majority of nations condemned each of these moves as irresponsible and self-serving, but Washington paid little heed — steadfastly pursuing short-term political gains instead of America's long-term global interests. International law was undermined and flouted.

When the invasion of Iraq became a front-burner issue, the world implored the Bush Administration not to do it, threatening everything from vetoes in the UN to political recrimination. America again disregarded the objections and went forward. The Security Council was subverted in the process and a creaky pre-World War II theory of justified pre-emptive strikes was resurrected. Again international law was cast aside.

When questions arose as to whether Geneva Convention protections would be extended to those captured in Afghanistan, President Bush dismissed the landmark 55-year-old treaty regime as a series of "legalisms" he would consider in making his decision.

This unapologetic pattern of discounting the importance of international law helped create an environment where it could easily by disregarded by those who were supposed to follow it. That subtle message was especially potent when coupled with the specific message to extract all information possible out of detainees to help further the war on terrorism.

How can the privates and sergeants on the ground at Abu Ghraib be faulted for following the lead of their commander-in-chief? They can be faulted because they should be regarded as rational, thinking human beings — the same as those they tortured. The fact that international law was simply disregarded made the process easier, but no more excusable.

America has begun to reap the whirlwind of its policy-line ignoring international law. It is held in the lowest regard foreign nations have had for it in decades, and it suffers from diminished standing worldwide. The abuses at Abu Ghraib are a particularly ugly gust of that whirlwind that has blown back in Washington's face. Re-embracing international law and the United Nations (and the unique legitimacy each can bestow) could help us weather and avoid the fury of such storms.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist and international law scholar Jordan Paust of the University of Houston Law Center says that recently-divulged White House and DOJ memos provide evidence of an illegal, unconstitutional and downright inept US plan to violate the Geneva Conventions on the protection of prisoners...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/images/paust.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>f one focuses on the January 25, 2002 Memorandum for the President by White House Counsel Alberto R. Gonzales (available <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4999148/site/newsweek">here</a>) and President George Bush's subsequent decisions and authorizations, there is evidence of the initiation of a Common Plan to violate the 1949 Geneva Conventions.  <br /><br />Behind the Plan was a memorandum addressing possible war crime responsibility and designs for attempted avoidance of international criminal responsibility that was written by then DOJ OLC attorneys John Yoo and Robert Delahunty entitled "Application of Treaties and Laws to Al Qaeda and Taliban Detainees" written on January 9, 2002 (available in part <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5025040/site/newsweek">here</a>) and "endorsed by top lawyers in the White House, the Pentagon and the vice president's office," according to the <em>New York Times</em> (Neil A. Lewis, "Justice Memos Explained How to Skip Prisoner Rights," NYT, May 21, 2004, at A10).<br />  <br />According to the Gonzales memo, the Common Plan involved at least those responsible for "the Department of Justice...formal legal opinion concluding... [with respect to] the Geneva Convention III on the Treatment of Prisoners of War (GPW)...that there are reasonable grounds for you to conclude that GPW does not apply with respect to the conflict with the Taliban.  I understand that you decided that GPW does not apply...," adding: "OLC has further opined that you have the authority to determine that GPW does not apply to the Taliban....OLC's interpretation of this legal issue is definitive."  According to the Yoo - Delahunty memo, when asked by General Counsel William Haynes about "the effect of international treaties...on the treatment of individuals detained by the U.S. Armed Forces during the conflict in Afghanistan... [and, i]n particular, ...whether the laws of armed conflict apply to the conditions of detention and the procedures for trial... [, w]e conclude that these treaties do not protect members of the al Qaeda organization... [and] do not apply to the Taliban...."<br /><br />The Plan among White House Counsel Gonzales and President Bush (and evidently others in DOJ and DOD at the time) that is evidenced in the Gonzales memo was legally inept.  The Plan openly admits the unavoidable fact that "the customary laws of war would still be available.... Moreover, even if GPW is not applicable, we can still bring war crimes charges...." with respect to violations of the laws of war during the war in Afghanistan.  Thus, the Plan recognizes that the customary laws of war apply to the war in Afghanistan but involves a design and decision to refuse to apply the 1949 Geneva Conventions despite the unavoidable facts: (1) that they apply to the war in Afghanistan, and (2) that they are treaty law that is also widely recognized as part of the customary laws of war that apply to the war in Afghanistan.  As Secretary Colin Powell warned in his memo of January 26, 2002, "The United States has never determined that the GPW did not apply to an armed conflict in which its forces have been engaged.... the GPW was intended to cover all types of armed conflict and did not by its terms limit its application" (available at <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4999363/site/newsweek">here</a> ).  It was reported in early February 2002 that the White House changed its prior plan to not apply the Geneva Conventions to the war in Afghanistan that the US internationalized on October 7, 2001.  The newer Plan attempted to erroneously deny any protections to members of al Qaeda captured in that war, but admit that the Geneva Conventions applied during the war.  See Paust, "Antiterrorism Military Commissions: Courting Illegality," 23 <em>Mich. J. Int'l L.</em> 1, 7 n.15 (2001) [hereinafter "Antiterrorism"].  Later events demonstrate that the newer Plan was to deny Geneva protections for the Taliban as well, claiming that they were all unlawful combatants and, as such, had no rights under the Geneva law &#8212; which is also in error and in violation of the Conventions.  See, e.g., Paust, "Judicial Power To Determine the Status and Rights of Persons Detained Without Trial," 44 <em>Harv. Int'l L.J.</em> 503, 504 n.3 (2003) [hereinafter "Judicial Power"]; "Antiterrorism," supra at 5-8 n.15.<br /><br />The Plan attempted to rest on a supposed "high premium on other factors, such as the ability to quickly obtain information," supposed "military necessity," and a claim that a "new paradigm renders obsolete Geneva's strict limitations on questioning."  However, none of these claims justify a Plan to violate the Geneva law.  Common Article 1 of the Geneva Conventions requires the United States "to respect and to ensure respect for the" Conventions "in all circumstances."  The Plan was to violate this duty.  Common Article 3 requires that, "as a minimum," all persons taking no active part in the hostilities, regardless of their status, "shall in all circumstances be treated humanely" and shall enjoy listed minimum guarantees.  The Plan was to violate these rights and duties.  No exceptions exist to the rights and prohibitions also contained, for example, in GPW Articles 13, 14, 16, 17, 130.  No exceptions exist to the rights and prohibitions also contained, for example, in the Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (GC) Articles 8, 16, 27 (except for necessary measures of control and security as such), 29, 31, 32, 33, 43, 78, 147.  The Plan was to violate these rights and duties.  As the Legal Adviser to the U.S. Department of State has written with respect to "the right to humane treatment &#8212; a right that belongs to all humankind, in war and in peace," "[i]t is a general principle...that inhumane treatment is cruel and unacceptable under any circumstance.... More broadly, this customary law...found more expansive expression in Article 75 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions.  While the United States has major objections to parts of Additional Protocol I, it does regard the provisions of Article 75 as an articulation of safeguards to which all persons in the hands of an enemy are entitled."  William H. Taft, IV, "The Law of Armed Conflict After 9/11: Some Salient Features," 28 <em>Yale J. Int'l L.</em> 319, 321-22 (2003); see also Paust, "War and Enemy Status After 9/11: Attacks on the Laws of War, in id. at 325-35; "Judicial Power," supra at  504-14; Paust, <a href="/forum/paust1.php">Abuse of Iraqi Detainees at Abu Ghraib: Will Prosecution and Cashiering of a Few Soldiers Comply With International Law?</a>   Any person who is not a prisoner of war and who is detained, regardless of status, is protected under common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions as well as other relevant international laws.  Most are also entitled to protections under the Geneva Civilian Convention.  See, e.g., materials cited previously and U.S. Dep't of Army Field Manual 27-10, <em>The Law of Land Warfare</em> 31, para. 73 (1956).  Thus, basic Geneva rights and duties concerning humane treatment apply whether or not a person detained is a prisoner of war, unprivileged belligerent, terrorist, or ordinary civilian.<br /><br />Under the United States Constitution, the President (and members of the Executive branch) is bound to faithfully execute the law, which includes treaty law and customary international law.  See, e.g., U.S. Const., art. II, Sec. 3; Paust, <em>International Law
as Law of the United States</em> 169-73 (2ed. 2003), and cases and materials cited.  Thus, the Plan to violate the Geneva Conventions is not only illegal but is also unconstitutional.<br /><br />This inquiry focuses on the Plan evidenced in the Gonzales 2002 memo and reports concerning the Yoo - Delahunty memo.  It does not begin to address the criminal authorizations, orders, and other actions effectuating the Plan or other plans that involve patent violations of the laws of war, such as plans (1) to remove persons who are not pws from occupied territory in Afghanistan or Iraq in violation of GC Articles 49 and 147 (war crimes and "grave breaches"), (2) to engage in forced disappearance of persons by refusing to disclose names and/or whereabouts of those detained without trial, (3) to offer rewards "dead or alive" (a war crime), (4) to deny persons who might face trials in military commissions at Guantanamo the minimum due process rights that are required under human rights law and the Geneva Conventions, and (5) to adopt "20&quot; or other secret interrogation techniques which apparently include some that are patent per se violations of the laws of war and human rights and some that are highly problematic and can constitute violations in particular circumstances.  <br /><br />With respect to planned denials of Geneva protections for those being interrogated, it has also been reported that there is evidence of an effectuation of the Common Plan at Guantanamo through April 2003 when Secretary of State Donald Rumsfeld ended the use of certain illegal tactics but approved other secret harsh methods, claiming that the Geneva law did not apply to the detainees.  See Robert Burns, "Lawyers Opposed Questioning at Guantanamo," <em>The Tribune</em>, SanLuisObispo.com , May 21, 2004.  See also DOD Background Briefing, May 20, 2004 (Di Rita: "the president had determined that the conflict...with the Taliban, while it was subject to the Geneva Conventions, people picked up as Taliban would be considered" unprotected; and a DOD Working Group created by General Counsel William Haynes in January 2003, with DOJ input, approved secret harsh interrogation techniques, which Secretary Rumsfeld approved in April 2003).  There were also September 2003 and October 12, 2003 memos by Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez concerning approved and need-to-be approved interrogation techniques in Iraq.  We are still learning more about the impermissible interrogation techniques.  Readers will recall that war crimes can range from "all measures of intimidation" through "inhumane treatment" and "cruel" treatment to "torture" and that the United States has several statutory bases for prosecution of both military and civilian persons who are reasonably accused of dereliction of duty, complicity, perpetration of various crimes, and direct involvement in common plans to violate the Geneva Conventions and other international criminal proscriptions.  See, e.g., Paust, <a href="/forum/paust1.php">Abuse of Iraqi Detainees</a>.<br /><br />Clearly, it is important that President Bush carry out his promise to initiate prosecution of all who are reasonably accused of relevant international crimes and end criminal practices such as illegal transfers of detainees, forced disappearance, and illegal forms of interrogation. <br /><br /><br /><em>Jordan J.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist and international law scholar Jordan Paust of the University of Houston Law Center says that legal responsibility for the Abu Ghraib prison abuses extends beyond the few soldiers currently subject to investigation and prosecution...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/images/paust.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>here has been a great deal of attention paid in recent days to the investigation and prosecution of a few military personnel in connection with torture and abuse of Iraqi detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad, but US responsibility under international law demands far more by way of response. First, torture is not the only crime evident in the revelations. Second, the revelations demonstrate that more than a few soldiers were involved. This was not an isolated criminal activity and more than military personnel were party to it. <br /><br />In addition to torture, customary and treaty-based human rights law prohibits "cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment." The law of war also prohibits torture and such other forms of treatment regardless of the status of the person detained. For example, the 1949 Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War includes various individual rights and duties evidenced in the following types of phrases: "Persons taking no active part in hostilities...shall in all circumstances be treated humanely;" "mutilation, cruel treatment and torture" and "outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment" are proscribed (article 3); persons detained without trial have the right to be "treated with humanity" (article 5); with respect to most civilians and others who are longer taking an active part in hostilities, there shall be "respect for their persons, their honor.... They shall at all times be humanely treated, and shall be protected especially against all acts of violence or threats thereof and against insults and public curiosity" (article 27); "No physical or moral coercion shall be exercised against protected persons, in particular to obtain information from them" (article 31); persons in control are "prohibited from taking any measure of such a character as to cause the physical suffering...of protected persons in their hands. This prohibition applies not only to murder, torture, corporal punishment, mutilation..., but also to any other measures of brutality whether applied by civilian or military agents" (article 32); "all measures of intimidation" are outlawed (article 33); "grave breaches," in addition to other war crimes listed, include "torture or inhuman treatment..., wilfully causing great suffering and serious injury to body or health" (article 147). In addition to human rights law and the laws of war, torture is also proscribed under a separate treaty ratified by the United States and implemented by 18 U.S.C. &Acirc;&#167; 2340A. <br /><br />Some forms of abuse can also constitute crimes against humanity under international law if they involved attacks on civilians or persecution on such grounds as race, religion, or nationality. Additionally, the customary international crime of forced disappearance occurs when persons are detained by "agents of the state or by persons or groups of persons acting with the authorization, support, or acquiescence of the state," and there is a refusal to disclose either the names or whereabouts of the detainees. It may be the case that some forms of coercion were even terroristic in purpose (i.e., were designed to produce intense anxiety or fear) and are condemnable as impermissible terrorism. Use of attack dogs to terrorize naked detainees would fit. <br /><br />What is the responsibility of the United States under international law with respect to such alleged crimes? It is a responsibility to initiate prosecution of or to extradite any person, military or civilian, found within its territory or territory under its jurisdiction who is reasonably accused of such a crime or crimes. Does the President of the United States have the duty to faithfully execute that responsibility? Yes, under Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution, the President must faithfully execute the law, which includes treaties of the United States and customary international law that, as the Founders and Framers unanimously agreed, is part of the laws of the United States. The President has promised recently that those responsible will be prosecuted. Can the United States prosecute military personnel and others who have left the service or who were civilians at the time of an alleged crime in the federal district courts? Yes. Torture as such can be prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. &Acirc;&#167; 2340A &#8212; and the statute is extraterritorial, reaching "Whoever outside the United States commits or attempts to commit torture." War crimes, including "grave breaches" of the Geneva Conventions, can be prosecuted either under 10 U.S.C. &Acirc;&#167; 818 (which incorporates the laws of war as offenses against the laws of the United States) coupled with 18 U.S.C. &Acirc;&#167; 3231 (which provides federal district courts with original, and at least concurrent, jurisdiction over any offense against the laws of the United States) or under 18 U.S.C. &Acirc;&#167; 2441 (for "grave breaches" and violations of article 3 of the Geneva Conventions committed by U.S. nationals). Some civilians can also be prosecuted under a new Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act (18 U.S.C. &Acirc;&#167; 3261). There is no federal statute that incorporates crimes against humanity or forced disappearances as such, but Congress, if it is really concerned about what happened at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere and seeks to assure that it won't happen again and that the United States complies with international law, could create new legislation that operates retrospectively to reach what are already crimes under customary international law without violating any ex post facto prohibitions. <br /><br />Moreover, rare press statements and reports from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) reveal that abuse of detainees in Iraq has occurred in several named places (the 2004 published report alone listing more than eleven sites), systematically in order to gain "confessions and extract information" if not elsewise, and throughout the last year &#8212; not just at Abu Ghraib and not merely early this year, which has been the focus of military investigations. ICRC officials and reports also state that they regularly complained and provided details of criminal activity last year and this year to prison authorities in Baghdad, senior officials of the Coalition Provisional Authority headed by Paul Bremer, and senior officials in the Bush Administration, which apparently included senior officials at the Pentagon and State Department. News stories also reveal that Secretary of State Colin Powell raised the issue of ICRC complaints at meetings of cabinet officials, but to no avail. Yet, Secretary Donald Rumsfeld testified that he did not learn of the abuses until mid-January when CENTCOM announced the problem. Various human rights organizations also complained of abuses directly to Paul Bremer and Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser to the President. <br /><br />What is even more disturbing has been the fostering of a culture wherein abuse can thrive by the President, the Secretary of Defense and others who have openly claimed at least since January 2002 that persons detained without trial during the war in Afghanistan and then later in Iraq were not entitled to protections under human rights law or the Geneva Conventions; that non-prisoners of war can be forcibly transferred from occupied territory in blatant violation of article 49 of the Geneva Civilian Convention (a war crime); that the names and whereabouts of numerous detainees will be kept secret in seriou
s violation of various international laws; that intimidation and stress-and-duress techniques of interrogation should be tolerated despite human rights and Geneva law prohibitions; that the President should have an unreviewable and unchecked power to decide who should be detained and interrogated, where, and how; that rewards "dead or alive" could be offered despite the fact that such conduct is a war crime; and that persons who might face prosecution for war crimes (using 10 U.S.C. &Acirc;&#167;&Acirc;&#167; 818, 821) at Guantanamo must not have the minimal due process guarantees that are required by human rights law and the Geneva Conventions. The admitted failure to train soldiers in the laws of war as required by international law did not help. <br /><br />Is the range of leaders responsible for dereliction of duty limited to those with formal command? No, it can include cabinet officials and others with effective authority, military or civilian. Is leader responsibility limited to circumstances where the leader knew of crimes committed by others? No, the general test is: knew or should have known, had an opportunity to act, and took no reasonable corrective action. Want of knowledge because of a failure to request reports or information is not an excuse. After crimes have been committed, inquiries and reports are not enough. Leaders must fulfill the responsibility to initiate prosecution of all of those who are reasonably accused of international crime. Leaders must assure that those who control other human beings have adequate training, at least in the laws of war. Failure to do so can form the basis for a leader's dereliction of duty, a separate crime under the laws of war. <br /><br /><br /><em>Jordan J.

Left on his own, he fumbled badly.&nbsp; Shareholders suffered.<br /><br />There are many interesting aspects of this case, including the limits of judicial supervision under the business judgment rule, as I recently <a href="http://busmovie.typepad.com/ideoblog/2004/11/eisners_testimo.html">wrote</a>, and whether this case signals a new Delaware approach to governance post-Enron.<br /><br />But I wonder whether something more basic is at stake -- the future of the corporate enterprise as we know it.&nbsp; After all that we have seen in the last few years, can we really be optimistic that things are changing?&nbsp; Consider:<br /><br />--Boards will continue to be supine in the face of strong and apparently successful CEO&#39;s, who control the agenda and the information flow.&nbsp;<br /><br />--Judicial supervision is, at best, a blunt instrument.&nbsp; This case is only now being tried, 8 years after Ovitz was fired. <br /><br />--Disgruntled shareholders can sell -- but at a price determined by defective governance.<br /><br />--Takeovers happen -- when all-powerful executives let them.<br /><br />Is there a better way?&nbsp; I&#39;ve argued in <em><a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=451060">Why Corporations? </a></em> for the dismantling of the corporate entity and the greater use of partnership-type forms for publicly held business. This could be spurred by a change in the tax laws that puts more emphasis on distribution rather than retention of earnings.<br /><br />Think about this in the Disney context.&nbsp; Why do we need this Disney behemoth?&nbsp; The brand?&nbsp; Synergy? Michael Powell recently wondered &quot;if Walt Disney would be proud,&quot; speculating on the disastrous cross-promotion of Disney&#39;s <em>Desperate Housewives </em>on Disney&#39;s Monday night football. Does this sort of thing make people want to go into Disney&#39;s family-oriented amusement parks?&nbsp; Even the film business has gotten away from the Disney brand -- Pixar was providing the meat until Eisner chased it away.<br /><br />How about spinning the amusement parks into a real estate limited partnership, divesting the television properties, and focusing on the movie business?&nbsp; Aside from giving Eisner less to play with over his remaining two years, what would be lost? <br /><br />Of course, we need a takeover market to engineer these changes. But possibly over time the market will see the light, particularly <a href="http://busmovie.typepad.com/ideoblog/2004/11/time_for_the_cb.html">if encouraged by the tax code</a>.&quot; [November 23, 2004; <a href="http://busmovie.typepad.com/ideoblog">Ideoblog</a> has the <a href="http://busmovie.typepad.com/ideoblog/2004/11/disney_and_the_.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Tokaji [Ohio State]: Berkeley Report on Electronic Voting in Florida</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/faculty/facultyprofiles/tokaji.html">Dan Tokaji</a>, Moritz College of Law, Ohio State University:<br /><br />&quot;Last week&#39;s conspiracy theory was that the election had been stolen in Florida counties using optical scan voting equipment, a paper-based system that functions like standardized tests. This week&#39;s may turn out to be the precise opposite: that <em>electronic voting</em> caused Bush to receive more votes than he should have.<br /><br />As discussed <a href="http://equalvote.blogspot.com/2004_11_01_equalvote_archive.html#109996076062163291">here</a>, the allegation made by some activists last week was that counties using optical scan equipment showed more votes for Bush than one would expect based on the party affiliation. By contrast, voters using electronic voting (the other type of system in Florida) had about the Kerry/Bush breakdown you&#39;d expect, as shown in <a href="http://www.jefffisherforcongress.com/Campaign2006/SurprisingFloridaPresidentialElectionResults.htm">this chart</a>. The allegation of foul play with optical scans was quickly debunked as noted <a href="http://equalvote.blogspot.com/2004_11_01_equalvote_archive.html#110001509438274689">here</a>, when it was pointed out that the optical scan counties were more likely to have Dixiecrat voters (i.e., registered Democrats who vote Republican) while the electronic voting counties tend to be more urban ones (in which Democrats mostly vote for Democrats).<br /><br />Now, a working paper from researchers at U.C. Berkeley asserts that electronic voting caused an increase in votes for Bush this year. In particular, the paper asserts that electronic voting resulted in 130,733 extra votes for Bush, primarily in three large counties (Miami-Dade, Palm Beach and Broward). The analysis is based on the increase in the number of votes for Bush in 2004, as compared with those he received in 2000 and those that Dole received in 2000. According to the paper, which can be found <a href="http://ucdata.berkeley.edu/">here</a>:<blockquote>Electronic voting raised Bush&#39;s advantage from the tiny edge he held in 2000 to a clearer margin of victory in 2004.... The state-wide impact of these disparities due to electronic voting amounts to 130,000 votes if we assume a &quot;ghost vote&quot; mechanism and twice that -- 260,000 -- if we assume that a vote misattributed to one candidate should have been accounted for the other.</blockquote>To be sure, the working paper doesn&#39;t go so far as to allege any foul play, much less that the election was stolen. Still, it reaches a provocative conclusion, one that electronic voting critics and those who&#39;ve been alleging a conspiracy to steal this election -- and there&#39;s substantial overlap between these two groups -- are sure to seize on.<br /><br />The big question is whether the conclusion the paper makes is supported by the evidence. I&#39;ve previously asserted that we should be skeptical of allegations that the election was stolen with optical scan equipment. In my view, the latest allegations warrant the same skepticism. While this working paper should be examined carefully, it&#39;s not at all clear that the data upon which the paper relies warrants the bold conclusion that electronic voting <em>caused</em> the increased vote for Bush in 2004....&quot; [November 19, 2004: <a href="http://equalvote.blogspot.com">Equal Vote</a> has <a href="http://equalvote.blogspot.com/2004_11_01_equalvote_archive.html#110082792669339796">more</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Balkin [Yale]: Attorney General Denounces Rule of Law As Aid To Terrorism</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/jbalkin/index.htm">Jack Balkin</a>, Yale Law School:<br /><br />&quot;From <a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/nation/ny-usash134040900nov13,0,6513476.story?coll=ny-nationalnews-headlines">Newsday</a>:<br /><blockquote>Departing Attorney General John Ashcroft on Friday lashed out at federal judges who have dealt setbacks to President George W. Bush&#39;s anti-terrorism and wartime policies, accusing them of &quot;invasive oversight and micromanagement.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;The danger I see here is that intrusive judicial oversight and second-guessing of presidential determinations in these critical areas can put at risk the very security of our nation in a time of war,&quot; Ashcroft said in his first speech since his resignation became public Tuesday.<br /><br />&quot;These encroachments include some of the most fundamental aspects of the president&#39;s conduct of the war on terrorism,&quot; he told the Federalist Society, a conservative lawyers group with close ties to the Bush administration.</blockquote>One would have more sympathy for what Ashcroft is saying if it hadn&#39;t turned out that his repeated violations of civil rights had done almost nothing to make the United States safer.  A <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/special/0306/">report</a> by his own Justice Department&#39;s Inspector General&#39;s Office found that under Ashcroft federal officials repeatedly violated the rights of aliens held in the United States, and that these violations had no discernible benefits for national security.  Under Ashcroft the Justice Department has repeatedly trumpeted the arrest of important terrorist groups only later to have to confess that the charges were unfounded or that the evidence was too weak to proceed with a prosecution.  And the Administration&#39;s A-1 example of a danger to the nation was Yasser Hamdi, whom it insisted had to be kept in a military prison indefinitely without any rights whatsoever. Once the Administration was required by courts to actually offer some proof for its charges, we suddenly discovered that Hamdi was relatively harmless, so harmless, in fact, that the government allowed him to return to his native Saudi Arabia. <br /><br />Over and over again John Ashcroft has asserted that he needs virtually absolute, unreviewable powers to make this nation safe.  And each time he has exercised these powers, he has abused them.  In the past four years he has proven himself repeatedly to be little more than a shameless, incompetent demagogue.<br /><br />The rule of law exists for a reason.  It exists to protect us from people like John Ashcroft, the nation&#39;s chief law enforcement officer.&quot; [November 13, 2004; <a href="http://balkin.blogspot.com">Balkinization</a> has the original <a href="http://balkin.blogspot.com/2004/11/attorney-general-denounces-rule-of-law.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Ribstein [Illinois]: Eisner&#039;s Testimony</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ribstein.org/">Larry Ribstein</a>, University of Illinois College of Law:<br /><br />&quot;The Disney trial on the hiring and firing of Ovitz continued yesterday with Eisner&#39;s direct testimony. As previewed here, Eisner will have to draw a fine line between justifying hiring Ovitz, and justifying firing him so soon after, without cause.  Eisner&#39;s direct testimony draws a complex picture of a man (Ovitz) who was trying hard but just didn&#39;t fit.  <br /><br />All of this not only bears on the negligence of the board in going along with Eisner&#39;s decisions, but provides insight into what a trial would have been like on a for-cause termination, if Eisner and the board had gone that route.  In other words, maybe it wasn&#39;t so dumb to avoid the trial and embarrassment and choose the no-cause firing. <br /><br />And even if the hiring and firing were dumb, there&#39;s no board liability unless the conduct can be crammed into the intentional misconduct or other exception to the exculpatory clause under Section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware corporation law that Disney had in its charter. <br /><br />Maybe it wouldn&#39;t have been so bad to avoid this messy trial of the Disney board, which has surely consumed vast sums in lawyer&#39;s fees, diversion of officer time (days on the stand and preparing to testify by the CEO, rather than attending to corporate affairs), besmirching the company&#39;s reputation and brand, etc. By the time the trial and appeals are over, the damages -- probably not more than the 140 million plus interest the corporation paid to fire Ovitz -- may look like chicken feed.  And even then the corporation must hope that it&#39;s all coming from the insurance company and not coming back through the corporation in the form of indemnification. <br /><br />So why, you might ask, did the corporation sue?  Answer -- it wasn&#39;t really the &quot;corporation,&quot; but rather a single shareholder who is suing &quot;derivatively&quot; on behalf of the corporation.  One wonders if the question had been put to the shareholders collectively if they would have gone along.  <br /><br />One might argue that this is not the point.  We must set an example for future executives and boards to jump through the appropriate hoops in their decision-making. So the shareholder plaintiff here is a sort of cop, and the coffers and reputation Disney are being sacrificed to make the whole corporate governance system work. <br /><br />Or a cynic might suggest that the whole system has been set up for the benefit of lawyers.  But you would not get such cynicism from this blog.&quot; [November 17, 2004; <a href="http://busmovie.typepad.com/ideoblog">Ideoblog</a> has the <a href="http://busmovie.typepad.com/ideoblog/2004/11/eisners_testimo.html">post</a>]<br /><br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Berman [Ohio State]: Seeking death for Scott Peterson</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/faculty/facultyprofiles/berman.html">Doug Berman</a>, Moritz College of Law, Ohio State University:<br /><br />&quot;As regular readers know, I typically try to avoid blogging about high-profile criminal law cases (unless and until there is a <em>Blakely</em> issue). But now that the Scott Peterson case is past the guilt stage and moving to sentencing, I guess it is time to jump into this fray.<br /><br /><strong><em>First</em></strong>, let me spotlight the article noted today by CrimProf blog <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/crimprof_blog/2004/11/highprofile_pet.html">here</a> about the enormous costs of the guilt phase of the Peterson trial. Obviously, all these costs are not simply the product of the fact that California is seeking the death penalty against Peterson, but it is certainly reasonable to view that fact as a contributing factor.&nbsp; (For a lot more on the economic costs of the death penalty, the Death Penalty Information Center <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?did=108&scid=7">has the data here</a>.)<br /><br /><strong><em>Second</em></strong>, as well covered in articles like <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/11/18/BAGA89TD6M1.DTL">this one</a>, Peterson&#39;s defense team has moved for a new jury for the penalty phase of his trial.&nbsp; I do not think a copy of the motion is publicly available, but I bet it is an interesting read.&nbsp; I wonder if Peterson&#39;s high-profile attorneys thought to cite <a href="http://www.mass.gov/Agov2/docs/5-3-04%20MassDPReportFinal.pdf">this report</a> from the Massachusetts&#39; Governor&#39;s Council on Capital Punishment which contends that a fair death penalty system should grant capital defendants the right &quot;to have a new jury selected for the sentencing stage.&quot;<br /><br /><strong><em>Third</em></strong>, as is very well documented by the <a href="http://www.fdap.org/blakely5.html">FDAP <em>Blakely</em> Page</a> and the <a href="http://www.adi-sandiego.com/Resources/Blakely%20Resources/Blakely.htm#Blakely%20Web%20Pages">ADI <em>Blakely</em> Page</a>, <em>Blakely</em> has made a stunning mess of sentencing in California.&nbsp; Ergo, if Scott Peterson avoids a death sentence, it it possible that <em>Blakely</em> issues could arise at his sentencing (though perhaps some California lawyers can clarify this issue).<br /><br /><strong><em>Fourth</em></strong>, as detailed in <a href="http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy/2004/11/death_is_not_so.html">this prior post</a>, even if Scott Peterson is sentenced to death, there is a reasonable basis for predicting he will die a natural death on death row before the state of California will be able to actually get Peterson to the execution chamber.&nbsp; At the very least, we can be certain that Peterson will get to see (dozens of) TV movies about his case before his day with the death chambers ever arrives.&quot; [November 19, 2004; <a href="http://sentencing.typepad.com/">Sentencing Law and Policy</a> has the <a href="http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy/2004/11/the_costs_and_p.html">post</a>] <br /><br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.uc.edu/faculty/godsey.html">Mark Godsey</a>, University of Cincinnati College of Law:<br /><br />&quot;An article that appeared last year in the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> about clemency memos written by Alberto R. Gonzales to George Bush while he was Governor of Texas is of renewed importance after Bush last week nominated Gonzales to take Ashcroft&#39;s post as AG.<br /><br />The article deals with the 57 clemency memos that Gonzales wrote to Bush while Gonzales served as Bush&#39; legal counsel in Texas.&nbsp; The author, Alan Berlow, obtained the confidential memos through Texas&#39; public information laws, and found that they &#39;&#39;repeatedly failed to apprise the governor of crucial issues in the cases at hand: ineffective counsel, conflict of interest, mitigating evidence, even actual evidence of innocence.&#39;&#39;<br /><br />For example, Berlow cited the case of Terry Washington, a mentally retarded man who was executed for the murder of a restaurant employee. Washington&#39;s jury was not informed of the degree of his retardation or of the severe abuse he received growing up. Washington&#39;s lawyers did not retain mental health experts for Washington&#39;s defense. <br /><br />While Washington&#39;s 30-page clemency petition focused on his retardation and his ineffective counsel, Gonzales presented Bush instead with a three-page document that mentioned Washington&#39;s petition only to state that it had been denied by the state Board of Pardons and Paroles.<br /><br />In another case, Gonzales failed to apprise Bush that the State&#39;s key witness had recanted, and also failed to mention that law enforcement officials had lied at trial about the favorable deal they had given another witness in exchange for him implicating the defendant.<br /><br />For more, click <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/prem/200307/berlow">here</a>.&quot; [November 15, 2004; <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/crimprof_blog">CrimProf Blog</a> has the <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/crimprof_blog/2004/11/gonzalez_texas_.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://vls.law.villanova.edu/prof/maule">Jim Maule</a>, Villanova University School of Law:<br /><br />&quot;Well, the Congress has itself in a fine mess of hot water this time around. Readers of this blog know that I&#39;m no fan of how Congress does business nor of most of what it generates.<br /><br />According to reports proliferating throughout web and print press (<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/11/20/tax.returns.ap/">CNN</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/22/politics/22explain.html?oref=login&oref=login">New York Times</a>, <a href="http://www.taxanalysts.com/www/taxwirewww.nsf/DocNoLookup/2740F1F84D6F353785256F53007B3E95?OpenDocument">Tax Analysts</a>, and <a href="http://www.taxguru.net/2004/11/be-happy-put-retirement-fears-to-rest.html">Tax Guru</a>, to name a few), the spending legislation that Congress passed on Saturday contains a provision that permits the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the chair of the House Appropriations Committee and their assistants access to income tax returns unrestricted by privacy protection. Members of the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committees, which have primary responsibility for drafting tax legislation, have limited access to tax returns, so that they can evaluate IRS and other assertions that existing law is being abused or fails to accomplish legislative intent, but their access is subject to serious civil and criminal penalties if they disclose or misuse the information. The provision slipped into the spending bill lacks those restraints.<br /><br />After people reading the text of the spending bill raised questions about the provision, spokespersons for House and Senate leaders said that the provision was a &quot;mistake&quot; and an &quot;error.&quot; They promised to remove it, and the Senate quickly passed a resolution stating that the provision &quot;shall have no effect.&quot; The House is scheduled to take up the resolution on Wednesday, and House leaders promise it will pass. Until it does, the spending bill will not be sent to the White House for the President&#39;s signature.<br /><br />Congressional aides claim that the provision was inserted at the request of Representative Ernest Istook, Jr., who chairs the transportation subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee. Istook is no stranger to controversy, as this <a href = "http://www.ombwatch.org/article/articleview/463/1/51?TopicID=1">1995 chronology of the &quot;Istook Amendment&quot;</a> demonstrates. The bit about subcommittee staff admitted to the falsification of documents surely hasn&#39;t inspired me to rethink my disdain for how Congress operates.<br /><br />The two chairs of the Appropriations Committees claim that they were unaware that the provision had been inserted into the legislation. Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota fumed that the incident reflected a bigger problem, that is, the pattern of Congress having mere hours to review legislation that runs on for hundreds (or in this case, 3300) pages. (And people think <em>I</em> am wordy, ha ha). Yet Senator Stevens reacted negatively to Conrad&#39;s complaint, claiming that the incident was a unique event in his &quot;more than 30 years&quot; on the committee.<br /><br />What&#39;s going on here? Is it just a matter of the typical chaos and confusion? I&#39;ve been on the Hill while legislation was being drafted. It&#39;s only a tad less frenetic than the pit at a commodities exchange. It is easy to see how mistakes can be made. But even if this incident is simply a consequence of how Congress does business, it is a sharp reminder that, as Senator Conrad reminds us, Congress doesn&#39;t do a good job handing the way it does business. If a business did business the way Congress does business, the business would soon be out of business.... &quot; [November 22, 2004; <a href="http://mauledagain.blogspot.com">Mauled Again</a> has <a href="http://mauledagain.blogspot.com/2004_11_01_mauledagain_archive.html#110114941758238396">more</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/faculty/facultyprofiles/berman.html">Doug Berman</a>, Moritz College of Law, Ohio State University:<br /><br />&quot;It&#39;s perhaps a sober reminder of the realities of criminal justice that President Bush&#39;s ceremonial pardoning of turkeys received a lot more press than his actual pardoning of people.&nbsp; (As an aside, I cannot help but wonder if Alberto Gonzales wrote <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/prem/200307/berlow">clemency memos</a> for Biscuits and Gravy, the pardoned turkeys (background <a href="http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy/2004/11/ag_nominee_gonz.html">here</a>).)<br /><br />In any event, as <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/11/18/presidential.pardons.ap/">this CNN story</a> details, the President did issue six human pardons this week, all to persons who committed minor frauds long ago.&nbsp; A few more details on some of the persons pardoned can be found <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/news/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/news/110077393187261.xml">here</a> and <a href="http://www.journalstar.com/articles/2004/11/19/local/doc419d80a75cef6483878466.txt">here</a>.<br /><br />In response to an e-mail inquiring about these pardons, Margaret Colgate Love who served for twenty years in the US Department of Justice, including seven as US Pardon Attorney under the first President Bush and President Clinton, wrote a brief note detailing President Bush&#39;s approach to pardons and commutations during his first term.&nbsp; You can download the full text of Margy Love&#39;s note below, and here are some highlights:&gt;<blockquote>Case statistics released last month by the Office of the Pardon Attorney in the Justice Department show that, since assuming office, Bush has granted a total of 25 pardons while he has denied 839 applications. His pardon grant rate is thus about 3% of all requests acted upon. (He has also denied 3,446 commutation requests, and that grant rate has too many zeroes to be meaningful.)&nbsp; By contrast, most Presidents in the past 100 years have granted between 20% and 30% of the pardon applications they considered. (The exception is the first President Bush, whose 76 pardons represented only 11% of the requests he considered, but his low grant rate is because DOJ sent him almost nothing but denial recommendations &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; I know, I did it!&nbsp; His son doesn&#39;t have the same excuse.) The OPA statistics indicate that there are 744 pending applications for pardon still awaiting action (plus 1729 requests for commutation). <br /><br />All but one of Bush&#39;s 25 pardons have been utterly unremarkable, the exception being the deathbed pardon of David McCall, the former mayor of Plano, Texas, who applied on a Wednesday and received his grant on Friday. This is a guy who has definitely decided to play it safe in the compassion department!</blockquote><a href="http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy/files/margy_love_pardon_explanation.doc">Download margy_love_pardon_explanation.doc</a> [November 19, 2004; <a href="http://sentencing.typepad.com">Sentencing Law and Policy</a> has the <a href="http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy/2004/11/pardon_me.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.ucla.edu/faculty/bios/bainbridge">Stephen Bainbridge</a>: UCLA Law School:<br /><br />&quot;&#39;House Republicans proposed changing their rules last night to allow members indicted by state grand juries to remain in a leadership post, a move that would benefit Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-Tex.) in case he is charged by a Texas grand jury that has indicted three of his political associates, according to GOP leaders.&#39; (Source: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A54572-2004Nov16.html">WaPo</a>)<br /><br />Based on everything I&#39;ve heard about this grand jury investigation, I suspect that it has a partisan motive. The grand jury is being run by an Austin, Texas-based DA who is a Democrat. Texas Democrats are incredibly mad at Delay for his role in the redistricting of the Texas congressional map, which generated 4 new GOP seats. The DA may well be out to give a little payback.<br /><br />Even if that&#39;s what&#39;s going on, however, it doesn&#39;t justify such a blatantly partisan response by the GOP. The rule that would be changed was adopted by the House GOP in response to Democrat Congressman Dan Rostenkowski&#39;s refusal to step down from his leadership post after he was indicted. It was supposed to be a blow against the old Congressional power structure and a blow for better ethics in government. To undo the rule now to benefit Delay is unseemly - indeed, hypocritical. The House GOP caucus should require Delay to step down if he is indicted and let the judicial process vindicate Delay (assuming this really is just a partisan witch hunt).&quot; [November 17, 2004; <a href="http://www.professorbainbridge.com">ProfessorBainbridge.com</a> has the <a href="http://www.professorbainbridge.com/2004/11/unseemly_haste_.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Tokaji [Ohio State]: Provisional Voting Problems</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/faculty/facultyprofiles/tokaji.html">Dan Tokaji</a>, Moritz College of Law, Ohio State University:<br /><br />&quot;The A.P. has <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/politics/president/articles/2004/11/16/analysts_cite_provisional_voting_flaws/">this story</a> summarizing the problems that the states had in implementing provisional voting.  It quotes my colleague Ned Foley as suggesting that Congress consider repealing HAVA&#39;s provisional voting requirement.<br /><br /><strong>My take:</strong>  I agree that there were serious problems in the way the provisional voting was implemented, particularly the lack of standards for determining which provisional votes should count.  But I don&#39;t agree with my colleague Prof. Foley&#39;s view that Congress should consider getting rid of HAVA&#39;s provisional voting requirement, and certainly not at this early stage in the implementation of HAVA.  The idea behind provisional voting is to provide a mechanism for votes to be counted when voter&#39;s names don&#39;t appear on registration rolls.  It&#39;s a mechanism that has worked well for years in some states, including California. <br /><br />In a world with perfectly accurate registration lists, we wouldn&#39;t need provisional voting.  But we don&#39;t live in that world, and won&#39;t in the foreseeable future.  The mandatory statewide registration databases, which will have to be implemented by 2006, may make things better in the long run.  But in the short run, it&#39;s likely that it will aggravate the problems with registration lists.  That makes provisional voting even more important.  <br /><br />What is important is that states enact clear rules, preferably through legislation, on how the provisional voting process -- especially counting -- should work.  Also, as state and county election officials gain greater familiarity with how provisional voting is supposed to work, we can expect the process to improve.&quot; [November 16, 2004; <a href="http://equalvote.blogspot.com/">Equal Vote</a> has the original <a href="http://equalvote.blogspot.com/2004_11_01_equalvote_archive.html#110062679845208851">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.wayne.edu/faculty/profiles/henning_peter.html">Peter Henning</a>, Wayne State University Law School:<br /><br />&quot;New York Attorney General Elliot Spitzer dropped another shoe from his closet on an insurance company, although it was not Aon Corp., about which there was some speculation when Spitzer announced that another suit was coming on Friday morning (Nov. 12).&nbsp; This time, the target is <a href="http://www.ulr-ins.com/about.aspx">Universal Life Resources</a> (ULR), which is a San Diego-based insurance broker, and the <a href="http://www.oag.state.ny.us/press/2004/nov/nov12a_04_attach1.pdf">complaint</a> alleges bid-rigging in violation of New York&#39;s Donnelly Act similar to that charged against Marsh &amp; McLennan. <br /><br />Unlike Marsh Mac, which is a multi-billion dollar company with thousands of employees spread across different divisions, ULR is a closely-held company, organized as a limited partnership with only one owner, Douglas P. Cox, and 80 employees.The complaint alleges that &quot;Cox completely controls ULR,&quot; other companies doing business with it viewed Cox and the organization as interchangeable, and engaged in &quot;self-dealing transactions&quot; with the company and its subsidiaries.&nbsp; As the sole owner of the company, it is not surprising that Cox completely controls it, indeed that&#39;s the very nature of being the sole owner of a company.&nbsp; Moreover, the fact that other companies that did business with ULR viewed Cox as the embodiment of the company is commonplace, and there is nothing necessarily improper about it.&nbsp; While corporate formalities have to be observed, owners of closely-held businesses are not held to the same standard in dealing with their company as officers and directors of publicly traded corporations.&nbsp; That does not mean Cox can treat the company as a personal piggy-bank, but a closely-held business is often run with less formality because the owner suffers any loss associated with the business directly.<br /><br />Because the lawsuit names both ULR and Cox, there is a greater possibility that Cox (and ULR) will fight Spitzer, rather than immediately seek a settlement.&nbsp; While a public company has a powerful incentive to cooperate with the government, a private company, especially one with a single owner who is also the object of the government enforcement action, does not need to protect the interests of a large group of shareholders.&nbsp; If Cox decides to fight, then ULR will fight, something we have not really seen in any of Spitzer&#39;s earlier cases.&quot; [November 12, 2004; <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/">White Collar Crime Blog</a> has the <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/2004/11/spitzers_next_s.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

Indeed, there is no federal regulation of insurance companies because of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode15/usc_sup_01_15_10_20.html">McCarren-Feguson Act</a>, which reserves to the states the power to regulate insurance.&nbsp; The key provision of the Act is 15 U.S.C. &Acirc;&sect; 1012, which provides:<blockquote><strong>State regulation</strong><br /> <br />The business of insurance, and every person engaged therein, shall be subject to the laws of the several States which relate to the regulation or taxation of such business.<br /><br /><strong>Federal regulation</strong><br /><br />No Act of Congress shall be construed to invalidate, impair, or supersede any law enacted by any State for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance, or which imposes a fee or tax upon such business, unless such Act specifically relates to the business of insurance: Provided, That after June 30, 1948, the Act of July 2, 1890, as amended, known as the Sherman Act, and the Act of October 15, 1914, as amended, known as the Clayton Act, and the Act of September 26, 1914, known as the Federal Trade Commission Act, * * * shall be applicable to the business of insurance to the extent that such business is not regulated by State Law.</blockquote>The Act means that large insurance companies potentially are subject to 51 state regulators (including the District of Columbia), and that kind of fragmentation makes it difficult for coordinated oversight.&nbsp; At the same time, any push for federal regulation will run into issues regarding the budget and federalism, not to mention the usual in-fighting on Capitol Hill regarding which Committee would have oversight responsibility for the overseers.&nbsp; As the investigations of the insurance industry blossom, watch for calls for increased regulation, and notice how the insurance industry divides on the issue.&quot; [November 16, 2004; <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog">White Collar Crime Prof Blog</a> has the original <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/2004/11/senate_hearing_.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://law.gsu.edu/directory/view.php?id=42&version=html">Ellen Podgor</a>, Georgia State University College of Law:<br /><br />&quot;As everyone awaits the post-Blakely decisions of Fanfan and Booker, the DOJ has decided to start its campaign to fight back with legislation, just in case the decision is not to their liking.&nbsp; In today&#39;s Wall Street Journal, in an article titled, &quot;<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB110073906693277488,00.html?mod=politics%5Fprimary%5Fhs">Justice Department Backs Bowman&#39;s Sentencing Reform</a>,&quot; we see reporter Gary Fields reporting that the DOJ&nbsp; supports a plan that &quot;takes the top off the existing guideline ranges, replacing them with the legally prescribed maximum for the crime.&quot;&nbsp; No one else seems to agree with DOJ, and hopefully Congress will also reject such a proposal....<br /><br />What&#39;s wrong with this proposal for white collar cases?<br /><br />1.&nbsp; We will be missing the opportunity to reconsider sentencing with all players at the same table.&nbsp; Lets get the prosecutors, judges, defense attorneys and sentencing experts to study the deficiencies of the present system and come up with something that works. (Check out my co-authored op-ed piece with Barry Scheck in the National Law Journal (7-26-04) titled, <a href="http://www.november.org/Blakely/NLJ7-26-04.html">Proceed With Caution</a>)<br /><br />2. Do we really want draconian sentences for white collar offenders?&nbsp; The prisons are full, costly, and will these sentences really serve as a deterrent of future white collar offenses?<br /><br />3. We would be missing the opportunity of examining in more depth the <a href="http://www.abanet.org/media/jkcrecs.html">Kennedy Commission Report</a> that looks at sentencing alternatives for offenders who likely could benefit from rehabilitation.<br /><br />4.&nbsp; This sure looks like an attempt to circumvent the basic holding in <a href="http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/24june20041200/www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/03pdf/02-1632.pdf">Blakely</a>, a decision authored by Justice Scalia (not exactly the liberal type).<br /><br />5. Gosh, does the DOJ want to risk reversals of trial and appellate decisions when the Court sends the message home yet another time (Apprendi, Blakely, etc.) as to what is required by the Sixth Amendment?<br /><br />Yes, I have an opinion, and could go on....But that is exactly why we should all slow down and carefully study the different proposals.&nbsp; And after all, what&#39;s so bad about having juries decide whether a sentence should be enhanced?&quot; [November 18, 2004; <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog">White Collar Crime Prof Blog</a> has the <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/2004/11/whats_the_lates.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Tokaji [Ohio State]: Ohio - It Ain&#039;t Over &#039;Til It&#039;s Over</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/faculty/facultyprofiles/tokaji.html">Dan Tokaji</a>, Moritz College of Law, Ohio State University:<br /><br />&quot;Taking Yogi Berra&#39;s words to heart, Ohio voting rights advocates have announced their plan to proceed with a contest of the election. This is in addition to the recount planned by the Green and Libertarian candidates, now reportedly to be joined by the Democratic Party as well. And to top things off, a new federal lawsuit was filed today that reportedly seeks to make sure that the recount is completed before the electoral college meets on December 13. Thus, although the result in Ohio is clear (<em>news flash: Bush won</em>), it&#39;s not quite as clear when the election will officially be over. Nor is it entirely clear -- at least to me -- how the process will actually work. But I&#39;ll try to sort out what&#39;s most likely.<br /><br /><strong>The Contest</strong><br /><br />The Ohio News Network has <a href="http://www.onnnews.com/Global/story.asp?S=2592759&nav=LQlCTMEA">this report</a> and the Cleveland Plain-Dealer <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/news/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/news/110094683912880.xml">this one</a> on the plan to file a <em>contest</em> of the election results. Activists reportedly plan to cite exit polls, provisional voting glitches, and &quot;hundreds of voter horror stories&quot; in support of their petition. Under Ohio law, election contests are to be heard by the Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court. Ohio R.C. 3515.08. (See <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/electionlaw/procedures_recount05.html">here</a> for the Election Law @ Moritz description by my colleague Chris Fairman.)<br /><br />A contest requires a petition, signed by at least 25 voters and filed within 15 days of the date the election results are &quot;ascertained and announced by the proper authority&quot; -- or in the event of a recount, within 10 days after the recount results have been ascertained and announced. R.C. 3515.09. A hearing must then be scheduled between 15 and 30 days of the petition.<br /><br />As of last report, the lawyers planning the contest couldn&#39;t say when they&#39;d file their petition.<br /><br /><strong>The Recount</strong><br /><br />But wait ... it gets even more complicated when we get to the <em>recount</em> provisions of Ohio law. As noted <a href="http://equalvote.blogspot.com/2004_11_01_equalvote_archive.html#110066179862316450">here</a>, the Green and Libertarian candidates have announced their intention to seek a recount. Earlier this evening, Keith Olbermann reported <a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/6533008/#041122a">here</a> that the Democrats plan to join the recount, and the A.P. later issued <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/24hour/politics/story/1857197p-9762228c.html">this report</a> confirming it. (Update: K.O. is now reporting <a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/6533008/#041122b">here</a> that the Dems now say they plan to &quot;participate in&quot; the recount, rather than &quot;join&quot; it ... whatever that means.)<br /><br />The recount request must be filed within five days of when the election results are officially declared. Ohio R.C. 3515.02 (&quot;the[recount] application shall be filed within five days after the day upon which the secretary of state declares the results of such election&quot;) . That hasn&#39;t happened yet, and may not for several days, as described below.<br /><br />Apparently concerned that the electoral college would meet before the recount is complete, the Greens and Libertarians (which K.O. glibly labels the &quot;Glibs&quot;) filed a federal lawsuit today in Toledo. That lawsuit reportedly seeks to compel the recount in sufficient time for it to be completed by December 13, the day the electoral college meets in each state&#39;s capital. See <a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/mason/stories/WO0411/S00262.htm">here</a> for a press release announcing the lawsuit....&quot; [November 22, 2004; <a href="http://equalvote.blogspot.com">Equal Vote</a> has <a href="http://equalvote.blogspot.com/2004_11_01_equalvote_archive.html#110116816811760312">more</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Hasen [Loyola Los Angeles]: More on the San Diego Write-In</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.lls.edu/academics/faculty/hasen.html">Rick Hasen</a>, Loyola Law School Los Angeles:<br /><br />&quot;The incumbent mayor, Dick Murphy, will be reelected unless one of the three lawsuits currently pending is successful, or unless there is a recount that will lead to a different result.  News stories on the end of counting showing Murphy in the lead are <a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/politics/20041120-9999-1n20mayor.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-sdmayor20nov20,1,6090325.story?coll=la-headlines-california">here</a>.  <br /><br />I have already <a href="http://electionlawblog.org/archives/002410.html">blogged</a> about two of the lawsuits, which seek a revote on grounds that the San Diego city charter prohibits write-in candidacies.  I think the state court judge was right that this suit should be barred by laches, and the state case is now going up on appeal.  A federal district court judge is hearing a parallel suit in a hearing Nov. 30.<br /><br />The other lawsuit is quite interesting.  According to the press reports, there may be as many as 4,000 or 5,000 votes for Donna Frye, the write-in candidate, where voters wrote in Frye&#39;s name on the ballot but they failed to fill in an oval  bubble next to the write-in space. The League of Women Voters want those votes counted.  Elections officials won&#39;t count them because of California Elections Code <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=elec&group=15001-16000&file=15340-15342">section 15432, subd. (a)</a>, which states:<ul>Any name written upon a ballot for a qualified write-in candidate, including a reasonable facsimile of the spelling of a name, shall be counted for the office, if it is written in the blank space provided and voted as specified below:<br />(a) For voting systems in which write-in spaces appear directly below the list of candidates for that office and provide a voting space, no write-in vote shall be counted unless the voting space next to the write-in space is marked or slotted as directed in the voting instructions.</ul>The rules for casting a vote told voters to &quot;completely darken the oval next to&quot; the written name of the write-in candidate.  <br /><br />The League raises a few arguments, some stronger than others.<br /><br />1. The absentee ballot instructions did not indicate that the oval must be filled in. I had looked at those &quot;1-2-3 instructions&quot; the other day on the San Diego Registrar&#39;s website, but they seem to have been taken down.  According to the League, the instructions did not say anything about darkening in the oval when one wished to vote for a write-in candidate.  So one argument---and this appears to be the strongest one--is that it does not violate the California Elections Code to count the absentee ballots cast for Frye without the oval filled in, because those ballots in fact were cast in accordance with the instructions.  The New Jersey Supreme Court apparently ruled that write-in votes should be counted under similar circumstances. (See <a href="http://majordomo.lls.edu/cgi-bin/lwgate/ELECTION-LAW_GL/archives/election-law_gl.archive.0411/date/article-273.html">here</a>.) If the judge agrees, it may be impossible at this point to know which were the absentee ballots cast in this manner, creating a difficulty in the remedy.  Should all unbubbled write-in votes count?  Only part?  How many?....&quot; [November 21, 2004; <a href="http://electionlawblog.org">Election Law</a> has <a href="http://electionlawblog.org/archives/002480.html">more</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Thousands of the country&#39;s most credentialed lawyers flocked to Florida to guarantee a fair election. Did we inadvertently miss an election debacle even greater than that of 2000 and negligently allow our client to concede?<br /><br />I am a Kerry supporter and a Bush critic. I went to Florida because my mother, a Florida resident, asked me to help protect the right of all citizens to vote and to ensure that all votes counted. I walked the polling lines for early voting in Daytona Beach, distributing sample ballots and helping citizens understand their rights. I tried to ensure that poll workers obeyed the laws about provisional ballots and that ballots were correctly fed through the optical scanner machines. And by my presence, along with other Democratic lawyers, I lent an air of legitimacy to the voting process, which, by and large, seemed fair enough. <br /><br />But one thing really troubled me: Who was checking to make sure the data contained in the digital memory cards actually matched the voters&#39; intentions marked on the paper ballots? Could we take the accurate counting of computer votes for granted, since the CEO of the leading voting machine manufacturer promised to &quot;deliver&quot; Ohio&#39;s electoral votes for Bush?....&quot; [November 15, 2004; Yale Law School @YLS has <a href="http://www.law.yale.edu/outside/html/Public_Affairs/537/yls_article.htm">more</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://lawwww.cwru.edu/faculty/faculty_bio.asp?id=102&adj=0">Peter Friedman</a>, Case Western Reserve Law School:<br /><br />&quot;Alberto Gonzalez, the nominee to be chief law enforcement officer of the land, prepared 57 confidential memos on the merits of granting death-row inmates clemency.  56 of the inmates were executed.  As Philip Carter writes in Slate, the memos &quot;would have barely earned a passing grade in law school, let alone satisfy the requirements of a job in which life and death were at stake. Perhaps more important, these early memos from Texas revealed Gonzales&#39; startling willingness to sacrifice rigorous legal analysis to achieve pre-ordained policy results at the drop of a Stetson.&quot;  As Alan Berlow wrote in the Atlantic Monthly (subscription required) the memos reflect &quot;an extraordinarily narrow notion of clemency.&quot; They appear to have excluded, for instance, factors such as &quot;mental illness or incompetence, childhood physical or sexual abuse, remorse, rehabilitation, racial discrimination in jury selection, the competence of the legal defense, or disparities in sentences between co-defendants or among defendants convicted of similar crimes.&quot;  In reporting on Berlow&#39;s article on Findlaw, John Dean writes: &quot;Take the case of Terry Washington, a thirty-three-year-old mentally retarded man with the communications skills of a seven-year-old executed in 1997. Gonzales&#39;s clemency memo, according to Berlow, did not even mention his mental retardation, or his lawyer&#39;s failure to call, at trial, for the testimony of a mental health expert on this issue. Nor did it mention that the jury never heard about Washington&#39;s history of child abuse; he was one of ten children, all of whom &#39;were regularly beaten with whips, water hoses, extension cords, wire hangers, and fan belts.&#39;&quot;  One of the Gonzalez memos is <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/prem/200307/berlow-documents">here</a>.<br /><br />One thing is certain about Gonzales, who is widely rumored to be in line for appointment by Bush to the Supreme Court: he doesn&#39;t have much of a paper trail.  Thus far, I have only been able to locate 21 opinions he wrote as a justice of the Texas Supreme Court.  Only one of those is politically notable, and not in a way liberals might fear.  In In Re Jane Doe, 19 S.W.3d 346 (Tex. 2000), Gonzalez concurred in a decision holding a minor had the right to seek an abortion without her parents&#39; consent.  None of the other Gonzalez opinions I&#39;ve located betray any particular political bent.  In light of both his failure to take the anti-abortion position in Doe and the absence of a paper trail, it shouldn&#39;t be entirely surprising that, as Jeffrey Toobin wrote in the New Yorker in 2003, &quot;around the Federalist Society . . .  the joke goes that &#39;Alberto Gonzalez is Spanish for David Souter.&#39;&quot; [November 10, 2004: <a href="http://lawwww.cwru.edu/faculty/friedman/raw/">RawData</a> has <a href="http://lawwww.cwru.edu/faculty/friedman/raw/">more</a>].</p>]]></content:encoded>

This dispute illustrates once more how deep WTO commitments penetrate the regulatory powers of its member countries.<br /><br />Under WTO rules, the U.S. agreed not to restrict the importation of certain &#39;recreational services,&#39; which Antigua argued includes the free flow of cross-border &#39;gambling services.&#39; The U.S. maintained that it never intended to bind itself in this sensitive sector, invoking the WTO&#39;s escape clause for trade restrictions necessary to protect &#39;public morals&#39; or &#39;public order&#39; from money laundering, organized crime and unrestricted access for minors to internet gambling.<br /><br />The panel made a statement that, in its view, the issue does not hinge on morality but on protectionism, an interesting outcome just one week after the U.S. presidential election was decided by &#39;moral values&#39; voters.<br /><br />As the WTO panel itself acknowledged, it is most likely that the U.S. simply made a mistake when scheduling its WTO commitments and genuinely did not intend to commit in the area of internet gambling. For such mistakes, the U.S. can always re-negotiate its commitments and withdraw the one on internet gambling, and either offer equivalent compensation to, or suffer reciprocal trade retaliation by, Antigua.&quot; [November 11, 2004; Duke News has <a href="http://www.dukenews.duke.edu/news/tip_wto_1104.html">more</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor Marjorie Cohn of Thomas Jefferson School of Law in San Diego says that the massive US assault on Fallujah is but the latest instance of illegal American aggression in Iraq, undertaken with disregard for international treaties and the principles of international law.<hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/cohncolor.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><strong>U</strong></font>S Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson was chief prosecutor at the Nuremberg Tribunal.  In his report to the State Department, Justice Jackson wrote: &quot;No political or economic situation can justify&quot; the crime of aggression. He also said: &quot;If certain acts in violation of treaties are crimes they are crimes whether the United States does them or whether Germany does them, and we are not prepared to lay down a rule of criminal conduct against others which we would not be willing to have invoked against us."<br /><br />Between 10,000 and 15,000 U.S. troops with warplanes and artillery have invaded Fallujah.  To "soften up" the rebels, American forces dropped five 500-pound bombs on "insurgent targets."  The Americans destroyed the Nazzal Emergency Hospital in the center of town.  They stormed and occupied the Fallujah General Hospital, handcuffing doctors and patients, in violation of the Geneva Conventions.<br /><br />Before Bush attacked Fallujah, Haji Mahmood Allawi, a former colonel in the Iraqi army said, "We are just a helpless and feeble town; a town like an old man!  Still, the U.S. is accumulating its armies and troops against Fallouja &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; as if Fallouja is a superpower that stands in the face of America &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; If you look at what is arrayed against Fallouja, you would think World War III was going to take place."<br /><br />The battle of Fallujah is more shocking and aweful than the bombardment of Baghdad that kicked off Operation "Iraqi Freedom" in April 2003.  A senior Marine Corps surgeon warned that casualties will surpass any level seen since the Vietnam War.  <br /><br />A reporter working for the London <em>Times</em> reported that on his first night in Fallujah, the U.S. Air Force attacked in waves from just after midnight to just after 5 a.m.  "I began to count out loud," he wrote, "as the bombs tumbled to the ground with increasingly monotonous regularity.  There were 38 in the first half-hour alone."  The perimeter of the town is "already largely in ruins.  The crumbling remains of houses and shell-pocked walls reminded me of my home town Beirut in the 1980s at the height of Lebanon's civil war."<br /><br />There have already been 100,000 "excess" Iraqi deaths since Bush launched his first strike on Iraq 18 months ago &#8212; that is, above and beyond those killed by Saddam Hussein, sanctions, U.S. bombings, and disease, all put together, in the 15 months prior to the invasion.<br /><br />A study published by the British medical journal <em>The Lancet</em> found that the risk of death by violence for Iraqi civilians is now 58 times higher than before Bush began to liberate them in April 2003.<br /><br />"We had to stop some operations until the [U.S.] elections were over," said a senior Iraqi Defense Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity.  "The Iraqi government requested support from the American side in the past, but the Americans were reluctant to launch military operations because they were worried about American public opinion.  Now, their hands are free."<br /><br />The Iraqi people, known in the media as &quot;the insurgents,&quot; are engaged in lawful resistance to the illegal invasion, regime change, and occupation of their country by U.S. and U.K. forces. Bush's war in Iraq is a war of aggression.  &quot;Aggression is the use of armed force by a state against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations, as set out in this definition," according to General Assembly Resolution 3314, passed in the wake of Vietnam.<br /><br />The only two situations where the UN Charter permits the use of armed force against another state is in self-defense, or when authorized by the Security Council.  Iraq had not invaded the U.S., or any other country, Iraq did not constitute an imminent threat to any country, and the Security Council never sanctioned Bush's war.  Bush and the officials in his administration are committing the crime of aggression.<br /><br />Virtually every Western democracy has ratified the treaty of the International Criminal Court, except the United States.  Bush knows that the Court will eventually prosecute leaders for the crime of aggression.  Mindful that he and his officials could become defendants, Bush renounced the Court, and extracted bilateral immunity agreements from more than 80 countries.  <br /><br />This year, however, Bush unsuccessfully sought to ram through the Security Council an immunity resolution that would exempt U.S. personnel from the Court's jurisdiction.  But shortly after the photographs of U.S. torture of Iraqi prisoners emerged, the Council refused to put its imprimatur on preferential treatment for the United States.<br /><br />Bush knows that the Court will also punish war crimes.  Pursuant to policies promulgated by Bush and Rumsfeld, U.S. forces have engaged in widespread torture and inhuman treatment of prisoners in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo Bay, Cuba. Bush admitted in his 2003 State of the Union address that he had sanctioned summary executions of suspected terrorists.<br /><br />Torture, inhuman treatment, and willful killing are grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, treaties ratified by the United States. Grave breaches of Geneva are considered war crimes under our federal War Crimes Act of 1996. American nationals who commit war crimes abroad can receive life in prison, or even the death penalty if the victim dies. Under the doctrine of command responsibility, a commander can be held liable if he knew or should have known his inferiors were committing war crimes and he failed to prevent or stop them.<br /><br />The first U.S. attack on Fallujah, last April, killed 900-1000 people, mostly noncombatants.  It was conducted in retaliation for the killing and mutilation of the bodies of four Blackwater Security Consulting mercenaries.  Collective punishment against an occupied population for offenses committed by others also violates the Geneva Conventions.<br /><br />Bush's forces occupied the hospital because it was from there that the civilian death tallies emerged last April.  That led to outrage throughout Iraq, outrage Bush wanted to avoid this time around.  <br /><br />Bush has sought to cover his crimes by putting an Iraqi face on his brutal war.  Before the November invasion of Falluja, the <em>New York Times</em> reported: "Thousands of Iraqi troops have moved into position with their American counterparts and are expected to take part &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; American soldiers are to do most of the fighting on the way in, clearing the way for the Iraqi security forces to take control once the insurgents are defeated.  With this method, Iraqi and American leaders hope for the best of both worlds: American muscle and an Iraqi face."<br /><br />If Bush were a student of history, he would realize that Iraqization, like Vietnamization, will fail to win the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people.  <br /><br />Working hand-in-glove with the U.S. government, interim puppet prime minister Iyad Allawi helped to soften up the rebels by declaring martial law throughout most of Iraq.  His authority came from legislation the human rights minister characterized as "very similar to the Patriot Act of the United States."  It enables Allawi to conduct extensive surveillance, impose cordons and curfews, limit freedom of movement and association, and freeze bank
 accounts and seize assets.<br /><br />"Iraqi confidence in the interim government has plummeted in recent months as the insurgency in Falluja and elsewhere has gained in strength and lethality," according to The New York Times.  <br /><br />And although foreign Islamic extremists have joined the fight, most resisting the American occupation are Iraqi.  "Didn't the Americans bring with them the British and the Italians?", asked Suhail al Abdali.  "Well, we have multinational forces, too," he said wryly.  Then al Abdali added, "They will pay the price with the blood of American sons who came to occupy Iraq.  They won't take Fallujah unless they fight street to street, house to house."<br /><br />Twenty-six prominent Saudi scholars and preachers wrote in an open letter to the Iraqi people: "The U.S. forces are still destroying towns on the heads of their people and killing women and children.  What's going on in Iraq is a result of the big crime of America's occupation of Iraq."  They stressed that armed attacks by militant Iraqi groups on U.S. troops and their allies in Iraq represent "legitimate resistance."<br /><br />"The attack on Fallujah is an illegal and illegitimate action against civilians and innocent people," said the Association of Muslim Scholars, an influential Sunni clerics group.  "We denounce this operation which will have a grave consequence on the situation in Iraq," declared spokesman Mohammed Bashar al-Faidhi. <br /><br />Baghdad University political science professor Salman al-Jumaili warns, "What happens in Fallujah will spread out across other Sunni cities, including Baghdad."  Al-Jumaili expects the Fallujah offensive will spin out of control, with fighting hop-scotching from one town to the next.<br /><br />A senior U.S. diplomat agrees.  "I would never tell you that violence in Sunni areas won't get worse when you open up a battle," he told the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, on condition of anonymity.<br /><br />Following the Holocaust, the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg called the waging of aggressive war &quot;essentially an evil thing . . . to initiate a war of aggression . . . is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.&quot;<br /><br />Bush's aggressive war against the people of Iraq promises to kill many more American soldiers and untold numbers of Iraqis.  Nuremberg prosecutor Justice Jackson labeled the crime of aggression &quot;the greatest menace of our times.&quot;   More than 50 years later, his words still ring true.<br /><br /><em>Marjorie Cohn, a professor at Thomas Jefferson School in San Diego, is executive vice president of the National Lawyers Guild, and the US representative to the executive committee of the American Association of Jurists.</em><br /><p><br />

		<title>Tokaji [Ohio State]: Ohio: Certification, Recount and Contest</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/faculty/facultyprofiles/tokaji.html">Dan Tokaji</a>, Moritz College of Law, Ohio State University:<br /><br />&quot;Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell has certified that President Bush won the state by about 119,000 votes, even as third-party candidates and independent groups continue to question the result. The New York Times has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/07/national/07ohio.html">this report</a>.<br /><br />On Wednesday, the Alliance for Democracy reportedly plans to file a petition contesting the election results. The Alliance&#39;s attorney Cliff Arneback states that &quot;We will allege in the complaint that the result should have been Kerry winning.&quot; As for the Democrats, the NYT reports that: &quot;Democratic officials, walking a fine line between their angry liberal base and centrist voters who consider the election over, said they were not contesting the results.&quot;<br /><br />In addition to the contest, a recount request is anticipated by the Green and Libertarian Party candidates. Now posted on the EL@M website is U.S. District Judge Sargus&#39;s <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/electionlaw/docs/Yost/order123.pdf">order</a> denying both sides motion for a preliminary injunction, in the case brought by Delaware County to stop the recount. As I&#39;ve noted, I think that Judge Sargus was right to deny both preliminary injunction motions. The fact that the election isn&#39;t close doesn&#39;t excuse Delaware County from its obligation to conduct a recount -- however pointless it may seem. At the same time, the Green and Libertarian candidates can&#39;t show that they&#39;d suffer any irreparable injury if the recount isn&#39;t completed by the &quot;safe harbor&quot; date of December 6 or the date the Electoral College meets, December 13.<br /><br />Also posted on the EL@M website is the <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/electionlaw/docs/Yost/intervenor.pdf">Kerry-Edwards&#39; campaign&#39;s motion to intervene</a>. The motion appears artfully drafted to avoid formally joining in the recount, while attempting to convey at least tepid support to appease Democrats who believe the election was stolen. In particular, it states that Kerry and Edwards &quot;have an interest in fully participating in the recount requested by the Defendants [Green candidate Cobb and Libertarian candidate Badnarik] in the instant action.&quot; Pretty pro forma stuff.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the DNC says it will launch an investigation into voting irregularities in Ohio. The Washington Post has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A41275-2004Dec6.html">this story</a>. The Post also mentions <a href="http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/dfiles/file_476.pdf">this new report</a> from the Lawyers&#39; Committee on Civil Rights and People for the American Way, analyzing problems during the election in a number of states.&quot; [December 6, <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/blogs/tokaji">Equal Vote</a> has the <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/blogs/tokaji/2004/12/ohio-certification-recount-and-contest.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://law.uc.edu/faculty/malloy.html">Elizabeth Malloy</a>, University of Cincinnati College of Law:<br /><br />&quot;Early Thursday morning, the <a href="http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2004412100347">Ohio General Assembly</a> passed tort reform legislation that will place caps on pain-and-suffering damages and punitive awards.&nbsp; Governor Bob Taft commended the passage of the bill and will sign it. This bill is the Ohio&#39;s third attempt to pass tort reform.&nbsp; The two prior bills have been declared unconstitutional and many attorneys have stated that this new bill may suffer many of the same defects as those earlier enactments. As The Cincinnati Enquirer reports, <BLOCKQUOTE>The bill, for instance, puts caps on noneconomic &#39;pain-and-suffering&#39; damage awards in cases where injuries are not considered catastrophic.<br /><br />But caps on awards &quot;have been held to be unconstitutional at least twice&quot; by the Ohio Supreme Court, said Peter Weinberger, a Cleveland plaintiff&#39;s attorney and chairman of the legislative committee of the Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers, which lobbied against the bill.</BLOCKQUOTE>It will be interesting to follow the fate of this bill. Ohio&#39;s Supreme Court, which is elected, has recently changed so it is difficult to predict how the new court will rule on the caps constitutionality issue.&quot; [December 10, 2004; <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/healthlawprof_blog">HealthLawProf Blog</a> has the <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/healthlawprof_blog/2004/12/ohio_legislator.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/faculty/facultyprofiles/tokaji.html">Dan Tokaji</a>, Moritz College of Law, Ohio State University:<br /><br />&quot;There&#39;s been continuing attention devoted to the Ohio recount and contest efforts in recent days. The latest developments include the Kerry campaign&#39;s reported intent formally to join the recount litigation, and Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr.&#39;s attempt to call attention to alleged irregularities. But the most significant issue, which few people seem to have noticed, is the structural flaw in Ohio&#39;s recount and contest laws -- which in a close election could degenerate into a genuine constitutional crisis.<br /><br /><strong>Kerry Campaign Joining Recount Litigation</strong><br /><br />The Washington Post reports <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A23344-2004Nov30.html">here</a> that the Kerry campaign will be joining the Green and Libertarian party efforts to force Delaware County, just north of the Columbus area, to participate in the recount. Delaware County&#39;s prosecuting attorney had brought suit to avoid having to go through the recount and, on November 23, a state court judge issued <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/electionlaw/docs/Yostorder.pdf">this temporary restraining order</a> preventing the candidates from requiring Delaware County to perform a recount. That case has now been <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/electionlaw/docs/Yost/Removal.pdf">removed to federal court</a> -- in other words, the defendants have had the case moved to federal court. And the state judge&#39;s TRO expired, by its terms, at 12 noon today, the day that counties are supposed to have completed their official canvass of the votes.<br /><br />I tend to believe that a recount is not likely to do much good. It won&#39;t address the very serious problems that materialized in Ohio&#39;s election, such as confusion over provisional voting, long lines at the polls, partisan election administration, and the continuing use of unreliable punch card voting machines that disproportionately harm minority voters. A recount won&#39;t change any of these things. And a recount certainly won&#39;t change the outcome of the election, as I&#39;ve explained <a href="http://equalvote.blogspot.com/2004_11_01_equalvote_archive.html#110066179862316450">here</a>.<br /><br />Still, I don&#39;t see any reasonable basis for a court order preventing the Green and Libertarian candidates from seeking a recount in Delaware County or anywhere else in the state. Ohio&#39;s recount statute, described <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/electionlaw/procedures_recount01.html">here</a>, allows candidates to demand a recount, even if the election results aren&#39;t close. If Ohio wants to amend its statute, to limit recounts to cases in which the vote is close, fine, but as long as the current statute is in effect candidates are entitled to a recount -- assuming they&#39;re willing to put up the required ten bucks per precinct -- regardless of whether it will accomplish anything....&quot; [December 1, 2004; <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/blogs/tokaji">Equal Vote</a> has <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/blogs/tokaji/2004/12/recounts-contests-and-electoral.html">more</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anna Ryzhova, Kyiv, Ukraine:<br /><br />&quot;Three events featured on Ukraine&#39;s political landscape yesterday, all of which went someway towards resolving the political impasse brought on by the scandalous Presidential election.<br /><br />First, the Parliament of Ukraine agreed to hold its extraordinary meeting on Dec 7th for solving the current political crisis. Second, although Victor Yanukovych, one of the two presidential candidates, was seriously expected to drop the presidantial campaign in the revote, he appeared on two TV channels to declare that he had no intention of withdrawing from the race. In his speach, Mr. Yanukovych separated himself from the &quot;old power&quot;, which, in fact, includes Mr. Kuchma and other officials who have brought Yanukovych his Premier chair and almost made him a president.Third, the round table of Messrs. Yushchenko and Yanukovych, President Kuchma and Speaker Volodymyr Lytvyn, as well as a number of foreign intermediaries, took place yesterday. Unfortunately, as reported the two major conflicting points, i.e. the resignation of the Cabinet and Constitutional reform, have not been resolved yet. The round table participants, however, have agreed upon that the President should dismiss the Central Election Commission and sign the amendments to the presidential elections law. Today, on Dec 7th, the Parliament is expected to vote on the package of Constitutional and electoral laws.&quot; [December 7, 2004 - special to JURIST; Anna Ryzhova is an Associate in the Kyiv office of Hunton &amp; Williams]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.uc.edu/faculty/godsey.html">Mark Godsey</a>, University of Cincinnati College of Law:<br /><br />&quot;On Monday December 6, the Supreme Court will hear an appeal from a Texas death row inmate, Thomas Miller-El, claiming Texas prosecutors improperly struck minorities from his jury.&nbsp; This is the second time in 2 years the Supreme Court will hear an appeal on Miller-El&#39;s behalf on this issue.&nbsp; The last case resulted in an 8 to 1 decision instructing the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider the &quot;substantial evidence&quot; suggesting that prosecutors in Miller-El&#39;s case systematically excluded black jurors from his jury that convicted him in 1985 of killing a hotel clerk in Dallas.&nbsp; Prosecutors used 10 out of 11 peremptory challenges to strike black jurors from the jury and they used a local procedure called &quot;jury shuffle&quot; to move blacks eligible for jury duty lower on the list of potential jurors for the case.&nbsp; In response to the Supreme Court&#39;s instruction to reconsider this evidence, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Miller-El&#39;s claim in a decision &quot;lifted&quot; without attribution from Clarence Thomas&#39; lone dissent in the 8 to 1 Supreme Court decision.&nbsp; The issue presented the second time around:&nbsp; Whether the Court of Appeals, in reinstating on remand from this Court its prior rejection of petitioner&#39;s claim that the prosecution had purposefully excluded African-Americans from his capital jury in violation of <em>Batson v. Kentucky</em>, 476 U.S. 79 (1986), so contravened this Court&#39;s decision and analysis of the evidence in <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell</em>, 537 E.S. 322 (2003), that an exercise of this Court&#39;s supervisory powers under Supreme Court Rule 10(a) is required to sustain the protections against invidious discrimination set forth in <em>Batson</em> and <em>Miller-El</em> and the safeguards against arbitrary fact-finding set forth in 28 U.S.C. 2254(d)(2) and (e)(1)?&nbsp;  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/05/national/05texas.html?hp&ex=1102309200&en=cb3c23993931bdaa&ei=5094&partner=homepage">More...</a><br /><br /><em>Wilkinson v. Dotson, 03-0287</em><br /><br />Questions presented:&nbsp; (1) Whether a prisoner may bring a claim under 42 U.S.C. 1983 claiming that his parole proceedings violate due process, even though success on the merits of the claim would result only in a new parole hearing and would not necessarily guarantee earlier release from prison? (2) Does a federal court judgment ordering a new parole hearing &quot;necessarily imply the invalidity of&quot; the decision at the previous parole hearing?&nbsp; <a href="http://www.medill.northwestern.edu/~secure/docket/mt/archives/000809.php">More...</a>&quot; [December 6, 2004; <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/crimprof_blog">CrimProf Blog</a> has the <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/crimprof_blog/2004/12/mark_supreme_co.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.lls.edu/academics/faculty/hasen.html">Rick Hasen</a>, Loyola Law School Los Angeles:<br /><br />&quot;The <em>Washington Post</em> reports <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A41270-2004Dec6.html">here</a> that new Democratic minority leader Harry Reid has said he could support Justice Scalia as a potential replacement for Chief Justice Rehnquist (if and when the Chief retires) because Scalia is &quot;one smart guy.&quot;  (Reid opposes Justice Thomas for Chief on grounds he has been an &quot;embarassment&quot; on the Court.)  The support for Scalia (tempered by a view that he must overcome &quot;ethics&quot; objections) has reportedly angered some Democrats.<br /><br />In looking at the disputes over judicial nominations, I have always believed that the actions of both Democrats and Republicans have been pretty rational, given political constraints and ideals.  Thus, I have written how it makes sense for Democrats to selectively filibuster a small group of judicial candidates who may be painted (fairly or unfairly) as ideological extremists, and it makes sense for Republicans to threaten (but not follow through on) threats to end the filibuster rules through a majority vote (the so-called &quot;nuclear&quot; option).  I think a focus on rational behavior helps to explain Reid&#39;s stance on Scalia a well.<br /><br />Why would it be rational to support Scalia?<br /><br />(1) Scalia would likely make a weak chief Justice.  Scalia may be &quot;one smart guy&quot;, but he is not a consensus builder.  Far more than anyone else on the Court, his opinions (particularly his dissents) are caustic and nasty.  He likely would not be effective in managing a cohesive conservative court.<br /><br />(2) Scalia, in his 60s, would have a shorter tenure as Chief Justice than a younger Chief who could have influence for a longer period, such as Justice Thomas or an outsider appointed to be chief.<br /><br />(3) Support for Scalia would allow Democrats to counter the charge that they would not vote for an anti-abortion candidate or a conservative, and they could make such a vote without changing the balance on this issue on the Court.  Having approved a Chief Justice Scalia, Democrats would then have additional strength in the court of public opinion to oppose an ideological nominee to fill Scalia&#39;s old seat.<br /><br />(4) To the extent Democrats could highlight Scalia&#39;s &quot;ethics problems,&quot; so much the better for them.&quot; [December 7, 2004; <a href="http://electionlawblog.org">Election Law</a> has the <a href="http://electionlawblog.org/archives/002565.html">post</a>].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Ryzhova [Kyiv]: Report from Ukraine</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anna Ryzhova, Kyiv, Ukraine:<br /><br />&quot;Yesterday, Dec. 8th, the Parliament of Ukraine adopted a number of landmark lawmaking decisions. The purpose of these decisions was to apply measures that would prevent fraud in future elections, to remove some powers from the presidency, and to appoint a new Central Election Commission.<br /><br />Generally, the Dec 8th session was marked by both victories and losses for Ukraine. Among the victories, the Parliament, honoring the Supreme Court decision, has approved the new board of the CEC. The new board now consists of the candidates submitted by the MPs and few officials from the previous board. Notably, the former Chairman of CEC who was accused of being the main actor in mass fraud received the least number of votes and was thus dismissed by definition. Another major change happened during this Parliament session. The General Prosecutor (Attorney General) of Ukraine who failed to put under criminal liability of state officials concerned with crimes during and after the election, publicly resigned from his post.<br /><br />The biggest victory of that day was the passage of the amendments to the elections law. These amendments contain measures to eliminate the possibility of vote-falsification. For instance, they provide for that nominations to poling stations will be based on parity of two candidates, i.e. each presidential candidate nominates half of the territorial election commissions members. The receipt of an absentee ballot will now be marked on the passport of a voter, etc. The comprehensive outline of the elections law amendments can be found <a href="http://www.ukranews.com/eng/index_high.html">here</a>.<br /><br />The MPs have also adopted the changes to the Constitution of Ukraine, which are referred to as Constitutional Reform. The goal of this Reform was to balance the powers of the President and the Parliament of Ukraine through the redistribution of the functions of the former between the Parliament and the Cabinet of Ministers. The Constitutional Reform will come into force in September 2005 or in January 2006, if the MPs fail to pass another break of the reform concerning the local administrations. The keystone of the Constitutional Reform is that Parliament will appoint the prime minister, who will appoint his Cabinet and the heads of local administrations. At the moment both these functions are the prerogatives of the president. This document represents a big compromise between candidate Yushchenko and his former rivals in the presidential campaign together with President Kuchma. Both laws have been simultaneously signed by the acting President who arrived to the Parliament for this purpose.&quot; [December 9, 2004 - special to JURIST; Anna Ryzhova is an Associate in the Kyiv office of Chadbourne &amp; Parke LLP]</p>]]></content:encoded>

This appeal was based on the &quot;guarantee&quot; clause, Article IV, Section 3: &quot;The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government....&quot;  This is the archtypal non-justiciable clause, <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&court=us&vol=48&page=1">ever since 1849</a>.

Notice the &quot;Invasion&quot; clause that comes right after the Guarantee clause, separated only by a comma, which is less than separated New England and New York from Quebec, or Georgia from Florida.)<br /><br />The suit the Supremes turned aside asked them to hold, basically, that the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court deprived Massachusetts of a &quot;Republican Form of Government&quot; by taking it upon itself to redefine marriage in that state.  Courts violate the Guarantee Clause when they make decisions best left to legislatures?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/jbalkin/index.htm">Jack Balkin</a>, Yale Law School:<br /><br />&quot;There are more hints (this from the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A59877-2004Dec12.html?sub=AR">Washington Post</a>) that the Republicans in the Senate will try the &quot;nuclear option&quot; to end filibusters on judicial nominations.<br /><br />The Republicans hold all the levers of power and now would like to leverage that power to kick away the last major support of minority rights.  It&#39;s a tricky calculation for Republicans, because, flush with power, they have many different things they want to do all at once, and they will not be able to do them all.  Do they want to entrench themselves in the courts for a generation more than they want to pass major legislative reforms like Social Security privatization or tax reform?  If they use the nuclear option, the Democrats may prevent any significant legislation from passing in retaliation.  On the other hand, if they want Democratic cooperation, the Republicans may have to accede to a more moderate policy on judicial nominations.  And it would not have to be that much more moderate, in fact, because in the past four years the Democrats filibustered only about 10 of the President&#39;s 229 nominations.<br /><br />The smart move would be not to stir up this particular hornet&#39;s nest.  Judicial nominations are most important for cultural and religious conservatives, who have nowhere else to go.  But one should never underestimate the temptation, among those who have recently become very powerful, to wield their power recklessly in order to demonstrate that they have it.&quot; [December 13, 2004; <a href="http://balkin.blogspot.com">Balkinization</a> has the <a href="http://balkin.blogspot.com/2004/12/nuclear-politics.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://law.buffalo.edu/Faculty_And_Staff/profile.asp?firstlevel=0&filename=ghosh_shubha">Shubha Ghosh</a>, University at Buffalo Law School:<br /><br />&quot;The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments today in the wine distributor case, Swedenborg. Here are two links to NPR coverage of the case from <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4206245">today</a> and <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4204989">yesterday</a>. At issue in the case is the reconciliation of the 21st Amendment which repealed Prohibition and relegated regulation of alcohol to the states with the&nbsp; Commerce Clause, which gives Congress the exclusive power to regulate commerce between the states.&nbsp; &nbsp;The case has important implications for the market for wine, not only for the small distributors who brought the challenge but also for Internet distribution.<br /><br />For what it&#39;s worth here&#39;s my prognostication about how the case should (and probably will come out):&nbsp; The 21st Amendment was not enacted to give states blanket license to regulate the interstate sale of alcohol.&nbsp; Instead, the Amendment was meant to overrule the 18th Amendment which prohibited the sale of all alcohol throughout the states.&nbsp; The language in the 21st Amendment that prohibits the &quot;transportation or importation&quot; into a state in violation of the state&#39;s laws is a statement about the police power of the state to regulate alcohol and was not meant to limit the Commerce Clause.&nbsp; This analysis means that states can regulate alcohol as long as the state regulation does not come into conflict with the Commerce Clause.<br /><br />I am not sure if the Court will address the conflict of the state regulation with the Commerce Clause (the so-called Dormant Commerce Clause doctrine).&nbsp; If the Court does address the dormant commerce clause, my sense is that the regulation would be unconstitutional either because it is facially discriminatory against other states or because of a disparate effect on interstate commerce.<br /><br />Whatever the result, the case will be helpful to follow in order to gauge how this Court draws the line between permissive state regulation of the marketplace and impermissive state restriction on competition.&nbsp; The decision has created and will continue a spirited debate.&quot; [December 7, 2004; <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/antitrustprof_blog">AntitrustProf Blog</a> has the <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/antitrustprof_blog/2004/12/supreme_court_o.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.wayne.edu/faculty/profiles/henning_peter.html">Peter Henning</a>, Wayne State University Law School:<br /><br />&quot;The former New England Regional Director of the Republican National Committee, James Tobin, was charged in a four-count <a href="http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/crim/ustobin120104ind.pdf">indictment</a> on Wednesday, Dec. 1, with conspiracy to make harassing telephone calls to the New Hampshire Democratic headquarters on election day in 2002.&nbsp; According to the indictment, Tobin worked with Charles McGee (who is not charged in the indictment), the Executive Director of the New Hampshire Republican Party, to hire a vendor to make telephone calls to five telephone numbers associated with the New Hampshire Democratic Party and one number for the Manchester Professional Firefighters Association, to prevent them from being able to use the telephones as part of a get-out-the-vote program.&nbsp; The vendor would place the calls, and then hang up once the telephone was answered, and then place calls again to the numbers.&nbsp; The conspiracy count and substantive charges allege violations of 47 U.S.C. 223(a)(1)(C), which makes it a crime for any person who<blockquote>makes a telephone call or utilizes a telecommunications device, whether or not conversation or communication ensues, without disclosing his identity and with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass any person at the called number or who receives the communications;</blockquote>The statute does not require any actual conversation, so it covers a wider range of conduct than, say, 18 U.S.C 875, which requires the interstate communication of an actual threat.&nbsp; An issue will be whether calling and hanging up constitutes harassment.&nbsp; In U.S. v. Lampley, 573 F.2d 783 (3d Cir. 1978), the Third Circuit stated that &quot;in enacting section 223 the Congress had a compelling interest in the protection of innocent individuals from fear, abuse or annoyance at the hands of persons who employ the telephone, not to communicate, but for other unjustifiable motives.&quot;&nbsp; Is interfering with a political party&#39;s use of the telephone for political purposes the same as causing them &quot;fear, abuse or annoyance&quot;?&nbsp; The indictment was returned in the District of New Hampshire, and the prosecutors are from the Computer Crime Section in Main Justice.&quot; [December 2, 2004; <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog">White Collar Crime Prof Blog</a> has the <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/2004/12/political_haras.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Posner [Chicago]: Preventive War</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Judge <a href="http://www.law.uchicago.edu/faculty/posner-r/">Richard Posner</a>, University of Chicago Law School:<br /><br />&quot;The U.S. invasion of Iraq, the U.S. decision not to invade Afghanistan before the 9/11 attacks, and concern with the apparent efforts of Iran and North Korea to obtain nuclear weapons raise acutely the question when if ever a preemptive or preventive war is justified. If &quot;preemptive war&quot; is defined narrowly enough, it merges into defensive war, which is uncontroversial; if you know with certainty that you are about to be attacked, you are justified in trying to get in the first blow. Indeed, the essence of self-defense is striking the first blow against your assailant.<br /><br />But what if the danger of attack is remote rather than imminent? Should imminence be an absolute condition of going to war, and preventive war thus be deemed always and everywhere wrong? Analytically, the answer is no. A rational decision to go to war should be based on a comparison of the costs and benefits (in the largest sense of these terms) to the nation. The benefits are the costs that the enemy&#39;s attack, the attack that going to war now will thwart, will impose on the nation. The fact that the attack is not imminent is certaintly relevant to those costs. It is relevant in two respects. First, future costs may not have the same weight in our decisions as present costs. This is obvious when the costs are purely financial; if given a choice between $100 today and $100 in ten years, any rational person will take $100 now, if only because the money can be invested and through interest compounding grow to a much larger amount in ten years. But the appropriateness of thus discounting future costs is less clear when the issue is averting future costs that are largely nonpecuniary and have national or global impact.<br /><br />Second, and more important, and well illustrated by the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, if the threat of attack lies in the future it is difficult to gauge either its actual likelihood or its probable magnitude. But this is not a compelling argument against preventive war. What is true is that a defensive war is by definition waged only when the probability of an attack has become one; the attack has occurred. The probability of attack is always less than one if the putative victim wages a preventive war, because the attacker might have changed his mind before attacking....&quot; [December 5, 2004; The Becker-Posner Blog has <a href="http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/archives/2004/12/preventive_warp.html">more</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Lee [Ohio State]: Supremes to hear Grokster</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Edward Lee, Moritz College of Law, Ohio State University:<br /><br />&quot;The Supreme Court decided to hear<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/news/archive/2004/12/10/national1312EST0567.DTL"> the Grokster case</a>, which involves the question whether p2p software distributors can be held secondarily liable for the infringing acts of some users of the software.  This is a huge case in the recording industry&#39;s strategy to curb music file sharing.  The 9th Circuit affirmed the district court&#39;s judgment that the p2p software distributors in Grokster had not violated the standards of secondary liability because the software had substantial noninfringing uses under the Sony doctrine.  In the Sony case, the Supreme Court held that the distribution of technologies that are capable of substantial noninfringing uses, such as the video recorder, cannot be the basis for secondary liability -- even though the technologies can also be used for infringing purposes.<br /><br />Thus, just as copyright laws cannot bar the manufacture and distribution of the printing press, copy machine, or video recorder, the Grokster court ruled that it cannot bar the supply of p2p software, which has many lawful uses in allowing the sharing of public domain content, government content, and even copyrighted content authorized by their creators.  For instance, the <a href="http://www.elee.cc/archives/000135.html">band Wilco </a>used p2p to gain popularity among listeners, including an album that reached No. 8 on the Billboard charts.<br /><br />I&#39;ve been working on an essay analyzing these legal issues and will have more to share later.  Stay tuned.&quot; [December 10, 2004; <a href="http://www.elee.cc/content.php?page=blog.php">Lee Blog</a> has the <a href="http://www.elee.cc/archives/000141.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Henning [Wayne State]: Quattrone Sanctioned by NASD</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.wayne.edu/faculty/profiles/henning_peter.html">Peter Henning</a>, Wayne State University Law School:<br /><br />&quot;Frank Quattrone, former star high tech investment banker at Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB), was permanently barred from the securities industry and fined $30,000 by the NASD yesterday (Nov. 22).&nbsp; Quattrone was convicted this past March of obstruction of justice in connection with an e-mail he forwarded to others in his group about cleaning up their files while the SEC was conducting an investigation of CSFB&#39;s activities in the IPO market, particularly those of Quattrone&#39;s high tech investment group.&nbsp; He was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment, and is currently free on bail pending appeal.<br /><br />The basis for the NASD&#39;s permanent bar is that Quattrone refused to testify on the record before an NASD hearing panel investigating his conduct.&nbsp; Quattrone asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege, but the NASD refused to recognize such a right for a member of the securities industry subject to its regulations because the Fifth Amendment only applies to the government and not private organizations.&nbsp; The NASD&#39;s <a href="http://www.nasd.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&ssDocName=NASDW_012489&ssSourceNodeId=9">news release</a> states:<blockquote>At his attorneys&#39; request, NASD Enforcement agreed to postpone Quattrone&#39;s testimony and to take that testimony near Quattrone&#39;s home in San Francisco because of issues concerning Quattrone&#39;s health.&nbsp; But ultimately, Quattrone&#39;s attorneys informed NASD Enforcement that he declined to testify in any location, because of pending state and federal investigations into the same misconduct.&nbsp; In March 2003, NASD Enforcement charged Quattrone with violating NASD conduct rules by refusing to testify.&nbsp; Quattrone answered the charges by denying any wrongdoing; arguing that because of ongoing criminal investigations into the same misconduct, the Fifth Amendment prevented NASD from compelling him to testify, and asserting that by trying to force him to waive his constitutional right against self-incrimination, NASD violated its statutory duty to provide him with a fair opportunity to defend himself.<br /><br />NASD&#39;s NAC [National Adjudicatory Council] rejected Quattrone&#39;s Fifth Amendment privilege arguments, saying the Fifth Amendment &quot;restricts only governmental conduct,&quot; and NASD&#39;s function as a regulator of the securities industry does not constitute government conduct.&nbsp; &quot;NASD is incorporated as a private corporation, it does not receive state or federal funding, and its Board of Governors is not composed of government officials or appointed by a government official or agency,&quot; the NAC says in its ruling.<br /><br />The NAC also rejected Quattrone&#39;s argument that NASD Enforcement failed to provide him with a fair opportunity to defend himself.&nbsp; To the contrary, it found that NASD Enforcement satisfied its statutory obligation and provided Quattrone with the procedural safeguards required by the federal securities laws.<br /><br />&quot;Enforcement made written requests for Quattrone&#39;s on-the-record testimony&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; Pursuant to Quattrone&#39;s request, the testimony was rescheduled and relocated,&quot; the NAC&#39;s ruling says. &quot;Enforcement&#39;s written requests for testimony stated that if Quattrone failed to comply, NASD could take disciplinary action against him that could result in sanctions, including a suspension or a bar from the securities industry.&nbsp; Quattrone was represented by counsel at all times, and he made a fully informed choice to refuse to provide testimony to NASD&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;&quot;</blockquote>The original hearing panel recommended only a one-year bar, but the NAC increased that to a permanent bar because it found that Quattrone&#39;s conduct was &quot;egregious.&quot;&nbsp; Quattrone&#39;s attorney stated that he would appeal to the SEC.<br /><br />The sanction against Quattrone highlights a problem for anyone working in an industry subject to self-regulation by a private body.&nbsp; The NASD&#39;s regulations are subject to review and approval by the SEC, and its decisions are subject to SEC review, but courts have held consistently that it is a private body and therefore the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination does not apply to its proceedings <em>(see, e.g. D.L. Cromwell Investments, Inc. v. NASD Regulation, Inc</em>., 132 F.Supp.2d 248 (S.D.N.Y. 2001), aff&#39;d 279 F.3d 155 (2d Cir. 2002)).&nbsp; Our casebook (<a href="http://west.thomson.com/product/18263035/product.asp">White Collar Crime: Law and Practice</a> (2d ed.)) highlights the parallel proceeding problem that confronts every defendant whose conduct is subject to both criminal and civil regulation--which seems to be just about everyone these days.&nbsp; Quattrone was called to testify while the grand jury was investigating his conduct, and almost every attorney would recommend that a client not testify while such an investigation was in progress, much less after an indictment is returned.&nbsp; This is a true Hobson&#39;s choice, and one which does exact a penalty from the person who refuses to cooperate with an industry or licensing investigation.&quot; [November 23, 2004; <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog">White Collar Crime Prof Blog</a> has the <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/2004/11/quattrone_sanct.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://lawwww.cwru.edu/faculty/faculty_detail.asp?adj=0&id=102">Peter Friedman</a>, Case Western Reserve University School of Law:<br /><br />&quot;It should come as no great surprise that the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/iwpList4/C5667B446C9A4DF7C1256F5C00403967">Red Cross</a> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/30/politics/30gitmo.html?th=&pagewanted=print&position=">reported</a> that the U.S. used psychological and physical coercion &quot;tantamount to torture&quot; on Guantanamo Bay detainees and that doctors and other medical workers helped plan interrogations in &quot;flagrant violation of medical ethics.&quot; As <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2004/0411.carter.html">Philip Carter wrote not too long ago</a> in connection with the torture exposed at Abu Ghraib, the treatment of prisoners taken by the U.S. &quot;wasn&#39;t a failure of implementation, as [Condoleeza] Rice and other administration defenders have admitted. It was a direct&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;and predictable&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;consequence of a policy, hatched at the highest levels of the administration, by senior White House officials and lawyers, in the weeks and months after 9/11.&quot;<br /><br />Re-reading the &quot;torture memos&quot; prepared by the administration only confirms Carter&#39;s views.  The memos are intellectually specious.  The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/documents/dojinterrogationmemo20020801.pdf">2002 Department of Justice memorandum that advised torture of prisoners could be justified</a> (the &quot;Torture Memo&quot;) limited the definition of &quot;torture&quot; to treatment that causes pain &quot;equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or even death.&quot; Id. at 1.  In reaching that conclusion, Jay Bybee, the memo&#39;s author, needed to interpret federal legislation prohibiting treatment of prisoners that caused &quot;severe pain.&quot; Remarkably, he looked to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode42/usc_sec_42_00001395---w022-.html">42 U.S.C. &Acirc;&sect;1395w-22</a> for that definition. Torture Memo at 5-6.  The provisions set forth in that section govern benefits under the &quot;Medicare + Choice&quot; plan.  It&#39;s patently ridiculous to find illumination of the meaning of the term &quot;severe pain&quot; as used in a statute pertaining to torture in a statute pertaining to the regulation of an insurance scheme.  An insurance regulation naturally is going to restrict the meaning of covered terms &#8212; one of the regulation&#39;s purposes is maintenance of the scheme&#39;s solvency.  Moreover, the statute Bybee cites on this point does not define &quot;severe pain,&quot; much less restrict it to pain that is the equivalent of that causes by organ failure or death.  Rather, the only reference in the provision he cited to &quot;severe pain&quot; is in subsection (d)(3)(B), which states as follows: <br /><br />The term &quot;emergency medical condition&quot; means a medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that a prudent layperson, who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine, could reasonably expect the absence of immediate medical attention to result in&acirc;&#8364;&#8221; <br /><br />(i) placing the health of the individual (or, with respect to a pregnant woman, the health of the woman or her unborn child) in serious jeopardy, <br /><br />(ii) serious impairment to bodily functions, or <br /><br />(iii) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part. <br /><br />Bybee, incidentally, <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/olp/bybee.htm">has been nominated</a> to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.&quot; [November 30, 2004; <a href="http://lawwww.cwru.edu/faculty/friedman/raw/">Raw Data</a> has the post]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Podgor [Georgia State]: Money Laundering on Tuesday&#039;s Supreme Court Docket</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://law.gsu.edu/directory/view.php?id=42&version=html">Ellen Podgor</a>, Georgia State University College of Law:<br /><br />&quot;This Tuesday the Supreme Court will hear oral argument in a case that is important to white collar crime law, as the case will determine whether the crime of conspiracy to commit money laundering under <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/ts_search.pl?title=18&sec=1956">18 U.S.C. 1956</a> requires an overt act. The reason that this case is significant to white collar prosecutions and defense is because in recent years the government has been tacking on money laundering charges to cases involving&nbsp; traditional white collar crimes, like mail or wire fraud. (see p. 201-05 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0314145680/qid=1101623829/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-4632925-4722408?v=glance&s=books">Israel, Podgor, Borman, &amp; Henning, White Collar Crime: Law &amp; Practice</a>). <br /><br />The cases to be heard are Whitfield v. United States and <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/circs/11th/0114746p.pdf">Hall v. United States</a>.&nbsp; The defendants were alleged to have a fraudulent investment scheme connected with a church organization.&nbsp; (e.g. &quot;Double Your Blessings Program&quot;)&nbsp; Going across the country raising money, the defendants allegedly made promises of money to made by investing with them.&nbsp; According to the 11th Circuit decision in the Hall case, &quot;many investors received little or no return on their gifts.&quot;&nbsp; As you might suspect, the defendants, on the hand, were accused of receiving amounts of $539,000 and $678,000.&nbsp; The government convicted Hall of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. <br /><br />Whether a conspiracy to commit money laundering requires an overt act will be the focus on Tuesday.&nbsp; It is a fascinating question because the general conspiracy statute located at <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/ts_search.pl?title=18&sec=371">18 U.S.C. 371</a> requires an overt act, while drug conspiracy statutes do not. The Court will likely spend significant time questioning the lawyers about the wording of the statute and the intent of Congress when the statute was passed.&nbsp; But the bottom line really is - will money laundering end up being more like drug conspiracies or the regular generic conspiracies.&nbsp; &nbsp;If the Court decides to omit the overt act in money laundering conspiracies then prosecutors will be able to charge this offense merely upon the agreement of the parties and the defendant&#39;s intent. The defendant will not have to take any steps toward the commission of the crime. The breadth of the money laundering statute is already obvious, as demonstrated by the fact that it is being used in white collar cases.&nbsp; If no overt act is required for conspiracies to commit money laundering, the money laundering statute becomes an even more powerful tool for prosecutors.&quot; [November 28, 2004; <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog">White Collar Prof Crime Blog</a> has the <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/2004/11/money_launderin.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Tokaji [Ohio State]: Preliminary Relief Denied in Ohio Recount Case</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/faculty/facultyprofiles/tokaji.html">Dan Tokaji</a>, Moritz College of Law, Ohio State University:<br /><br />&quot;U.S. District Judge James Carr has denied a preliminary injunction and TRO, in a case seeking to compel Ohio election officials to complete a recount by the December 7 &quot;safe harbor&quot; date.  His order can be found <a href="http://electionlawblog.org/archives/04-7724.pdf">here</a> on Rick Hasen&#39;s blog, and the moving papers in the case (<em>Rios v. Blackwell</em>) are <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/electionlaw/key-recounts.html#Rios">here</a> on the Election Law @ Moritz website.  <br /><br />The plaintiffs in the case include the Libertarian and Green Party candidates for President.  They claim that the failure to conduct a recount by the &quot;safe harbor&quot; date -- discussed in the post immediately below -- violates their constitutional and statutory rights.  Judge Carr doesn&#39;t reach the merits of their claims, instead resting on the fact that there&#39;s no possibility of the plaintiffs being harmed, given that they can&#39;t possibly prevail in the election.<br /><br /><strong>My take:</strong>  I think Judge Carr was correct to deny preliminary relief.  He was also right to avoid the merits, at least at this stage, given the tricky issues that it raises.  But this leaves a serious problem unresolved. <br /><br />As I mentioned yesterday, Ohio&#39;s recount and contest scheme makes it difficult if not impossible for the state to meet the December 7 &quot;safe harbor&quot; date, by which contests over presidential electors must be resolved in the state is to ensure its chosen electors will be the ones counted in Congress.  In fact, Ohio&#39;s scheme makes it difficult for the recount and contest process to be completed by the date on which the Electoral College meets (December 13).  Perhaps some of the blame lies with Secretary Blackwell for not proceeding more quickly. But the biggest problem, it seems to me, lies in Ohio&#39;s statutory scheme.  <br /><br />It seems clear that the statute needs to be fixed.  Whether the courts have a role to play in the process is less clear.  <br /><br />As an initial matter, it&#39;s hard to see how the Plaintiffs can plausibly claim a violation of any right under Art. I, Sec. 2 of the Constitution, providing that electors shall be appointed in such manner as the Legislature may direct.  The only real argument is that Blackwell should declare the election by December 3, the date on which the Secretary of State is by statute supposed to send notice to the chosen electors.  (He&#39;s said that he may not do it before December 6.)  But this doesn&#39;t really solve the problem, since there still wouldn&#39;t be enough time for a recount and contest.  Nor can Plaintiffs plausibly claim that the federal safe harbor law (3 U.S.C. 5) has been violated.  It&#39;s up to states to determine whether they wish to take advantage of this safe harbor, and I think it&#39;s doubtful that this statute confers any privately enforceable rights.  <br /><br />That leaves Plaintiffs&#39; claims under the First and Fourteenth Amendment.  Maybe there&#39;s a due process argument, arising from the fact that the State of Ohio has prescribed a recount and contest procedure that can&#39;t realistically be completed in time for it to be meaningful.  While this claim isn&#39;t very clearly fleshed out in Plaintiffs&#39; moving papers, and it might be declared moot after the electoral college meetts, it would be nice to see this issue litigated now -- rather than in the context of a truly disputed election four, eight, or twelve years hence.  Capable of repetition yet evading review?&quot; [November 23, 2004; <a href="http://equalvote.blogspot.com">Equal Vote</a> has the <a href="http://equalvote.blogspot.com/2004_11_01_equalvote_archive.html#110127648218576016">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Solum [San Diego]: Ashcroft v. Raich</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.sandiego.edu/~lsolum/">Lawrence Solum</a>, University of San Diego School of Law:<br /><br />&quot;When I wrote these words, I was sitting in the chamber of the Supreme Court of the United States. The last time I was in this room, I was sitting on the bench in the chair usually occupied by Chief Justice Rehnquist&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;that&#39;s another story altogether. On this occasion, Rehnquist&#39;s chair was empty, but he will participate in the decision of the case heard today--Ashcroft v. Raich.<br /><br /><strong>Background</strong><br /><br />The issue in Raich focuses on medical use of cannabis, authorized by a voter initiative in the State of California but prohibited by federal law. In particular, the issue is whether the federal government may prohibit the possession of home-grown, intrastate, noncommercial cannabis, the use and possession of which has been authorized by state law.<br /><br />In a sense, this case has its roots in the New Deal era. In 1937, the United States Supreme Court began to expand Congress&#39;s legislative power in the famous case of Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel (the case involving the so-called &quot;switch in time that saved nine&quot;). A few years later, the Court decided Wickard v. Filburn, in which a federal limitation of wheat production was upheld as applied to a Mr. Filburn&#39;s use of wheat on his own farm. The rationale of that case was that the general class of all wheat grown and consumed on farms on interstate commerce would be substantial, and therefore, Congress could regulate the wheat even though it was never sold in interstate commerce. In the 1950s through the 1980s, the conventional wisdom was that the Supreme Court had removed virtually all limits on Congress&#39;s power under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. So long as there was a &quot;rational basis&quot; or even a &quot;conceivable rational basis&quot; for Congress&#39;s action, it would be within Congress&#39;s legislative power. It was therefore a shock when the Supreme Court decided two cases in the 1990s that struck down federal statutes on the grounds that they were outside of Congress&#39;s power to regulate interstate commerce.<br /><br />The first of these two cases was Lopez, in which the Supreme Court struck down the Gun Free School Zones Act, a federal statute that prohibited the possession of a gun within 1000 feet of a school. The second case was Morrison, in which the Court struck down the Violence Against Women Act. These cases limited Wickard v. Filburn to regulations that involve &quot;economic activity,&quot; a category that the Court has never precisely defined but which seems to apply to actions that are part of a process that leads to sale or barter.<br /><br />The lower courts have recently begun to apply Lopez and Morrison in &quot;as applied&quot; challenges to other federal statutes. Examples include: (1) a home-assembled machine gun, (2) home-made child pornography, and (3) home-grown state authorized medical cannabis. Ashcroft v. Raich gives the Supreme Court an opportunity to clarify the meaning of Lopez and Morrison and potentially, an opportunity to further limit Congress&#39;s power or to modify its two &quot;new federalism&quot; decisions in a way that would make them toothless. Raich is potentially a very important case, but it also could be decided on very narrow grounds.<br /><br /><strong>The Justices Enter</strong><br /><br />The chamber is hushed as the Justices begin to enter, beginning with Justice O&#39;Connor. Justice Stevens waits a few moments and then speaks, announcing that the Court will take motions of admission to the Supreme Court Bar. This quaint ritual is completed with dispatch, and Justice Stevens calls Paul Clement, the Acting Solicitor General of the United States to the podium....&quot; [November 29, 2004; <a href="http://lsolum.blogspot.com">Legal Theory</a> has <a href="http://lsolum.blogspot.com/archives/2004_11_01_lsolum_archive.html#110176369403760998">more</a>]<br /><br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contibuting Editor Ali Khan of Washburn University School of Law says that the Bush administration&#39;s appointment of minority candidates to high-profile positions has made them the complicit and even enthisiastic instruments of political and legal policies as harmful as any espoused by white males.<hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/khan2.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he Bush administration is making history in recruiting so many minorities to perform high-profile jobs. Colin Powell was the first black man to head the State Department, Condoleezza Rice was the first black woman to be the National Security Advisor, and appears set to be first black women Secretary of State, succeeding Powell. White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales, if confirmed by the Senate, would be the first Hispanic to be named United States Attorney General.<br /><br />The introduction of these and other minorities into what has traditionally been a political game of white monopoly in Washington has been in that it&#39;s suggested to the world that President Bush values both equality and diversity, and that racial prejudices, actively wired in American power grids, are falling apart. No longer are Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians confined to dirty jobs, such as cleaning private quarters of the white establishment. See, says the Administration, the sons and daughters of the people of color are being actively recruited to lead the world.<br /><br />But wait a minute. On closer inspection, the willing coalition of black, brown, and other faces of color appears to have been summoned to whitewash foreign invasions, occupations, deportations, detentions, disappearances, and even the commission of war crimes such as torture and extra-judicial executions. Minorities have been cast as big-headed puppets to speak daggers on behalf of a producer/director who, we are told, believes in God, democracy, and liberation.<br /><br />Take Dr. Condoleezza Rice, known as Condi (which means sweet). Born in the same year the famous Brown case outlawing segregation was decided, raised in the Deep South where lynching of  the innocent had been the way to vent hatred, and scarred with memories of her schoolmate killed in the bombing of a black church by white supremacists, Condi has come a long way indeed to champion abusive harshness against the enemy. Of all the presidents men and women, Condi, a pastor&#39;s daughter, has been the most combative in her rhetoric of warfare. It was Condi, the brilliant professor on the Bush Cabinet, who wrote a column in the <em>New York Times</em> to tell the world &quot;Why we know Iraq is lying about weapons of mass destruction,&quot; concluding her piece with ominous words &quot;time is running out.&quot; Time did run out on Iraq, UN inspectors, and the world calling for restraint, though Condi knew little about the truth of her crusade. One wonders how Condi would employ her militaristic strategies in her new role as America&#39;s chief diplomat.<br /><br />Another Bush minority, Alberto Gonzalez, has built upon equally impressive credentials to promote abusive harshness at home and abroad. Rising from a humble Mexican family in Texas, going to college against all odds of a working class household, and graduating from Harvard Law School, Alberto has endeared himself to the Administration&#39;s tough guys. As the White House Counsel, he envisioned a lawless prison for the so-called &quot;enemy combatants&quot; captured in Afghanistan. He denied them the protection of Geneva Conventions, arguing that some of laws provisions are quaint and obsolete.  In 2002, Alberto cleared a legal memo allowing torture as an acceptable means to investigate enemy combatants unless torture results in death, organ failure, or serious impairment of bodily functions. Discarding restraints of international law, since the tough guys had no use for them, Alberto&#39;s memos most certainly contributed to abominable abuses at Abu Gharib (which perchance was under the general command of General Ricardo Sanchez, another Bush minority, this time engaged in supervising the slaughter of Iraqi civilians). Seeing law as an instrument of power, Alberto has constructed a notion of White House legality with no intrinsic morality. It remains to be seen how Alberto, if confirmed by the Senate, would lead the Department of Justice, the task of which is not simply to please the White House but to enforce laws and protect civil liberties.<br /><br />The story of Viet Dinh, perhaps the most brilliant Bush minority, is no less compelling. Born in Saigon when bombs were falling all over Vietnam, Viet entered America as a refugee. Graduating <em>magna cum laude</em> from Harvard Law School, clerking with Supreme Court Justice Sandra O Connor, and later teaching at the Georgetown Law Center, Viet was ripe in 2001 to serve the public. As irony would have it, the glory of authoring the Patriot Act fell on this Asian refugee. The Act he authored is an inscrutable text, neither elegant nor candid, but one hammered together to sneak and peek (on the theory that while the cats away the mice will play), gag , detain, and even criminally implicate speech protected under the First Amendment. In his media encounters, Viet defends the Act as a wonderful security gift to Americans (Muslim Americans excluded), and labels the grassroots movement against the Act as hysteria and fury signifying nothing.<br /><br />Far more pompous than Condi, Alberto, and Viet is Colin Powell, who has served his boss with shrewd skepticism instead of foolish fervor. Colin has gained the reputation of a man of conscience who has resisted becoming totally subservient to the tough guys. That is why, the argument goes, he first lost his power, then his job. That might be so. But it was this Bush minority who deceived the UN Security Council about pictures of Iraqi trucks hauling the weapons of mass destruction. Colin seemingly disapproved the war but nonetheless continued to support it for years. This is no show of conscience. In any event, Colin has aided and abetted a dirty foreign policy for far too long to claim any cloak of purity.<br /><br />Of course, there exists no proof that the White House has launched a deliberate policy of hiring minorities for illegal and immoral assignments. But who needs proof these days? Mere accusation should suffice. It is certainly intriguing that Bush minorities are collectively chanting the mantras of security at home and liberty abroad to play dirty with law, affirming an unfortunate message that even the people of color, when given the responsibility to run affairs of the state, act no differently than white males, the species so maligned in critical race literature as the paragon of brutality and cold-heartedness.<br /><br />Thus a new chapter is being written in American history, the theme of which is &quot;dirty diversity.&quot; Non-white faces have been hired for big-ticket jobs so that a black woman vouches for an unjust war, a black man defends it, one Hispanic justifies the use of torture while another supervises the slaughter of foreign civilians, and a Vietnamese refugee writes the law to maim American civil liberties. The jobs for these minorities are better than they used to be, but the tasks are no cleaner. <br /><br /><em>Ali Khan is a professor of law at Washburn University School of Law in Topeka, Kansas.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.wayne.edu/faculty/profiles/henning_peter.html">Peter Henning</a>, Wayne State University Law School:<br /><br />&quot;An article in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/15/business/media/15media.html">New York Times</a> (Dec. 15) states that Time Warner is preparing to announce a settlement in a long-running SEC and Department of Justice investigation into accounting issues at its American Online unit (AOL), including a $400 million transaction between AOL and Bertelsmann in 2000.&nbsp; The accounting issues involve (always exciting) revenue recognition in what appear to have been round-trip transactions, something that has troubled the energy and food distribution industries, among others.&nbsp; According to the article:<blockquote>Time Warner is expected to announce a settlement with the Justice Department in its investigation of advertising deals between America Online and smaller Internet companies that may have allowed America Online to exaggerate its growth, an official close to the case said yesterday. The announcement could come as early as today.<br /><br />The company may also announce a tentative agreement with the enforcement division of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is conducting a separate investigation into accounting irregularities at America Online, the official said. Time Warner is expected to pay $500 million to $600 million to settle all civil and criminal accusations with the two agencies.</blockquote>The fine will be divided between the DOJ ($200 million) and the SEC ($300+ million). The SEC investigation has had a particularly negative effect on the company because it called into question the reliability of its financial statements, making it impossible for&nbsp; Time Warner to issue debt and equity securities--a must for any company hoping to engage in acquisitions, for which Time Warner is famous. Indeed, it likely still rues the day it decided to accept the AOL offer in 1999, even having dropped that moniker from its name a couple years ago.&quot; [December 15, 2004; <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog">White Collar Crime Prof Blog</a> has the <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/2004/12/time_warner_set.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

Afshari</em></a> overturned a lower court decision and held <a href="http://web2.westlaw.com/keycite/default.wl?mt=LawSchoolPractitioner&fn=_top&sv=Split&cite=18+usca+2339B(a)(1)&rp=%2fkeycite%2fdefault.wl&vr=2.0&rs=WLW4.12">Title 18 U.S. C. 2339B(a)(1)</a> constitutional. This statute provides criminal penalties for providing &quot;material support&quot; to a designated terrorist organization.&nbsp; The statute provides that an organization is designated as a &quot;terrorist organization&quot; under the statute by the Secretary of State.&nbsp; The further statute provides that an organization labeled by the Secretary as a &quot;terrorist organization&quot; can challenge this finding only in the D.C. Circuit.<br /><br />The lower court had held that the statute was facially unconstitutional because it restricted judicial review to the D.C. Circuit alone.&nbsp; Rejecting that position, the Ninth Circuit stated:<BLOCKQUOTE>Many administrative determinations are reviewable only by petition to the correct circuit court, bypassing the district court, and that procedure has generally been accepted. Many are reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit, or the Federal Circuit, and those restrictions have also been generally accepted. The congressional restriction does not interfere with the opportunity for judicial review, as the MEK&#39;s extensive litigation history shows. And this scheme avoids the awkwardness of criminalizing material support for a designated organization in some circuits but not others, as varying decisions in the different regional circuits might.</BLOCKQUOTE>The Court also rejected the defendants due process arguments against the statutorily designated procedure for judicial review.&nbsp; In rejecting the defendants&#39; First Amendment arguments, the court stated:&nbsp; &quot;It would be anomalous indeed if Congress could prohibit the contribution of money for television commercials saying why a candidate would be a good or bad choice for political office, yet could not prohibit contribution of money to a group designated as a terrorist organization. Thus, we hold that</a><a target="_top" href="http://web2.westlaw.com/find/default.wl?DB=1000546&DocName=18USCAS2339B&FindType=L&AP=&mt=LawSchoolPractitioner&fn=_top&sv=Split&vr=2.0&rs=WLW4.12">&Acirc;&sect; 2339B</a> does not impermissibly restrict the defendants&#39; First Amendment right of association.&quot;<br /><br />According to the indictment, the defendants solicited charitable contributions at the Los Angeles International Airport for the &quot;Committee for Human Rights,&quot; gave money and credit cards to the Mujahedin-e Khalq (&quot;MEK&quot;), and wired money from the &quot;Committee for Human Rights&quot; to an MEK bank account in Turkey. They did all this after participating in a conference call with an MEK leader, in which they learned that the State Department had designated the MEK as a foreign terrorist organization. The MEK leader told them to continue to provide material support despite the designation. All told, according to the indictment in this case, the money they sent to the MEK amounted to at least several hundred thousand dollars.<br /><br />The MEK was founded in the 1960s as an Iranian Marxist group seeking to overthrow the regime then ruling Iran. It participated in various terrorist activities against the Iranian regime and against the United States, including the taking of American embassy personnel as hostages in 1979. After the Iranian regime fell and was replaced by a clerical, rather than a Marxist, regime, MEK members fled to France. They later settled in Iraq, along the Iranian border. There they carried out terrorist activities with the support of Saddam Hussein&#39;s regime, as well as, if the indictment is correct, the money that the defendants sent them.&quot; [December 21, 2004; <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/crimprof_blog">CrimProf Blog</a> has the <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/crimprof_blog/2004/12/breaking_case_n_5.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Tokaji [Ohio State]: Move to Delay Electoral College in Ohio</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/faculty/facultyprofiles/tokaji.html">Dan Tokaji</a>, Moritz College of Law, Ohio State University:<br /><br />&quot;Today&#39;s the day that the Electoral College meets in each of the state capitals. Just hours before, some congressional Democrats and other Democratic activists asked state officials to delay the Electoral College vote in Columbus, Ohio until the recount is completed. The A.P. has <a href="http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20041213/NEWS/412130393">this report</a>.<br /><br />President Bush won by about 119,000 votes, as of the date that Ohio&#39;s results were certified a few days ago. But there are recount requests and a contest of the election still pending. The Green and Libertarian parties&#39; candidates requested recounts in each of the 88 Ohio counties, which are to start this week. A spokesman for Ohio Gov. Bob Taft says that the state won&#39;t postpone the Electoral College vote or make it provisional, as House Dems areq requesting. Oh well.<br /><br />In related news, the <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/">Columbus Dispatch</a> reported yesterday that heavily Republican precincts in Franklin County saw an increase in voting machines, while heavily Democratic ones lost voting machines. There were reports of multi-hour lines in many Franklin County precincts on election day, particularly those in or near central Columbus. While the full text of the story doesn&#39;t appear to be available on line, the Dispatch report finds that:<BLOCKQUOTE>- Predominantly Democratic Franklin County precincts -- those where Democrat Al Gore got at least 70 percent of the vote in 2000 -- had 17 fewer machines used in 2004. At the same time, the strongest GOP precincts -- where George W. Bush got at least 70 percent of the vote four years ago -- received eight more machines.<br /><br />- Based on the information available when officials placed machines, the Democratic precincts had 20 percent more &quot;active&quot; voters per machine used than the Republican areas. The GOP precincts had an 18 percent higher turnout in 2000, but the Columbus ballot this year was much longer than in the suburbs because of bond issues -- which officials say was a major reason for long lines.<br /><br />- The county average for active voters per machine was 229 per precinct, with a range from 388 in Columbus Precinct 73-J to 84 in Truro Township A. But nearly three-fourths of the Democratic precincts had a higher-than-average voter-permachine number, compared with 30 percent of the GOP precincts.<br /><br />- Franklin County officials tried to put 29 additional machines into service on Election Day -- all in the Democratic and minority precincts -- but 17 weren&#39;t used because they were delivered after the polls closed or because poll workers told those delivering the machines that they weren&#39;t needed, officials said. The county didn&#39;t use 22 other machines.</blockquote><strong>My take:</strong> The recount and contest in Ohio won&#39;t change the outcome, and doesn&#39;t provide a good reason for delaying the Electoral College vote . . . this year. But in a closer election, the glaring flaw in Ohio&#39;s election procedures, which allows insufficient time for the recount and contest to be completed before the Electoral College meets, could spell disaster.<br /><br />As far as this year&#39;s election goes, I&#39;ve still not seen any evidence yet that would support the claim that Kerry really won -- or would have won if not for &quot;irregularities.&quot; But the latest findings in the Dispatch report are troubling. Franklin County election officials vigorously deny any partisan gamesmanship in the distribution of machines. And that&#39;s probably true, given that the county boards of election have equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans. But even if there wasn&#39;t an intentional maldistribution of machines, the long lines that many Columbus-area voters faced were a disgrace. There&#39;s no telling exactly how many people were discouraged from voting as a result of those lines, and it would be inexcusable if election officials failed to fix this problem before the next presidential elections.<br /><br />This isn&#39;t rocket science folks. We need new voting machines, and we need them now (or at least by 2006).&quot; [December 13, 2004; <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/blogs/tokaji">Equal Vote</a> has the <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/blogs/tokaji/2004/12/move-to-delay-electoral-college-in.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anna Ryzhova, Kyiv:<br /><br />&quot;Ukraine has bravely overcome the third Presidential election round. Last Sunday, Dec. 26th, as many as 77% of Ukrainian voters participated in the revote choosing their President.<br /><br />By 10 pm Dec 27th, the Central Elections Commission (&quot;CEC&quot;) has processed 99.9% of election protocols containing cumulative information per each election region and announced mathematically convincing but not yet official results of the elections: the Orange Revolution leader, Mr. Yuschenko, has won the Presidential elections receiving 52% of votes. Yuschenko&#39;s rival, the Prime Minister Victor Yanukovych has received 44%.<br />    <br />The election process is reported to be fair and transparent, except for voting cabins where each voter was making his or her choice by secret voting. Nevertheless, yesterday Mr. Yanukovych announced that he intends to challenge the results of the elections in separate regions and then as a whole.<br /><br />According to the official CEC web site, 8.5 thousand of observers from different parts of the world has arrived to watch over the election process. In addition to that, number of Ukrainian residents have volunteered to observe the elections and assist in voting. The assisting was extremely important for disabled voters who could only vote at their homes.<br /><br />The problem with disabled voters has arisen when the Presidential Elections Act, amended after the Orange Revolution, provided that only 1st category disabled voters could vote at home. Two days before the elections, the Constitutional Court of Ukraine has abolished the said provision allowing all categories of disabled to vote at home in case they are unable to get to an election station on their own. The CEC was not prepared to ensure transportation for such &quot;home-based&quot; voting. In these cases private people assisted the stations &quot;delivering the voting right&quot; to disabled.<br /> <br />The spirit of victory has been darkened by the death of the Ministry of Transportation, Mr. Kyrpa, who was shot at his cottage after he met with an undisclosed top official. The murder or suicide is now under investigation.&quot; [December 28, 2004 - special to JURIST; Anna Ryzhova is an Associate in the Kyiv office of Chadbourne &amp; Parke LLP]</p>]]></content:encoded>

The government has asked a federal court &quot;to enter a judgment of $2.53 billion against two members of Adelphia&#39;s founding Rigas family, who were convicted in July on fraud and conspiracy counts.&quot; To make matters worse, &quot;the Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a lawsuit against Adelphia and the Rigases, charging fraud and self-dealing and seeking to recover &#39;all ill-gotten gains.&#39;&quot;&nbsp; But as the Wall Street Journal article notes, the government may wait to see if the assets are sold at an auction.&nbsp; It is easier for the government if they obtain cash then a business, so as not to be placed in the position of having to run or maintain the business.<br /><br />What is happening in this case stresses the need for defense counsel to approach white collar crime cases from a global perspective.&nbsp; One has to consider all the collateral consequences to a client and their company throughout the representation. In the Rigas cases we see the possibly of assets being seized.&nbsp; This is only a small segment of what can occur in a white collar case.&nbsp; Other factors that one may be dealing with, in addition to criminal charges, are license forfeiture or debarment from doing future business with the government.&nbsp; Additionally, one may be dealing with several different government agencies such as the SEC and IRS, in addition to handing the criminal matter.&quot; [December 14, 2004; <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog">White Collar Crime Prof Blog</a> has the <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/2004/12/will_the_govern.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

The defense begged jurors to &quot;go back there and please spare his life.&quot;</p></blockquote>Obviously, anyone who is absolutely opposed to the death penalty will decry this result. But for those who are open to the idea of executing convicted murderers, I have to wonder whether this is an appropriate case for invoking the death penalty.&nbsp; To be sure, the jury found that Peterson premeditated the murder of his wife, and while that finding may be overturned on appeal, for now, I&#39;ll take it true. But what makes Peterson more deserving of the death penalty than any other murderer?&nbsp; Certainly not in volume of killing, or manner of killing.&nbsp; It&#39;s just that the victim happened to be photogenic and to have a family that spoke passionately about its loss.<br /><br />Considering that <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?did=108&scid=7#From%20DPIC">the death penalty costs more to seek than life imprisonment</a> (perhaps a biased site, but one consistent with other studies I&#39;ve seen),&nbsp; you have to wonder, are the people of California really better off having gotten the death penalty against Peterson?&quot; [December 13, 2004; <a href="http://yin.typepad.com/the_yin_blog">YinBlog</a> has the <a href="http://yin.typepad.com/the_yin_blog/2004/12/does_death_for_.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Podgor [Georgia State]: 80% of Recent Bush Pardons Were Convicted of White Collar Offenses</title>

The last one, &quot;theft from interstate shipment&quot; could go either way, perhaps depending on the facts.&nbsp; I will give the benefit of the doubt on this last one to it being in the non-white collar category and claim 8/10 of the November/December pardons as white collar. (admittedly not an accurate statistical study being conducted here - so I would say the margin of error is likely to be 10%).<br /><br />Some will claim that having 80% of pardons as white collar offenses is a proper percentage, as we are dealing with non-violent crimes here.&nbsp; Others may, however, note that there seems to be a lack of consistency in the types of pardons being granted by the President (high percentage of white collar offenders) with an aim of increased penalties in sentencing guidelines for white collar offenders.&nbsp; Just maybe, President Bush is giving a perfect reason for the need to rethink sentencing guidelines with respect to white collar offenses.&nbsp; But I guess, others out there will claim that I am comparing apples and oranges, as sentences have nothing to do with pardons.&nbsp; Your choice, I have my opinion.&quot; [December 23, 2004; <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog">White Collar Crime Prof Blog</a> has the <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/2004/12/bush_pardons_wh.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/faculty/facultyprofiles/berman.html">Douglas Berman</a>, Moritz College of Law, Ohio State University:<br /><br />&quot;According to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/12/21/presidential.pardons.ap/index.html">this AP story</a>, President George Bush granted four pardons today, which gives him a total of just 31 pardons and commutations during his first term.&nbsp; As the AP story notes, this total is &quot;far off the pace of most modern presidents and less than half the 77 granted by his father, President George H.W. Bush, during his single term from 1989 to 1993.&quot;<br /><br />In a few recent prior posts, I have discussed President Bush&#39;s stingy approach to the historic clemency power, as well as other clemency news:<ul><li><a href="http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy/2004/11/pardon_me.html">Pardon me</a></li><li><a href="http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy/2004/12/no_new_york_cle.html">No New York clemencies this season</a></li><li><a href="http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy/2004/12/come_all_thee_c.html">Come all thee clemencies</a></li></ul><u>UPDATE</u>: Seeking more insights about President Bush&#39;s approach to these matters, I wrote to Margaret Colgate Love, a specialist in post-conviction remedies and executive clemency, who served for seven years as US Pardon Attorney under the first President Bush and President Clinton.&nbsp; Here&#39;s her powerful reaction to the recently announced pardons:<blockquote>These four grants are collectively so banal and inconsequential as to demonstrate once again President Bush&#39;s disdain for his own pardon power. In all four cases the crimes were very minor (all were sentenced to probation), and three of the four occurred more than 25 years ago. To confine use of the power to these kinds of cases, as Bush has throughout his four years in office, trivializes and squanders it. When you think of the enormous good that could be done with the power, and what the Framers thought about it as a test of presidential mettle and integrity, you can see that it is a truer measure of presidential courage than almost anything else the President does. Don&#39;t forget that this is the ONLY way a federal offender can get relief from the collateral consequences of conviction, which under state law can be very severe. <br /><br />Relatedly, President Bush has granted only 29 of the 707 pardon cases he has decided to date. This means that his pardon grant rate is less than 3% (his father&#39;s pardon grant rate was double that, and all other 20th century Presidents were well into double digits). In addition, the Office of the Pardon Attorney reports that there are over 700 pardon cases still awaiting presidential action -- many of which were filed during the Clinton administration. (This doesn&#39;t count the 2000-odd commutation applications that are presently pending). The quality and quantity of this President&#39;s pardon grants are hard to square with his statements about the importance of giving convicted people a second chance.</blockquote> [December 21, 2004; <a href="http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy">Sentencing Law and Policy</a> has the <a href="http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy/2004/12/bushs_stingy_pa.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

Perhaps it really is <a href="http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy/2004/12/the_embookereme.html">all my fault</a>.<br /><br />I have previously highlighted <a href="http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy/2004/12/the_costs_of_de.html"><span style="color: #336699;">here</span></a> and <a href="http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy/2004/12/the_impact_of_d.html"><span style="color: #336699;">here</span></a> and <a href="http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy/2004/11/gauging_the_imp.html"><span style="color: #336699;">here</span></a> how many different persons and institutions are eager for a decision in <em>Booker</em> and <em>Fanfan </em>&acirc;&#8364;&#8221; including, of course, both other branches of the federal government.&nbsp; Recall that, way back in July, the <a href="http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy/2004/07/congress_clears.html">US Congress</a> and the <a href="http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy/2004/07/thesaurus_of_rh.html">Acting Solicitor General</a> expressed in remarkable terms how critical it was for the Court to promptly rule on the constitutionality of the procedures used in applying the federal sentencing guidelines.&nbsp; Moreover, as I noted before, last year the Court in <a href="03pdf/02-1674.pdf"><span style="color: #336699;"><em>McConnell v. Federal Election Commission</em></span></a> was able to resolve the constitutionality of the new federal campaign finance laws &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; in opinions totaling 298 written pages!! &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; before heading home for the holidays. <br /><br />I must now speculate that Chief Justice Rehnquist&#39;s illness is playing a role in the delay.&nbsp; Notably, as detailed <a href="http://goldsteinhowe.com/blog/archive/2004_12_12_SCOTUSblog.cfm#110295024478239270">here</a>, the Chief did not participate in some of the cases decided today.&nbsp; I presume that reveals that the Chief&#39;s health is impacting his ability to be a fully functioning member of Court.&nbsp; Though I doubt that CJ Rehnquist is a swing vote on whether <em>Blakely</em> applies to the federal guidelines, he could be a swing vote on the second severability question.&nbsp; Moreover, CJ Rehnquist&#39;s absence from the Court may mean that there is not a chief administrator pushing other Justices to complete their opinions.&nbsp; [<strong><u>UPDATE</u></strong>: Howard Bashman <a href="http://www.legalaffairs.org/howappealing/2004_12_01_appellateblog_archive.html#110295452795500483">has news here</a> on the impact of the Chief&#39;s health, as well as <a href="http://www.legalaffairs.org/howappealing/2004_12_01_appellateblog_archive.html#110295749846105182">speculations here</a> about who may be writing <em>Booker</em> and <em>Fanfan </em>based on which Justices have yet to author a majority opinion from the Supreme Court&#39;s October 2004 argument session.]<br /><br />More than a few folks, as particularly detailed in posts <a href="http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy/2004/12/more_supreme_co.html">here</a> and <a href="http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy/2004/12/more_musings_an.html">here</a>, have suggested that January would be a better and/or more appropriate time for a decision in <em>Booker</em> and <em>Fanfan</em>.&nbsp; I am not sure I agree, since I think there are real costs &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; to both federal and state criminal justice systems &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; stemming from another month of legal uncertainty about constitutionally required sentencing procedures.&nbsp; However, given <a href="http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy/2004/07/the_challenges_.html">the challenges SCOTUS faces</a> and the apparently <a href="http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy/2004/07/justice_oconnor.html">deep divisions within the Court</a>, I suppose I should be glad the Court is taking whatever time it needs to get <em>Booker</em> and <em>Fanfan</em> right.&quot; [December 13, 2004; <a href="http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy">Sentencing Law and Policy Blog</a> has the <a href="http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy/2004/12/no_news_is_big_.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Froomkin [Miami]: UK&#039;s House of Lords Holds that Indefinite Detention Violates European Convention on Human Rights!</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.tm/">Michael Froomkin</a>, University of Miami School of Law:<br /><br />&quot;You know you are in trouble when the <em>House of Lords</em> is more protective of civil rights than the US court system: <a title="Guardian Unlimited | Special reports | Law lords back terror detainees" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/terrorism/story/0,12780,1374967,00.html">Law lords back terror detainees</a>:<blockquote>Detaining foreigners without trial under emergency anti-terror legislation breaks European human rights powers, law lords ruled today.<br /><br />The decision from the law lords, Britain&rsquo;s highest court, throws the government&rsquo;s security policies into chaos.<br /><br />A specially-convened committee of nine law lords upheld an appeal by nine foreigners who have been detained without charge or trial, most of them in Belmarsh prison, south-east London, for around three years.<br /><br />Experts said today&rsquo;s decision would probably force the government to repeal the section of the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 which has permitted the indefinite detention of foreigners.<br /><br />The law lords, making the ruling in the chamber of the House of Lords, described the legislation as &ldquo;draconian&rdquo; and &ldquo;anathema&rdquo; to the rule of law.</blockquote>OK, OK, my slur on our Supreme Court is ever so slightly  unfair, as the US case with the most closely related fact pattern, the Padilla case, was turned down on procedural grounds.  (Both cases involve domestic detention of a suspect arrested domestically; the cases differ slightly, however, in that Padilla was a US citizen while the persons in the UK case are foreign nationals, albeit presumably legally admitted to the UK.)  Read between the lines of Padilla and the other detention cases and you could get to a point where we end up a bit like the UK but my point is that this requires some squinting <em>and meanwhile <a href="http://www.abcnews4.com/news/stories/1104/189810.html">Padilla is still in jail</a> without charges or prospect of trial</em> or indeed any idea of when he might get out.<br /><br />Note also that in the US the Bush administration has implemented indefinite no-trial detention without a shred of statutory justification.  Conversely, in the UK the detentions were not by executive fiat, but pursuant to an act of Parliament.  Nevertheless, the Law Lords &mdash; who once proclaimed Parliamentary supremacy, but now have new powers under the European Convention and the UK&#39;s Human Rights Act, &mdash;have struck down indefinite detention in no uncertain terms, and by an 8-1 vote, as barbaric and uncivilized.<br /><br />History will be cruel to this administration, which is indeed barbaric and uncivilized.  Squandering the US&#39;s moral capital while looting the Treasury for the rich and debasing our currency is an historic achievement, but not one that one wishes to live through; it seems likely that  the aftermath will be substantially worse.&quot; [December 16, 2004; <a href="http://www.discourse.net">Discourse.net</a> has the <a href="http://www.discourse.net/archives/2004/12/uks_house_of_lords_holds_that_indefinite_detention_violates_european_convention_on_human_rights.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/faculty/facultyprofiles/berman.html">Doug Berman</a>, Moritz College of Law, Ohio State University:<br /><br />&quot;The ruling by the Kansas Supreme Court yesterday in <em>Marsh</em> declaring the state&#39;s death penalty procedures unconstitutional (<a href="http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy/2004/12/the_death_penal_1.html">basics here</a>) is yet another piece of evidence suggesting that the death penalty is now dying a slow death in the US.<br /><br />(For more on the <em>Marsh</em> ruling, here are articles from the <em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/18/national/18death.html?oref=login">New York Times</a></em> and the <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/news/nation/10444309.htm"><em>Kansas City Star</em></a><em> </em>and the <em><a href="http://www.ljworld.com/section/citynews/story/190767">Lawrence World-Journal</a></em>.&nbsp; The <em>KC Star</em> article details that the state plans to appeal the <em>Marsh</em> ruling to the US Supreme Court, and the <em>World-Journal</em> piece details the crimes of the six men on Kansas&#39; death row.&nbsp; For more on the decline of death, consider the recent posts <a href="http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy/2004/12/more_on_the_dec.html">here</a> and <a href="http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy/2004/12/death_is_defini.html">here</a>.)<br /><br />It is fascinating that the <em>Marsh</em> ruling in Kansas comes only months after New York&#39;s highest court found unconstitutional that state&#39;s death penalty procedures in <em>People v. LaValle</em> (<a href="http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy/2004/06/new_yorks_death.html">discussed here</a>).&nbsp; Kansas and New York in the mid 1990s , after long periods without capital punishment, both enacted new death penalty laws.&nbsp; But now, a decade later, both states have had their capital sentencing procedures declared unconstitutional. <br /><br />Notably, not a single person has been executed in either Kansas or New York, although a handful of defendants had been sent to each state&#39;s death row.&nbsp; And, as detailed in <a href="http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy/2004/11/the_noticenbsp_.html">a New York estimate</a> and <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?scid=7&did=918.">a Kansas study</a>, both states have spent an enormous amount of money administering the death penalty.&nbsp; These realities lead me to continue to wonder when fiscal conservatives will start speaking out vocally against the death penalty as a bad investment of limited state resources.&quot; [December 18, 2004; <a href="http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy">Sentencing Law &amp; Policy</a> has the <a href="http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy/2004/12/a_sign_of_the_c.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Podgor [Georgia State]: Former Connecticut Governor Pleads Guilty</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://law.gsu.edu/directory/view.php?id=42&version=html">Ellen Podgor</a>, Georgia State University College of Law:<br /><br />&quot;<a href="http://ap.tbo.com/ap/breaking/MGB3Z6K533E.html">AP wires</a> report that Former Governor Rowland of Connecticut pled guilty to one count of conspiracy with the specific offense being a deprivation of honest services. The AP story notes that &quot;[t]he plea deal ends the two-year-long investigation into corruption in the administration of Rowland, who resigned July 1 after 9 1/2 years in office.&quot; According to the AP wire, prosecutors told the judge, &quot;that Rowland accepted $107,000 worth of vacations, work on his cottage and free flights from state contractors and others.&quot;<br /><br />Rowland will likely face jail time, fines and a payment to the IRS. Although it is uncertain what sentence John Rowland will receive, and whether the sentencing guidelines of &quot;15 to 21 months in prison,&quot; as stated by the AP story, will be controlling, it appears that this matter is over for the former governor.<br /><br />Despite the fact that Rowland may soon be facing fines and jail time, this plea may be somewhat of a holiday present for the former governor. After being investigated for two years, finality to this process may offer a certain relief, even when jail time may be in his future. In some cases the jail time is not as difficult as the publicity and stigma that surrounds white collar offenders during an investigation. This is especially true when the investigation lasts for several years.&quot; [December 23, <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog">White Collar Crime Prof</a> has the <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/2004/12/former_connecti.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anna Ryzhova, Kyiv:<br /><br />&quot;Today, at noon under the EST time, Ukraine will be watching the nationally televised debate between Presidential candidates Victor Yushchenko and Victor Yanukovych. The debate this time is expected to be different from the previous one. A new format will allow for one-on-one Q&amp;A and discussions between the two candidates. The revote will be held on December 26 that is in a week from now. After the revolutionary events throughout Ukraine, it seems that everybody in Ukraine has already made his or her choice among the two candidates. But still I expect this debate to have an impact on the electorate.&quot; [December 20, 2004 - special to JURIST; Anna Ryzhova is an Associate in the Kyiv office of Chadbourne &amp; Parke LLP]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Froomkin [Miami]: CIA Has Secret Prison at Guantanamo</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.tm/">Michael Froomkin</a>, University of Miami School of Law:<br /><br />&quot;<a title="At Guantanamo, a Prison Within a Prison (washingtonpost.com)" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A5918-2004Dec16.html">At Guantanamo, a Prison Within a Prison</a>:<blockquote> Within the heavily guarded perimeters of the Defense Department&#39;s much-discussed Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba, the <span class="caps"><acronym title="Central Intelligence Agency">CIA</acronym> </span>has maintained a detention facility for valuable al Qaeda captives that has never been mentioned in public, according to military officials and several current and former intelligence officers.</blockquote>But to the military&#39;s credit, they required the <span class="caps"><acronym title="Central Intelligence Agency">CIA</acronym> </span>to follow some of the most basic treaty obligations:<blockquote>The <span class="caps">U.S. </span>base at Guantanamo Bay thus provided the <span class="caps"><acronym title="Central Intelligence Agency">CIA</acronym> </span>with an isolated venue devoid of the sensitive international politics. But it came with strings attached.<br /><br />The <span class="caps">U.S. </span>military, which controls the base, required the agency to register all detainees, abide by military detention standards and permit the <span class="caps">ICRC </span>some level of access.<br /><br />&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to be in my back yard, you&rsquo;re going to have to abide by my rules&rdquo; is how one defense official explained it.</blockquote>Normally, as I&rsquo;ve noted before, the evidence is that the <span class="caps"><acronym title="Central Intelligence Agency">CIA</acronym> </span>doesn&rsquo;t bother with the Geneva conventions, and indulges in &ldquo;ghost detainees&rdquo; and who knows what sort of physical and psychological pressure:<blockquote><span class="caps"><acronym title="Central Intelligence Agency">CIA</acronym> </span>detainees, by contrast, are held under separate rules and far greater secrecy. Under a presidential directive and authorities approved by administration lawyers, the <span class="caps"><acronym title="Central Intelligence Agency">CIA</acronym> </span>is allowed to capture and hold certain classes of suspects without accounting for them in any public way and without revealing the rules for their treatment.</blockquote>You still have to wonder why exactly the <span class="caps"><acronym title="Central Intelligence Agency">CIA</acronym> </span>couldn&rsquo;t just lock these guys up at Langley?  Is there any risk at all that they could get to a lawyer, or that if it did it would do them any good?  Why <em>does</em> the <span class="caps"><acronym title="Central Intelligence Agency">CIA</acronym> </span>have to hold these guys abroad?  Can there be <em>any</em> legitimate reason other than the desire to do things that our law would not allow?  And if that is the reason, then I firmly believe it is an illegal motive.  Our federal government is created by the Constitution.  It has only those powers the constitution grants it.  The power to act lawlessly abroad is not one of those powers.  The Constitution constrains the <span class="caps"><acronym title="Central Intelligence Agency">CIA</acronym> </span>abroad just as it does domestically; if it&rsquo;s wrong for our agents to torture people here, it&rsquo;s equally wrong anywhere.  And remember, they are formally our agents, We the People are formally their masters; what they do, my fellow citizens, they do in our names, more&rsquo;s the pity.&quot; [December 17, 2004; <a href="http://www.discourse.net">Discourse.net</a> has the <a href="http://www.discourse.net/archives/2004/12/cia_has_secret_prison_at_guantnamo.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Tokaji [Ohio State]: Puerto Rico&#039;s Gubernatorial Election in the Courts</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/faculty/facultyprofiles/tokaji.html">Dan Tokaji</a>, Moritz College of Law, Ohio State University:<br /><br />&quot;Think old-fashioned paper ballots guarantee election integrity? Think again.<br /><br />In a fascinating case coming out of Puerto Rico, the First Circuit Court of Appeals heard argument Monday over which ballots should be counted in the race between Anibal Acevedo Vila, who narrowly defeated Pedro Rossello, the former governor and pro-statehood candidate, by 3,880 votes. Still in dispute are some 28,000 disputed ballots, cast using Puerto Rico&#39;s &quot;outdated paper balloting system, in which voters simply mark an X in pencil next to the preferred candidate for governor and nonvoting member of Congress.&quot; The disputed ballots are ones that showed a vote for both Mr. Vila and a small third party that supports Puerto Rican independence. Mr. Vila says those votes were properly counted as votes for him; Mr. Rossello says they shouldn&#39;t have been. A Puerto Rico court has said the disputed ballots should be counted, but a U.S. district judge has ruled otherwise.<br /><br />Former Solicitor General Ted Olson, who famously represented George W. Bush in <em>Bush v. Gore</em>, is representing Mr. Rossello -- and is claiming that the decision belongs with a federal judge, who said the ballots shouldn&#39;t be counted. According to Olson, counting the disputed ballots would give more weight to some votes than others. (Well, it worked once before, I guess.) On the other hand, Mr. Vila&#39;s lawyer Charles Cooper and the Puerto Rico Election Commission&#39;s lawyer Prof. Rick Pildes (whose name the NYT misspells) argue that the decision belongs in Puerto Rico&#39;s courts and should be decided under its election laws.&quot; [December 14, 2004; <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/blogs/tokaji">Equal Vote</a> has the <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/blogs/tokaji/2004/12/puerto-ricos-gubenatorial-election-in.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

Over Evolution... The state American Civil Liberties Union plans to file a federal lawsuit Tuesday against a Pennsylvania school district that is requiring students to learn about alternatives to the theory of evolution. The ACLU said its lawsuit will be the first to challenge whether public schools should teach &quot;intelligent design,&quot; which holds that the universe is so complex that it must have been created by some higher power.....&quot; [<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,141431,00.html">continuation</a>].<br /><br />Amazing.  This is not a Scopes-type case, where the government prosecutes a teacher who taught a disfavored theory.  Here, the government itself (the school board) is coming to the aid of a disfavored theory, and in so doing, is in effect broadening the intellectual options presented to students. The ACLU is suing to <span style="font-weight:bold;">prevent</span> this. When the subject at hand is that of human origins, the ACLU&#39;s take is that the First Amendment <span style="font-weight:bold;">requires suppression</span> of competing theories.  It&#39;s trying to do exactly what Justice Douglas, reinventing <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=268&invol=510">Pierce</a> in his <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=381&invol=479">Griswold</a> opinion, called &quot;contract[ing] the spectrum of available knowledge.&quot; [December 14, 2004; <a href="http://ninomania.blogspot.com">Ninomania</a> has the full <a href="http://ninomania.blogspot.com/2004_12_12_ninomania_archive.html#110305242824285426">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>
