It was held in the cities of Delhi, Kolkata (Calcutta), Chennai and Bhubaneswar. I hadn&#39;t been in Delhi for the first parade, and so I followed coverage of the event on TV and in newspapers. I remember being very proud that finally, the parade&#39;s organizers and supporters had finally forced India &#8212; the world&#39;s largest democracy and second most populous nation &#8212; to publicly acknowledge its gay and lesbian citizens. I was also very surprised. I could not believe that things had changed so much in the six years I had been away from home, so that such an event could even be organized and held.<br /><br />In 2008, I had spoken to friends in India who were planning to attend the first parade, and I had the sense that they were enthusiastic and optimistic but also apprehensive about the event. They mentioned rumors that the parade would be sabotaged or not held at all. However, the event took place without incident, and attracted over 1200 people - nearly four times the expected turnout.  I wanted to do my part as well, despite living in the city of New York at the time, so I took the train to Christopher Street in Greenwich Village. Spontaneous demonstrations had broken out there at the Stonewall Inn 39 years before, in response to discrimination against sexual minorities. Every year since, gay pride parades have been held across the world to commemorate this day. At the bar of this historic inn, I raised a toast to the first Indian Gay Pride Parade.<br /><br />One year later, I was thrilled to be home in Delhi for the second parade. This year, the marchers&#39; agenda included a specific issue &#8212; the repeal of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The British colonial government had introduced this statute in 1860 and it had remained in effect, virtually unaltered, for nearly 150 years. It read,<blockquote>Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature, with any man, woman or animal shall be punishable with imprisonment for life or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years and shall also be liable to fine.</blockquote>In effect, the Section criminalized all non-reproductive penetrative sexual activity. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/3667568633_223825b91f_o-764608.jpg"><img style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 226px; height: 320px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/3667568633_223825b91f_o-764145.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>While convictions under Section 377 of the IPC have been extremely rare, it has been used extensively to target sexual minorities, sex workers and HIV/AIDS prevention efforts. A young gay couple I met this summer told me that fear of harassment under Section 377 led them to maintain a strict heterosexual facade in their affluent suburban New Delhi home. &quot;Coming out&quot; would jeopardize their employment and social standing. As a gay couple, no one would rent them a house, but as two straight friends trying to rent a two-bedroom apartment, they faced no difficulties. The couple participated in the 2008 parade, but had attempted to maintain anonymity by using aliases and feather masks. Nonetheless, they scanned newspapers the next day, worried that someone would recognize them in a crowd photograph.<br /><br />In recent years, the campaign to repeal Section 377 has gained marked support from the educated urban section of the society, despite fears of reprisal. This year&#39;s parade was held days before the Delhi High Court&#39;s ruling on the legality of Section 377, and the opposing parties in the matter were clearly delineated. On one side was Voices Against 377, a coalition of non-governmental organizations, with Naz Foundation, a non-profit working with populations affected with HIV/AIDS, at its forefront. On the other side were religious and conservative political organizations. There was disagreement within the government, as well. The Home Ministry was concerned that that the section&#39;s repeal would &quot;open the floodgates of delinquent behavior&quot; whereas the Health Ministry supported the decision on the basis that it would help in the struggle against HIV/AIDS.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/3667589121_01ec4609c4_o-707183.jpg"><img style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 213px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/3667589121_01ec4609c4_o-706640.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>The march began in the heart of New Delhi &#8212; ironically &#8212; amidst buildings erected by the British colonial government that had also written Section 377, and continued along the route I had taken for over fifteen years to school. Early into the march, it was evident that there were far more participants than the year before. The atmosphere was colorful and festive. Demonstrators held up banners reading &quot;377 Quit India,&quot; reminiscent of the Indian freedom struggle a century ago, when Indians held banners urging the British to &quot;Quit India.&quot; Marchers wore flamboyant costumes in all colors of the rainbow and elaborately feathered masks. Foreign media had a strong presence at the march and journalists stopped marchers for quotes and interviews. While the overall mood was upbeat, the masks served as a reminder that the Delhi High Court had yet to make a decision.  The need for caution was evident, since, after all, Section 377 was still in force. In a strict legal sense, many of the participants in the march were criminals. The organization of the parade was a first material step in the campaign for equality. The repeal of Section 377 would hopefully be the next step.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/3668319654_4bf05f667d_o-787136.jpg"><img style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 213px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/3668319654_4bf05f667d_o-786686.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>I believe that the problem of discrimination against same-sex couples has its origins in modern Indian perceptions of sexuality. India is largely unused to expressions of alternate sexuality in mainstream media and everyday life. Even if homosexuality were to be decriminalized, it would be difficult to shed the stigma attached to the lifestyle. This was a sobering thought, and was reflected in the nature of the parade. The event&#39;s focus was not as much on revelry, as on the communication of a political point. Despite the flamboyant costumes, rainbow clothing and elaborate make-up, many of the participants sought to protect their anonymity, visibly flinching as camera flashes went off. Quotes offered to the media were mostly anonymous because of family and social pressures to stay &quot;in the closet.&quot;<br /><br />The Delhi High Court repealed Section 377 three days after the parade. As expected, the decision received a mixed response. While supporters were relieved that Section 377 was no longer in force, gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered sections of society still face significant discrimination. Opponents of the decision called the move an &quot;abomination&quot; and intend to move the Supreme Court to overturn the repeal of Section 377. For now, the Section can no longer provide legal basis for discrimi
nation against the gay and lesbian section of society. However, the gap between the law and practice needs to be bridged. While it might be naive to expect a miraculous turnaround in attitudes towards gay and lesbian issues, the repeal is undoubtedly a positive move. Perhaps next year, there will be fewer masks and aliases at the Third Annual Gay Pride Parade.<br /><br /><font size="2">Photo credits: Mayank Austen Soofi</font><br />

		<title>Christmas Day bomber prompts unwise call for Guantanamo-style policies in US</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.utahcitizenscounsel.org/?page_id=79">David R. Irvine</a> and <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/detail.asp?id=23">Virginia E. Sloan</a> [<a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/">Constitution Project</a>]: &quot;In the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/not-guilty-plea-entered-in-attempted.php">aftermath</a> of the attempted Christmas Day bombing, some want to shift the discussion from the best way to close Guantanamo - an objective first announced by President Bush - to instituting Guantanamo-like policies in the United States.  Critics of the Obama administration&#39;s decision to try the alleged bomber, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, in federal court have gone so far as to suggest that he be designated an &quot;enemy combatant,&quot; transferred to military custody for interrogation, denied access to counsel and tried by a military commission even though he was captured in the United States.  The policies employed at Guantanamo have resulted in protracted litigation and delayed justice, weakened our alliances, and undermined constitutional principles at home, and for these reasons such policies must not be transferred to the US.  They must end.<br /> <br />Our Constitution provides a just and effective process for prosecuting and detaining terrorism suspects, both pre- and post-trial.  Trials of terrorism suspects like Abdulmutallab in traditional federal courts are not only consistent with the Constitution and our American values, but are also far more effective in achieving justice for all concerned than are their flawed counterparts, the military commissions.  In fact, the commissions have only handed down three low-level terrorist convictions compared to the nearly 200 terror-related convictions obtained through our traditional federal court system over the past nine years.<br /> <br />The ineffectiveness of the military commissions process is further demonstrated by the fact that they have been subject to extensive and costly litigation.  In fact, the Supreme Court struck down the original, post-9/11 military commissions for failure to follow basic principles of constitutional and international law. Challenges to the commissions have delayed justice for the thousands of Americans who were affected by the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the continued use of military commissions will ensure endless litigation and further delays.<br /> <br />Critics of the decision to try Abdulmutallab in federal court imply that by transferring him to military custody, alternative methods of interrogation (read &quot;mistreatment&quot; here) could be used to extract information from him.  These implications insult the men and women serving and defending our country, who know that torture and inhumane treatment are both illegal and ineffective.  Critics further suggest that because Abdulmutallab was given an attorney, law enforcement officials can obtain no further information from him.  These claims are not only disturbing, but faulty.  By all reports, Abdulmutallab cooperated with authorities when he was arrested, and continues to provide them with valuable information.  Law enforcement authorities appear confident that they will continue to learn useful information from him as the criminal justice process unfolds.<br /> <br />Trying terrorism suspects in our federal courts and detaining them in our traditional criminal justice system does not require a choice between national security and our fundamental values as Americans. The proper approach to closing Guantanamo and dealing with terrorism suspects is not a partisan issue. This is demonstrated by the fact that a <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/manage/file/348.pdf">bipartisan coalition</a> [PDF file] of nearly 140 former diplomats, military officials, federal judges and prosecutors, and members of Congress, as well as bar leaders, national security and foreign policy experts, and family members of victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks have come together to issue <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/manage/file/347.pdf">Beyond Guantanamo: A Bipartisan Declaration</a> [PDF file]. In the <span style="font-style:italic;">Declaration</span> this group of unlikely allies supports trying terrorism suspects in regular federal courts, rather than by military commission, and opposes indefinite detention without charge. These principles recognize and affirm that we can keep our country safe while still adhering to the rule of law and the values that are embodied in our Constitution and that have stood the test of time for over 200 years.<br /> <br />Those who are in favor of instituting Guantanamo-like policies in the United States propose a troubling departure from the values that define America and make America exceptional. It is time to recognize that the Guantanamo system of detaining and trying terrorist suspects has failed us.  Implementing those policies in the United States would neither change this fact nor keep us safe.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">David R. Irvine is a Brigadier General (Ret.) in the U.S. Army.  He is also a Former Commander of the 96th Regional Readiness Command and a former faculty member of the Sixth U.S. Army Intelligence School.

		<title>Prison term for Taiwan&#039;s ex-president highlights need for accountability reforms</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://politics.soc.ntu.edu.tw/old/en/faculty.php"><strong>Thomas Ching-peng Peng</strong></a> [Associate Professor, Department of Political Science, <a href="http://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/">National Taiwan University</a>]: &quot;On September 11, 2009, Taiwan&#39;s ex-President Chen Shui-bian was <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/taiwan-ex-president-chen-indicted-for.php">sentenced</a> to life in prison and fined NT $200 million on charges of embezzlement, taking bribes, and money laundering, involving a total of NT $490 million (US $15 million) while in office from 2000-2008. The implications of Chen&#39;s indictment on the current Taiwanese administration include the following aspects:<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">The inadequacy of the accountability mechanisms is clearly exposed</span><br /><br />Due to the imbalance of institutional power and accountability mechanisms in the constitution, Chen&#39;s corruption went through a long period without proper checking. According to the constitution, the President is popularly elected and appoints a premier to handle the executive branch except for military and diplomatic affairs, which are totally entrusted to the President.  The President does not need to answer to Congress and may merely deliver an annual state of the nation address to the Congress. However, if the President exercises implied and extended power to play illegal money games, the institutional mechanism of holding him accountable is relatively weak, if it exists at all. Unless the President is recalled or impeached on the ground of treason or rebellion, he is exempted from penal charges. Chen&#39;s relentless corruption evidenced the weakness of this constitutional design.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">The unrestrained power of the presidential appointment needs to be changed</span><br /><br />Since the President can unilaterally appoint the Premier without the consent of the Congress, even to the extent that he may act against the majority of the Congress as Chen did, he has significant power to determine political and civil service appointments. The fact that an intelligence chief withheld Chen&#39;s money laundering information, escaping the supervision of his Minister and the Premier, is an example of the influence the presidential appointment power can have in governmental operations. Similarly, the integrity of the controversial Attorney General in handling Chen&#39;s prosecution case is widely questioned because of the fact that he was previously nominated by ex-President Chen.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">The legal framework for political donations must be improved</span><br /><br />A Political Donations Act was passed on March 31, 2004. Before this, there were no legal restrictions on political donations in Taiwan. Even with the Political Donations Act in place, Chen repeatedly argued that the money his family received was income from political donations rather than bribery. Although the Political Donations Act was overhauled in 2009, the grey area of political donation remains a great issue in public administration since the Act regulates political donations to candidates only during certain months before election.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">The accounting procedure for discretionary expenses of public officials must be strictly enforced</span><br /><br />In the past, in order to pay for the social functions of public officials, there was an administrative custom that Taiwanese administrators at all government levels could use a certain amount of discretionary funds with and without receipts. The legal rule on the discretionary expenses requiring receipts was not strictly followed. Chen&#39;s family used the State Affairs Fund for household items and even collected receipts from their friends to claim the expenses. The indictment of Chen&#39;s forgery crime on the State Affairs Fund will undoubtedly change the age-old administrative custom and lead to legal enforcement of discretionary expenses. &quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.upiasia.com/columnist/Danilo_Reyes/">Danilo Reyes </a>[Staff member, <a href="http://www.ahrchk.net/index.php">Asian Human Rights Commission</a>]: &quot;The declaration of Proclamation 1959, placing a large part of Maguindanao province, in the southern Philippines, under a state of martial law was devoid of a constitutional basis. Thus, legal action <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/philippines-prosecutors-begin-rebellion.php">taken</a> against those accused of being involved in rebellion - those charged for the Maguindanao massacre, and evidence taken for its prosecution during the period of martial law, are legally and procedurally flawed, which calls the case itself into question.<br /><br />First, there is legal ambiguity concerning the crime of rebellion. For example, in  the case involving  the &quot;<a href="http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/regions/view/20071105-98913/%91Release_us%2C_too%2C%92_say_Tagaytay_5">Tagaytay Five</a>,&quot; the Regional Trial Court (RTC) in Tagaytay City ruled, in August 2008, that the prosecutors failed to prove that the crime of rebellion they were accused with existed at all or had been committed, resulting in their case being dismissed and their release from jail.<br /><br />The court held that: &quot;by its nature, rebellion is a crime of the masses or multitudes involving crowd actions done in furtherance of a political end.&quot; In order for the crime to legally exist &quot;both the purpose and overt acts are essential components of [the] one crime, without either of them the crime legally does not exist.&quot;<br /><br />The act of taking up arms and the presence of &quot;heavily armed groups&quot; in order &quot;to resist government troops&quot; from affecting arrests or conducting searches - the arguments used as the justification by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in declaring martial law - did not meet the fundamental elements that constitute the crime of rebellion.  So, legally, the crime never occurred and prosecution in court is inappropriate.<br /><br />The Ampatuans, a political clan accused of involvement in the November 23, 2009 Maguindanao massacre, were not taking up arms to grab power from the government. They, and their hundreds of supporters, are the people in power. The crime of rebellion was concocted by the government to justify the constitutionality of martial rule.<br /><br />Grabbing power from the government was not the Ampatuan&#39;s political end, nor was it the purpose of their heavily armed supporters. They are, as shown by their overt acts, either resisting arrest or obstructing the security forces from arresting and conducting searches as part of a police investigation.  This is thus a purely criminal matter that should be dealt with accordingly by the a police.<br /><br />Thus, the prosecution of the accused in the rebellion case was instead a political move by the Department of Justice, one of the agencies that openly defended martial law, to justify Proclamation 1959.  This was never truly about prosecution of the crime of rebellion or for violations of the law of the land. For the Department of Justice, whose head is an appointee of the President and under her oversight, to take these actions, is not surprising.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=384&key=195&parent=19&report=79">Sarah Cook</a> [Asia Research Analyst and Assistant Editor, <a href="http://www.freedomhouse.org">Freedom House</a>]: &quot;When Chinese democracy activist and author Liu Xiaobo was <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/china-rights-activist-sentenced-to-11.php">sentenced</a> to 11 years in prison last week, many around the world appeared stunned by the length of his sentence and absence of due process rights. Such harsh punishment for offering rational, constructive criticism of the government seems more compatible with Soviet times or Burma&#39;s ruling junta than the modernized economic world power that China has become.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Liu&#39;s sentencing - in all its injustice and absurdity - is symptomatic of more systemic problems and politicization of the Chinese legal system, particularly in so-called &quot;sensitive&quot; cases. Moreover, in the past two years, signs have emerged that the situation may be getting worse, not better.<br /><br />Over the past three decades, the Chinese legal system has been built from scratch &#8212; thousands of laws have been passed, judges trained, and state-of-the art courthouses built. Under this external facade of modernity, however, lies a system that still falls far short of the rule of law.<br /><br />The Chinese Communist Party exercises significant influence over the judicial system via its political-legal committees and power to appoint judges, most of whom are party members and subject to its disciplinary procedures. Whether because of direct orders from the local party committee or fear of reprisals from other state actors, judges&#39; autonomy to decide cases based on the law and evidence remains circumscribed.<br /><br />In recent years, greater space has been granted in commercial cases, disputes between private individuals, and some administrative decisions. Nevertheless, judicial independence remains dramatically curtailed in socio-economic and politically sensitive cases, where lawsuits may be automatically rejected and verdicts are routinely predetermined. Hence the need for no more than a few minutes or hours per trial.<br /><br />Beyond direct political intervention, multiple other factors may take precedence over the law in judicial decision-making. Corruption remains widespread. In a dynamic that can sway justice in favor of ordinary citizens, public opinion and attention via the internet have also been shown to impact judicial considerations.<br /><br />Whether this more populist form of justice indicates a move towards the rule of law is debatable, however. As rights attorney Gao Zhisheng reflects in his memoir, &quot;The decisions in favor of these children [in medical malpractice suits] were usually made because of public support and pressure from the media, rather than out of the judges&#39; genuine concern for the children&#39;s rights under the law. As for the law, it has not demonstrated the capacity to play a role on its own.&quot;<br /><br />As citizens&#39; awareness of their legally enshrined rights has grown and attorneys like Gao have prompted officials to follow the laws they themselves passed, Party leaders have become nervous. After a decade of emphasizing professionalism and limited judicial autonomy, since 2007, their attitude towards the judiciary has reverted in a more unabashedly political direction. In March 2008, a party veteran with no formal legal training was appointed as chief justice.<br /><br />Soon after, he issued a new doctrine termed the Three Supremes: Supremacy of the Cause of the Party, Supremacy of the Interests of the People, and Supremacy of the Constitution and Law, in that order of importance. Over the past year, judges throughout the country have been forced to spend hours studying these directives. Although some judges and legal scholars have been struggling to prevent this from reversing the modest improvements of recent years, for the moment, the hardliners seem to be gaining ground.<br /><br />One way this has manifested has been harsher than usual punishments for citizens seeking to exercise their freedoms of expression, association, and religious belief. The year 2009 saw several &quot;firsts&quot; in this regard. The first Tibetan executed since 2003. The first lawyer sentenced to seven years in prison for defending his clients&#39; rights. The first activist sentenced to prison for publishing information critical of the government&#39;s response to the Sichuan earthquake.<br /><br />Sentences for prisoners of conscience in China are already notoriously long - a recent Freedom House study of internet freedom in 15 countries found that &quot;prison sentences for online violations in China tend to be longer than elsewhere, with a typical minimum of three years and maximums as high as ten, while in other countries most sentences range from six months to four years.&quot;<br /><br />Nonetheless, anecdotal evidence indicates they may be getting longer. In September, a Hunan court sentenced a democracy activist to 13 years for organizing a political party. In March, a retired physics professor from Shandong who had previously spent three years in an labor camp for practicing Falun Gong was this time sentenced to seven in prison. A 7-year sentence imposed on a house church leader last month was reportedly the longest meted out since 2004.<br /><br />These are a small sampling of the overall population of prisoners of conscience. In October, the US Congressional-Executive Commission on China published a partial list of political prisoners containing over 1,200 names. Beyond the prison system, tens of thousands of people are estimated detained extra-judicially in &quot;re-education through labor&quot; camps, &quot;black jails,&quot; and psychiatric hospitals for their political or religious views.&quot;<br />

		<title>Lifting HIV travel ban marks end to era of American discrimination</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.immigrationequality.org/template.php?pageid=12"><strong>Victoria Neilson</strong></a> [Legal Director, <a href="http://www.immigrationequality.org">Immigration Equality</a>]: &quot;On Monday, with relatively little fanfare, the US <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-hivaids-travel-ban-lifted.php">closed</a> a chapter on an era of discrimination and intolerance.  Since 1987, any non-citizen seeking to enter the US was prohibited from doing so if he or she was HIV-positive, unless he or she met the narrow qualifications for a waiver. Likewise, all applicants for lawful permanent residence were required to undergo an HIV test, and if the result was positive, could not move forward with the application without a waiver.  Only those applicants with close American relatives were even eligible to submit a waiver.                              <br /><br />When President Clinton attempted to lift the HIV travel and immigration ban in 1993, Congress reacted by enshrining the HIV exclusion in the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.f6da51a2342135be7e9d7a10e0dc91a0/?vgnextoid=fa7e539dc4bed010VgnVCM1000000ecd190aRCRD&vgnextchannel=fa7e539dc4bed010VgnVCM1000000ecd190aRCRD&CH=act">Immigration and Nationality Act</a>.  That the ban was the result of homophobia and hate is beyond dispute.  As Senator Jesse Helms stated at the time, &quot;I had reached the conclusion that every possible concession had already been made to the AIDS lobby and to the homosexual rights movement which feeds it.  But the Clinton administration&#39;s kowtowing to this arrogant and repugnant political group is beyond belief.&quot; 139 CONG. REC. S1697-02, S1721 (daily ed. Feb. 17, 1993).<br /> <br />For more than two decades, this needless ban has kept families apart, prevented students and skilled workers from bringing their talent to the US, and scared undocumented people with HIV away from testing and treatment.  Equally important, the ban has damaged the international reputation of the United States as a world leader in HIV/AIDS education and treatment.  For two decades, the US has been unable to host a major AIDS conference.  Finally, with the end of the ban, the 2012 conference will occur on US soil.<br /> <br />Being an immigration lawyer, by definition, means facing daily frustrations as we must explain to clients why there are simply no options under existing law.  In my fifteen years of practice, yesterday will certainly rank as one of the happiest days.  Hearing from people who have been waiting years to visit the US or to apply for permanent residence here and, finally, being able to tell them that their HIV status is no longer relevant to their application has been truly incredible.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.campusprogress.org/events/3770/lyric-thompson"><strong>Lyric Thompson </strong></a> [Policy Analyst, <a href="http://www.womenforwomen.org">Women for Women International</a>]: &quot;Last week Sudan celebrated an ironic anniversary. In name only, it was the fifth anniversary of peace - specifically, the comprehensive peace agreement (CPA), the official armistice signed to end one of Africa&#39;s longest-running civil wars in 2005.  The CPA was supposed to signal the end of a war that is estimated to have displaced 4 million and claimed the lives of over 2 million, infamous for a brutal campaign of rape.  Yet residents of Africa&#39;s largest country know today&#39;s Sudan is far from peaceful. &quot;After the CPA we celebrated; we thought it was over,&quot; says Karak Mayik, country director for the humanitarian and development aid organization Women for Women International, &quot;but every year since, the violence has been rising.  Things are not fine in Sudan.&quot;  <br /><br />US Secretary of State Clinton echoed Mayik&#39;s concerns in her remarks on the anniversary, stating that, &quot;[v]iolence in the South is rising and tensions continue in border areas,&quot; estimating that 2,500 people had died and 350,000 been displaced in 2009 alone.  Meanwhile, a senior adviser to President Omar al-Bashir sounded an ominous prediction, proclaiming war would be the result of next year&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/sudan-lawmakers-adopt-law-on-referendum.php">referendum</a> that may well end in Southern secession.<br /><br />In addition to outright violence, today&#39;s Sudan is also plagued by food insecurity, with more than 6 million people dependent on food aid.  And President Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity, a development that was greeted with the government&#39;s expulsion of 13 major aid groups providing critical assistance to the many hungry and displaced Sudanese. <br /><br />From where Mayik sits as a Sudanese woman, war survivor and humanitarian in Southern Sudan, the next year is a critical one for her country, especially for women and children.  She spent years in a Khartoum-based camp for people displaced by the war and now risks her life daily to equip women with valuable rights training and economic opportunities that will enable them and their families to rebuild. She recalls one instance last year when violent tribal clashes erupted near Women for Women International&#39;s offices. The violence threatened the lives of many, and displaced thousands of women and children, who found themselves without food, shelter and water. Mayik&#39;s staff put together the few resources they had to buy food, blankets and clothes for hundreds of displaced people stranded on Women for Women International farmland.  The governor of Lakes State, South Sudan, recently gave her the title of &quot;Commander of Nonviolent Forces&quot; for her efforts. Even against a backdrop of violence and instability, these women were building bridges of peace and security.<br /><br />So what is the American plan for Sudan? How will America work to quell the fighting and empower the grassroots movement for peace that Commander Karak and her colleagues are waging? Thankfully, President Obama has pledged to &quot;confront the serious and urgent situation in Sudan.&quot; Last year, the Obama Administration released a carrot-and-stick strategy for the country that critically focuses equally on the obstacles to peace in the West and in the South, prioritizing both the crisis in Darfur as well as the implementation of the CPA.  According to Mayik, US efforts should further focus on the main challenges impeding peace, including critical development issues such as land administration, water availability, oil sharing and lack of infrastructure. If unresolved these issues threaten to compromise the country&#39;s coming referendum, which we continue to hear may provoke another war.<br /> <br />There is increasing discussion on these points. Yet there is one tremendous gap in the policy discussion that has yet to be addressed: gender. From the unveiling of last year&#39;s Sudan strategy to last week&#39;s anniversary remarks, a gender agenda for peace in Sudan is absent.  In a country where the violence of war has been profoundly gendered and a majority of the population engaged in civil society efforts to rebuild is female, this seems shortsighted. <br /><br />This is nothing new, although it is something of a surprise in an administration that has from the beginning established gender as one of its key priorities, from the establishment of the White House Council on Women and Girls to the naming of an Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women&#39;s Issues. The White House must remember that women are more vulnerable to displacement and violence in conflict, and yet have been historically excluded from peace negotiations. From Liberia to Rwanda, women on the continent have demonstrated their vested interest in and powerful action on peace and security.  Yet during the landmark signing of the CPA, Sudanese women were underrepresented and have continued to face social exclusion and some of the worst violence to date after the war. As Washington turns toward Khartoum in the critical year ahead, will the women again be forgotten? <br /><br />It can only be hoped that they will not. There is perhaps no better image of women&#39;s valuable, everyday contributions to peacemaking than the image of Mayik and her staff working to educate, feed, clothe and protect the vulnerable in times of war. This is the everyday work of implementing peace, and in declaring Mayik the &quot;Commander of Non-Violent Forces&quot;  the Governor demonstrates extraordinary recognition of an ordinary truth - women are the architects of peace and are invaluable allies in our attempts at peace-building.  As we look toward next year in Sudan, a year of important elections and what is hoped to be the full implementation of the fragile CPA, we must not forget these strong women, who if engaged, can be the engineers of a true and lasting peace in Sudan. Stronger women do build stronger nations.&quot;<br />

The fanfare is over and world leaders have <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/no-legally-binding-agreement-on-climate.php">little</a> to show for it. President Obama left the conference with hope that the compromise he came to with five other world leaders would be supported by the entire conference. He said that most of the text had been worked out and that he was leaving negotiators empowered to sign off on a &quot;Copenhagen Accord.&quot; Instead the group think was only to &quot;take note&quot; of the accord. The accord was damned as a failure by developing nations, global warming activists, and United Nations officials. In reality, the lack of  enforceable emission reductions likely will result in more meaningful reductions than had such an agreement been put in place, and do more to lift the world&#39;s poor out of abject poverty and despair.<br /><br />So now what? While the UN Secretary General says he is pleased with the results of the conference, the fallout is beginning to be seen. There are reports that the <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/business/copenhagen-fallout-carbon-trade-to-tumble-20091220-l7iu.html">European carbon trade market</a> is taking a hit with prices falling as a result of the conference. And, more ill will has been manufactured toward the US as a result of the conference. Developing nations in particular feel the United States is attempting to prevent their development and that the US is unwilling to do its share, even after decades of direct aid and development and security.<br /><br />Emissions and energy use are linked. In 2008, goods and services produced in the United States represented 30 percent of all of the world&#39;s production as measured by gross domestic product.  In the same year, the US share of global greenhouse gas emissions represented only 19.3 percent.  Richer countries are actually cleaner and healthier countries. It is the <span style="font-style:italic;">affluent</span> society that does not want to be the effluent society.<br /><br />The United States continues a decades-long trend of improving the efficiency in the use of carbon based fuels and resources, as measured by carbon intensity. Carbon intensity is the ratio of greenhouse gas emissions per dollar of gross domestic product, and is a measure of the efficient use of capital, labor, materials and labor. This is the result of entrepreneurial activities and innovative approaches implemented over time, and illustrates that the United States is actually emitting less than our share. At the same time, the EU, which does have enforceable emission standards, has an emissions growth rate three times that of the US (from 1997 through 2006) despite having smaller population and economic growth, Copenhagen was a disappointment in many ways for many people, but the public, both rich and poor, should take a moment to give a little shout of joy that energy and entrepreneurial freedom can continue to provide global health and wealth.&quot;<br />

		<title>Serbia&#039;s genocide suit against Croatia reflects Balkan political realities</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Zarko Markovic</strong> [Researcher, <span style="font-weight:bold;">Belgrade Centre for Human Rights</span>]: &quot;When Croatia filed its genocide suit against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1999, the political implications of that move might have seemed much easier to predict than its legal consequences. With both wartime leaders, Milosevic and Tudjman, still holding their leading positions, political relations between the two countries were strained and almost impossible to worsen or improve. On the other hand, legal implications of the suit were less certain. Almost eleven years later, Serbia filed her <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/serbia-files-genocide-suit-against.php">countersuit</a> despite the fact that both suits have no chance of success, which became clear after the ICJ rendered its judgment in the Bosnian genocide case and since the ICTY, of all the atrocities that took place in the Balkans in the 1990s, has qualified only the Srebrenica massacre in 1995 as genocide. This time, the political implications look uncertain, since relations, which were improving since Tudjman died at the end of 1999 and Milosevic lost the 2000 presidential elections in Serbia (and was surrendered to the ICTY), worsened after Croatia recognized Kosovo.<br /><br />If Croatia could not predict the outcome of the proceedings before the ICJ in 1999, why did Serbia file its countersuit eleven years later, when the outcome is easily predictable? There are two kinds of reasons which may be behind this decision &#8212; political and legal. Serbian authorities probably feel that one part of the public is expecting some kind of reaction, especially since the majority of the population (voters are always in the mind of any politician) thinks that expelling Serbs from Croatia should be punished and also believes that the ICTY has been trying only, or mostly, Serbs. Another political message Serbian authorities are trying to send is that they are ready for and not afraid of the proceedings. Legal reasons may be very practical &#8212; the Serbian legal team wants to secure a more comfortable position (if possible in a case like this) in the courtroom, and this might be possible to achieve if one is not in a defensive position all the time.<br /><br />Nevertheless, there are still some hopes that the dispute could be settled outside the courtroom. Last week, Serbian president Boris Tadic <a href="http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/main/news/24768/?tpl=299&ST1=Text&ST_T1=Article&ST_AS1=1&ST_max=1">said</a>: &quot;We want to believe that it is possible that Croatian and Serbian institutions will sit at the table in the future and try to establish, through a persistent and laborious process, a possible out of court solution that would satisfy the principle of justice and fairness, but also take care of victims.&quot; There is no doubt that the Serbian side is willing to negotiate in order to settle this out of the ICJ. On the other side, there are signs that Croatian authorities may reconsider whether to continue its case as the new Croatian president, professor Ivo Josipovic, said the suit was filed under different circumstances, when Serbia was not trying persecutors of war crimes and was not showing a willingness to face the past. He also <a href="http://internationalpeaceandconflict.ning.com/profiles/blogs/croatians-voted-for-change">said</a>: &quot;I shall negotiate with Belgrade about missing persons, war crimes trials and the return of cultural treasures. If they accept these conditions there is no reason to proceed with the genocide case.&quot; Josipovic, professor of international criminal law at the Zagreb University School of Law, was a member of the team that prepared the submission against Serbia and is certainly aware of its chances of success. Of course, possible withdrawal will depend on the decision of the Prime Minister, Jadranka Kosor, who is also president of the HDZ (the political party founded by former president Tudjman).<br /><br />It appears that both sides feel they do not need this, especially when they are trying to make progress on their way towards the EU (which underlines the importance of regional stability and good relations between the two countries), but they do not know how to get out of this situation without losing electoral support, as both governments have tiny majorities in their parliaments and so must also depend on small parties.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://ilanpappe.com/"><strong>Ilan Pappe</strong></a> [Professor, Department of History, <a href="http://www.exeter.ac.uk/">University of Exeter</a>]: &quot;The building of the separation wall between Israel and the West Bank in 2001 and before that the construction of the fence between the Gaza Strip and Israel in 1994, were claimed by official Israel to be barriers against terrorism. In reality, in the case of the West Bank, they separated Palestinians from Palestinians and barred many of them any access to their schools, fields, businesses and neighbors. In the Gaza strip the fence transformed the Strip into a human mega prison for its million and a half inhabitants. <br /><br />Whereas the sufferings of the Palestinians are very obvious as a result of the fencing of their areas, very few people noticed that the Israelis were also caging themselves. The wall  in the West Bank and the fence in  the Gaza strip were additional fortifications to those already surrounding the state of Israel: the electric fence built in the northern border of Israel and the one that is now being <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/israel-to-build-barrier-along-egypt.php">erected</a> on Israel&#39;s southern border. <br /><br />There is no doubt the Israelis will complete fencing themselves in the south as well. Yes, there are smugglers who have to stopped, but there are other effective means of doing that. There are very few terrorists entering this way and in any case they are outnumbered by asylum seekers from Africa whom the Jewish state would now be able to fend off &#8212; forgetting how it was in the name of refugehood that they won the international legitimacy for Israel&#39;s establishment. <br /><br />The most important long term implication of this move is to enhance the siege mentality of the Israeli Jews as a collective and as individuals. The state since its creation has been a crusade citadel alienated by the area into which it forced itself in the late 19th century and of which it still refuses to be a part. The physical separation  from the rest of the Middle East would not solve the need to find an equitable democratic and humane solution for the conflict between the Palestinians and the Jews in Israel and Palestine, and will only aggravate further the tensions between Israel and the rest of the Arab world; thus undermining the stability of the world at large.&quot;<br />

		<title>New air travel security measures strain foundations of the liberal state</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.gspia.pitt.edu/AboutGSPIA/FacultyDirectory/FacultyDirectory/FacultyDirectoryDetails/tabid/188/smid/803/ArticleID/145/reftab/187/t/Keller-William/Default.aspx"><strong>William W. Keller</strong></a> [Professor, <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/">University of Pittsburgh</a>]: &quot;International travelers are being subjected to higher levels of <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/obama-outlines-measures-taken-following.php">security screening</a> in the wake of last week&#39;s attempt to blow up Northwest Airlines Flight 253.  Uniformed guards carrying automatic weapons could be seen inside the main terminals at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris.  Security personnel set up two checkpoints, one before the concourse leading to the gates and another at the gate leading to the plane.  At the first checkpoint travelers were required to place shoes, coats, computers, toiletries, luggage, and other objects in bins for screening.  Hand searches of carry-on bags and electronic wand searches were performed for many, but not all travelers.  At the gate, all carry-on items were opened and inspected by security personnel and all travelers were meticulously patted down, sometimes more than once.  This set of procedures undoubtedly would have detected the explosive device that Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab attempted to detonate onboard the Northwest Airlines flight as it approached the airport in Detroit.  Most travelers appeared to approve these procedures or at least to be tolerant of them and associated delays. <br /><br />But the ramped up security, which assumes there is a technical solution to air terror, raises issues related both to civil liberties and to the character of the government that institutes them.  With regard to civil liberties, we have not yet confronted either the limit of the searches or the profiling that may cause a search to occur.  It is now possible, for example, to construct a high-explosive device that can be concealed in a human body cavity.  Should the airline and/or the government then conduct body cavity searches to make sure that no such device is present?  If so, what criteria would be used - race, ethnicity, gender, nationality, &quot;watch lists,&quot; informant information - as grounds to conduct such a search?  We can assume that persons would have a right to refuse such searches, at least in a modern liberal state, even if they were evicted from the airport and placed on a &quot;no fly&quot; list.  Or can we?  What if security and intelligence personnel are certain that the traveler is carrying such an explosive device?  Perhaps they have video surveillance evidence or the report of a reliable informant.  Would they not demand to conduct a search in this scenario?  Should the traveler have the right to refuse such a search?  Should intimate personal privacy be sacrificed to enhance public security?<br /><br />If the answer is yes, we can begin to see a subtle transformation in the character of the liberal state.  It can be detected in the fusion of the air travel sector and police powers.   The state has combined with private industry where airline security personnel and government officers work closely to control the behavior of travelers.  In the United States it is illegal to interfere with government officers and punishable by fines and imprisonment.  The multibillion dollar airline security industry also attaches to the state, not only through the provision of security technology, but also through its lobbying apparatus, effecting the law and airline security regulations.  Security procedures apply to all air travelers and impose a burden on all taxpayers, even though fewer than 1 in 100 million air travelers attempts to commit an act of terrorism.  So heinous is the crime that no instance of it can be tolerated.  And so the coercive powers of the state are inflated, and even if unintended, militate against the rights and/or privileges of travel, association, privacy and so on.  The government and the airlines have imposed a process of acculturation so that most people accept reasonable and sometimes unreasonable conditions of travel.<br /><br />Terrorism is not, of course or even mainly, confined to air transportation.  Internal security measures are just more pervasive and visible in that sector.  In the name of security we see the coercive powers of the state applied increasingly to one area after another.  Banking transactions are monitored to cull out possible terrorist financing.  We have become accustomed to ubiquitous surveillance technology.  Government agents engage in extraordinary rendition of suspected terrorists and criminals to third party governments for interrogation or imprisonment.  The FBI has issued tens of thousands of &quot;national security letters&quot; which are warrantless demands for information, that must be supplied and kept secret by law.  The CIA has conducted a program of &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques&quot; torturing suspected terrorists at undisclosed locations.  What these and many other measures have in common is that they contribute to what might be called the surveillance security state.  It is a state that is inconsistent with the basic tenets of the modern liberal polity, certainly as it was understood by the framers of the US Constitution as well as the Declaration of the Rights of Man.<br /><br />We will, of course, have to maintain air transportation security.  But as the same time, in the name of liberty, it will be necessary to monitor closely the guardians of the internal security, to limit and regulate their activities and numbers, and to abolish their power in all instances where it infringes unnecessarily on the character of liberal governance.  At the conclusion of the Constitutional Convention in 1787 a lady enquired of Benjamin Franklin, &quot;Well, Doctor, what have we got - a Republic or a Monarchy?&quot;  He is reported to have replied, &quot;A Republic, if you can keep it.&quot;  As we calibrate our responses to terrorism, we would do well to keep these words in mind.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.iglhrc.org/cgi-bin/iowa/content/about/staffdirectory/index.html">Sara Perle</a> and <span style="font-weight:bold;">Samara Fox</span> [Acting Communications Director and Intern, <a href="http://www.iglhrc.org">International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission</a>]: &quot;The 22-year-old HIV/AIDS ban on the entry into the United States of HIV-positive individuals who are not US citizens <a href="/paperchase/2010_01_04_indexarch.php#3187588848555689735">ended</a> on January 4, 2010 when the <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-s1793/text">Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Extension Act of 2009</a> came into effect. This act states that: a) HIV infection is no longer included on the list of &quot;communicable diseases of public health significance;&quot; b) Testing for HIV infection is no longer required as part of the US immigration medical screening process; and c) HIV infection no longer requires a waiver for entry into the United States. The prior regulation that maintained the ban was written in 1987 - when HIV was poorly understood.<br /><br />The lifting of the ban has an immediate and positive impact on the lives of HIV positive individuals, their friends, family, and activist communities. The ban unfairly set people with HIV apart from those with other diseases and disabilities, despite the fact that HIV is not transmitted casually. It played into hostility and hatred toward persons with HIV and was used to target marginalized groups of people for exclusion, including men who have sex with men (MSM). Rather than promoting the human rights of people in need of protection, it promoted social stigma and isolation for people who are HIV positive both within and outside the United States. This discrimination decreased the accessibility and availability of HIV education and treatment, increasing the risk to people with HIV/AIDS and to global public health.<br /><br />The ban created a strong incentive for HIV positive visitors to the US to lie about their HIV status or to avoid travel to the US altogether. While the possibility of receiving a waiver to the ban existed in principle, in practice the bureaucracy involved in obtaining a waiver stood as a significant deterrent, and waivers were not always granted. The result was that HIV positive individuals were often unable visit loved ones, seek emergency medical treatment or attend and speak at international conferences and meetings. In addition, those individuals that concealed their HIV positive status could still be subjected to testing by the US Immigration and Naturalization Agency (INA) if suspected of infection. Because travelers with HIV/AIDS medications found on their person were tested, some HIV positive individuals traveled without their medications, which weakened their body&#39;s ability to fight infection and increased HIV-resistance once the medication was resumed. <br /><br />Now that the ban has been lifted, HIV positive individuals need not fear exclusion from the US merely for traveling with their life-saving medications. The lifting of the ban also has a direct impact on the work of many lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT ) activists, facilitating their attendance at HIV/AIDS and LGBT conferences and meetings that take place in the US.  And of course, the lifting of the ban will make it possible for many more individuals to visit loved ones living in the United States and to seek temporary specialized medical treatment related to HIV/AIDS and other medical conditions. <br /><br />The HIV/AIDS entry ban violated international human rights law under the <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/b3ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR) and the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> (UDHR). In restricting the movement of individuals solely because of their HIV status, the ban violated the right to freedom of movement (ICCPR Art 12, UDHR Art 13) and in requiring testing and disclosure of HIV status to public authorities, the ban violated the right to privacy (ICCPR Art 17). The ban also intensified HIV/AIDS stigma to the point that it violated the right of HIV positive persons to access education, information and health care (UDHR Art 26(2)) and because the HIV travel ban did not actually address a public health emergency, its exclusion of HIV positive individuals was without reasonable justification and violated the right to freedom from discrimination (ICCPR Art 2 (1)). <br /><br />In addition, Article 42 of the <a href="http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241580410_eng.pdf">International Health Regulations</a> [PDF file], a binding instrument of international law to which the United States is a party, requires that &quot;[h]ealth measures taken pursuant to these Regulations shall be...applied in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner.&quot; Moreover, according to the <a href="http://data.unaids.org/Publications/IRC-pub07/jc1252-internguidelines_en.pdf">International Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights</a> [PDF file], exclusion based on HIV status infringes on basic human rights because:<br /><blockquote>&quot;[t]here is no public health rationale for restricting liberty of movement or choice of residence on the grounds of HIV status....[A]ny restrictions on those rights based on suspected or real HIV-status alone, including HIV screening of international travelers, are discriminatory and cannot be justified by public health concerns.&quot;</blockquote>  On January 1, 2010, South Korea also loosened its travel restrictions for HIV positive foreigners, though some experts maintain that compulsory testing of foreign residents is continuing regardless. Other countries that still have restrictions on entry, residence and length of stay for HIV positive individuals include China, Cuba, Egypt, Iraq, Israel, New Zealand, North Korea, Poland, Russia and Singapore.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.tjsl.edu/faculty_m_cohn">Marjorie Cohn</a> of Thomas Jefferson School of Law says in rejecting the broadcast of the Proposition 8 same-sex marriage trial, conservative justices of the United States Supreme Court are using procedural excuses to push a critical issue back into the closet ...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/cohncolor.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>O</strong></font>n Wednesday, a conservative majority of the Supreme Court overturned a ruling made by a federal trial judge that would have allowed limited television coverage of a trial that will decide the fate of California's Proposition 8. The trial, which is currently proceeding in San Francisco, is one of the most significant civil rights cases of our time. The plaintiffs are seeking to overturn a ballot initiative that makes same-sex marriage illegal in California.<br /><br />It was unusual that the Supreme Court even decided to hear this case. The high court takes very few cases. It generally decides issues about which the state or federal courts are in conflict or cases that raise important questions of federal law. Yet relying on the Supreme Court's "supervisory power" over the lower courts, the five conservative justices &#8212; Roberts, Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy &#8212; joined in an unsigned 17-page decision and chided Chief Judge Vaughn Walker for seeking to broadcast the trial without a sufficient notice period for public comment.<br /><br />Justice Breyer wrote in the dissent joined by Justices Stevens, Ginsburg and Sotomayor that he could find no other case in which the Supreme Court had intervened in the procedural aspects of local judicial administration. Indeed, Breyer cited a case in which Scalia wrote, "I do not see the basis for any direct authority to supervise lower courts."<br /><br />Moreover, in the comment period that Walker did allow, he received 138,574 comments, and all but 32 favored transmitting the proceedings.<br /><br />The majority concluded that the same-sex marriage opponents would suffer "irreparable harm" if the trial were broadcast to five other federal courts around the country. But all the witnesses who allegedly might be intimidated by the camera were experts or Prop 8 advocates who had already appeared on television or the Internet during the campaign.<br /><br />No one presented empirical data to establish that the mere presence of cameras would negatively impact the judicial process, Breyer wrote. He cited a book that I authored with veteran broadcast journalist David Dow, <u>Cameras in the Courtroom: Television and the Pursuit of Justice</u>. It describes studies that found no harm from the camera, and one which found that witnesses "who faced an obvious camera, provided answers that were more correct, lengthier and more detailed."<br /><br />The five justices who denied camera coverage noted at the outset that they would not express "any view on whether [federal] trials should be broadcast." Toward the end of their decision, however, they stated that since the trial judge intended to broadcast witness testimony, "[t]his case is therefore not a good one for a pilot program."<br /><br />In my opinion, it is no accident that the five majority justices are the conservatives who, in all likelihood, oppose same-sex marriage. Why don't those who oppose same-sex marriage want people to see this trial? <br /><br />Perhaps they are mindful of the sympathy engendered by televised images of another civil rights struggle. "It was hard for people watching at home not to take sides," David Halberstam wrote about Little Rock in <u>The Fifties</u>. "There they were, sitting in their living rooms in front of their own television sets watching orderly black children behaving with great dignity, trying to obtain nothing more than a decent education, the most elemental of American birthrights, yet being assaulted by a vicious mob of poor whites."<br /><br />The conservative justices may think that televising this trial will have the same effect on the public. Witnesses are describing their love for each other in deeply emotional terms. Religious fundamentalists who oppose them will testify about their interpretation of scripture. Gay marriage is one of the hot button issues of our time. Passions run high on both sides. This is not a jury trial in which jurors might be affected by the camera or a criminal case where the life or liberty of the defendant is at stake. <br /><br />In spite of what the conservative majority claims, the professional witnesses are not likely to be cowed by the camera. Modern broadcast technology would allow the telecast without affecting the proceedings in the courtroom. <br /><br />There is overwhelming public interest in this case. It will affect the daily lives of millions of people. The decision denying limited broadcast coverage at this point effectively eliminates any possibility that it will be allowed before the trial is over. The conservative judges are using procedural excuses to push this critical issue back into the closet.<br /><br /><br /><br /><em>Marjorie Cohn is a professor at Thomas Jefferson School of Law and co-author, with David Dow, of <u></em>Cameras in the Courtroom: Television and the Pursuit of Justice.</u><em></em><br /><br /><iframe src="/related/marjoriecohn.php" frameborder='0' width='100%' height='140' scrolling='no' valign='top' marginheight='3'></iframe><br />

		<title>&#039;Liberal&#039; Fundamentalism in Pakistan: Objecting to Islamic Arguments in NRO</title>

The governing PPP, in particular the President's men, are up in arms given not only the political embarrassment caused by the apex court's verdict and the revelation of damaging information in the course of hearings on NRO, but also the direct threat of prosecution and disqualification posed to the President's inner circle, if not the President himself.<br /><br />However, some of the criticism has come somewhat unexpectedly from a particular quarter of the lawyers' fraternity that had actively pushed for the restoration of the judiciary: liberal rights advocates who have been historically supportive of the superior courts' public interest and fundamental rights jurisprudence. The grievance appears to be the inclusion of reference to arguments based in Islamic law by the court in its short order amongst the grounds for declaring the NRO to be unconstitutional. Such a reaction reeks of a fundamentalist (i.e. uncompromising and simplistic) aversion to the entirety of Islamic legal discourse, and while it comes from a segment of society professing a liberal rights oriented ideology, it is inherently, fundamentally, and irreconcilably illiberal in that its starting point is a denial of the possible validity of another worldview.<br /><br />There is no denying that Pakistan's particular experience with the Islamization of laws has been problematic in multiple ways. The enactment of the <em>Hudood</em> and the <em>Qisas</em> &amp; <em>Diyat</em> laws, for example, led to several kinds of miscarriages of justice and created room for the abuse of powers by police as well as misuse by private individuals. Furthermore, the enactment of these laws played havoc with the doctrinal foundations of Pakistan's laws with the result that it took the courts and the Parliament three decades to bring many of the controversies to an uneasy rest.<br /><br />What has arguably been an even more sinister aspect of the Islamization of laws is the further legitimation of existing cultural practices and social attitudes that are inherently discriminatory and misogynistic. This resulted in the adoption by the non-Shariat courts, trial as well as appellate, of positions explicitly and implicitly discriminatory towards women and religious minorities. The Lahore High Court's decision in a case denying a woman the right to marry without her wali's consent is a notable and by no means singular example.<br /><br />What is missing from this picture of Islamization, however, is a narrative of the evolution of a jurisprudence of Islamic public rights initially by the Shariat courts and later on by the High Courts and the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Whilst there is no denying that the Shariat courts' jurisprudence regarding minorities' rights has been problematic and that these courts have thus far failed to take up the case for womens rights, the Shariat courts managed to develop a robust doctrinal base for the Islamic right to equality, the independence of the judiciary and, most relevant to the NRO controversy: the principle of the accountability of the executive.<br /><br />A prime example of the development and enforcement of the Islamic right to equality is the Federal Shariat Court's decision in 'In Re: Islamization of Laws' (PLD 1985 FSC 193). The court declared section 4 of the Members of the National Assembly (Exemption from Preventive Detention and Personal Appearance) Ordinance 1963 to be null and void for repugnance to the injunctions of Islam. This statute exempted members of parliament from preventive detention and personal appearance before a civil court while parliament was in session.<br /><br />It must be noted that the exemption was meant to be temporary and related primarily to appearance before civil courts. Nonetheless, the Federal Shariat Court (and in 1991, the Shariat Appellate Bench of the Supreme Court) struck down even this limited protection on the basis of an Islamic right to equality noting that as regards the administration of justice, Islam "requires that justice be rendered regardless of the status of the parties." Considering that the NRO sought permanent (as opposed to temporary) exemption from appearance before the courts in criminal (as compared to civil) cases, it did not stand a chance in the light of the principles laid down by the Federal Shariat Court nearly two and a half decades ago.<br /><br />As Martin Lau observes in his recent book <u>The Role of Islam in the Legal System of Pakistan</u>, the Islamic right to equality is stronger than the fundamental right to equality provided in Article 25 of the Constitution as it is rooted in a distrust of the executive. It must also be noted that the Federal Shariat Court's jurisprudence on Islamic rights (even during the rule of General Zia, to whom the court was presumed to owe an allegiance) was stronger than the rights jurisprudence of the High Courts and the Supreme Court: "a most extraordinary result considering that the implementation of Islamic law is normally associated with a loss of fundamental rights."<br /><br />The Supreme Court's decision in a 1992 case (PLD 1994 SC 412) demonstrates further how the High Courts and the Supreme Court took the baton from the Shariat Courts and the extent to which Public Interest Litigation (PIL) jurisprudence is indebted to the Shariat Courts' rights jurisprudence. The Supreme Court disqualified a member of National Assembly for having used his political position to obtain a loan on favourable terms in disregard of the established rules. The court based its jurisdiction and authority on principles of Islamic law and Article 2-A of the constitution. To quote Martin Lau again: &quot;Accountability of public officials &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; was one example of the positive impact of Islamic law."<br /><br />To the extent that the Supreme Court has incidentally referred to principles rooted in Islamic law in its short order invalidating the NRO, the court's position is neither novel nor a departure from established law. Those who have suggested otherwise are either ignorant of the particular strand of Islamic legal doctrine or, as is more likely, the anxiety with Islamic public law principles arises on an altogether different count. If the established principles of Islamic public law discussed above are taken to their logical conclusion several members of the President's coterie face political demise. Worse still, the President himself may find his constitutional protection from criminal prosecution to be less secure than a plain reading of the text of Article 248 suggests.<br /><br />It is an established principle of constitutional interpretation that when two provisions of the constitution are seemingly in conflict these must be read together and harmoniously interpreted. On the one hand Article 248 promises the President protection from criminal proceedings in any court during the term of his office; on the other Article 2-A brings in principles of Islamic law including the accountability of the head of the executive. Ironically, in their opposition to the entirety of Islamic legal discourse, those who have campaigned long and hard against t
he victimization of the poor and disenfranchised now stand on the side of the rich and powerful. <br />    <br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Moeen Cheema is an Associate Lecturer at the Australian National University&#39;s College of Law.

Unless you live under a rock, you know this.  Innumerable talking heads are lambasting federal agencies for seemingly egregious mistakes. Some demand that President Obama fire Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano; others decry lessons not learned from 9/11.<br /><br />Although something clearly went very wrong, we must be cautious when pointing fingers and reaching sweeping conclusions.  While airport security and intelligence coordination seem to be the immediate culprits here, the problem lies far deeper than that. <br /><br />We face a stark reality. An Islamic extremist, Mutallab was bent on killing innocent passengers, including fellow Moslems, regardless of their faith. Moderate Moslems in Detroit have condemned the attack. But religious extremists remain committed to our destruction, including extremists right here in the US. <br /><br />Radical imams send the Mutallabs of the world to their fiery death promising glory and virgins in martyrdom. Indeed, these Mutallabs are in our midst; Somali 'lost boys' radicalized in Minneapolis mosques and sent to Pakistan for suicide bombing training are proof enough.  Terror in the name of God is our reality.  Religious extremism presents the single greatest danger to national security &#8212; we must regain the initiative.  And yet we must guard against capricious and arbitrary measures, and distinguish between religion and religious extremism.<br /><br />What can we do? I suggest several proactive measures in my recent book, <u>Freedom from Religion: Rights and National Security</u>.  Although counterintuitive in a vibrant democracy, limiting the free speech of those inciting violence in the name of religious extremism is legitimate.  Constitutional law scholars are extremely uncomfortable with such limitations, but extremists leave us minimal wiggle room.<br /><br />First, violence preached in a house of worship loses any immunity based on freedom of speech.  We cannot wait for actors influenced by extreme religious sermons to commit dastardly acts &#8212; law enforcement must act on the violent extremist speech.<br /><br />However, imagine the chilling effect if agents attend worship dressed differently from parishioners, holding 'pen and pencil' while listening to sermons.  A faith leader told me he would therefore prefer FBI agents remain undercover.  Although "less honest," it produces better information and minimizes Free Exercise violations.<br /><br />Second, we must re-articulate the limits of clergy speech.  How often must clergy incite before law enforcement moves in?  What words justify monitoring?  In <em>Brandenberg v. Ohio</em>, the Supreme Court said states cannot "forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action."<br /><br />The court continued: "The mere abstract teaching of the moral propriety or even moral necessity for a resort to force and violence, is not the same as preparing a group for violent action and steeling it to such action."<br /><br />An extremist religious cleric's power is, potentially, extraordinary.  In <em>Brandenburg</em>'s three-prong test&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;imminence, likelihood, intent&acirc;&#8364;&#8221; an extremist religious authority determined to encourage his congregation to act almost certainly meets the first two requirements.  A listener is likely to obey the words of his ultimate spiritual authority and a "critical mass" of regular violent sermons will make his act imminent.<br /><br />Third, while celebrating religion and religious freedom, we must immediately resolve critical issues at the confluence of religion and national security: will airport security officers worldwide require women in full-length burkhas to lift their veils for identification purposes; will they ask individuals with Arabic-sounding names additional questions; will they subject individuals going to or coming from Middle East countries to additional scrutiny?<br /><br />Many of us instinctively recoil at affirmative answers to these questions; others suggest we have no alternative but to fundamentally re-articulate how we protect ourselves. Winston Churchill would have said we must 'look the tiger in the eye'. The question &#8212; how we balance powerful competing rights: the right to religion and the right to self-defense.<br /><br />The direct, undeniable connection between terrorism and extremist religious speech demands that we seek answers.  But we must be extraordinarily cautious lest we overreact.  American history is replete with examples, from the internment of innocent Japanese-Americans after Pearl Harbor to the torture-based interrogation regime after 9/11. Both represent the very worst in Presidential decision-making and Supreme Court and Congressional acquiescence; in essence, a complete failure of checks and balances and separation of powers.<br /><br />Finger-pointing is always endemic to Washington. The immediate and future danger posed to innocent individuals demands that our President &#8212; restrained by an active judiciary and Congressional oversight &#8212; demonstrate courageous and bold leadership. We must recognize that religious extremism poses an immediate danger and that religious extremists no longer deserve immunity predicated on faith.<br /><br />Impositions on extremist faith are indeed controversial, but may be inevitable. Inevitable &#8212; just like the next religious extremist-motivated terrorist attack.<br /><br /><br /><em>Amos N.

Rather, she suggests, we should use the law to rise to those challenges....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/laurieblank.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td></table><font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>his is a new kind of war, with a new kind of enemy.  The old rules of international law are antiquated and no longer apply.  So says Judge Janice Brown of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in <u>Al-Bihani v. Obama</u>.  These assertions echo the claims used by the Bush Administration to argue that the Geneva Conventions are "quaint" and "obsolete."<br /><br />We are in a new kind of war.  Where once nations fought nations, now we fight insurgents, shadowy terrorist groups and other non-state entities.  Where we once measured combat by the number of tanks or fighter jets destroyed, now we count roadside bombs and suicide bombers.<br /><br />But does this new kind of war necessarily demand new rules?  Those who say yes point to the fact that the Geneva Conventions entered into force in 1949, only four years after World War II &#8212; ancient history in terms of the nature of conflict. <br /><br />Before we confine the law of war to the dustbin of history, however, let's just be sure that we don't really need them.  The Geneva Conventions, and the law of war for centuries before that, are based on four key principles: distinction, proportionality, military necessity, and humanity. <br /><br />The principle of distinction requires all parties in a conflict to distinguish between those who are fighting and those who are not and to target only the former when launching attacks.  It also requires those who are fighting to distinguish themselves from innocent civilians.  Distinction has a simple but noble purpose &#8212; to protect innocent civilians from unnecessary suffering during conflict.  It also protects soldiers by helping them understand whether persons they encounter are hostile or innocent.<br /><br />The principle of proportionality seeks to balance military goals with protection of civilians.  It prohibits an attack when the expected civilian casualties will be excessive compared to the anticipated military advantage.  In essence, a commander must believe that the stated military goal is reasonable in light of any foreseeable incidental civilian casualties.<br /><br />Military necessity recognizes that the goal of war is the complete submission of the enemy as quickly as possible and allows any force necessary to the achievement of that goal as long as such force is not forbidden by the law.  Destroying enemy capabilities is legitimate, therefore; wanton killing and destruction is not.<br /><br />Humanity aims to minimize suffering in armed conflict.  To that end, the infliction of suffering or destruction not necessary for legitimate military purposes is forbidden.  This principle stems from the code of chivalry, itself an early manifestation of the laws of war.<br /><br />Those who argue that we need new rules for these new wars must consider exactly which of these principles we no longer want or need.  Are we so anxious to kill terrorists and jihadists that we are willing to disregard the need to figure out whether our targets are in fact terrorists before we shoot?  Perhaps instead we'll decide we can destroy as many villages as it takes to get that one elusive insurgent.<br /><br />The uncertainties and complexities of fighting against insurgents and terrorists do indeed increase the challenges in applying and adhering to the laws of war.  These same complexities make conflict ever more deadly for innocent civilians and soldiers alike.  Throwing out the very rules designed to minimize suffering in conflict hardly seems to be the right choice at a time when that suffering is only increasing.<br /><br />Instead, let's focus on making the law work better in unpredictable and difficult circumstances.  For example, we need to sharpen our ability to differentiate between friends and foes so that we know who is dangerous and who we must protect.  Our enemies may not wear uniforms, but that does not give us the right to shoot innocents in their stead. <br /><br />We need to examine how to better protect civilians caught up in the zone of combat while still enabling effective military operations.  When insurgents seek shelter in local villages, we cannot simply choose between bombing the whole village or letting the insurgents walk free for fear of civilian casualties, but need to develop operational tactics that enable more surgical strikes. <br /><br />We need to learn more about how insurgents and terrorists operate so we can target their facilities while still protecting civilian buildings and infrastructure. The fact that our enemies make roadside bombs in residential basements and store munitions in mosques or hospitals does not excuse our obligation to distinguish between military and civilian objects.  Nor does it make this obligation obsolete.  Rather, it means that we must marry a more discerning analysis of when a building becomes a legitimate target with more sophisticated intelligence information.<br /><br />The key principles of the international law of war are sound and timeless in their purpose &#8212; and critical to our ability to carry out effective military operations.  Judge Brown seeks to discard the "old wineskins of international law" and "demands new rules be written."  But which of these principles would she give up?  The challenges new wars pose are vast, but rather than let them define us and our values, let's use the law to rise to the challenge.<br /><br /><br /><em>Laurie R. Blank is the Acting Director of Emory Law&#39;s International Humanitarian Law Clinic.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.anu.edu.au/scripts/StaffDetails.asp?StaffID=477">Moeen Cheema</a>, Associate Lecturer at the Australian National University College of Law, says that the Pakistan Supreme Court&#39;s December ruling in the NRO case reopens a long-running clash between the country&#39;s executive and the judiciary, a conflict that the executive cannot constitutionally win....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/paksupcourt.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>O</strong></font>n December 16, 2009, the Supreme Court of Pakistan declared the country&#39;s controversial National Reconciliation Ordinance, popularly known as the NRO, unconstitutional on a number of grounds and decided that it was <span style="font-style:italic;">void ab initio</span>. As a result, the court ordered that all cases that had been terminated under the NRO would be reinstated, including the money-laundering case against Asif Ali Zardari, current President of Pakistan, which was being pursued in Switzerland. The Supreme Court's decision is a landmark decision but one whose real ramifications and deeper political significance cannot be fully understood in the absence of an awareness of an intriguing period of Pakistan's history within which the NRO saga is unfolding.<br /><br />The NRO was promulgated by Pakistan's military strongman, General Pervez Musharraf, on October 5, 2007. Through this ordinance the President sanctioned the automatic dismissal of thousands of criminal cases including corruption charges against the current President and several key politicians of his party as well as serious criminal cases against members of a main coalition party, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM). The re-opening of these cases by the Supreme Court has caused significant embarrassment to the federal government and creates the possibility that many leading members of these coalition parties, including some ministers, may be convicted and hence disqualified from being members of the Parliament.<br /><br />It may be recalled that the General had earlier attempted to remove the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in March 2007, but this attempt failed as the Chief Justice was reinstated by the Supreme Court in July that year after a movement by Pakistan's lawyers. Having passed the NRO pursuant to a political deal with the Pakistan Peoples' Party (PPP) of late Benazir Bhutto, the President sought reelection for a third term on October 6, 2007, at which point the PPP's abstention paved the way for the General's success. The NRO was challenged before the Supreme Court and on October 12 the apex court of Pakistan issued an order directing that the operation of the NRO be suspended until such time as the court reviews the ordinance in detail and pronounces its verdict on its constitutionality.<br /><br />Musharraf's reelection was also challenged in the Supreme Court and, fearing an adverse decision, the General dismissed the entire superior judiciary and imposed an extra-constitutional state of emergency on November 3. Musharraf then announced the holding of elections for the national parliament under international pressure. However, upon the assassination of Benazir Bhutto in mysterious circumstances in December 2007 the elections were initially postponed and finally held in February 2008. The PPP, then headed by Asif Ali Zardari, late Benazir Bhutto's widower, rode a sympathy wave and won the most seats in the National Assembly. Later the PPP formed the federal government in coalition with a number of political parties, including one of General Musharraf's main backers, the MQM. Musharraf made a host of appointments to fill the vacancies created by the unconstitutional removal of a majority of the judges of the superior courts.<br /><br />The PPP government initially accepted General Musharraf as the President of Pakistan. However, under pressure from the main opposition parties, the PPP relented and Musharraf was forced to give up the office of the President under a threat of impeachment in August 2008. In subsequent elections for the Presidency, Asif Ali Zardari emerged as the surprise candidate and won the elections comfortably. He was sworn in as Pakistan's 11th President in September 2008. Mr. Zardari&#39;s ascent to the Presidency was paved by two actions of the loyalist Supreme Court created by Musharraf&#8212;also known widely and unceremoniously as the 'Dogar Court' after the pretender Chief Justice Abdul Hameed Dogar. In one decision the Dogar Court declared the requirement of holding an undergraduate degree to be eligible to become a parliamentarian or a President to be unconstitutional. In another set of decisions, the Dogar Court vacated corruption charges against the President in March and April 2008 pursuant to the NRO, with which that court found no fault.<br /><br />From March 2008 to March 2009 the PPP government refused to reinstate Iftikhar Chaudhry as the legitimate Chief Justice of Pakistan along with other judges who had been unconstitutionally removed by General Musharraf. A movement for the restoration of the legitimate court progressively gained momentum but was thwarted by the PPP government led by Asif Ali Zardari. The movement reached a crescendo as the retirement date of Abdul Hameed Dogar in March 2009 neared. This also coincided with the second anniversary of the CJ Chaudry's unconstitutional dismissal. A 'Long March' was called for by the lawyers in which Pakistan's emerging civil society, opposition political parties and the broader public wholeheartedly participated. The Long March threatened to destabilize Pakistan's elected government which finally succumbed and announced the restoration of Iftikhar Chaudhry and other judges.<br /><br />With the reinstatement of CJ Chaudhry a new era in Pakistan's judicial history began to unfold. Contrary to the government's fears, the Chaudhry Court did not seek vengeance. Instead the court went about putting its own house in order. Pursuant to a constitutional petition, the court first declared General Musharraf's emergency actions to be unconstitutional but did not immediately strike down all legislative measures passed in the emergency period. The court gave the government some time to seek parliamentary approval of the legislative enactments made by General Musharraf during the emergency period. The court also declared all judicial appointments made in that period to be unconstitutional with the result that in one stroke all Musharraf and Zardari appointees (and loyalists) were weeded out of Pakistan's superior judiciary.<br /><br />When the PPP government subsequently failed to muster parliamentary backing for the NRO, the Supreme Court began hearings on the validity of this unpopular ordinance in early December. Embarrassed by its failure to get the NRO passed by Parliament, the PPP government refused to defend the ordinance before the Supreme Court. This wasn't the end of the matter however, as when the Supreme Court sought information concerning the details of NRO beneficiaries, the government made futile attempts to mask such information. The revelation of the nature and extent of the charges and the names of the beneficiaries, many of whom continue to occupy key positions within the government, have caused significant erosion of the political credibility of the PPP government in general, and of President Zardari in particular.<br /><br />The NRO saga hasn't ended. In fact, it has only just begun. In the coming months corruption charges will be pursued against several key PPP ministers and leading members. The media, the public, and the superior courts are expected to keep a close watch on the prosecution of these cases to see whether the government is able to steer the judicial process in favor of the accused. Questions shall also be raised about the eligibility of Mr. Asif Ali Zardari to hold the office of the Presidency. All
 of this may lead to a clash between the executive and the judiciary, a conflict that the executive cannot constitutionally win. The government's strategy in such circumstances would be to politicize the judiciary and create an impression that the Supreme Court is allying with Pakistan's military establishment in an effort to displace yet another elected government.<blockquote><strong>Timeline of Events:</strong><br /><br />March 2007: First dismissal of CJ Iftikhar Chaudhry<br /><br />July 2007: Reinstatement of Iftikhar Chaudary by the Supreme Court<br /><br />October 5, 2007: Promulgation of NRO<br /><br />October 6, 2007: General Musharraf's reelection as President <br /><br />October 12, 2007: Supreme Court's interim order barring benefit under NRO<br /><br />November 3, 2007: Musharraf imposes emergency and dismisses CJ Chaudhry and judges<br /><br />December 2007: Assassination of Benazir Bhutto<br /><br />February 2008: Elections for Parliament<br /><br />April 2008: The Dogar Court paves the way for dropping of charges against Zardari<br /><br />August 2008: Musharraf resigns as President for fear of impeachment<br /><br />September 2008: Asif Ali Zardari becomes President of Pakistan<br /><br />March 2009: Long March and re-instatement of the Chaudhry Court<br /><br />December 16, 2009: Supreme Court's final verdict on NRO</blockquote><span style="font-style:italic;">Moeen Cheema is an Associate Lecturer at the Australian National University&#39;s College of Law.</span><br /><br /><iframe src="/related/moeencheema.php" frameborder='0' width='100%' height='140' scrolling='no' valign='top' marginheight='3'></iframe><br />

		<title>For the Sake of Fair and Speedy Trials: A Confirmation Plea</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.richmond.edu/faculty/tobias.htm">Carl Tobias</a> of the University of Richmond School of Law says that in order for the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to function properly, the Senate must confirm Judge Denny Chin as soon as possible after returning from recess, and President Obama should promptly nominate candidates for the other three vacancies on the court....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/carltobias.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->W<odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->hen President Barack Obama assumed office, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit experienced a vacancy in one of the tribunal's 13 judgeships. Since then, the Senate has confirmed Judge Gerard Lynch for that opening. However, the chief executive has elevated Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court while three additional Second Circuit judges have assumed senior status. Thus, it is critical that the administration expeditiously fill these vacancies. The White House has adopted practices to facilitate appointments, but the four seats remain unoccupied.<br /><br />An instructive example of this problem is Southern District of New York Judge Denny Chin's nomination to the Second Circuit. Because the four vacancies can undermine prompt, economical, and fair disposition of appeals, the Senate must swiftly approve Judge Chin while the President should expeditiously submit - and the upper chamber must promptly confirm - nominees for the three other empty judgeships. Indeed, the Senate ought to approve Judge Chin as soon as it reconvenes in January because the tribunal needs all of its members to deliver justice.<br /><br />The Second Circuit is the final stop for 99 percent of appeals from Connecticut, New York, and Vermont. The court hears many significant business disputes, a number of which are important to United States economic recovery. The current vacancies in four of its 13 positions could impede speedy, inexpensive, and equitable appellate resolution. For example, the tribunal now requires more time to decide appeals than all but one of the 12 regional circuits.<br /><br />Several reasons explain why the court lacks 30 percent of its members. Judge Chester Straub assumed senior status in July 2008, and President George W. Bush nominated Southern District of New York Judge Loretta Preska on September 9 of that year, but he consulted only minimally with New York's Democratic Senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Clinton. September was also too late in a presidential election year for confirmation, and the 110th Senate adjourned without considering the jurist. Moreover, Judge Chin is the only candidate whom the Obama White House has nominated for the existing vacancies.<br /><br />President Obama has applied several techniques in order to expeditiously fill the current openings. He promptly consulted the home-state senators prior to actual nominations. Most senators have cooperated with the administration and swiftly proposed candidates who are very smart, ethical, independent, hard working and even-tempered. Obama specifically requested the guidance of New York Democratic Senators Schumer and Gillibrand who both strongly advocated Judge Chin. The chief executive nominated the jurist on October 6, while he received a November 18 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing at which both New York senators appeared and expressed their enthusiastic support. The Judiciary panel approved Chin on a December 10 voice vote.<br /><br />The White House carefully selected Judge Chin because he had compiled an excellent record as a trial judge in the Southern District over the last decade and a half. Illustrative was Chin's expert handling of the Bernard Madoff criminal proceeding. The jurist earned the highest ABA rating of well qualified. Moreover, the two New York senators have lauded the nomination.<br /><br />Given Chin's distinguished service, the Senate must promptly schedule him for a floor debate and vote. Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the Judiciary Committee Chair, and Senator Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), the ranking member, should work together on confirming the nominee. For instance, Senator Sessions could urge Senator Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the Minority Leader, to cooperate with Senator Harry Reid (D-Nev.), the Majority Leader, in swiftly arranging Judge Chin's floor consideration.<br /><br />    <span style="font-style:italic;"><br />Carl Tobias is the Williams Professor at the University of Richmond School of Law.</span><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Dr. Barry A. Feinstein, a Senior Lecturer in International Law at the School of Law of Netanya Academic College in Israel, says that the Israel navy's actions against the Gaza Flotilla complied with international law, despite the United Nations Human Rights Council's report to the contrary, in the first of a two-part series regarding the flotilla controversy this past summer ... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/Feinsteinhead.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>A</b></font>lthough the pre-determined verdict of Israel's guilt, as prescribed by the mandate granted by the United Nations Human Rights Council to the fact-finding mission it dispatched "to investigate violations of international law, including international humanitarian and human rights law, resulting from the Israeli attacks on the flotilla of ships carrying humanitarian assistance" to Gaza,  was seemingly not taken into account by the Mission at its outset, the Mission's <a href="www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/15session/A.HRC.15.21_en.pdf">final conclusions</a> [PDF], including among others "the blockade is unlawful and cannot be sustained in law"  and "the action of the Israel Defense Force in intercepting the Mavi Marmara on the high seas ... was clearly unlawful," need to be approached cautiously. As tragic as it was that nine people died and others were injured during the incident, it is telling that in breath-taking speed the Human Rights Council had within two days following the event already condemned in its resolution 14/1 of June 2, 2010 (supported by, among other Human Rights Council members, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, China, and Kyrgyzstan) Israel's actions as "violations of international law, including international humanitarian and human rights law," while it took for example more than two months for the Human Rights Council to finally pass a resolution relating to violence in Kyrgyzstan that eight weeks prior to the flotilla episode had claimed hundreds of casualties, and over a week before any Human Rights Council resolution on the Kyrgyzstan crisis was ever passed, hundreds more (indeed thousands more according to some reports) were killed in ethnic violence in that same troubled country.</p>

<p>Imposed economic hardship on civilian populations is not a singular occurrence in the world today. Witness, for example, the economic difficulties for civilian populations as the result of sanctions that have been imposed on other problematic regimes, such as those in North Korea, Syria, Cuba, and Iraq as a means of applying economic pressure on them and during the course of which typically goods that are not vital are not transferred to the countries, including obviously items that would help them militarily.  A naval blockade implementing sanctions in fact is a recognized and accepted military tool.  For example, a blockade called Operation Sharp Guard was imposed for three years in the mid-1990's by NATO and Western European Union naval forces on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, during which they queried some 74,000 vessels and boarded and inspected at sea about 6,000 of them, while directing for inspection to port more than 1,400 ships. Coalition naval forces engaged in the maritime interception operation to enforce the Iraq embargo had by the year 2000 challenged almost 30,000 merchant vessels, boarded about 13,000 ships, and directed to coalition ports for further investigation some 750.   A blockade, designated as a "quarantine" was also imposed in 1962 by the United States against Cuba, and during the first year of the mid-twentieth century Algerian crisis French naval vessels on the high seas visited and searched almost 5,000 ships that were suspected of transporting war materiel to Algeria. Allied Powers imposed blockades against Axis and Central powers during the two World Wars as well. During World War One, British naval vessels, for instance, were credited with intercepting and detaining thousands of merchant ships suspected of transporting cargo bound for the enemy, and the Allied naval blockade of Germany was widely considered to have been responsible for the deaths due to starvation of around three-quarters of a million German civilians.   </p>

<p>The actions of the Israel navy against the flotilla on the high seas were conducted pursuant to long-standing principles of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/385ec082b509e76c41256739003e636d/7694fe2016f347e1c125641f002d49ce">law of armed conflict at sea</a>.  These principles allow Israel to impose on the high seas  <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/255?OpenDocument">a naval blockade</a> of territory controlled by the enemy in order to prevent the entrance of ships, without regard to the type of cargo that the ships are carrying, to prohibit commerce with the enemy, even if the cargo is bound for civilians, and to search on the high seas for contraband which consists of goods destined for enemy controlled territory and that "may be susceptible for use in armed conflict."  Flotilla vessels therefore could be visited and searched on the high seas if they were reasonably suspected of breaching or attempting to breach the blockade or of carrying contraband, but they could also be visited and searched on the high seas if they were reasonably suspected of violating regulations set up by Israel within the immediate naval operations area or of engaging in belligerent acts on the enemy's behalf or of making an effective contribution to the military action of the enemy; Israel could exercise control on the high seas over flotilla vessels located in the immediate vicinity of naval operations and ships that did not comply with orders given them by Israel in this regard could be presumed to have hostile intent or enemy character and therefore could be treated as if they were enemy ships; flotilla vessels that were reasonably believed to be breaching or that were attempting to breach the blockade or that were carrying contraband, or that were violating regulations established by Israel within the immediate naval operations area or that were engaged in belligerent acts on the enemy's behalf or that were making an effective contribution to the military action of the enemy, could be captured on the high seas; and flotilla vessels could be attacked on the high seas, like military objectives, if they engaged in belligerent acts on the enemy's behalf or made an effective contribution to the military action of the enemy, or if they were reasonably believed to be breaching the blockade or to be carrying contraband, after they had been given prior warning and when they clearly and intentionally refused to stop or resisted visit, search or capture. </p>

<p>To the extent that general international law principles relating to self-defense would be relevant, Israel, just as any other State, obviously is permitted to exercise its inherent right of self-defense, and indeed has both the right and the duty to thwart attacks against its citizens,  including on the high seas, and certainly once attacked, Israel naval personnel naturally had the right to defend themselves.  The <a href="http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/82702E75-9A14-4EF5-B414-49B0D7A27816/0/JSP3832004Edition.pdf">2004 British Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict</a> [PDF], which reflects and repeats the relevant international legal principles regarding blockade and contraband, also explains that security zones may be established "as a defensive measure"  and emphasizes as well that maritime and total exclusion zones "are legitimate means of exercising the right of self-defence and other rights enjoyed under international law." Furthermore, even under international agreements the Palestinians signed with it, Israel was entitled to carry out actions in which the Israel navy engaged.  As stipulated in the <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace+Process/Guide+to+the+Peace+Process/Declaration+of+Principles.htm">1993 Declaration of Principles between Israel and the Palestinians</a>, "Israel will continue to carry the responsibility for defending against external threats, as well as the responsibility for overall security of Israelis for the purpose of safeguarding their internal security and public order."   Also in accordance with the <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace+Process/Guide+to+the+Peace+Process/Agreement+on+Gaza+Strip+and+Jericho+Area.htm">1994 Agreement on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area  between Israel and the Palestinians</a>, as the Mission report correctly points out, and pursuant to the <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace+Process/Guide+to+the+Peace+Process/THE+ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN+INTERIM+AGREEMENT.htm">1995 Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip between Israel and the Palestinians</a>,  which incidentally has superseded the <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace+Process/Guide+to+the+Peace+Process/Agreement+on+Gaza+Strip+and+Jericho+Area.htm">Gaza-Jericho Agreement</a>,  "Israel shall continue to carry the responsibility ... for defense against external threats from the sea and from the air ... and will have all the powers to take the steps necessary to meet this responsibility." The Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement additionally prescribes that foreign vessels are not to approach closer than 12 nautical miles from the Gaza coast,  and further pursuant to the Interim Agreement, in fulfilment of Israel's security and safety responsibilities along the Gaza coast, Israel naval vessels are permitted to "take any measures necessary against vessels suspected of being used for terrorist activities or for smuggling arms, ammunition, drugs, goods, or for any other illegal activity." The United States similarly has in fact long-exercised its jurisdiction over foreign vessels on the high seas to enforce narcotics legislation, which has been upheld in Federal circuit court of appeals decisions "under the 'protective principle' of international law ... which permits a nation to assert jurisdiction over a person whose conduct outside the nation's territory threatens the nation's security....," and "'a nation may exercise authority upon the high seas to such an extent and to so great a distance as is reasonable and necessary to protect itself and its citizens from injury.'" </p>

<p>The Israel navy acted in accordance with international law when on the high seas it imposed the naval blockade of Gaza and searched for contraband; when on the high seas it visited and searched flotilla vessels that were reasonably suspected of breaching or attempting to breach the blockade or of carrying contraband or of violating regulations established by Israel within the immediate naval operations area or of engaging in belligerent acts on the enemy's behalf or of making an effective contribution to the military action of the enemy; when it acted on the high seas to control flotilla vessels that were sailing in the immediate vicinity of naval operations and presumed those vessels which did not comply with orders given them by it in this regard to have hostile intent or enemy character, treating them as enemy ships; when it captured on the high seas flotilla vessels that were reasonably believed to be breaching or that were attempting to breach the blockade or that were carrying contraband or that were violating regulations established by Israel within the immediate naval operations area or that were engaged in belligerent acts on the enemy's behalf or that were making an effective contribution to the military action of the enemy; and when it attacked on the high seas like military objectives flotilla vessels that engaged in belligerent acts on behalf of the enemy or that made an effective contribution to the enemy's military action, or that were reasonably believed to be breaching the blockade or to be carrying contraband, and after they had been given prior warning they clearly and intentionally refused to stop or resisted visit, search or capture.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href=http://www.warriorlegacyfoundation.org/staff/details.asp?id=12237 ><strong>Jim Hanson</strong></a> [Senior Director, <a href=http://www.warriorlegacyfoundation.org/>Warrior Legacy Foundation</a>]: "As <a href= /paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-targeted-killing-lawsuit.php>reported here</a>: A judge for the <a href=http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/>US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> on Tuesday <a href=https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2010cv1469-31>dismissed</a> [PDF] a <a href= /paperchase/2010/08/rights-groups-file-suit-over-us-assassination-order-suspected-terrorist.php>lawsuit</a> challenging the Obama administration's ability to conduct "targeted killings" in the case of radical Muslim cleric and US citizen <a href=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11658920>Anwar al-Awlaqi</a>.</p>

                <p>I am not the best person to be commenting on the legal arguments around this judgment. I will however cheer its understanding that it is not the job of the judiciary to look over the shoulder of the President and attempt to micromanage him when he is exercising his authority as Commander in Chief. That is not to say that he is unfettered when operating as such, but that his responsibility to keep us safe makes him the proper one to decide when one of our enemies must be killed.</p>

                <p>To be sure, this Court recognizes the somewhat unsettling nature of its conclusion - that there are circumstances in which the Executive's unilateral decision to kill a U.S. citizen overseas is "constitutionally committed to the political branches" and judicially unreviewable. But this case squarely presents such a circumstance.</p>

                <p>This decision notes correctly that evaluating intelligence regarding terrorist threats is not the job of the judiciary, nor is determining what the proper response to these same threats. Article Two of the US Constitution was specifically designed to make sure that our military forces had one and only one Commander in Chief. Leadership by committee is an oxymoron and nowhere more so than when applied to military and counterterrorism operations. That is why we hold elections every four years; we want to make sure that the person we give that mighty power to is worthy of it. </p>

                <p>Awlaqi is a member of al Qaeda and actively recruits terrorists and works to inspire them to kill us. His membership in al Qaeda also means that the <a href=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ40/content-detail.html>Authorization to Use Military Force (AUMF)</a>, passed overwhelmingly by Congress soon after 9/11, is a specific hunting license.</p>

                <p>That the President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.</p>

                <p>That is a very broad mandate and obviously includes Awlaqi by his own admission. But what if he is not part of al Qaeda and had nothing to do with 9/11? What if he didn't think they were radical enough and he formed his own terror cell? The judge's decision in this case did not seem to rest on the AUMF, but the more basic power of the Commander in Chief. That would seem to say that once the same reasoning is applied, then Awlaqi painted a target on his forehead as soon as he convinced the President he is a viable threat to the US and our citizens. That is a common sense idea that I am happy to see has filtered up to our courts. If we can identify and kill terrorists wherever we find them on the planet, that is a good thing."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kristine Long, Pitt Law &#39;11, attended a lecture hosted by the Center for International Legal Education on &quot;The Role of the US in International Criminal Justice,&quot; presented by Stephen Rapp, the US Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Rapp-1-720582.jpg"><img style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 278px; height: 320px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Rapp-1-720208.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><font style="font-weight: bold;">W</font>hile I listened to Ambassador Stephen Rapp talk about the United States&#39; role in international law, I couldn&#39;t help but think about Obama&#39;s State of the Union address from the night before. While Obama&#39;s talk was highly focused on domestic troubles, his speech did allude to the larger role America plays in the international community. Obama stated that &quot;our destinies are connected to those beyond our shores,&quot; and that America &quot;must always stand on the side of freedom and human dignity.&quot; These words were echoed when Ambassador Rapp took on the daunting task of explaining in one hour how international criminal law operates.  <br /><br />Rapp&#39;s lecture reiterated Obama&#39;s sentiment that the US has tried to be pro-active in humanitarian issues. In fact, his position was created by the Clinton administration in 1996, in response to the atrocities taking place in the former Yugoslavia, Sierra Leone, and Rwanda. It was interesting to hear that the US is the only country to have such an ambassador position. One of the first things that struck me about Rapp&#39;s lecture was how much he emphasized precedent when discussing America&#39;s future, and he was keen to mention the efforts of the Clinton administration in the international arena. While the conflicts in Kosovo, Rwanda, and Darfur are most relevant for law students, the international community has been working towards the policy of &quot;international justice&quot; since the Nuremberg trials. For me, the Nuremberg trials seem so distant, but they were the inspiration for Rapp&#39;s career, and he demonstrated that Nuremberg and its lessons are still relevant in today&#39;s conflicts.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Rapp,-Jalloh,-Crossley,-Nordenberg-713234.jpg"><img style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 245px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Rapp,-Jalloh,-Crossley,-Nordenberg-712840.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>While Rapp is certainly an expert in his field, I really appreciated how little time he actually spent on the legal issues the US faces. It seems strange that at a lecture at a law school, a prosecutor almost downplayed the intricacies of the law. Even in the briefest moments when Rapp did discuss the law, the issues grew to be vastly complex. Anyone who has ever studied international law can appreciate how difficult it is for multiple nations to agree on treaties and conventions. The simplest task of defining an issue (let alone the issue of &quot;genocide&quot;) becomes nearly impossible, as every country has its own perspective and political priorities. What struck me the most about Rapp&#39;s lecture then was that instead of focusing on the legal principles involved, he humanized the issue of genocide and remained both informative and personal. The part of the lecture that stood out for me was when Rapp told the story of a young Rwandan man who had lost every single member of his family to genocide but after the trial told Rapp that it was the happiest day of his life. A statement of guilt and accountability is exactly what Rapp and the international community work hard to provide for victims of genocide and the community at large.<br /><br />For Rapp, the reason the US and other countries began to get involved was, quite simply, because the world had failed in humanitarian efforts, namely, the 1994 Rwandan Genocide and the war crimes in the former Yugoslavia. In attempting to respect the UN principle of state sovereignty, the world allowed genocide to happen. Rapp stated: &quot;It is illegal for one man to hurt another - this is assault, how in multiplying it by a million is it not an illegal act?&quot; While other countries sat comfortably in safety, genocide happened, and it was important that the world held to account those responsible.<br /><br />That accountability is essentially why the US has played such a strong role in supporting international courts. The support from multiple nations is to send a message that through universal jurisdiction, criminals will not find safe havens after they have committed crimes against humanity. According to Rapp, the US will continue to work within the framework of international systems because it is only through multinational cooperation and resources that the world can bring such terrible crimes to an end.<br /><br /><br /><font style="font-size: 8pt" size="2">Mentioned in this article:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2010/01/28/us/politics/AP-US-Obama-State-of-the-Union-Text.html">2010 State of the Union Address</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.icty.org">International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/">The Special Court for Sierra Leone </a><br /><br /><br />Photos courtesy of: D.

		<title>IRAQ: Citizenship and Women&#039;s Rights under the Iraqi Constitution</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sara Burhan Abdullah, Pitt Law LLM &#39;08 and JD &#39;12, was an observer to the Iraqi Constitutional Review Committee. She shares her experiences with the issue of inheritance of citizenship and women&#39;s rights in her home country of Iraq...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><font size="3"><b>U</b></font>nder Saddam Hussein&#39;s dictatorial regime, children born of Iraqi women and foreign men could not inherit Iraqi citizenship, whereas children of Iraqi men and foreign women could. Iraqi women were also not allowed to travel outside the country without an escort of a father, brother, husband, or other close male relative, known in Arabic as a <i>mahram</i>. With the overthrow of Saddam Hussein&#39;s regime, however, these laws have been changed in favor of Iraqi women, and women&#39;s rights have generally increased. Thus, for example, the 2005 Iraqi Constitution clearly provides in Article 18 that a child born to an Iraqi father or an Iraqi mother is considered to be an Iraqi holding original Iraqi citizenship.<br /><br />As an externship student working in Baghdad on a US State Department grant managed by the University of Utah School of Law, one of my responsibilities was to attend the Constitutional Review Committee (CRC) as an observer. The CRC was responsible for amending the current Constitution and was composed of representatives from each of Iraq&#39;s major political blocs, including the Kurd, Sunni, and Shi&#39;a factions, as well as some other secular parties. A contentious issue discussed by the CRC members was Article 18, which proposed granting Iraqi citizenship to children born to only an Iraqi mother. This was opposed by some of the committee&#39;s members.<br /><br />I witnessed one of the committee&#39;s most vigorous arguments on this issue. The Kurds, supported by some of the Shi&#39;a Islamists, opposed any amendment to Article 18 that would discriminate against women while the primarily Sunni Islamist members argued that an Iraqi mother should not be able to pass on Iraqi citizenship to her children. While I was technically not allowed to participate in the discussion as a student observer, I could not stay silent, and I asked for permission to give an opinion.  I was motivated to speak because a child with an Iraqi mother and Iraqi father believes herself to be as much a citizen of her mother&#39;s country as her father&#39;s country. The idea that a child belongs solely to the country of her father and has no right to the country of her mother, even if she lives in her mother&#39;s country, suggests that her entire heritage devolves from her father alone. This constitutes unfair discrimination against a child born to only an Iraqi mother. Additionally, if a mother cannot pass on citizenship to her child, there is the possibility that her children would be without citizenship where the child lives in the mother&#39;s country of citizenship and the father&#39;s country requires the child to be resident in the father&#39;s country of citizenship in order to be a citizen. <br /><br />The committee chair nodded his assent, and the members listened to me speak. I asked the members in favor of amending Article 18 to explain the basis of their position. One CRC member stated that his objection stemmed from concerns surrounding dual citizenship. A representative from Kurdish bloc countered this by stating that the Constitution allows dual citizenship. Furthermore, the Kurds argued that if the goal were to reduce dual citizenship, Article 18 should have included children born to foreign women with Iraqi husbands, since Iraqi men marry foreigners in greater numbers than Iraqi women.<br /><br />The next day, I provided research to the committee about the number of countries which are signatories to the Convention for the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). CEDAW Article 9(2) prohibits the type of sex-based discrimination which the CRC was considering making law in an amendment to Article 18.  A few countries, including Iraq, have made reservations to Article 9(2), but most have not. My goal in providing the committee with this research was to encourage it to reconsider its views in light of the international community&#39;s position respecting women&#39;s rights. This had an effect on some Shi&#39;a Islamist parties, but was ignored by others.<br /><br />The committee finally agreed to amend the article so that it did not explicitly state the citizenship of child born to only one Iraqi parent. Rather, the CRC agreed that the legislative branch should speak to this issue.  I am certain that some parties will attempt to pass legislation which discriminates against Iraqi women who have children with foreign men. However, I would hope that women&#39;s rights activists would challenge the law under the separate equal protection clause of the Constitution which prohibits discrimination in the law on the basis of gender. From my perspective, it would appear that they would have an excellent case.<br /><br /><font style="font-size: 8pt" size="2">Mentioned in this Article:<br /><a href="http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/"><br />Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women</a></font></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Supreme Court&#039;s McDaniel ruling will have minimal impact on habeas corpus practice</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.russellhabeas.com/">Kent Russell</a> [Attorney, <a href="http://www.russellhabeas.com/">Russell and Russell</a>]: &quot;In <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-rules-habeas-reviews.php">McDaniel v. Brown</a>, a habeas petitioner unsuccessfully sought to vacate his conviction on the basis of admittedly flawed DNA evidence which grossly overstated the chances that the defendant was the person guilty of a brutal rape of a child. In my judgment, for the reasons stated below, this decision will have very limited effect on habeas corpus jurisprudence.<br /> <br />Most fundamentally, the main thrust of the Supreme Court&#39;s <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-559.pdf">decision</a> [PDF file] in <u>McDaniel</u> [PDF file] &#8212; that non-record evidence cannot be considered on habeas corpus &#8212; only applies to insufficiency of the evidence claims under <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/443/307/case.html">Jackson v. Virginia</a>. These claims [hereafter &quot;Jackson&quot; claims], which allege that there was insufficient evidence to convict the defendant as a matter of law, require that the habeas petitioner show that no reasonable jury would have convicted the defendant based on the evidence presented at the trial. This was always one of the toughest standards to meet, even in the pre-AEDPA era, in which federal judges were free to substitute their own judgment for that applied by the state court judges who upheld the jury&#39;s verdict on direct appeal. In the wake of <a href="http://www.treas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/legal/statutes/aedpa.pdf">AEDPA</a> [PDF file] &#8212; the 1996 federal habeas corpus law which provides that convictions obtained in state courts can only be overturned where the state court&#39;s decision was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable interpretation of US Supreme Court law &#8212; it is nearly impossible to win a Jackson-type claim on federal habeas corpus. Knowing this, habeas corpus lawyers rarely even make Jackson claims any more, much less expect to actually win them on habeas corpus.<br /> <br />Hence, for example, rather than bringing a Jackson claim, a contemporary habeas corpus attorney who believes that the defendant was convicted on weak evidence will much more commonly allege that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to bring before the court evidence which would have undermined the evidence introduced at trial. Such a claim has several advantages over a Jackson claim: First, Jackson claims are, by their very nature, based on the evidence that was introduced at trial, which means that they must be brought on direct appeal or are waived. Accordingly, a habeas lawyer making a Jackson claim starts out staring into the teeth of a state court ruling based on the four corners of the record, and there is virtually nothing &quot;new&quot; the habeas lawyer can bring to the table to change the equation. Furthermore, a Jackson claim must be evaluated by viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, which means that only the evidence pointing to conviction need be looked at to sustain the conviction under Jackson&#39;s tough test. Conversely, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is based on evidence not introduced at trial. Hence, habeas counsel is free to bring non-record evidence into the mix on habeas, thereby providing a new playing field that is different from the field on which the jury trial played out. Moreover, the standard of review for ineffective assistance of counsel claims requires a showing that it is reasonably probable that, had the jury heard the evidence that the ineffective trial lawyer failed to introduce, the outcome would have been more favorable to the defendant than it was. Although that is not an easy standard to satisfy, it&#39;s a heck of a lot easier than showing, in effect, that it&#39;s impossible that a reasonable jury would have convicted the defendant based on the trial evidence most favorable to the prosecution, which is what Jackson requires.<br /> <br />Similarly, rather than making a Jackson claim, a habeas lawyer seeking to show that faulty DNA evidence was responsible for convicting an innocent person (i.e., the situation in <u>McDaniel</u>) could have attacked the flawed DNA evidence head-on as having rendered the trial so fundamentally unfair as to have violated Due Process. There is a legitimate basis for such a claim, namely the Supreme Court decision in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/432/98/case.html">Manson v. Braithwaite</a>, which holds that the use of excessively suggestive identification evidence violates Due Process. If such a claim were successful, the habeas court would have to excise the offending evidence and then determine whether, based on the remaining evidence, the admission of the flawed evidence &quot;had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.&quot; Again, that is not easy to show, but it&#39;s a lot easier to do than showing the trial evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, was so weak that no rational jury would have convicted the defendant.<br /> <br />Coming back now to <u>McDaniel</u>, it&#39;s crucial to point out that the Supreme Court did not reject either an ineffective assistance of counsel claim or a Due Process claim on the merits. Rather, the Court declined to consider the Due Process claim because the petitioner&#39;s lawyers had waived it by failing to assert it at all in the state proceedings; and sent the case back to the Ninth Circuit to pass on the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, as that claim had been raised by the petitioner in state court but had not been evaluated or ruled upon by the Ninth Circuit, which only considered the flawed Jackson claim. Hence, the petitioner in <u>McDaniel</u> can still win on habeas corpus if the Ninth Circuit grants him relief on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim &#8212; a very real possibility since the US District Court did grant relief on this claim as well when the case was still at that level.<br />        <br />In sum, the Supreme Court&#39;s decision in <u>McDaniel</u>, which may not even resolve that case, will only have a wider impact by making it clear that habeas claims based solely on <u>Jackson</u> will have to sink or swim based on the evidence introduced at trial and not on the basis of new evidence submitted for the first time in federal court. Yet, that much was pretty clear before <u>McDaniel</u>, and Jackson claims are so rare anyway under AEDPA that <u>McDaniel</u>&#39;s overall impact on contemporary habeas corpus practice should be minimal.&quot;<br />

		<title>Recent FCPA indictments show escalation of enforcement focus against individuals</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.millerchevalier.com/hmoyer/"><strong>Homer Moyer</strong></a> [Member, <a href="http://www.millerchevalier.com/">Miller &amp; Chevalier</a>]: &quot;This week&#39;s highly publicized <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/doj-announces-indictments-against-22-in.php">arrest</a> of 22 corporate executives for violations of the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/docs/statute.html">Foreign Corrupt Practices Ac</a>t (FCPA) is newsworthy and in some respects unprecedented, but otherwise confirms FCPA enforcement trends that have been increasingly evident in recent years.  Unprecedented were the simultaneous arrests of 22 individuals, a number that surpassed the record-setting total of 19 individual arrests in 2009.  The detailed public briefing by senior officials of the Department of Justice, FBI, and US Attorneys Office, which followed the arrests, provided an unusual level of publicity, which media and blogs quickly relayed across the globe. <br /> <br />The enforcement focus on individual executives and employees reflects a continuing escalation of FCPA prosecutions of individuals, a trend that some enforcement officials have implied may be a more effective deterrent than corporate prosecutions.  These indictments will likely be followed by indictments of corporations in the arms and law enforcement products industry for which arrested individuals worked.  This pattern, which reverses the sequence found in most early FCPA enforcement actions, offers enforcement agencies the advantage of perfecting their cases against corporations through the testimony of individual employees who have been indicted and have then elected to cooperate with enforcement authorities.<br /> <br />The focus on an entire industry - conveniently demonstrated here by the arrest of numerous executives who had gathered in Las Vegas for an industry convention - is one that the Department of Justice and the SEC have evidenced in recent years and have, more recently, explicitly acknowledged.  These arrests echo what the Justice Department itself describes as past investigations that have concentrated on the oil and gas industry and on pharmaceuticals and medical device companies.  Officials have also acknowledged that an expansive investigation of corrupt payments to customs officials through customs brokers is ongoing. <br /> <br />In answer to questions, Justice Department officials stated that the use of undercover tactics, widely reported as a &quot;sting&quot; operation, is a &quot;natural outgrowth&quot; of increasing levels of FCPA enforcement and the expanded use of FBI resources.  As this investigation began more than two years ago, it would be a mistake to read into it any recent political or policy shifts, although it is another example of increasing international cooperation among enforcement authorities of different countries.  With 140 FCPA investigations still in the pipeline, there is a yet-to-be-defined universe of corporations and corporate executives for whom the lessons of this investigation may be relevant.&quot;<br />

		<title>Burmese democratic activist Nyi Nyi Aung faces barrage of trumped up charges</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.freedom-now.org/board.php">Beth Schwanke</a> [Legislative Counsel, <a href="http://www.freedom-now.org">Freedom Now</a>]: &quot;Nyi Nyi Aung is a Burmese-born American democracy activist who was arrested at the Rangoon, Burma airport on September 3, 2009. Nyi Nyi was attempting to visit his mother, also an imprisoned democracy activist, who has cancer and is being denied medical treatment by the Burmese junta.<br /><br />Nyi Nyi&#39;s detention and trial are gravely flawed under both Burmese and international law and he has suffered severe mistreatment by Burmese officials. He was denied food and sleep for a week, beaten, and denied medical treatment. This is a violation of the <span style="font-style:italic;">jus cogens</span> prohibition against torture. Nyi Nyi was denied consular access for two periods of over two weeks. This is a clear violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Further, Nyi Nyi has been denied regular access to counsel and an open trial in violation of Burma&#39;s Code of Criminal Procedure and Judiciary Law.<br /><br />In addition to these defects in Nyi Nyi&#39;s detention and trial, the charges against Nyi Nyi are pretextual; intended as punishment for his pro-democracy activities. The Burmese junta initially charged Nyi Nyi with violations of the State Protection Law and Emergency Act. These charges were dropped without explanation. Currently, Nyi Nyi is <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/myanmar-court-charges-us-citizen-with.php">charged</a> with a violation of Article 468 of the Burmese Penal Code for allegedly forging a Burmese national identity card. This carries a potential sentence of seven years. Nyi Nyi is also charged with two violations of Section 24 of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act for failing to declare US and Burmese currencies that he allegedley brought into Burma. These charges carry a potential sentence of three years. Finally, Nyi Nyi is charged with violating Section 6(3) of the 1951 Burma Immigration (Detention) Rules for failing to renounce his Burmese citizenship when he became a US citizen. This carries a potential sentence of two years. These charges are ever fluctuating.<br /><br />This latest round of charges fails to meet even a modicum of legitimacy. Even ignoring that the factual basis for these charges fails to meet any evidentiary standard, they are logically unsound. With regards to the forgery charge, Nyi Nyi had no need of a Burmese identity card - an American passport would (or should have) provided him with far more protections than a Burmese identity card. The currency charges are similarly unfounded. Nyi Nyi was arrested before he entered customs and therefore had no opportunity to declare his currencies.  Finally, as the junta&#39;s own witness, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs official, admitted, he is not aware of any other individual being charged with failing to renounce Burmese citizenship. He also admitted there is no process in Burmese Embassies abroad for former Burmese citizens wishing to renounce their citizenship to do so.<br /><br />Nyi Nyi Aung suffers severe violations of his human rights and faces twelve years in Burmese prison on trumped up charges, motivated to silence his activism.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ipacademy.org/about/people/39-detail.html"><strong>James Cockayne</strong></a> [Senior Fellow, <a href="http://www.ipinst.org">International Peace Institute</a>]: &quot;Vice-President Joe Biden&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-to-appeal-dismissal-of-charges.php">announcement</a> in Iraq that the US government will appeal the recent dismissal of federal criminal charges against five Blackwater private security contractors was a diplomatic necessity. It was designed to reassure Iraqi politicians and the Iraqi people of the Obama administration&#39;s good faith and sympathy, at a time when the administration is trying to moderate the tensions between Iraq&#39;s sectarian and political factions. But Biden&#39;s announcement does little to suggest that the US government has a clear strategy for putting in place an effective regulatory system for this global industry. And this is beginning to cause problems with US allies.<br /> <br />The prospects of such an appeal succeeding seem dim, given the damning story of a bungled investigation told by Judge Richardo Urbina&#39;s decision. That story highlights the complexity of providing effective accountability for the conduct of private companies operating in insecure foreign locations. Yet effective regulation is all the more pressing, in the context of the Afghan surge: US Central Command reported that between December 2008 and September 2009, the number of Department of Defense armed contractors surged 236% - from 3,184 to 10,712.<br /> <br />If the Obama administration wants to avoid a repeat in Afghanistan of the military, diplomatic and political costs the US incurred in Iraq from civilian casualties and property damage perpetrated by American and third-country security contractors, it needs to ensure that both the Department of Defense and Department of State are working towards an effective system of regulation and cross-border accountability, dealing with issues like cross-border evidence-sharing, access to justice, and incentives for investigation and prosecution. Both Defense and State have taken large strides towards more effective regulation in recent years. The Department of Defense has significantly strengthened the Defense Federal Acquisition Supplement, and improved oversight in theater by the military. State, likewise, has improved its contract oversight arrangements, and played a key role in the negotiation of the Red Cross-backed &quot;Montreux Document on Pertinent International Legal Obligations and Good Practices for States related to Operations of Private Military and Security Companies during Armed Conflict.&quot; Over 30 states, including Iraq and Afghanistan, have now agreed to that <a href="http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/montreux-document-170908/$FILE/ICRC_002_0996.pdf">Montreux Document</a> [PDF file]. But none of these steps have put in place an effective system of international regulation and cross-border accountability, as the Blackwater dismissal shows.<br /> <br />As recent steps by the UK make clear, US allies are growing impatient. The Department of Defense is now working with the Swiss government to develop a global industry Code of Conduct, but the drafts made public so far include merely the promise of the development of an &quot;international accountability mechanism&quot; in the future. This risks giving contractors, good and bad, a free ride as they can claim to abide by the industry Code, with no fear of consequences if in fact they do not. Many contractors, particularly in the UK, are concerned that this would provide a recipe for continued impunity for the &quot;bad apple&quot; operators, at their expense. As a result, the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office is convening multistakeholder discussions in the next two weeks, which will consider whether the UK should back a separate Code, with more effective implementation and enforcement arrangements. The result would be regulatory fragmentation, reduced market transparency and efficiency &#8212; and even greater barriers to justice for the victims of contractor misconduct.  Even a successful appeal of the Blackwater charges dismissal will not remedy that; only an effective strategy involving both the Departments of Defense and State will.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.heritage.org/about/staff/brettschaefer.cfm"><strong>Brett Schaefer</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.heritage.org/about/staff/StevenGroves.cfm">Steven Groves</a> [Fellows, <a href="http://www.heritage.org/">The Heritage Foundation</a>]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-war-crimes-ambassador-says-us.php">comments</a> by US Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues Stephen Rapp yesterday are a welcome confirmation of the concerns held by many Americans regarding the potential for overreach by the International Criminal Court and its prosecutor.  As Ambassador Rapp cautioned, there is a strong possibility that US military and political officials could be unfairly prosecuted by the ICC because of the breadth of US political and military interests.  Indeed, the ICC has opened an investigation into alleged war crimes in Afghanistan that could very easily involve American citizens and soldiers given America&#39;s leadership role in both the military operations and the political transition.  This situation and Rapp&#39;s valid concern underscore the need to preserve and expand America&#39;s network of bilateral <a href="http://www.ll.georgetown.edu/guides/article_98.cfm">Article 98 agreements</a> in which countries agree not to surrender US persons to the ICC without US permission.<br /><br />Ambassador Rapp&#39;s caution is especially welcome considering some comments by Obama administration officials indicating that the administration was greatly interested in expanding US ties and cooperation with the ICC, possibly to include seeking ratification of the Rome Statute.  That said, Ambassador Rapp&#39;s statement that no US President is likely to submit the Rome Statute to the Senate for advice and consent in the &quot;foreseeable future&quot; is hardly surprising.  President Clinton expressed grave concerns regarding the treaty and refused to submit the Statute to the Senate knowing that he did not have the 67 votes necessary for ratification.  Although support in the Senate may be higher now than in 2000, there is little indication that President Obama has the votes to clear that threshold.   <br /><br />But there is a world of space between ratification and current US policy.  The <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-war-crimes-ambassador-says-us.php">summary</a> of the Ambassador&#39;s remarks included a statement that the &quot;US should continue to support the work of international criminal tribunals.&quot; Does that mean that the Obama administration will seek to enhance US cooperation with the ICC?  The answer remains unclear.<br /><br />We think that they still wish to do so.  But to what extent and under what circumstances?  Will they seek to weaken legislative constraints on US cooperation with the ICC?  Will they seek to &quot;resign&quot; the Rome Statute?  Will they seek changes to the Rome Statute in the upcoming review conference in Uganda to alleviate US concerns?  If so, what specific changes will they pursue?  All of these questions remain unanswered.<br /><br />If the US is not seeking ratification, we think changes to US policy toward the ICC are unnecessary.  Indeed, the Bush administration was willing and able to support a Security Council resolution referring the situation in Darfur to the ICC.  Nothing prevents such &quot;a la carte&quot; cooperation with the ICC in the future.  However, the US should continue to seek changes to the Rome Statute and the Court&#39;s rules and regulations with the intent of alleviating US concerns.  The US owes its military and officials what protections and peace of mind it can provide.&quot;<div><br /></div><div><em>Brett D.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>John Washburn</strong> and <strong>Matthew Heaphy</strong> [Convener and Deputy Convener, <a href="http://www.amicc.org/">The American NGO Coalition for the ICC</a> (AMICC)]: &quot;According to the JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-war-crimes-ambassador-says-us.php">report</a> about Ambassador Stephen Rapp&#39;s January 28 speech at the University of Pittsburgh Law School, he made it clear that the US would not ratify the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a> of the International Criminal Court in the foreseeable future.  This is not surprising since the Obama administration is still struggling to determine its ICC policy.  Indeed, given the years of US hostility to the Court under the Bush administration and the lack of understanding of the ICC and its work in Congress and among the American people, it will take quite a while for a US president to decide to seek advice and consent to ratify the Rome Statute.  <p class="MsoNormal">Ratification of treaties in the United States is extraordinarily challenging in comparison to other countries because it requires the advice and consent of two-thirds of the US Senate.  Once a president submits a treaty to the Senate, it is referred to the Foreign Relations Committee for consideration and joins a long queue of other treaties.  If the FRC or the full Senate votes that treaty down, it goes back to the end of the line and it&#39;s very difficult to move it to the top of the Senate&#39;s agenda.  That is why it is best to build support for the Court in the US before seeking ratification.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal">In polls about 65% of Americans consistently respond that the US should join the ICC, though they know little about what the Court does or the crimes it is investigating.  Knowledge about the ICC in the US Government is also lacking, in part because the US stayed away from meetings of the ICC&#39;s governing body, the Assembly of States Parties (ASP), for eight years. That changed in November 2009 when President Obama authorized a US delegation to the Assembly&#39;s session in The Hague.  The US now also plans to participate as an observer in the ICC Review Conference to be held in Kampala, Uganda in May and June, 2010.  Hopefully the US will have a policy in place by that time.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal">The Review Conference could have a profound impact on the US relationship with the Court, and help determine whether the US can build a transparent, productive and cooperative relationship with the ICC.  The conference will decide on questions such as amendments to war crimes and activating the Court&#39;s jurisdiction over the crime of aggression.  There is also much for the US to learn about how the ICC operates, and that will take time.  It will also take time for the US to implement its new ICC policy once it is completed.  Ambassador Rapp is right to anticipate that US ratification is not foreseeable in the near future.  This should not be taken as meaning that the Obama administration is hostile to the Court.  The US presence at the ASP dramatically illustrated that the reverse is true.  We can expect that this positive attitude toward the Court will be reflected in the new policy.&quot;</p><br />

Lobo, who supported the coup, was &quot;elected&quot; under conditions that seem to take the region back to the heady Cold War days of the 1980s, Ronald Reagan, Contras, and Honduras&#39; very own death squad, the Battalion 3-16.  The majority of Hondurans boycotted the elections, as did reputable international observers.  Many candidates for other offices withdrew, and despite State Department insistence that the process was perfectly transparent, the UN declared that conditions for a fair election were not present. And just to further dramatize the scene, there were various political assassinations before and after the contest.  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:black;">It is also likely that the Lobo administration, along with its backers, is intent on reversing the direction of the Zelaya years.  No more talk of social justice, or new terms for debt, or pesky ideas about how to protect the public sector from more IMF sanctioned privatization, or serious proposals to reform a horrific Judiciary.  Despite the hundreds of thousands of protesters in a number of marches, the country seems back on track to the past.  There are even growing paramilitary protest squads back in place to deal with the dissenters.  Meet the new Honduras, the quintessential &quot;Banana Republic.&quot;</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:black;">While the Obama administration originally stood with the rest of the international community in condemning the coup and called for a restoration of democracy, it has seemingly begun to challenge the spirits of its forerunners.  It has been pushing other presidents in the hemisphere to recognize the Lobo government, while Secretary of State Clinton cited questionable figures from the illegally-appointed Honduran Supreme Electoral Tribunal to justify the election.  By breaking ranks with the bulk of Latin America&#39;s democratically-elected governments on confronting the Honduran crisis with democratic substance and not just form, Barrack Obama&#39;s administration had squandered whatever hope was left for a progressive turn in US-Latin American relations.  The White House seems to be telling the world that nothing new on this score will be coming out of Washington D.C.&quot;</span></p><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Andrea Prasow</strong> [Senior Counterterrorism Counsel, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a>]: &quot;On February 1, 2010, Maher Arar <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/arar-appeals-rendition-suit-to-supreme.php">asked</a> the US Supreme Court to overturn a lower court ruling that he cannot sue federal officials for damages even though they allegedly conspired with Syrian officials to subject him to torture in Syria.  A powerful <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/7b73738a-4146-4ae0-9e9d-7e451666e9f7/1/doc/06-4216-cv_opn2.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/7b73738a-4146-4ae0-9e9d-7e451666e9f7/1/hilite/">dissent</a> [PDF file] by Judge Guido Calabresi in the Second Circuit&#39;s <span style="font-style: italic;">en banc</span> review of the case criticized the majority for &quot;utter subservience to the executive branch&quot; and engaging in &quot;extraordinary judicial activism&quot; to deny Arar relief.<br /><br />Arar, a Syrian-born Canadian citizen, was mistakenly identified as a terrorist by Canadian authorities while transiting through JFK International Airport in New York.  Bush administration officials sent him to Syria where he was detained, interrogated and tortured for almost a year before being sent back to Canada.  The Canadian government engaged in an exhaustive public inquiry regarding Canada&#39;s involvement in the matter, concluded that Arar had no connection to terrorism, and awarded him a multi-million dollar settlement.  Yet the US government has done nothing to provide Arar with any form of redress &#8212; nor even acknowledged any wrongdoing.<br /><br />Arar&#39;s case is an important one for the Obama administration.  In the past year, the administration has done little to hold former officials accountable for authorizing torture or to provide redress for victims of torture.  Attorney General Eric Holder initiated a preliminary investigation into CIA abuses, but it appears to be limited to &quot;unauthorized&quot; interrogation techniques and will not examine wrongdoing up the chain of command.  The Justice Department&#39;s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) investigated possible ethical misconduct by its attorneys in connection with the &quot;torture memos&quot; and completed a draft of its report in December 2008.  Yet despite the Attorney General&#39;s promise to Congress that the OPR report would be available by the end of last year, it still has not been released.  And instead of repudiating renditions to foreign countries based on unenforceable and ineffectual &quot;diplomatic assurances&quot; that a person will not be subjected to torture, the task force charged with reviewing interrogation policy recommended that the US continue such transfers based on those assurances.<br /><br />Nor have individuals who have suffered abuse been successful at obtaining redress before the courts.  In asserting that even meritorious litigation should be summarily dismissed if it might lead to revelations of classified information, the Obama Justice Department has taken what it acknowledged in at least one case is &quot;exactly&quot; the same position as the Bush administration.  Its overbroad reading of the &quot;state secrets&quot; privilege denies torture victims the opportunity to even have their case considered by a federal judge.<br /><br />Civil suit for money damages is but one means of redress for victims of torture.  For Maher Arar, it is the only remaining avenue available to him in the US.  The Obama administration now has the opportunity to alter its opposition to his suit to permit some form of redress.  And if it does not, there is a risk the Supreme Court could interpret statutes granting some officials immunity to mean that victims of torture can never successfully hold their torturers accountable.  This would be a great tragedy for the fundamental right to redress for official wrongdoing, a foundation of the US justice system.&quot;<br />

		<title>Live Nation-Ticketmaster merger promotes competition in primary ticket sales market</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.thorpreed.com/html/the_lawyers/l0068.html">John C. Rodney</a></strong> [Partner, <a href="http://www.thorpreed.com/html/index.html">Thorp Reed &amp; Armstrong, LLP</a>]: &quot;When I first heard about the proposed Live Nation-Ticketmaster <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/doj-approves-live-nation-ticketmaster.php">merger</a>, in early 2009, my initial reaction was &quot;you have to be kidding.&quot;  How could the nation&#39;s leading concert promoter team up with the nation&#39;s leading ticket seller without that foreclosing competition in the live music industry in many geographic markets?  Surely the newly installed antitrust regulators in the Obama administration would put a stop to this.  But, following an extensive review involving not only the United States but many individual states and other countries as well, and a comprehensive settlement, the deal closed near the end of January 2010.<br /><br />This transaction illustrates two of the fundamental principles of antitrust law.  First, determining whether or not a transaction runs afoul of the law almost always turns on defining the markets.  Second, the law protects competition, not competitors.<br /><br />To a ticket buyer, Ticketmaster always seemed like a monopolist.  If it sells tickets to an event, you typically can&#39;t buy those tickets from anyone else, so the Ticketmaster &quot;convenience charge&quot; becomes part of the cost of the show.  Why isn&#39;t that a monopoly?  Well, the promoter could have set the ticket price at, say, $35 and then paid Ticketmaster $5 per ticket for selling the tickets, instead of setting the price at $30 and letting Ticketmaster add its own $5 convenience charge (some of which is typically rebated to the promoter or venue anyway).  Or, the promoter could sell the tickets itself, which is what Live Nation had started to do before it agreed to buy Ticketmaster.  Moreover, in a world where the physical ticket doesn&#39;t exist until it is purchased and then printed, having multiple outlets all trying to sell the same tickets simply doesn&#39;t work.  So, while there may be a superficial appeal to the conclusion that Ticketmaster creates a monopoly at the individual event level, that really isn&#39;t the market of concern because the event promoter has a legitimate monopoly over its own tickets and, insofar as this analysis is concerned, can sell the tickets by itself or however it wishes.  So, there is no market in which competition is being foreclosed.<br /><br />So what&#39;s the problem?  The major problem here related to Live Nation&#39;s large market share in major live event promotion and its control over many of the nation&#39;s major event venues (over a third) combined with Ticketmaster&#39;s over 80% share of the primary ticket reseller market.  Could Live Nation limit the events it controls to arenas that use Ticketmaster to sell their tickets?  That could certainly tend to foreclose competition in the ticket sales business because unless a venue signed up with Ticketmaster, it couldn&#39;t get the hot acts that Live Nation promotes.  Could Ticketmaster refuse to sell tickets for an act unless the act agreed to let Live Nation be its promoter?  For a company with over 80% of the market, that could be a big concern.  Another important antitrust aspect of the transaction is that, in 2008, Live Nation started its own ticket selling company and offered those services to third parties.  Live Nation was starting to get some traction with other venues and promoters.  Another problem is that the switching costs for an arena or promoter that doesn&#39;t want to do business with its competitor, Live Nation, could be significant, thus further cementing Ticketmaster&#39;s position at non-Live Nation venues.  In addition, for major acts, the onslaught of ticket buyers in the first few minutes tickets go on sale requires a major investment in IT infrastructure and software, but only Ticketmaster has the volume of business to support that investment.<br /><br />What did the Department of Justice do about all this?  Rather than filing suit to stop the merger, it required Ticketmaster and Live Nation to agree to several divestitures and other changes that would promote competition in the market for primary ticket sales.  All of that is <a href="http://www.justice.gov/atr/cases/f254500/254544.htm">explained</a> in the Competitive Impact Statement filed pursuant to the Tunney Act and currently available for public comment.  The settlement was designed to create competition in the two key portions of the market - primary ticket reselling at multiple venues, and promoter controlled ticket sales.  It did that by mandatory licensing or sale arrangements with two of the nation&#39;s largest live entertainment companies.  In addition, Ticketmaster and Live Nation agreed not to retaliate against venue owners who get primary ticketing services from third parties or require venues to use Ticketmaster ticketing services in order to book acts promoted by Live Nation.  They also have to make customer data available to existing customers who switch ticketing services or to other promoters under certain circumstances.<br /><br />The bottom line, though, is that the two companies were allowed to merge.  So, does this mean that the Obama administration has abandoned its vow to enforce the antitrust laws and we&#39;re going to see the Reagan/Bush eras of vanishing antitrust enforcement again?  I don&#39;t think so.  What we have here is exactly what we ought to have, i.e., two private companies being allowed to pursue the merger, but with competition in the market protected.  In fact, the settlement itself is structured so that there should be significantly more competition in the market than there would have been had the transaction never happened.  Still, we&#39;ll have to wait and see just how all this plays out because, as Puff Daddy sang, &quot;It&#39;s All About the Benjamins.&quot;&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.blogger.com/URL%20of%20your%20webpage"><strong></strong></a><strong><a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/about_us/staff/hicks_n.aspx">Neil Hicks</a></strong> [International Policy Advisor, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/index.aspx">Human Rights First</a>]: &quot;The leaders of the Islamic Republic know well the value of violence and brutality as political control mechanisms.  In recent months, the authorities have unleashed random beating of protesters, arbitrary detention and torture, apparently including rape of detainees, running down protesters with motor vehicles,  shooting with live ammunition into crowds of unarmed demonstrators resulting in fatalities, and apparent targeted killings.  The recent <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/iran-executes-2-for-post-election.php">executions</a> of two young men, Mohammed Reza Ali Zamani and Arash Rahmanipour, after legal proceedings that violated Iranian law as well as international standards, and the threat, encouraged by hardliners like Ayatollah Jannati, the Chair of the Council of Guardians, to execute <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/iran-planning-execution-of-9-more.php">more</a> alleged protesters, are a piece of this long-established strategy of state terror to quell dissent.<br /><br />But the authorities are trying to achieve more through the earlier show trials and these recent exemplary executions.  Not only do they wish to sow fear and deter further protest, they also hope to take control of the narrative of the post-election protests that have produced the deepest political crisis in Iran since the early years of the Islamic Republic.<br /><br />Leaders of the opposition movement like presidential candidates, Mir Hossein Mousvai and Mehdi Karroubi, and former president Mohamed Khatami, have sought to characterize the opposition as the true defenders of the Islamic Republic and of the constitutional and democratic values that were the aspirations of some of its founders.  The color of the opposition is Islamic green; the opposition does not hesitate to claim Muslim holy days as occasions to advance its cause and there is a contest over who can claim the legacy of the late founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini.  There is some irony, and not a little justice, in the spectacle of Khomeini&#39;s flexibility and chameleon qualities &#8212; traits that he used ruthlessly to outwit and outmaneuver his one time leftist and liberal democratic allies in the overthrow of the monarchy and to secure his grip on power &#8212; now being used by the opposition to challenge the absolute authority of the office of Leader of the Islamic Republic that he created for himself.<br /><br />To counter this narrative the authorities are anxious to demonstrate that the opposition has no legitimacy, is subservient to foreign interests and that its prime instigators are unpopular violent opposition groups.  Prior to his execution, Arash Rahmanipour confessed to his role in plotting post-election protests on behalf of the People&#39;s Mojahedine of Iran, an organization associated with acts of political violence and terrorism in Iran, much derided among Iranians for having sided with Saddam Hussein against Iran in the Iran-Iraq war.  In fact, Rahmanipour seems to have been a confused young man who had only slight contact with the PMOI and no involvement whatsoever in the post-election protest movement.  (He had, in fact, been in prison since March 2009, three months before the elections even took place.)  Zamani was convicted of being a member of an obscure organization supportive of the restoration of the monarchy and also has no connections to the opposition movement.  The authorities seem to be operating on the principle that if a lie is repeated often enough and loud enough, people will come to believe it.<br /><br />Time will tell whether the opposition will be cowed by these crude tactics.  The anniversary of Khomeini&#39;s triumphant return to Iran and the creation of the Islamic Republic 31 years ago is fast approaching.  There will be further protests to mark this occasion and the authorities will again make the calculation of how much violence is needed to contain them.  Opposition leaders are emphasizing that the forces that made the revolution were strengthened when the Shah&#39;s security agencies used excessive force against demonstrators and were swept aside by public outrage.  There are no doubt arguments among historians as to whether that is an accurate description of events three decades ago; even more unknown is whether that history will repeat itself in 2010 with the regime&#39;s brutal overreach sowing the seeds of its own downfall.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.crimlawfed.com/qualifications.html">Jon May</a></strong> [Attorney, <a href="http://www.crimlawfed.com/">Law Offices of May and Cohen PA</a>]: &quot;On Monday, January 25, 2010, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-noriega.php">denied</a> General Manuel Noriega&#39;s petition for certiorari review.  But the case before the Court is hardly at an end.  Counsel for General Noriega will file a petition for rehearing on February 19, 2010.  While it is rare for the Court to grant such a petition, it did so in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/553/06-1195/">Boumediene v. Bush</a>, which struck down Section 7 of the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/PL-109-366.pdf">Military Commissions Act of 2006</a> [PDF file] as unconstitutional.  In <u>Noriega</u>, defense counsel are seeking the same ruling as to Section 5 of the MCA.<div><br /></div><div>Justice Thomas wrote a 15-page <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/orders/courtorders/012510zor.pdf#page=14">dissent</a> from the denial of certiorari that was joined by Justice Scalia.  Justice Thomas argued that the issues raised in General Noriega&#39;s case should be considered now because they apply to a large number of persons being detained by the United States.  General Noriega&#39;s petition &quot;presents an opportunity to decide the constitutionality...of federal statutes...in time to guide courts and the political branches in resolving difficult questions concerning the &quot;proper exercise of governmental power...and...spare detainees and the Government years of unnecessary litigation.</div><div><br /></div><div>General Noriega&#39;s case addresses an issue left undecided by the Court, which is whether Section 5 so narrows the scope of habeas review under <a href="http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/uscode/28/VI/153/2241">28 U.S.C. &Acirc;&sect;2241</a> that it &quot;effectively works a suspension of the writ.&quot;  Review would also likely settle such questions as whether the Geneva Conventions are self-executing and whether the federal courts may classify detainees as POWs, as United States District Court Judge William Hoeveler did for General Noriega.  As Justice Thomas observed, &quot;addressing these questions now...would avoid years of litigation and uncertainty no matter what we conclude on the merits.&quot; At this juncture, General Noriega only needs two more Justices to agree that it is in the national interest to reach these issues now.&quot;</div><br />

		<title>Proposed French ban on burqas alienates Muslim minority</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.blogger.com/URL%20of%20your%20webpage"><strong></strong></a><strong><a href="http://www.becketfund.org/index.php/person/27.html">Angela C. Wu</a></strong> [International Law Director, <a href="http://www.becketfund.org/index.php">The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty</a>]: &quot;The French Parliament has issued a <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/france-burqa-ban-proposal-likely.php">report</a> recommending a ban on the burqa in government-run venues such as public transportation and hospitals.  The 200 page report, published on January 26th by a special committee of parliamentarians, was commissioned to study the role of the veil in France and came just shy of recommending a ban in all public places in France.  The burqa or niqab is a full face covering that some Muslim women wear in public.  President Nicolas Sarkozy declared in a speech to the French Parliament last June that the burqa is a symbol of women&#39;s &quot;subservience,&quot; and that it is incompatible with the &quot;French republic&#39;s idea of women&#39;s dignity.&quot; The debate over the burqa, fueled by Sarkozy&#39;s speech, is a part of a national campaign asking what it means to be French.<br /><br />Unfortunately, a burqa ban will not ease France&#39;s national identity insecurities, nor will it aid the integration of the country&#39;s sizeable Muslim minority.  More importantly, the debate fails to take into account the possibility that the burqa could be for some women a sincere nonviolent expression of conscience.  Ironically, the ban disrespects the individual conscience of pious Muslim women by assuming they can&#39;t make their own decisions.<br /><br />France is a signatory to the <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/b3ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR), in which Article 18 requires the protection of freedom of thought, conscience, and religion.  The official commentary to Article 18 makes it clear that the &quot;freedom to manifest religion or belief&quot; includes the &quot;wearing of distinctive clothing or headcoverings.&quot;  Article 18 also accounts for the balancing of rights against other interests, such as &quot;public safety, order, health or morals, or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others.&quot;  However, the debate surrounding the burqa raises the question of the motives behind the ban.  Without accommodations for conscience and a clear vision of some legitimate public interest at stake, the French will be making it clear to its own citizens and to the world that the ban is a pretext for alienating Muslims.<br /><br />The uproar over the burqa ban is an example of the majority expressing its insecurity by making use of an easy political target: a very small, distinct minority of about 2000 women in France who wear the veil.  The ban will affect so few people that it will be nearly invisible except as a political talking point.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnists <a href="http://www.nesl.edu/faculty/hansen.cfm">Victor Hansen</a> and <a href="http://www.nesl.edu/faculty/Friedman.cfm">Lawrence Friedman</a> of New England Law | Boston say that despite his campaign promises, it seems that President Obama has made the political calculation that anything other than the indefinite detention of 49 current Guantanamo detainees is simply not worth the political risk....<br /><hr size=1> <br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/victorhansennew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td><img src="/forumy/lawrencefriedmannew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>L</strong></font>ast week, a presidential task force charged with assessing the feasibility of prosecuting suspected terrorists currently detained at Guantanamo Bay finished its evaluation of the cases. Relying upon the work of the task force, President Obama has concluded that of the remaining detainees, 110 should be repatriated or released to a third county, 40 should be tried either in federal court or by military commission, and 49 should be detained indefinitely without trial because they are too difficult to prosecute and too dangerous to release.   <br /><br />The decision to detain these individuals without trial is not unexpected. In spite of then-candidate Obama's promises, it seems President Obama has made the political calculation that to provide these suspects any additional legal process is simply not worth the political risk. <br /><br />Indeed, the administration's decision was foreshadowed by an earlier action last spring.  Before assuming office and in his first few months thereafter, President Obama acknowledged that there may be some detainees at Guantanamo who could not be tried or released. The President indicated that he would seek additional Congressional authorization to develop criteria, and standards to govern the indefinite detention of these individuals.  Just a few months later, the President announced that he would not seek additional authorizations, and that the Authority to Use Military Force (AUMF), enacted immediately after September 11, afforded him the necessary authority to detain individuals without trial indefinitely.  <br /><br />The reason for the change may lie in the anticipation of the political opposition the President faced from both parties when he announced that some of the Guantanamo detainees would be moved to the United States as part of his plan to close the detention facility.  Congress even took steps to deny the President funding to transfer detainees to the United States, as well as imposing a notice requirement.  <br /><br />The vocal and swift opposition to the President's plan may suggest a lack of political will to deal with the thorny issue of indefinite detention. <br /><br />To be sure, among the many difficult issues raised by the Guantanamo detentions, the question of what to do with individuals who cannot be tried or released is particularly challenging. We do not know very much about these 49 detainees. They may be the worst of the worst&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;or at least the worst of the rest&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;but it also may be that the United States can no longer bring them to justice for practical reasons. <br /><br />Consider that trying some of these individuals could expose intelligence sources, as well as intelligence-gathering means and methods&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;though that risk is significantly reduced under the new military commission rules that establish procedures for dealing with sensitive information.  Consider also that some of these detainees likely were subjected to interrogation techniques so coercive as to taint any evidence that could be brought against them in federal court or in military commissions.   <br /><br />At the same time, the decision not to seek additional Congressional authorization for the indefinite detention of these 49 detainees, and those similarly-situated terrorism suspects the United States may capture in the future, is troublesome. At the most fundamental level, it sets a dangerous precedent that can be repeated and expanded any time the Executive determines that indefinite detention or similar action is in the best interests of national security. <br /><br />In addition, the President's decision not to seek and obtain Congressional support and authorization for such action makes that decision much more likely to be subjected to challenge in the courts. If we have learned anything from the testing of President George W. Bush's terrorism policies before the courts, it is that Congressional involvement from the start likely would have resulted in less wasted effort in developing the legal means to address terrorism suspects and detainees.   <br /><br />Further, the lack of transparency in President Obama's decision-making leaves us to wonder about the real reasons for the continued detention of these individuals, fostering continued doubts about the government's ability to make accurate assessments of such individuals. At this point, we may rightly ask whether, in light of the many policy failures over the past eight years and the government's poor record of deciding which terror suspects are in fact the "worst of the worst," these 49 detainees really pose the kind of threat that the government alleges.  <br /><br />Finally, the President's decision once again backseats Congress on a major issue of national security, an issue that may have a serious domestic impact. Clear statutory authority from Congress permitting the President to indefinitely detain those who pose a danger to the citizens of the United States would go a long way toward alleviating the expressed fears about trying some terror suspects in Article III courts, and about closing the detention facility at Guantanamo.   <br /><br /><br /><em>Victor Hansen teaches criminal law and criminal procedure and Lawrence Friedman teaches constitutional law and state constitutional law at New England Law | Boston.

Obama explained that Bernanke, a scholar of the Great Depression during his tenure in academia, had helped save the nation from entering another such historic economic calamity.  <br /><br />Inside the island's Oak Bluffs Elementary School,  Bernanke was standing by Obama's side, as the president recited how the Fed Chair had saved "a financial system on the verge of collapse with calm and wisdom, with bold action and out-of-the-box thinking that has helped put the brakes on our economic free fall.&quot;  The president gave extra credit to the Fed Chair for "bold, persistent experimentation [that] has brought our economy back from the brink.&quot;<br /><br />Acting on a law professor's instinct, Obama summarized his argument for the reappointment in a simple four-part test:  Bernanke was being reappointed "because of his background, his temperament, his courage, and his creativity."  It is five months later and the four-part test still proves true. But, now we are just days away from the January 31 expiration of his appointment. With the additional resource of the fulsome analysis of Ben Bernanke provided by Time Magazine's 2009 Person of the Year issue, the exercise could be quickly completed by detailing each of the four criteria.<br /><br />Of course the Fed chief has made a few missteps, but that just means he's human.  Some critics say he did too much; others say too little.  But, have no doubt,  he was exactly the right person to calmly and creatively lead the Fed during the worst financial crisis that the nation has faced in the last seventy years.  And, he is exactly the right person to finish the job of unwinding his creative economic interventions as the nation's economy slowly improves. <br /><br />According to his own speech at the Oak Bluffs Elementary School,  Bernanke is fully committed to continuing to "promote growth and prosperity" while maintaining "an environment of price stability." Ben Bernanke knows well from his South Carolina roots the generational tragedy of job losses. Dr. Bernanke well knows his economic history regarding how inflation can quickly burn out of control. He will strike the right balance.<br /><br />But for full credit, the exercise answer should perhaps break the rules and challenge the completeness of the question.  The raging debate over Bernanke's reappointment is also about the broken Senate confirmation process wherein nominee defamation and floor vote delay are commonplace.   Most troubling is the increasing occurrence of individual senators placing procedural holds &#8212; a type of mini-filibuster &#8212; against a nomination which requires a 60 vote cloture process.  <br /><br />This Senate rule requirement of a 60-vote confirmation process runs counter to the Constitution's  Article II, Section 2 design according to which the president nominates and the Senate is limited to ratifying or rejecting the choice by a simple majority vote.   Many thoughtful people both inside and outside the Republic's upper chamber are asking that this rule be changed.  When the rule change was fully debated in 2005,  it was misnamed the 'Nuclear Option," but it would have been better branded as the "Constitutional Option."<br /><br />In hindsight,  perhaps President Obama, while at the Oak Bluffs Elementary School last August, should have taken advantage of recess.  Our founders wisely provided an alternative process for federal appointments.   Clause 3 of Article II, Section 2 states that &quot;[t]he President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the end of their next Session.&quot;  Alexander Hamilton explained in Federalist No. 67 that this "auxiliary method of appointment" was needed for those vacancies "which it might be necessary for the public service to fill without delay.&quot;  <br /><br />As President Obama considers the 300 other federal executive, regulatory, and judicial vacancies, this might be an answer worth considering.  The two law professor nominees whose DOJ jobs will be to establish legal policy and help pick federal judges (Dawn Johnsen for OLC and Christopher Schroeder for OLP) have been blocked by partisan Senate obstruction for months. It is past time to call recess.<br /><br />As open book exercise answers are usually limited in word count, however, there may not be enough space to detail the validity, history, and practicality of the recess commissioning process.    <br />    <br /><br /><em>Victor Williams is a clinical assistant professor at Catholic University of America School of Law and an attorney in Washington, D.C.

With the 2006 release of the 14 "high-value" al-Qa'eda detainees held by the CIA in "undisclosed" locations, all enemy combatant detainees are currently held either at Bagram Air Force Base in Afghanistan (about 800) or the American run detention facility, Camp Delta, at Guantanamo Bay (GTMO), Cuba (about 200).  <br /><br />Under the rule of law associated with armed conflict, all al-Qa'eda and Taliban detainees are unlawful enemy combatants or &quot;unprivileged enemy belligerents&quot;, as the recently passed 2009 Military Commissions Act labels them.  As such, these individuals are not entitled to Miranda rights, nor are they entitled to the special protections associated with prisoners of war. <br /><br />Under the law of war, the purpose of detaining these unprivileged enemy belligerents is to ensure that they do not return to join enemy forces and, in this unique situation, to allow American officials the opportunity to gather any necessary intelligence about the terrorists' organizational infrastructure, financial network, communication system, weapon supply lines, and plans for future terror attacks. As is the practice in all wars, the purpose of detention is not to punish the enemy combatant, but to protect the host nation from future acts of violence by the enemy.  <br /><br />The first good news in the detention issue is that President Obama has not been able to fulfill his stern promise to close the detention facility at GTMO by January 2010, or sooner, because of the "perception" that the United States is in some way acting outside of the rule of law.  Of course, this reasoning is incorrect.  In reality we are at "War with Al-Qa'eda" and GTMO is therefore perfectly lawful.  Indeed, closing GTMO would only provide a significant propaganda victory to our enemies, not a public relations victory.   <br /><br />In addition, during the first year of the Obama Administration, few seemed the least bit curious about where we were sending al-Qa'eda detainees if not to GTMO.  In fact, they were and are being sent to join the hundreds and hundreds of al-Qa'eda and Taliban unprivileged enemy belligerents at Bagram, Air Force Base.  The same legal authority that allows the United States to lawfully detain al-Qa'eda and Taliban fighters at GTMO is used at Bagram.  In other words, if President Obama believes that we need to apologize for GITMO and close it down, then we certainly need to apologize for the far larger detention facility at Bagram and close it down.   <br /><br />To be sure, this double standard has not been lost on detainees at Bagram.  In the past year, at least four separate lawsuits were filed in the federal district court in Washington DC by individuals captured outside Afghanistan seeking, among other things, the right of habeas review of their status as "enemy combatants."  When the cases were consolidated, the Obama Administration strongly argued that the four were not entitled to habeas review because they were in fact enemy combatants and lawfully detained under the applicable law of war and Congress's 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF). Unfortunately for the United States, in each case (except for a detainee who was a citizen of Afghanistan), the federal court ruled against the Obama Administration.  Relying on <em>Boumediene v. Bush</em> (2008), the federal district court held that the Constitution guarantees habeas rights to Bagram detainees. <br /><br />Clearly, the granting of habeas to unprivileged enemy belligerents in far off Afghanistan poses serious difficulties for the Obama Administration, but this matter may well be overcome by the second piece of good news associated with detention issues.  In early January 2010, the Afghan Defense Ministry announced that it had agreed to take over the new 60-million-dollar (US funded) Bagram detention facility by the end of 2010.  This means that the Afghan government would be solely responsible for detaining and prosecuting all detainees.  If this comes to pass, the United States may be able to close a significant chapter in dealing with the vast majority of the unprivileged enemy belligerents captured in the War on Terror.   Good news indeed.<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Jeffrey F. Addicott [Lt. Col. (ret.)

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.williamgeorgeross.com/">William G. Ross</a> of Cumberland School of Law, Samford University, says that although a president should naturally be careful to avoid demonstrating disrespect for the Supreme Court, the remarks President Obama recently made about the Court&#39;s decision in <u>Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</u> during the State of the Union address did not in any way derogate judicial independence or encourage any defiance of the Court's decision....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forumy/williamrossnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><strong>P</strong></font>resident Obama's pungent criticism of a very recent and highly controversial U.S. Supreme Court decision during his State of the Union address last week raises important questions about the proper manner in which a president should express objections to the Court's decisions.  Many Americans, including many Democrats, believe that Obama's remarks about the Court's five-to-four January 21 decision invalidating certain limitations on corporate spending in political campaigns were disrespectful to the Court and insensitive to the doctrines of judicial independence and separation of powers, particularly since the Justices were present at the State of the Union address. Considered in context, however, Obama's remarks were not improper, although they might have been somewhat imprudent.<br /><br />First, it is important to point out that Obama criticized only one judicial decision, <u>Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</u>. He did not attack the Court itself or impugn the good faith or motives of any individual justice. Although he objected to the manner in which the Court exercised its power of judicial review in a particular case, he did not express any objection to the Court's power of judicial review or even remotely imply that he supported any kind of curtailment of the Court's institutional powers. In contrast with earlier periods of American history, when controversial Supreme Court opinions often provoked calls for abridgment or abolition of the power of judicial review, the adverse reaction to <u>Citizens United</u> has not generated any assault on the Court itself. <br /><br />To the extent that Obama believes that <u>Citizens United</u> could have baneful consequences for the integrity of American democracy, he appropriately used the "bully pulpit" of a State of the Union address to warn about the decision's deleterious impact and to call for measures to counteract it. Obama is hardly alone, for his dismay over <u>Citizens United</u> is shared by countless Americans and by many members of Congress, who are trying to formulate legislation that will overcome or at least ameliorate its effects. Indeed, one of the harshest criticisms of the decision originated on the Court itself. Justice Stevens, in a dissent joined by Justices Ginsberg, Breyer, and Sotomayor, warned that the decision "will undoubtedly cripple the ability of ordinary citizens, Congress, and the States to adopt even limited measures to protect against corporate domination of the electoral process." <br /><br />Moreover, Obama's remarks about <u>Citizens United</u>, which displayed a forthrightness that many of his liberal critics found refreshing, were far from intemperate. Here is what Obama actually said:<blockquote>With all due deference to separation of powers, last week the Supreme Court reversed a century of law to open the floodgates for special interests &#8212; including foreign corporations &#8212; to spend without limit in our elections. Well, I don't think American elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests, and worse, by foreign entities. They should be decided by the American people, and that's why I'd urge Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps corrects some of these problems.</blockquote>Despite the widespread commentary about Obama's remarks about <u>Citizens United</u> in his State of the Union address, Obama's far more trenchant remarks on the day on which the Court announced <u>Citizens United</u> have attracted little notice or criticism. In this statement, Obama declared that "With its ruling today, the Supreme Court has given a green light to a new stampede of special interest money in our politics. It is a major victory for big oil, Wall Street banks, health insurance companies and the powerful interests that marshal their power every day in Washington to drown out the voices of everyday Americans." Obama may have felt that he needed to tone down his remarks for the highly formal occasion of the State of the Union address, particularly because the Supreme Court justices were present. <br /><br />Obama's words arguably were more moderate than many passages of Stevens's dissenting opinion. In addition to his warning about "corporate domination of the political process," Stevens disparaged the Court's opinion as "a rejection of the common sense of the American people, who have recognized a need to prevent corporations from undermining self-government since the founding, and who have fought against the distinctive corrupting potential of corporate electioneering since the days of Theodore Roosevelt." <br /><br />Although some critics of Obama's speech contend that Obama lied about the Court's decision insofar as he alleged that it could permit foreign corporations to bankroll American elections, many lawyers and scholars believe that the decision could have exactly this effect even though the decision technically addressed only a provision of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 that concerned domestic corporations and even though the decision did not overturn restrictions on direct campaign contributions. The danger of foreign influence would appear to be particularly significant since even many "domestic" corporations actually are owned mostly or largely by foreign interests. Indeed, in his dissent Stevens warned that the decision "would appear to afford the same protection to multinational corporations controlled by foreigners as to individual Americans." While one might disagree with Obama's statement about foreign corporations--as did Justice Samuel Alito, who indignantly mouthed "not true" when Obama made this allegation&#8212;-it is not fair to say that Obama lied. It also is unfair for some of Obama's critics to claim that he lied by alleging that <u>Citizens United</u> reversed a century of precedent. Although the decision technically rejected precedents dating back no farther than 1990, Justice Stevens explained in his dissent that "[t]he Court today rejects a century of history when it treats the distinction between corporate and individual campaign spending as an invidious novelty born of Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U.S. 652 (1990)." If Obama lied, then so did Stevens and the three other dissenters. <br /> <br />There is likewise little basis for objecting to Obama's criticism of even one individual decision on the basis that any presidential criticism of a judicial decision tends to discredit the Court and hinder the enforcement of its decisions. Obama's criticism of Citizens United does not create such a danger, although this kind of a threat could arise in other types of cases. Since the Court--as Alexander Hamilton famously pointed out in No. 78 of The Federalist--has neither the power of the purse nor the power of the sword, it is dependent upon the goodwill of the executive and legislative branches of the federal and state governments and of the American people for the enforcement of its decisions. A president therefore should be particularly careful about criticizing any decision that could encounter widespread defiance.<br /><br />For example, enforcement of the Supreme Court's controversial decisions during the 1960s expanding the procedural rights of criminal defen
dants depended upon compliance by countless police officers and state judges. Although there is no indication that Lyndon Johnson opposed these decisions, any criticism by him of decisions such as <u>Miranda v. Arizona</u> (1966) while he was president could have encouraged law enforcement officials to ignore, evade, or even defy the Supreme Court's rulings. Similarly, the Supreme Court's widely unpopular decision barring prayer in public school, <u>Engel v. Vitale</u> (1962), required compliance by tens of thousands of schools and hundreds of thousands of teachers. The decision was difficult to enforce, and at least some schools ignore it even today. President Kennedy was wise to publicly urge respect for the decision, explaining to its opponents that there was an "easy remedy" insofar as "we can pray a good deal more at home, we can attend our churches with a good deal more fidelity, and we can make the true meaning of prayer much more important in the lives of our children." Likewise, the Supreme Court's principal school desegregation decision, <u>Brown v. Education</u> (1954), required the goodwill of countless parents and compliance by a wide array of school boards, state legislators, and governors. President Eisenhower, who had severe misgivings about <u>Brown</u>, has been criticized for making public endorsements of the decision that were so lukewarm and ambiguous that they may have discouraged compliance. Efforts to compel public officials to comply with <u>Brown</u> often required costly and protracted litigation by civil rights groups that had difficulty financing such litigation. Similarly, the costs of efforts to enforce <u>Engel</u> or the Court's criminal procedure decisions would have had to have been borne in many cases by under-financed religious minorities or impoverished criminal defendants.<br /><br />In stark contrast to these earlier cases, <u>Citizens United</u> is not a decision that the Supreme Court should have any difficulty enforcing. The Federal Elections Commission is the only agency that could directly frustrate the Court's decision, and any attempt by the Commission to try to enjoin the types of activity permitted by the Court's decision would attract widespread public attention and provoke litigation by well financed corporations. <br /><br />Finally, complaints about Obama's criticism of <u>Citizens United</u> are misplaced to the extent that they underestimate the extent to which previous presidents have criticized the Court and its decisions. Although presidents usually have been circumspect about making public comments concerning Supreme Court decisions, presidential criticism of such decisions has been far from unknown. In 1989, for example, President George Bush advocated a constitutional amendment to overturn the Court's decision in <u>Texas v. Johnson</u>, which nullified a state statute that criminalized flag burning. Although Bush signed a federal statute to criminalize flag burning, he continued to express preference for a constitutional amendment. When the Court two years later invalidated a similar federal law in <u>United States v. Eichman</u>, Bush immediately advocated another constitutional amendment.<br /><br />Presidential criticism of the Court's decisions probably would be even more common if presidents had not so often agreed with the outcome of decisions or had not believed that criticism could offend important blocs of voters. Franklin D. Roosevelt, for example, generally refrained from criticism of the Court after the Court during 1935 and 1936 nullified several of his New Deal measures because he feared that such criticism could backfire. In a press conference in 1935, he complained that the Court's decisions were relics of the "horse and buggy definition of interstate commerce," but he otherwise was silent until early in 1937, when his Court-packing proposal and his harsh remarks about the Court inspired widespread disapproval that culminated in congressional rejection of his plan to add up to six justices to the Court. <br /><br />Although Obama's criticism of <u>Citizens United</u> in his State of the Union address probably is the strongest statement that a president ever has made about a recent Supreme Court decision in any State of the Union speech, other presidents have used the State of Union to make points about judicial decisions. As recently as 2004, President Bush tacitly criticized the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts's recent decision on same-sex marriage, alleging that "activist judges have begun redefining marriage by court order, without regard for the will of the people and their elected representatives." Bush implied that he supported a constitutional amendment to overturn the decision. Although President Reagan never mentioned <u>Roe v. Wade</u> by name or directly criticized the Supreme Court in his State of the Union addresses, he impliedly criticized <u>Roe</u> in his 1984 and 1986 addresses. In his 1988 State of the Union speech, Reagan advocated a constitutional amendment to allow prayer in public schools, but he did not specifically refer to <u>Engel v. Vitale</u> or any other Court's school prayer decisions. In 1922, President Harding called for an amendment to restrict child labor which would have had the effect of overturning the Court's decisions in <u>Hammer v. Dagenhart</u> (1918) and <u>Bailey v. Drexel Furniture</u> (1922), although Harding did not mention these decisions or the Court by name. <br /><br />Until Obama's speech last week, perhaps the most piquant remark concerning the U.S. Supreme Court in any State of the Union message was made by Franklin D. Roosevelt in January 1937, only a few weeks before he announced his infamous Court-packing proposal. Roosevelt expressed hope that "we can meet new national needs with new laws consistent with an historic constitutional framework clearly intended to receive liberal and not narrow interpretation." Implying that he opposed constitutional amendments but would work for some other method to ensure judicial approval of economic regulatory legislation, Roosevelt declared that "[t]he vital need is not an alteration of our fundamental law, but an increasingly enlightened view with reference to it," and that "[m]eans must be found to adapt our legal forms and our judicial interpretation to the actual present needs of the largest progressive democracy in the world." The Justices were absent from this State Union address, even though Roosevelt had expected them to attend.  Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes speculated in his diary that they stayed away because they had &quot;received a tip as to the contents of the message&quot;.<br />  <br />Theodore Roosevelt, however, holds the record for criticism of courts in State of the Union addresses. In his 1906 and 1908 State of the Union addresses, Roosevelt made extensive and stinging remarks about state and federal judges who invalidated economic regulatory legislation and who issued injunctions against the legitimate activities of labor unions. In his 1908 address, Roosevelt declared that "[j]udges of this stamp do lasting harm by their decisions because they convince poor men in need of protection that the courts of the land are profoundly ignorant of and out of sympathy with their needs." Similarly, in his 1906 address, Roosevelt complained about "flagrant wrongs committed by judges in connection with disputes." In both addresses, in which Roosevelt devoted thousands of words to discussing judicial issues, Roosevelt professed strong respect for the majority of state and federal judges and for judicial independence, but he warned that the continuation of strong judicial institutions required a wise exercise of judicial power that elevated the rule of law over special interests. <br /><br />Roosevelt did not make these remarks in front of any judges because State of the Union addresses were not delivered in person between 1801 and 1913. Much of the criticism of Obama's remarks last week are based not on what he said but on where he said it. Many critics of Obama's remarks about <u>Citizens United</u> complain that Obama was unfair to the Co
urt to the extent that the justices had no immediate way to respond, other than in the ill-advised manner used by Alito. But while extrajudicial comments by judges about their own decisions are inappropriate, there are plenty of lawyers, journalists, scholars, and pundits who can defend the Court's opinions. Although a president naturally should be careful to avoid demonstrating any disrespect for the Court, particularly when the justices are present, Obama's remarks in his State of the Union address were limited to only one case and did not in any way derogate judicial independence or encourage any defiance of the Court's decision. Indeed, such measured criticism of the Court can actually enhance public respect for the judiciary. As Theodore Roosevelt observed in his 1906 State of the Union address, "just and temperate criticism" of the judiciary helps to prevent "that intemperate antagonism towards the judiciary which...if it became widespread among the people...would constitute a dire menace to the Republic." <br /><br /><br /><em>William G.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Julia Carrano, George Washington University School of Law &#39;10, spent a summer working for Heritage Watch in Cambodia...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><div style="text-align: left;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Cambodia-051-720659.jpg"><img style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Cambodia-051-720192.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><font style="font-weight: bold;">A</font>fter my first year of law school, I spent a month in Phnom Penh, Cambodia with Heritage Watch, a non-profit organization dedicated to preserving Cambodian cultural heritage sites and fostering sustainable development. As an intern, my job was to synthesize relevant laws and other legal documents into a database that could be easily accessed by those needing to know the rules governing the use of cultural property from Cambodia. My goal going into the project was to assess how Cambodia&#39;s growing problem with cultural heritage preservation could benefit from a coherent legal approach.<br /><br />Like many other nations, Cambodia faces problems of looting and illicit sales of its cultural artifacts.  The problem of preservation has been exacerbated by Cambodia&#39;s history of political instability, which has prevented the nation from establishing adequate legal protections for important sites and objects. During the totalitarian regime of the Khmer Rouge, the country&#39;s political and legal systems were destroyed, and educated individuals were either killed or forced to flee the country. As a result, the entire nation suffered culturally and economically. Further violence and destruction continued as the Khmer Rouge planted landmines throughout the countryside, and it was not until a civil law system was put into place in 1993 that Cambodia began to regain peace and stability.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Cambodia-070-769870.jpg"><img style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Cambodia-070-769385.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>After 1993, Cambodia began attempting to protect its cultural legacy. At the same time, the country was also attempting to solve the problems of rapid and unsupervised economic development, devastated cultural and educational systems, and the lack of functioning legislative or judicial bodies. In 1996, the Cambodian legislature, the Chbab, passed one major piece of legislation concerning cultural heritage preservation, the Law on the Protection of Cultural Heritage (LPCH), which outlines the limited property rights applicable to cultural property, the way these rights can be used, and the appropriate sanctions for violations of the law. While the law does not directly nationalize cultural property, an approach taken by some countries, such as Peru and Mexico, it does severely restrict an owner&#39;s property rights, particularly if the property is classified as an artifact by the relevant authorities. The LPCH is a document that, in my opinion, represents a well-reasoned middle ground between a draconian law preventing the selling of any cultural artifacts and weak legislation treating cultural heritage like any other type of property.<br /><br />Still, I quickly discovered that there is a problem of consistency within this legislation (Chbab). The LPCH is not the only governing authority on the regulation of cultural property, and other laws overlap in subject matter. In addition to the LPCH, there are numerous legal authorities affecting cultural heritage preservation in Cambodia, such as the Constitution; executive decrees; criminal code provisions governing theft and importation regulations; land law provisions; customs regulations; and international treaties to which Cambodia is a signatory. Additionally, the Cambodian executive has considerable lawmaking authority, since laws are only infrequently passed by the legislative branch and usually do not address their subject matter in much detail. Therefore, much of the law actually comes from sub-decrees (Anu-Kret) adopted by the Council of Ministers or proclamations (Prakas) from individual ministers. Authorities within the ministry also use the circular (Sarachor) to clarify points of law.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Cambodia-073-716652.jpg"><img style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Cambodia-073-716183.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>Authorities differ, because while some mention cultural heritage regulation, others do not define it at all or provide a definition which deviates from that set forth in the LPCH. These laws also fail to establish consistent penalties. For example, it is relevant to know whether cultural property has to be a certain age and whether the definition only includes man-made objects, but not all authorities are clear on these distinctions. In addition, the Cambodian legal system makes it extremely difficult to locate the relevant executive documents, particularly if you do not read Khmer, which presumably many in the antiquities market or international community do not. For instance, I could find no English translation of the major implementing Sub-decree 98 Concerning the Execution of the Protection of Cultural Patrimony. Even for major pieces of legislation, there are usually only unofficial translations. However, there is still the problem of enforcement, even if one could distill all the potentially relevant and conflicting authorities down to a coherent policy on cultural heritage preservation. The LPCH system of classification sounds rational, but it may have little value in actual practice.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Cambodia-097-777075.jpg"><img style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Cambodia-097-776555.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>This confusion in the Cambodian legal system has an important implication beyond the borders of the country. The looted objects do not, for the most part, stay on the mantels of Cambodians, but instead are exported to developed countries, particularly the US. It is difficult to successfully prosecute an importer of illicit cultural property in the US because under the National Stolen Property Act (NSPA) one must prove that the item was indeed &quot;stolen&quot; in the country of origin. US courts must assess Cambodian ownership laws, including all relevant decrees mentioned above, and the extent to which these laws and decrees are enforced in practice. Thus, unclear and overly-complex Cambodian legislation makes it difficult for courts to reach a satisfying conclusion. US courts must conclude either that the Cambodian government intended to create national ownership of the cultural item in question, meaning that the item is &quot;stolen&quot; for purposes of criminal prosecution, or that restrictions on exporting and trading cultural property in Cambodia do not bestow national ownership, and the US has no basis for prosecution.<br /><br />My time with Heritage Watch revealed exactly why, from an international perspective, clear, consistent, and enforceable domestic cultural heritage laws are vital for the successful protection of cultural property. Ultimately, my internship led me to ask a more fundamental question which is considered less often: Why is the protection of cultural heritage worth the time, money, and effort, particularly in a developing nation like Cambodia where there are so many other problems? During my time in Cambodia, I witnessed some of the answers to that question. Tourism has a strong impact on the national economy, and cultural preservation gives citizens a sense of identity and community that has been forgotten through col
onization, war, and poverty. Most Cambodians have only a vague sense of the richness and sophistication of their past, and while they might be proud of being from the country of Angkor Wat, they have no true understanding of its importance. Cambodians need education that presents the nuances of their history, showcasing their struggles, accomplishments, and the injustices they have faced. This education can form a bond among citizens that will go much deeper than pride or nostalgia and it must be taught now, because if these cultural sites and treasures are lost, there will be no second chance to recover them.<br /><br /><br /><font size="2">Mentioned in this Article:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.heritagewatchinternational.org/">Heritage Watch</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.bigpond.com.kh/council_of_jurists/Culture/cul001g.htm">Law on the Protection of Cultural Heritage </a><br /><br /><a href="http://eca.state.gov/icpp/18-2314.html">National Stolen Property Act</a><br /><br />Photo Credits: Julia Carrano</font></div><br />

		<title>PITTSBURGH: Haitian Orphans and Expedited Adoptions</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kristine Long, Pitt Law &#39;11, relates the findings of Anna Kavalauskas and Silpa Swarnapuri, Pitt Law &#39;12, who looked into the measures taken to facilitate adoption proceedings for 54 Haitian orphans relocated to Pittsburgh...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/4-722674.jpg"><img style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 213px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/4-722266.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><strong>I</strong>n January, Haiti was struck by an earthquake which devastated the nation and brought attention and aid from all over the world. In addition to shortages of food, housing, and medical care, the earthquake left many orphaned children. One of the immediate responses came a week after the earthquake, when 54 Haitian orphans from the Bresma orphanage in Port-au-Prince were flown into Pittsburgh. The city was chosen as a site for expediting adoption proceedings for these children due to its success with relocating domestic refugees during the Hurricane Katrina crisis. The Center of Life, a community organization in Pittsburgh, had already established a partnership with Bresma.<br /><br />According to Allegheny County Department of Human Services Director Marc Cherna, Pittsburgh was a natural choice for the temporary housing of the orphans. &quot;Pittsburgh seems to be the model, people have confidence and we handle [these situations] well,&quot; he commented after the adoption proceedings concluded. Allegheny County began preparing for all possible emergencies and had Port Authority buses and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center ambulances ready to transport the children from the airport to Children&#39;s Hospital.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Haiti-1-743404.jpg"><img style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 213px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Haiti-1-742953.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>At the time of the earthquake, most of the children were already in the process of being adopted through a private Kentucky adoption agency, and so when the children arrived, Allegheny Department of Human Services staffers had prepared a makeshift courtroom at Children&#39;s Hospital because they assumed that they would have jurisdiction to complete the adoption proceedings. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), however, sent a team of 25 workers to take over and finalize the adoptions. After working long hours, ICE completed 41 out of 54 adoptions, with the remaining 13 children staying at the Holy Family Institute in Pittsburgh. Holy Family provides a residential program and works with children who are unable to live with their families. The US government still has to determine the status of these remaining children before further decisions can be made about their future. Sister Linda Yankoski, the Executive Director, spoke of the need to have a more efficient refugee resettlement program in place.<br /><br />Part of the reason the US is waiting for more information about the orphans is that there have been previous problems with Haitian adoption proceedings. In 2007, UNICEF estimated that there were 380,000 orphans in Haiti. However, these numbers can be misleading, because many parents and legal guardians who are temporarily unable to care for their children due to poverty leave them in orphanages for short periods of time. As a result of this practice, determining which of the children were actually orphans before the earthquake has become a challenging task. Currently, an adoption moratorium is being sought by aid agencies in an attempt to allow parents and relatives to reunite with their children when possible.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Haiti-3-769442.jpg"><img style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 213px; height: 320px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Haiti-3-769050.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>There are competing policies, however, because other agencies encourage expediting adoptions because orphaned children require specialized assistance and need immediate attention. In the past, Haitian adoption proceedings could last up to three years, but the Haitian government is now attempting to speed up the process because they aim to place children with families as soon as possible. However, when adoptions are rushed, rumors of child trafficking and abuse can become serious concerns. Currently, the US Department of Health and Human Services works with refugees, but it does not have regulations specifically directed towards children, and is therefore unprepared to handle these types of cases. In response, Allegheny County has provided staff to help the government develop protocol in this area. Cherna stated he would not be surprised if Congress began to look at this issue more closely and implement safeguards against child trafficking practices. The rumors of child trafficking were strengthened when only days after speaking with Cherna, there was a report that 10 US citizens affiliated with a Baptist church were arrested for attempting to bring 33 children into the Dominican Republic. An Austrian charity, SOS Children&#39;s Villages, has taken temporary responsibility for the children and confirmed that at least 10 of them were not orphans. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Haiti-2-709117.jpg"><img style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 213px;" src="/dateline/uploaded_images/Haiti-2-708672.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>While speaking to those involved with the adoptions in Pittsburgh, the question that came to our minds was how, if the Haitian proceedings are notoriously long and there are policy implications for extending adoption proceedings, did the 54 Haitian children come into Pittsburgh so quickly? Cherna seemed to believe that the Haitian government did not want to expedite the procedures so drastically, but the children obviously needed immediate help. Also, some of the children were already in various stages of the adoption process and the 41 families had already invested roughly over $45,000 in adoption costs. The next question is whether there will be more Haitian orphans in Pittsburgh this year. While it is possible, according to Cherna, the process has been affected by the arrest of the American Baptist group. There are still countless children left homeless in Haiti, but since the arrests, only 3 more children have been airlifted out of Port-au-Prince.<br /><br />Finally, we asked how the experience has affected the Allegheny County staff. Cherna described how rewarding it has been, adding that this was the reason he went into the field in the first place. However, Allegheny County staff still spend most of their time working with local citizens in need. As Cherna states, &quot;I tell people every time they call that there are plenty of kids right here in Allegheny County who need a home.&quot; These children also need to be adopted and the US government encourages domestic adoptions by offering health care and education subsidies.<br /><br /><font size="2">Mentioned in this article:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.alleghenycounty.us/dhs/">Allegheny County Department of Human Services</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.hfi-pgh.org/">Holy Family Institute</a><br /><br />Photos Courtesy of: Eva Mueller</font><br />

		<title>INDIA: Protecting Sex Workers</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamsa Subramaniam discusses the knowledge she gained as a 2008 Clinton Fellow at <a href="http://www.saathii.org/">SAATHII</a>, an HIV/AIDS technical assistance organization in Chennai, India...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n 2007, the World Health Organization reported that 2.3 million people above the age of 15 are infected with HIV in India, a prevalence which ranks second only to South Africa. Approximately 40 percent of the infected are women. The Indian government estimates that 8 percent of the nation&#39;s sex workers are infected with HIV, which is almost nine times higher than the overall HIV infection rate for Indian adults. Moreover, studies of sex workers conducted by the Indian National AIDS Control Organization in individual areas have found much higher HIV prevalence rates, such as 44 percent in Mumbai, and 26 percent in Mysore.<br /><br />It is true that a considerable portion of sex work &#8212; especially in the developing world &#8212; is performed as a result of trafficking or other forms of sexual coercion. With this issue in mind, India adopted the Immoral Trafficking Prevention Act (ITPA) in 1956, in line with the 1949 UN International Convention for the Suppression of Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others. While the law as drafted is quite comprehensive, the ITPA is enforced most commonly by punishing sex workers for soliciting sex as opposed to arresting pimps for profiting from this sort of exploitation.<br /><br />During my time at SAATHII, I spoke with sex workers in the context of my work, and I realized that while many women go into sex work as a result of trafficking, others actually turn to it as a calculated professional choice. I had not considered this a possibility, but came to understand that sex work can be comparatively lucrative when other &#39;culturally acceptable&#39; jobs pay practically nothing.<br /><br />One woman I met, Fathima (alias), moved to Chennai with her husband shortly after their marriage.  They were soon living in absolute poverty with a newborn daughter. After months without work, Fathima became a house servant, where she was paid 50 Rs ($1) a day. When the father went away for business, his two sons started soliciting Fathima for sex. She realized that instead of working in this home for so little, or at any other job, for that matter, she could charge clients for sex and make 10 times more per night to take care of her family. After 15 years of being in this business, Fathima charged on average 1,000 Rs per session (around 5000 Rs per week) and single-handedly earned enough money to buy a small house and educate both her daughters in English-language schools and universities.<br /><br />The issue remains that sex work is still a crime, therefore sex workers are seldom protected under Indian law. I was told that it is not uncommon for them to perform sexual favors for police officers in exchange for their turning a blind eye to the &#39;violation.&#39; There is now a growing movement led by the Sonagachi sex workers in Kolkata, Asia&#39;s largest red-light district, demanding labor rights in addition to calling for the refocusing of the ITPA to punish traffickers who force women into prostitution, and to decriminalize sex work in India.<br /><br />For a sex worker in Chennai, getting high-paying clients means cruising train stations and bus stops to locate men who seem safe and relatively wealthy, all the while avoiding the &quot;special police&quot; employed to enforce the ITPA. Prospective clients tread carefully at cruising sites for fear of being seen, judged, or intimidated by the police. If the ITPA were also used to criminalize those who buy sex, women like Fathima would have to search even harder to locate &#39;safe&#39; clients. Criminalizing clients will drive the entire sex industry underground, further stigmatizing sex workers, precluding them from availing themselves of legal protection and necessary social services, especially HIV-related medical support. Additionally, this will create yet another barrier for sex workers attempting to negotiate for a safe sexual experience, including the use of condoms. While many women&#39;s rights organizations, politicians, and the public at large look at sex work through the lens of morality, public health practitioners prefer the perspective of safety. If the ITPA were amended to criminalize clients, sex workers will be even more vulnerable to the occupational hazards they already face. More alarmingly, this law may have a hand in facilitating the spread of HIV.<br /><br />The HIV/AIDS unit of the Lawyers Collective, a human rights NGO in India, endorses the sex-worker rights movement to strengthen the ITPA to come down harder on traffickers, especially those who traffic children, while legitimizing sex work as a profession so long as it is one of choice. This way, those who sell sex as their livelihood may be privy to social services, especially access to health care, and those who traffic women are punished.<br /><br />Legally defining sex work is a first step in protecting the rights and preserving the health of the estimated 2.8 million sex workers in India. Criminalizing clients of sex workers will do nothing more than drive the sex industry underground, making it impossible to monitor activity and moving public services further away from women who desperately need them. As an aspiring public health practitioner who is familiar with the Indian HIV epidemic, I believe it is abundantly clear that legal changes need to be made to combat the spread of HIV in this extremely vulnerable and high-risk group. It will certainly be interesting for me to follow the course of this debate. My ultimate hope is the ITPA is implemented in such a away that promotes the right to health, so women like Fathima can live independently without fear and provide for their families.<br />

		<title>UKRAINE: Models of Constitutional Judicial Review</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Myroslava Savchuk, Pitt Law LLM &#39;10, discusses the differences between judicial review in the United States and her home country of Ukraine...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><br /><font size="3"><b>J</b></font>udicial review refers to a court&#39;s power to review the constitutionality of a country&#39;s laws and invalidate them when necessary. Although the structure, methods, and effects of judicial review differ from country to country, there are two main types of judicial control over the constitutionality of actions of other branches of government. As an LLM student at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, I&#39;ve thought about their similarities and differences on a near-daily basis.<br /><br />The American system accords the power of constitutional judicial review to all judicial bodies. The Austrian Constitution of 1920, drafted by the well-known legal scholar Hans Kelsen, established constitutional review on the European continent. This European or Austrian system of judicial review confines the power of judicial review to a single judicial body, typically a constitutional court, and was adopted in the constitution of my home country of Ukraine. <br /><br /><b>Nature of Judicial Review and Its Rationale</b><br /><br />Although the US Constitution does not expressly provide for judicial review, Justice Marshall argued in <u>Marbury v. Madison</u> that it was implied in the provisions of Article III of the Constitution, which states: &quot;The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish&quot; and &quot;the judicial power is extended to all cases arising under the Constitution.&quot; Article VI further declares that the Constitution is the supreme law of the land and &quot;the Judges of every state shall be bound thereby.&quot; [sic]<br /><br />In continental Europe, the framers of constitutions, as well as legal and constitutional scholars, initially resisted the idea of judicial oversight precisely because it placed limits on the authority of representative assemblies. It was feared that an explicit adoption of constitutional review might lead to the establishment of a &quot;government of judges&quot; as opposed to an elected assembly.<br /><br />Constitutional review started to gain support in Europe after its adoption in the Austrian Constitution in 1920 and was adopted in three distinct ways: in Germany and Italy after World War II, in Spain and Portugal after the collapse of their authoritarian governments, and in the countries of Eastern Europe after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Austrian model of constitutional review in Europe was popular because it was believed to preserve traditional legal order while simultaneously allowing for effective review. It protects individual rights and provides a source for constitutional-law-building. Following continental Europe&#39;s example, my home country of Ukraine provided for a special Constitutional court when drafting its constitution.<br /><br /><b>Comparisons Between the Two Systems of Judicial Review</b><br /><br /><u>Marbury v. Madison</u> implied the power of judicial review to the entire American judiciary, from the lowest trial court to the US Supreme Court. However, the Constitutional Court of Ukraine was given explicit powers of constitutional judicial review by the Ukrainian Constitution and the Law &quot;On the Constitutional Court of Ukraine,&quot; which set forth the Court&#39;s organization, authority, and procedures of operation. The Court first met in 1996, months after the adoption of the Constitution.<br /><br />The Constitutional Court acts outside of the hierarchy of Ukrainian Courts and is the sole body of constitutional jurisdiction in Ukraine. Pursuant to Article 149 of the Constitution, the Court was granted constitutional judicial review over the legal acts of the Verkhovna Rada (the Parliament) of Ukraine, the President, the Cabinet of Ministers, and the Verkhovna Rada of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. The Court also has the power to provide the official interpretation of the Constitution and the laws of Ukraine. On issues arising under this Article, the Court renders final decisions that are mandatory for execution throughout the territory of Ukraine. According to Article 152 of the Constitution, laws and other legal acts, or their separate provisions that are deemed unconstitutional lose legal force from the day of the Court&#39;s decision.<br /><br />The Constitution sets the number of judges at 18 and provides that the President, the Parliament, and the Congress of Judges of Ukraine each appoint six judges. This appointment process was established to ensure impartiality and judicial independence. Unlike in the United States, where judges are either elected or appointed for life, a judge on the Constitutional Court of Ukraine is only appointed for a term of nine years, must resign upon reaching the age of 65, and has no right to reappointment.<br /><br />Article 151 of the Constitution establishes that the Court render decisions on the constitutionality of international treaties on the appeal of the President or the Cabinet of Ministers. The President or Cabinet of Ministers may request opinions on the constitutionality of international treaties to which Ukraine is currently a  party, or international treaties submitted to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine for ratification. While the government may certify questions to the Court, most Constitutional questions are raised in the course of ordinary lawsuits, and any person may challenge the constitutionality of a law or other governmental action that adversely affects that person. Thus, in cases brought by individuals the Court has a power similar to the writ of certiorari granted by the US Supreme Court. Further, where constitutional questions come before the Constitutional Court in the course of ordinary lawsuits, comparisons may be drawn to the &quot;case or controversy&quot; requirement in the US. However, the US has the additional requirement that a plaintiff have standing before the court, whereas the Ukrainian Constitutional Court will hear cases brought even by non-citizens.<br /><br />The Ukrainian Constitution establishes a limited list of officials who may directly appeal to the Constitutional Court seeking its opinion on the constitutionality of a law. The Court will consider the constitutionality of a legal act only on the &quot;constitutional submission&quot; of the President, no less than 45 National Deputies, the Supreme Court, the Authorized Human Rights Representative of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine or the Verkhovna Rada of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. The other distinction between the two systems is that American courts are limited to decide only &quot;cases and controversies&quot; that arise out of disputes between litigants with standing before the court and provable injuries, whereas European constitutional courts usually have broad jurisdiction to decide abstract constitutional questions in the absence of a concrete dispute. As Ukraine conforms to the European model of constitutional judicial review, the Constitutional Court will decide the constitutionality of a particular issue without any particular dispute involved, so long as the issue is raised by the appeal of an authorized body.<br /><br /><b>Conclusion</b><br /><br />Constitutional judicial review is an important mechanism of checks and balances, which allows courts to exercise review of legal acts and the actions of the other two branches. Judicial review has become increasingly common throughout the world, and its regular exercise serves to strengthen respect for the Constitution, protect fundamental rights, and thus contribute to institutional stability.<br /><br />There are two different systems of judicial review, one based on the American model and the other based on the European model. The European model, which was adopted in my home country of Ukraine, differs from the American in several respects. The main distinction between the two systems
is that under the European, or the Austrian model, a special institution is established to conduct constitutional judicial review. In Ukraine, this is the Constitutional Court, which is the sole body with constitutional jurisdiction. On the other hand, in the United States all courts consider constitutionality in the course of deciding ordinary disputes. The differences in the systems result from differences in the development of the countries and their legal systems. Some scholars have argued that the American system of generalized and diffuse review makes the Constitution more accessible, whereas others have suggested that a system of centralized and specialized review allows judges to develop an expertise in constitutional law and provides for harmonization of constitutional jurisprudence. While each system has its pros and cons, they both operate effectively in their political and legal environments.<br /><br /><font style="font-size: 8pt" size="2">Mentioned in this article:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.rada.gov.ua/const/conengl.htm" alt="Constitution of Ukraine">Constitution of Ukraine</a><br /></font>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Billy</strong> <strong>Corriher</strong> [Attorney and researcher, <a href="http://www.bordc.org/">Bill of Rights Defense Committee</a>]: &quot;Attorney General Eric Holder is <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/holder-defends-decision-to-try.php">standing firm</a> on the decision to try Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the attempted Christmas Day bomber, in a criminal trial. Some senators critical of the decision not to use military tribunals have gone so far as to introduce <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6115E320100202">legislation</a> to block funding for civilian trials for terrorism suspects. In a <a href="http://www.justice.gov/cjs/docs/ag-letter-2-3-10.pdf">letter</a> [PDF file] responding to lawmakers, Holder insisted that the prosecution of Abdulmutallab will prove successful and that the administration&#39;s decision &quot;has not, and will not, compromise our ability to obtain information needed to detect and prevent future attacks.&quot;<br /><br />Holder pointed out that like Abdulmutallab, Richard Reid was arrested by federal authorities after trying to ignite explosives on a plane bound for the United States. The Bush administration tried Reid in a federal court, and he is now serving a life sentence. The Bush administration&#39;s criminal prosecution of Reid did not raise concerns, nor did a 2003 executive <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xabout/laws/gc_1214592333605.shtm">order</a> specifying that the Attorney General is responsible for criminal investigations of terrorist acts committed within the Department of Justice&#39;s jurisdiction.<br /><br />So why are some politicians now doubting the effectiveness of our criminal justice system in trying terrorist suspects? Policymakers criticizing the Obama administration as &quot;soft on terrorism&quot; are using the fear of terrorism to score political points. Instead of exploiting these fears, those politicians should participate in a constructive conversation about how to keep America safe.<br /><br />There is no reason to doubt that Abdulmutallab will be convicted. Although statements elicited before <em>Miranda</em> warnings were issued may be inadmissible, authorities have <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2010/feb/03/nation/la-na-bomber-miranda3-2010feb03">confirmed</a> that Abdulmuttab continues to provide valuable information to authorities. Abdulmutallab is accused of committing a crime in the presence of many witnesses - his would-be victims - and he will face a significant sentence. The United States criminal justice system is more than capable of obtaining justice for those who seek to kill civilians on a mass scale, whether it be in the case of Abdulmutallab or any other terrorist suspect. One need only read Holder&#39;s letter to find several examples of successful terrorism prosecutions since the 9/11 attacks.<br /><br />Criminal trials for suspected terrorists will only strengthen our country in the struggle against terrorism. Our hand is stronger when the world sees that terrorists captured by the US are convicted in swift and fair trials. If we wish to triumph in the so-called &quot;war on terror,&quot; then America&#39;s victories must have legitimacy. Military tribunals, which have relied on hearsay and evidence obtained through coercion, cannot provide this legitimacy. Working within our criminal justice system to try terrorist suspects ensures an American advantage in the struggle for hears and minds.<br /><br />Terrorists should not be treated differently from other would-be murderers just because they are motivated by political intentions. Those who seek to further ideological ends through violence reject our society&#39;s fundamental rules. We must embrace those rules. The same rule of law that forbids mass murder to further political ends requires that our government treat all criminals in the same manner.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.eff.org/about/staff/kurt-opsahl"><strong>Kurt Opsahl</strong></a> [Senior Staff Attorney, <a href="http://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>]: &quot;Over the past few weeks, Google&#39;s new social networking service, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/group-claims-google-buzz-social.php">Buzz</a> has upset a lot of people over inadvertent disclosures of personal information.  The underlying privacy issue is that many users inadvertently published the list of the people they email and chat with most frequently using the Gmail and Gchat services that Google provides.<br /><br />Under the original configuration, if you took the default options and didn&#39;t opt-out or edit this list during profile creation, this list became part of your profile, and thus becomes available to the public.  Yet, these email and chat contacts are not necessarily people you want to advertise as friends via a public social network.  Consider the issues with reporters and sources, doctors and patients, you and your former significant others, etc.<br /><br />These problems arose because Google attempted to overcome its market disadvantage in competing with Twitter and Facebook by making a secondary use of your information.  Since it is difficult to import lists of social network contacts, Google attempted to jump-start Buzz with lists drawn from its successful Gmail and Gchat services.  While this may help Buzz grow and save users the time to type in all their contacts, it also has an inherent danger of inadvertent disclosure of private information.<br /><br />Responding to criticism (including EFF&#39;s), Google moved away from the system in which Buzz automatically sets you up to follow the people you email and chat with most, and adopted an auto-suggest model, in which you are shown the friend list with an option to de-select people before publishing the list.  While a full opt-in model would be less likely to result in inadvertent disclosures of private information, this is a significant step forward.<br /><br />Though Google responded quickly to these privacy concerns, they never should have happened in the first place.  While Buzz previously had a lot of these privacy options available, the user interface failed to provide users with the setting users had reasonably expected.  Google should follow fair information practices and make secondary uses of information only with clear, unequivocal user consent and control, and test these controls to ensure that the default settings match with the expectations of the user.&quot;<br />

		<title>Obama administration&#039;s approach to ICC reflects fear of political prosecutions</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.hudson.org/learn/index.cfm?fuseaction=staff_bio&eid=Elizabeth%20Samson">Elizabeth Samson</a></strong> [Visiting Fellow, <a href="http://www.hudson.org/">Hudson Institute</a>]: &quot;From the time that US President Barack Obama came into office there has been talk of the United States joining the International Criminal Court, but those efforts may be <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-war-crimes-ambassador-says-us.php">laid to rest</a> for the time being.  It appears as though this administration has not come much further in being convinced that participation in the ICC is either beneficial to US interests or necessary, and it remains in doubt with good reason.<div><br /></div><div>The <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/585?OpenDocument">Rome Statute</a> of the International Criminal Court was adopted in 1998, and the ratification of the Rome Statute in 2002 by 60 countries established the ICC as a permanent tribunal to prosecute individuals for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.<br /><div><br /></div><div>In 2000 during the Clinton Administration, the United States signed the Rome Statute, but did not submit the treaty to the Senate for ratification, pending further assessment of the ICC&#39;s functioning.  President George W. Bush ordered the US to suspend its signature of the Rome Statute in May 2002 out of concern that politically-motivated lawsuits would be initiated against American citizens abroad due to global expansion of the US military.  Instead, in accordance with Article 98 of the Rome Statute, the US entered into bilateral immunity agreements with over 100 countries to prevent foreign states from surrendering Americans to the ICC.</div><div><br /></div><div>Despite continued efforts by President Obama to distance himself from the policies of his predecessor, the fear of unfair prosecutions of US citizens by the ICC still gives him pause. Citing this reason, Stephen Rapp, US Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues, recently <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-war-crimes-ambassador-says-us.php">stated</a> that no US President will be likely to submit the ICC treaty to the Senate for ratification in the &quot;foreseeable future.&quot;  Ambassador Rapp also cited the existence of a strong US court system as an additional barrier to ratification.</div><div><br /></div><div>The purpose of the ICC is to function as a complementary court to a country&#39;s already existing national judiciary.  Pursuant to Article 17 of the Rome Statute, the ICC only has the authority to act when a country is &quot;unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution.&quot;  A country may be considered &quot;unwilling&quot; if it is clearly shielding someone from responsibility for crimes that are within the ICC&#39;s jurisdiction to prosecute.  A country may be found to be &quot;unable&quot; to prosecute &quot;due to a total or substantial collapse or unavailability of its national judicial system.&quot;  So, for Western countries like the United States that have robust democratic institutions and thriving and functioning judiciaries, joining the ICC can be seen as a political move, a diplomatic gesture, but not a legally necessary one.</div><div><br /></div><div>The US is not entirely opposed to the ICC in principle and has supported and acknowledged the ICC&#39;s authority to investigate and prosecute war crimes in places like Darfur, Sudan.  But then again, Sudan&#39;s legal system has allowed for ethnic cleansing and genocide in Darfur by the Sudanese regime.  This very fact necessitates prosecution by the ICC because Sudanese national courts could be considered both &quot;unwilling&quot; and &quot;unable&quot; to prosecute according to the standards set forth in Article 17.</div><div><br /></div><div>The ICC is only intended to have jurisdiction if a country&#39;s judicial infrastructure is too weak or its government too corrupt to effectively prosecute.  Ideally, the ICC should be a court of last resort rather than a court of first instance and it is, therefore, imperative that the US pursue other avenues to achieve that goal.  In light of that, Ambassador Rapp maintains that the US remains committed to strengthening national judiciaries, supporting the establishment of international criminal tribunals, and working with states that fairly exercise universal jurisdiction in instances where there is a connection of the state to the crime being charged - a strategy that will ultimately be more effective in the long run to help achieve global justice.&quot;</div></div><br />

		<title>Canada should consider burka ban as consistent with a free society</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.travelandtransitions.com/interviews/farzana_hassan.htm">Farzana Hassan</a></strong> [Member, <a href="http://www.muslimcanadiancongress.org/">Muslim Canadian Congress</a>]: &quot;The French parliament is currently <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/france-burqa-ban-proposal-likely.php">debating</a> the legality of a proposed ban on the burka, the full veil worn by some conservative Muslim women.  In a statement endorsing the recommendations of the parliament, President Sarkozy mentioned equality and liberty as the reasons for the proposed legislation.  Not surprisingly, this controversial move has sparked an array of opinions, both supporting and opposing the proposed ban, which will be confined for now to public buildings.  Liberals argue such a ban constitutes an infringement on individual rights and religious freedoms guaranteed in the French constitution.  Others maintain such a ban would help Muslim women facing coercion in the matter.<div><br /></div><div>The move has ignited similar debates in the United States and Canada with the secular Muslim Canadian Congress (MCC) calling for a burka ban in Canada.  In a letter to the Canadian government, the MCC cited concerns over the security of the public, the safety of burka-clad women as well as the resultant marginalization of these women.</div><div><br /></div><div>As expected, the MCC has met with opposition from both Islamist groups as well as liberals who espouse an uncompromising multiculturalism.  They argue that a burka ban would restrict the choices of women who wear the niqab or burka.  But in their defense of the rights of these women, they often ignore the lack of choice for women who choose not to wear the niqab and are forced into adopting the cumbersome garb.</div><div><br /></div><div>Legislation protecting their rights is not only desirable but essential.  The influence of Wahabism grows stronger by the day.  Proliferation of the burka is likely to have societal implications.  A society allowing the marginalization of a sizable number of individuals stands at risk of being perceived as a dysfunctional society.  The biggest challenge is that the burka adherents are inherently evangelical and their ultimate goal is to spread this practice among all Muslims by scaring them with theology.  That is why this matter must be nipped at the bud.</div><div><br /></div><div>The burka has already proliferated in Britain, where the government is reluctant to pass legislation against it for this reason.  It is leery of passing legislation that is likely to affect a significant number of individuals.  A similar scenario must be avoided in Canada and the United States, where the observance of the burka as yet, remains on the periphery.</div><div><br /></div><div>Additionally, the argument promoting individual choice and freedom must be assessed within the context of the common good.  Pluralism is hardly to be understood as an absolute.  Restricting certain individual rights to advance the common good is by no means outside the realm of democracy and pluralism, and must function as a safeguard against the oppression of traditionally marginalized groups.  It necessitates legislation against the burka, which is not only a tool of oppression but has now become a security threat in the current politically turbulent climate.</div><div><br /></div><div>The same safeguards against the possible abuse of multiculturalism are stated in Article 9, section 2 of the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/EN/Treaties/html/005.htm">Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms</a>: <blockquote style="text-align: justify;">Freedom to manifest one&#39;s religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.</blockquote>Legislation against the burka, therefore, does not pose a conflict with this human rights document.  The <a href="http://www.efc.ca/pages/law/charter/charter.text.html">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> is also clear on the matter as follows:  <blockquote>The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.</blockquote></div><div>The above provision must serve as a basis for establishing the constitutionality of a burka ban in Canada.  Choices made by women at the behest of radical theologies cannot be embraced if they are contrary to tenets of freedom that are enshrined in our society.&quot; </div><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.humanrightsusa.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=151&Itemid=129">Piper Hendricks</a></strong> [International Justice Project Director, <a href="http://www.humanrightsusa.org/">World Organization for Human Rights USA</a>]: &quot;Last Friday, February 5, 2010, while preparing for what has been called the &quot;snowpocalypse&quot; here in Washington, DC, we at Human Rights USA learned that the Court in our civil case against Charles Taylor, Jr. (&quot;Taylor Jr.&quot;) had <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/son-of-liberia-ex-president-ordered-to.php">awarded</a> a total of $22.4 million in damages to our five clients for the atrocities they endured at the hands of Taylor Jr. and the Anti-Terrorism Unit (ATU) forces under his command.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As we shared the exciting news with our clients, colleagues, and the media, we faced the question:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  &quot;</span>What does this decision <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">mean</em>?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What does it mean to the plaintiffs &#8212; to the legal community &#8212; to potential defendants &#8212; and to the world?&quot;<div>  <p class="MsoNormal">Allow me to address each of these questions in turn, after a quick practitioner&#39;s tip to any law students reading this commentary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As a lawyer, it is extremely important to ensure that your clients understand the implications of filing a lawsuit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To the fullest extent possible, your clients understand the potential risks and repercussions to them and potentially their families as well as the potential benefits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And where you have international clients who, naturally, may not be familiar with the American legal system, it is important to explain the time frame for filing, their role if the case goes to trial, the nature of a final judgment, and the process of enforcing a judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We have discussed the timeline of these events with our clients multiple times over the course of the case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So when we called last Friday with the news, our clients understood that the paper saying they were owed $22.4 million dollars did not mean they would have that money in their pockets come Monday morning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">For our clients, this order is a victory in and of itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Throughout the case, our clients have understood there are two types of victories to be won:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>psychological victories and tangible victories. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Having the courage to tell their stories and file the case in court was a major psychological victory for our clients.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The opportunity to face Taylor Jr. in person or testify by video conference before the Court was also a significant psychological victory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And Friday&#39;s recognition by a United States entity of the egregious nature of the brutal acts our clients suffered at the hands of a US citizen and the lasting impact those acts have had was yet another psychological victory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As the order states, &quot;Mr. Taylor&#39;s horrific and repeated actions, as detailed in the complaint and testified to by the plaintiffs, are a chilling example of man&#39;s inhumanity to man, to borrow a phrase from Robert Burns.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Such actions, because they were designed to strip the plaintiffs of their humanity and dignity, deserve the strongest judicial condemnation [&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;].&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Now that we have a tangible order, our next step is to turn it into a tangible victory. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Any amount we are able to collect in enforcing the judgment can begin to cover the financial burdens our clients face because of Taylor Jr. and offer a better chance of making the most of the lives they now lead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Regardless of the results of recovery efforts, however, nothing will detract from the major psychological victories our clients are already celebrating. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal">For the legal community, this case provides additional precedent for cases brought under the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1350.notes.html">Alien Torture Statute</a> (ATS) and the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c102:H.R.2092.ENR:">Torture Victims Protection Act</a> (TVPA).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In Friday&#39;s order, Judge Jordan states that damages under both the ATS and TVPA should be determined by reference to federal law.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Court awarded both compensatory and punitive damages under these statutes and in significant sums, which courts in future cases will consult for reference.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal">To potential defendants &#8212; others who believe they could mistreat fellow humans in this manner and never be held accountable &#8212; this award will serve as a deterrent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Though some in this country may not have closely followed the cases against Taylor Jr., many in other countries did.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As violent conflicts continue in other countries, including several in Africa, those who thought they could violate human rights with impunity are forced to rethink as the number of violators held accountable around the world continues to rise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">For the world, this case, like each case to address such brutal atrocities, strengthens the voice of the international community in condemning violations of human rights.  With Friday&#39;s ruling, the United States says even more loudly &#8212; and potential violators hear even more clearly:  &quot;No!  We will not tolerate disrespect for the life of fellow human beings.  No!  We will not allow torture or other forms of cruel treatment.&quot;  Cases under the ATS and TVPA have addressed human rights violations in many parts of the world - from the Philippines and Peru to El Salvador and, now, Liberia.  This ruling enforces the message that those who violate the rights of others <em>will </em>be held accountable.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal">African newspapers covered the criminal and civil cases against Taylor Jr. and their online comment boards remained active throughout both cases.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>An article on<a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201002060003.html"> AllAfrica.com</a> regarding the February 5 ruling prompted debate regarding the role of the United States courts in holding accountable a US citizen acting abroad and how quickly the plaintiffs would &quot;wait before [they] see one penny.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In response, &quot;s.waylee&quot; posted a comment that sums up the significance of this case more fittingly than anything else I have read.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Copied verbatim, s.waylee wrote:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in; margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">my brother, the victims got no problem waiting to be compensated even up to 20yrs but the fact that the court has reconised the many wickness taylor and his son carry out against innocent liberian have proved that there is justic in the world. the decision of the court is not only about money but it is a victory to every victims liberian anywehre in the world. brovo to america, brovo to icc and brovo to all peaceful liberian. let heaven bring peace unto us once again and never our children witness the pains of sorrow ever in our country history.&quot;</p></div><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal; "><a href="http://www.cdt.org/personnel/brock-n-meeks"><strong>Brock N. Meeks</strong></a> [Director of Communications, <a href="http://www.cdt.org/">Center for Democracy &amp; Technology</a>]: &quot;Recently, tens of millions of Google Gmail users woke up to find the company had automatically placed them in a membership queue for its new social networking tool called &quot;<a href="/paperchase/2010/02/group-claims-google-buzz-social.php">Buzz</a>.&quot;  No one had a say in whether or not to turn Buzz on because Google had already &quot;turned it on&quot; for every Gmail user on the planet.  Big mistake.<br /><br />Buzz allows Gmail users to interact with others in the Buzz community in a variety of ways that can be integrated with other Google products such as Picasa, Google Reader, etc.  The move is a bold one for Google, representing its most ambitious attempt to-date to weave together otherwise disparate services and data sources.<br /><br />The most immediate privacy concern Buzz presented was that it unwittingly &quot;unmasked&quot; the real registered name behind whatever &quot;nickname&quot; a Gmail user might have chosen for him or herself; that real registered name was then revealed to some random subset of people that were (again) automatically selected from the user&#39;s Gmail contact list.  And if a user followed the Buzz sign-up procedure, a mandatory step if you wanted to actually gain the ability to post messages, that users&#39; most private and personal contacts - a lawyer, a lover, a licensed medial clinic - were potentially at risk of discovery by others inside a Gmail user&#39;s contact list.  The potential privacy fiasco resulting from such comingling of contacts is easy to surmise.<br /><br />The mobile application that allows Buzz users to follow along using a handheld device posed another kind of privacy risk, namely, that it can track a user&#39;s exact location and broadcast it to every other Buzz member in the world.  And since Buzz is integrated with Google Maps, the service was kind enough to even pinpoint your location on a street map, which is also accessible to other Buzz members (Turning off or declining any message asking to use your device&#39;s &quot;location services&quot; is a quick fix to deep-six this tracking capability).<br /><br />The good news is that Google, having suffered an immediate and withering amount of backlash from its users, quickly addressed the major privacy concerns and is actively working on solutions to others.  The &quot;bad news&quot; is that one of the more innovative companies in the world utterly failed to follow established principles of <a href="http://www.cdt.org/policy/role-privacy-design-protecting-consumer-privacy#comment-1206">Privacy by Design</a>.  In its rush to push Buzz out the door, the company put some of the most personal information it holds at risk.<br /><br />The stealth launch of a product is uncharacteristic of Google and the blowback will no doubt leave a bright shining scar as a reminder of what not to do in the future.  It should also be a head&#39;s up for Google&#39;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunkworks_project">skunkworks</a> engineers when considering new products and services that are tightly integrated with existing data-rich products.  On an individual product development basis Google has been good about adopting industry-leading privacy practices.  Buzz, however, is a textbook case of why privacy advocates continue to view Google with a wary eye. Meanwhile, Google&#39;s turn-on-a-dime response to implement fixes to the most troubling privacy issues, should return a measure of good will to the company.<br /><br />Today&#39;s Internet user is empowered and not afraid to flex muscles born of its collective activist success.  For this reason alone, any company thinking of rolling out a new social media platform or application should first do extensive, privacy-centered testing.&quot;</span></strong><br />

		<title>Bull v. San Francisco ruling permits overly broad policy of strip searching jail detainees</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>David Shapiro</strong> [Staff Attorney, <a href="http://www.aclu.org/prisoners-rights">ACLU National Prison Project</a>]: &quot;In an unfortunate decision, the Ninth Circuit last week <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/federal-appeals-court-rules-inmate.php">reversed</a> its own precedent and rolled back protections against strip searching jail detainees in <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/02/08/05-17080.pdf">Bull v. San Francisco</a> [PDF file].  The en banc ruling weighed in on the question - which has divided the circuits - of whether the Fourth Amendment lets jail officials strip search detainees indiscriminately, by approving an overly broad policy of strip searching all detainees admitted to San Francisco&#39;s general jail population without regard to the offenses charged, and even without reasonable suspicion.<br /><br />A similar issue involving the blanket strip search policies of two New Jersey jails is pending in the Third Circuit. Last month, ACLU attorneys filed an amicus brief in the case on behalf of five former New Jersey Attorneys General, asking the court to affirm a district court opinion that required reasonable suspicion.<br /><br />Strip searches inflict severe humiliation on pretrial detainees, who are presumed innocent.  Just last year, the Supreme Court described a strip search of a student as &quot;embarrassing, frightening, and humiliating,&quot; and &quot;categorically distinct&quot; from a non-strip search.  At the same time, jail can be a dangerous place, and strip searches may be necessary in some cases to prevent contraband &#8212; drugs, or even worse, knives and guns &#8212; from being smuggled in by detainees.<br /><br />Courts have balanced these interests by permitting strip searches when there is reason to think a detainee might have contraband. The Supreme Court held in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/441/520/case.html">Bell v. Wolfish</a> that jail officials may conduct strip searches after contact visits, which create an opportunity for detainees and their visitors to plan in advance to exchange contraband.  Most of the circuits, however, have held that a strip search soon after an arrest requires greater justification because an arrest, unlike a visit, usually comes as a surprise and does not allow for advance planning.  Courts have found adequate grounds for a strip search after arrest when there is reasonable suspicion, or when the charges involve contraband or an act of violence, or when a detainee is charged with a felony, as opposed to a misdemeanor.  Even when such grounds for a strip search do not exist, the Fourth Amendment still allows jail officials to ferret out contraband through less humiliating means, including metal detectors, pat downs and cell searches.<br /><br />The Ninth Circuit&#39;s decision, however, parts ways with virtually every other circuit by holding that any detainee arrested and admitted to general population can be strip searched without reasonable suspicion.  While the court cited instances of contraband discovered by strip searches, the opinion was more notable for what it did not say &#8212; that jail officials had ever found contraband in a case where reasonable suspicion did not exist and where the charges themselves did not provide a basis for a strip search.   In short, there was no evidence of a law enforcement interest in strip searching the very group of detainees affected by the decision, and the ruling permits extreme invasions of personal privacy even in cases where there is no demonstrated benefit to jail security.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal; "><strong><a href="http://www.freemedia.at/about-us/staff-directory/">David Dadge</a> </strong>[Director, <a href="http://www.freemedia.at/">International Press Institute</a>]: &quot;The International Press Institute (IPI), as an organisation that has campaigned for almost 60 years for press freedom, wholeheartedly welcomes the <a href="/paperchase/2010_02_16_indexarch.php#7416404848295711333">proposals</a> made in the Icelandic parliament.  By selecting the best elements from existing laws overseas and combining them in these new proposals, Iceland hopes to become a shining beacon of press freedom in the world.  The proposals &#8212; to provide &quot;an attractive package of free speech and openness laws, including source protection, internal media communications protection, protection from libel tourism, immunity for intermediaries such as ISPs, and a tight statute of limitations on litigation,&quot; as <a href="http://wikileaks.org/">WikiLeaks</a> editor Julian Assange said &#8212; are exemplary and deserve great praise.  Iceland already had an excellent global reputation for press freedom and these measures will help boost and re-establish it as a world leader in press freedom following the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan/26/iceland-credit-crunch">banking crisis of 2009</a>.</span></strong><div><strong><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal; "><br />However, it is important to remember that while global organisations such as WikiLeaks will be able to take advantage of the media laws in Iceland by relocating servers and workers to Iceland, and thus enabling them to continue their sterling work, this is not a feasible option for the average newspaper or blogger in a repressive state such as Iran, Cuba or Burma.  Using an Icelandic-based ISP will not stop governments who regularly act extra-judicially to clamp down on Internet use.  The blocking of social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook in Iran and Vietnam, not to mention the countless anti-government blogs such as Generaci&oacute;n Y in Cuba, demonstrate the lengths repressive regimes will go to, to curtail freedom of speech online.<br /><br /></span></strong></div><div><strong><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal; ">Moreover, violations of press freedom are often more subtle than the closing down of publishers, newspapers and websites.  Cultures of self-censorship and general fear of kidnappings, attacks and killings will not drastically lessen thanks to Iceland&#39;s &quot;haven.&quot;<br /><br /></span></strong></div><div><strong><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal; ">As a result, it is vital that the Icelandic government and parliament speak out on the international stage and condemn countries that fail to uphold international principles of media freedom.  By doing so, it will be seen to be holding repressive regimes abroad to account, as well as promoting press freedom at home.<br /><br /></span></strong></div><div><strong><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal; ">We at IPI sincerely hope that the rest of the world, especially those who have already embraced the principles of press freedom, follow Iceland&#39;s example, and await the outcome in the Icelandic parliament with great interest.&quot;</span></strong></div><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Min Myat Kyaw </strong><a>[Member, </a><a href="http://www.ahrchk.net/index.php">Asian Human Rights Commission</a>]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/myanmar-court-sentences-suu-kyi.php">sentencing</a> of four supporters of democracy party leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi to two years&#39; imprisonment last week is the latest instance of how courts in Burma (Myanmar) operate under the military regime there to defeat civil and political rights, without regard to the terms of the very laws that they purport to uphold.  <div><br /></div><div>The imprisonment of Naw Ohn Hla and three others attracted some interest abroad partly because it coincided with a visit to Burma by the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in the country, Tomas Ojea Quintana.  The envoy has rightly emphasized that an election scheduled for late in the year will not be taken seriously abroad unless all prisoners of conscience are freed. </div><div><br /></div><div>But the manner in which cases of political imprisonment are conducted in Burma underscores the difficulties that the global community faces in documenting and addressing their incidence.  The same week that Naw Ohn Hla was jailed, the Asian Human Rights Commission <a href="http://www.ahrchk.net/ua/mainfile.php/2008/3045/">issued</a> an appeal on new charges against Ma Sandar, who was released just last September after serving a sentence that was instigated by her complaints about corrupt councilors.  The new case against her is under the same sections of law and before the same judge; the outcome too will probably be the same.  The week before, the Commission issued an appeal for Dr. Wint Thu and eight others, whom Special Branch police illegally arrested and held incommunicado for nearly three months. In December a court <a href="http://www.aappb.org/Chronology_Jan_2010_Eng.pdf">handed</a> them jail terms of up to 71 years for allegedly planning to commemorate the monk-led uprising of 2007.  The prosecutor&#39;s evidence consisted of confessions that were extracted through police torture. </div><div><br /></div><div>The constant movement of detainees to and from Burma&#39;s jails on charges that have little or nothing to do with the real reasons for their custody and even less to do with the standards of law that the courts pretend to enforce makes tracking their cases and understanding their mechanics a full time job.  No sooner are persons like Ma Sandar or Naw Ohn Hla let out than they or others are rearrested and charged with new offences.  There are no sweeps netting hundreds or thousands of dissidents that might grab headlines overseas.  Nor are there any mass releases: amnesties free up space for new inmates, and typically include few political prisoners, many of whom are near to the end of their terms anyhow.  Instead there is only a daily passing back and forth through the penal turnstiles. There is only the pointless inflicting of meaningless punishments on people like Naw Ohn Hla, Ma Sandar and Dr. Wint Thu, who are condemned for mundane acts that in most other parts of the world would not excite official interest, let alone attract criminal sanctions.  There is only the cruel banality of a dictatorship whose institutions for political and social control are not going to go away on account of an election.&quot;</div><br />

		<title>Convention on Cluster Munitions sets new international humanitarian law standard</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal; "><strong>Thomas Nash</strong> [Coordinator, <a href="http://www.stopclustermunitions.org/">Cluster Munition Coalition</a>]: &quot;Future generations will remember 2010 as the year cluster bombs became illegal around the world.  Following its swift <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/cluster-munitions-treaty-to-take-effect.php">ratification</a> by 30 states, the Convention on Cluster Munitions - the most significant disarmament and humanitarian treaty in more than a decade - enters into force on August 1, establishing a new international legal standard for civilian protection.<div><br /></div><div>A cluster munition (or cluster bomb) is a weapon containing multiple - often hundreds - of small explosive submunitions or bomblets.  Air-dropped or ground-launched, they cause two major humanitarian problems and risks to civilians. First, their widespread dispersal means they threaten military targets and civilians alike, so the humanitarian impact can be extreme, especially when the weapon is used in or near populated areas, as it frequently has been.  Many submunitions fail to detonate on impact and become de facto antipersonnel mines, killing and maiming people long after the conflict has ended.  These duds can be more lethal than antipersonnel mines; incidents involving submunition duds are more likely to cause death than injury.</div><div><br /></div><div>The CCM came about through a close partnership between pro-ban governments, civil society led by the Cluster Munition Coalition, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and UN agencies.  The leadership of affected states and individual cluster bomb survivors was crucial to its success.  The rationale for establishing the new norm is quite simple: international humanitarian law inadequately addressed the use of cluster munitions because it was too difficult to apply and it was too open to interpretation.  Just as importantly, only a precise and clear rule prohibiting cluster munitions can send the message to state parties and states not party alike that the use of such weapons is not morally acceptable.</div><div><br /></div><div>Since it opened for signature in Oslo in December 2008, the CCM has been signed by 104 states and ratified by 30.</div><div><br /></div><div>As only a small percentage of existing cluster munition stockpiles has been deployed in armed conflict, the convention can be seen as preventive, in particular in comparison with the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, which was negotiated during the height of the landmine crisis.  The convention protects civilians by prohibiting cluster munition production and requiring the destruction of remaining stockpiles.  But it also advances the right of cluster bomb survivors to be included in society and to lead dignified lives, by setting clear obligations for states to provide assistance to victims and affected communities.</div><div><br /></div><div>The implementation of the Mine Ban Treaty, which is in many respects a forebear to the CCM, has shown that even states not party have felt increasingly pressured to abandon use of a prohibited weapon due to the stigma surrounding its use.  Experience has shown, that even before its entry into force, the CCM has already had a similar stigmatizing effect, causing states to shy away from using cluster bombs.  The two most recent instances where cluster bombs are known to have been used in armed conflict - by the Israel Defense Forces in Lebanon in 2006 and by both Russia and Georgia in South Ossetia in 2008 - met with international condemnation.  The United States, another non-signatory, imposed an export ban on 99 percent of its stockpile of cluster munitions in March 2009 and plans to stop using the overwhelming majority of its cluster munitions from 2018</div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: -webkit-xxx-large;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:130%;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 16px;"><br /></span></span></span></div><div><div><div>After the Convention on Cluster Munitions enters into force, the next milestone will be the First Meeting of States Parties, which will be held in Lao PDR in late 2010. As a result of US bombing more than 30 years ago, Lao PDR is the country most heavily contaminated by cluster munitions.</div><div><br /></div><div>This year will be the best opportunity for additional states to join the CCM - to get in on the ground floor of this new international standard - and begin to implement the treaty&#39;s provisions to rid the world of cluster bombs, prevent harm to civilians and assist all those affected to realize their fundamental rights.&quot;</div></div></div></span></strong><br />

		<title>Pakistan: New &#039;Judges&#039; Case&#039; in the Making?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnists <a href="http://law.anu.edu.au/scripts/StaffDetails.asp?StaffID=477">Moeen Cheema</a> of Australian National University College of Law and Shahzad Akbar, an advocate practicing at the Lahore High Court in Pakistan, say that since Pakistan President&#39;s Zardari&#39;s refusal to appoint judges to the Lahore High Court (LHC) seriously undermines the capacity of that key court to provide justice in human rights cases and is a matter of public importance, either the LHC or the country&#39;s Supreme Court may eventually direct the president to comply with the Supreme Court&#39;s recent holding in the &quot;Judges&#39; Case&quot;....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/paksupcourt.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->T<odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->he threat of an imminent "clash&quot; of the institutions of the state, the executive, and the judiciary appears to have materialized in Pakistan. The President, Asif Ali Zardari, and the Governor of Pakistan's largest and most populous province of Punjab, Salmaan Taseer, are resisting the appointment of judges recommended by the chief justices of the Supreme Court and the Lahore High Court (LHC).<br /><br />The president has refused Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry&#39;s recommendation for the elevation of Justice Saqib Nisar, the second senior-most judge of the LHC, arguing that it is instead the current chief justice of the LHC who ought to be elevated to the Supreme Court. Until that issue is resolved, Governor Taseer appears determined to stall the appointment of judges against approximately 30 vacancies in the LHC on the recommendation of the current chief justice of the LHC. The historic judgment of the Supreme Court in the Al-jihad Trust Case, popularly known as the Judges&#39; Case, is being distorted and misquoted in order to justify the executive&#39;s refusal to appoint the judges.<br /><br />In 1994, President Farooq Leghari, acting on the advice of Prime Minister Benzair Bhutto, appointed 20 judges to the LHC as well as acting chief justices to the LHC and the High Court of Sindh. This appointment of pro-government judges was resented by all relevant stakeholders, including the Bar Councils around the country. It was in this context that petitions were filed and, finally, the issue was resolved in what we know popularly as the Judges&#39; Case in 1996.<br /><br />Article 177 of the Constitution states that: &quot;The Chief Justice of Pakistan shall be appointed by the President, and each of the other Judges shall be appointed by the President after consultation with the Chief Justice.&quot; In the Judges&#39; Case the Supreme Court interpreted this provision to mean that while the president nominally has the power to appoint the chief justice of the Supreme Court, he/she has no discretion in that matter and is obligated to appoint the senior-most judge in the Supreme Court to that post. The court also held that the consultation with the chief justice referred to in the constitutional provision is binding upon the President.<br /><br />Likewise, Article 193 states that the president shall appoint the judges of the High Courts &quot;after consultation&quot; with the Chief Justice of Pakistan, the Governor of the province and the Chief Justice of the High Court of that province. In appointing the chief justices of the High Courts, the president shall only consult with the chief justice of the Supreme Court and the Governor. Again, it was held that the consultation with the chief justices is binding upon the President. If judicial independence is to be ensured, the executive ought to have no say in the choice of candidates for judicial positions.<br /><br />As regards the appointment of the Chief Justices of the High Courts and the Supreme Court, it was held that the senior-most judge of that court has a legitimate expectation to be appointed to that position once it becomes vacant. However, the issue currently is very different from that taken up by the Supreme Court in the Judges&#39; Case. Here the president&#39;s men are arguing that the senior-most judge of the High Court ought to be elevated to the Supreme Court. The Judges&#39; Case laid down the principle of seniority for appointment of existing judges to the post of the chief justice, but it did not deal with the appointment of new judges to the Supreme Court, and it did not require the chief justices of the High Courts be elevated when a vacancy is created in the Supreme Court.<br /><br />This specific issue was thoroughly discussed in the case of Supreme Court Bar Association through its <u>President Hamid Khan vs. the Federation of Pakistan</u> (2002) where, once again, a five-member bench examined the appointment of judges in the Supreme Court and the issue of seniority in the High Courts for such appointments. Explaining the spirit of the Judges&#39; Case and subsequent precedents, the Supreme Court held that the contention that the chief justice of a High Court is entitled to be elevated to the Supreme Court due to seniority &quot;is misconceived and travels beyond the parameters indicated in the Judges&#39; Case. In our considered view, the scope of seniority and legitimate expectancy enunciated in those cases is restricted to the appointments of the Chief Justice of a High Court and the Chief Justice of Pakistan, and these issues neither apply nor can be extended to the appointment of Judges of the Supreme Court.&quot;<br /><br />It was categorically stated that there is neither constitutional convention nor past practice to elevate the senior-most judges of a High Court to the Supreme Court. An interesting comparison was also drawn by the Supreme Court between Article 180 of the Constitution of Pakistan, which governs the appointments of acting chief justices of the Supreme Court and where the words &quot;the most senior of the other Judges&quot; are mentioned, and Article 177, which deals with the appointment of a Supreme Court judge and where such language is missing. In the Supreme Court&#39;s own words: &quot;the absence of the words &#39;most senior&#39; in Article 177 for appointment of Judges of the Supreme Court would show that the seniority of a Judge in the High Court is not a <span style="font-style:italic;">sine qua non</span> for his appointment as a Judge of the Supreme Court.&quot;<br /><br />Another argument which undermines the government&#39;s argument is that judges may be appointed directly from the bar and not from among the judges of the High Courts. Advocates with 15 years of practice and retired High Court judges may be appointed to the Supreme Court, and we have precedents of several such appointments to the Supreme Court.<br /><br />The chief justice of the Supreme Court is the head of the judiciary and it is his prerogative to recommend judicial appointments according to the Constitution. His role in judicial appointment is central and his opinion concerning the competence of an individual to serve as a judge is binding upon the executive and the only reason that the executive may withhold an appointment recommended by him is where the governor or the president has adverse information concerning the character or conduct of a recommended candidate. The issues of seniority, suitability, and knowledge of law are areas which are to be judged by the chief justice.<br /><br />In fairness, this is not the most suitable method in the world for making judicial appointments. For example, judicial appointments may be made upon the recommendation of an independent commission, as done in the UK, or after vetting by Parliament if the US model is followed. However, until the constitutional method for judicial appointments is changed there is a choice to be made between either granting the president a greater say in judicial appointments, as was historic
ally the case, or the chief justice, as has been the situation after the Judges&#39; Case. The latter is clearly preferable.<br /><br />Given the weight of the precedents and the underlying principles, it should not surprise anyone when the Supreme Court quashes the notification of appointment to the Supreme Court issued by the President in contravention of Chief Justice Chaudhary's advice. Furthermore, if the president and the governor are under the impression that they can stall the appointments of judges to the LHC indefinitely, they are mistaken. Article 184 empowers the Supreme Court to make an order of the same kind that the High Courts can issue pursuant to their writ jurisdiction if there is &quot;a question of public importance with reference to the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights.&quot; Article 199(1)(c) empowers a High Court to &quot;make an order giving such directions to any person or authority, including any government&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;as may be appropriate for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights.&quot; Since the refusal to appoint judges to the LHC is seriously undermining the capacity of that court to provide justice in human rights cases and is a matter of public importance, either the LHC or the Supreme Court may eventually direct the president to comply with the Supreme Court&#39;s direction. <br />    <br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Moeen Cheema is an Associate Lecturer at the Australian National University&#39;s College of Law. Shahzad Akbar is an advocate practicing at the Lahore High Court and a visiting lecturer at the Islamic International University, Islamabad.</span><br /><br /><br /><em>Postscript</em>: Contrary to Chief Justice Chaudhary&#39;s recommendation, President Asif Ali Zardari issued a notification on February 13 purporting to elevate Justice Khwaja Sharif (Chief Justice of Lahore High Court) as a judge of the Supreme Court and appointing Justice Saqib Nisar as Acting Chief Justice of Lahore High Court.However, both of the judges refused to accept the notification as valid. The Chief Justice of Pakistan, Iftikhar Chaudhary, immediately took suo moto notice of the palpably unconstitutional action of the President and constituted a 3-member bench that suspended the notifications. The government initially defended its actions but relented in the face of rising public pressure and criticism from the bar, opposition political parties, and the media. The government withdrew the notifications on February 17 and the Prime Minister agreed to make all judicial appointments in the Supreme Court and the High Courts according to the recommendations of the Chief Justice of Pakistan.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.creighton.edu/law/faculty/aronson/index.php">Bruce Aronson</a> of Creighton University School of Law says that Japanese automobile manufacturer Toyota&#39;s current safety crisis - now the subject of Congressional hearings - should prompt the company to address its seriously flawed system of governance more than just its public image....<br/><hr size=1><br/><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forum/brucearonson.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><strong>T</strong></font>he next phase in Toyota's crisis will be the appearance of the President of Toyota Motor Corporation, Akio Toyoda, before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on February 24th.  <br /><br />His message will likely reflect an opinion he published in the <em>Washington Post</em> on February 9th entitled "<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/08/AR2010020803078_pf.html">Toyota's Plan to Repair its Public Image</a>."  <br /><br />In it he outlines a number of steps he is taking to address Toyota's current crisis, including internal and external reviews of operations and quality controls, more vigorous investigation of consumer complaints, more effective internal sharing of information, and better communications with regulators.<br /><br />Conspicuously absent from this list of worthy measures is any mention of the role of the board of directors in corporate governance.  The structure and function of a typical Japanese corporate board reinforces the penchant for corporate secrecy in Japan, which is often cited as a cause of Toyota's problems. <br /><br />In both the United States and Japan, the board of directors has a legally mandated function to ensure a corporation's compliance with law.  In both countries, case law provides that directors have a duty of oversight&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;as part of their fiduciary duties owed to the corporation and its shareholders&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;to establish and monitor an information and reporting system designed to ensure such compliance.  In the United States the duty of oversight in Delaware stems from the well-known Caremark decision, while in Japan it results from a shareholder derivative suit related to the $1.1 billion trading loss scandal in Daiwa Bank's New York branch in 1995 (see my <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=920853">law review article</a> analyzing this case and its impact in Japan).  Statutes in both countries also provide for broader systems of internal controls.  In this case Toyota's systems failed badly.<br /><br />In Japan the legal duty of oversight often clashes with the traditional structure of Japanese boards&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;large, hierarchical boards in which directors are all insiders and retain "line" management responsibilities.  As a result, any problem can appear to be limited to the director(s) "in charge" of a particular area despite the common fiduciary duty owed by each director.<br /><br />The Toyota case is particularly interesting because Toyota has been held out in Japan as the prime example of the strength of this "traditional" system of Japanese corporate governance.  This system relies on competition in product markets, team production alliances with suppliers, and "main banks" to monitor the performance of corporate management, as opposed to "Western" approaches such as independent directors and a market for corporate control.<br /><br />A "Western" approach appeared in Japan in 2002 as part of an ongoing debate on reform of corporate governance following Japan's "lost decade" of the 1990s. An amendment to Japan's corporate law at that time provided Japanese companies with an option to replace their German-inspired, traditional positions of representative director (a director chosen by the board to represent the corporation, much like a president) and internal corporate auditor (elected by shareholders to monitor directors' performance) with an "American-style" system of executive officers and board committees with independent directors.  Not many Japanese companies have adopted this new system, although the number is slowly increasing.<br /><br />Until recently the Japanese often contrasted the success of Toyota, the champion of traditional Japanese governance, with the poor performance of Sony, which adopted the "American-style" board committee system and now has a foreigner as its CEO.  This popular comparison was always somewhat exaggerated.  For example, in 2003 Toyota modified its system through the introduction of "non-board managing officers" and a reduction in the number of directors on its board (from over 40 to 29).  However, even today every area of the company is represented by a senior manager on the board of directors and there are no outside directors.  Given Toyota's current problems and its prominence, it will be interesting to see if other Japanese companies will now reconsider this traditional system and incorporate a greater element of independent monitoring of management. <br /><br />This is not to suggest that the apparent downfall of Toyota condemns the entire system of Japanese corporate governance.  Every system has its corporate scandals.  The result of scandals such as Enron in the United States has been an even greater emphasis on independent directors in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and elsewhere.  Such measures were not effective in preventing new scandals, such as those accompanying the financial crisis of 2008.  For example, one oft-cited weakness at Citigroup was the board's lack of industry expertise and experience, and its resulting inability to monitor traders' risk management practices concerning complex financial products.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Toyota's response to its current troubles is striking because it has maintained its rather narrow emphasis on manufacturing quality and production issues in the face of a full-fledged crisis.  A problem of this magnitude is not simply a matter of a technical fix or of repairing Toyota's public image.  There were also significant flaws in Toyota's governance system.  Perhaps Mr. Toyoda and his colleagues should also consider a plan for a greater role of the board of directors, compliance with law, and corporate governance issues within "the Toyota Way."<br /><br />The House Oversight Committee might even be interested in hearing about it.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist Gail Davidson, Executive Director of <a href="http://www.lrwc.org/">Lawyers Rights Watch Canada</a>, says that the Supreme Court of Canada was simply wrong in taking the extraordinary step of denying Canadian Guantanamo detainee Omar Khadr the remedy ordered by the courts below &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; the only remedy available &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; based on the arbitrary power of the executive to conduct foreign affairs....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/gaildavidson.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->T<odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->he decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in the Omar Khadr[1] case &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; which implies that remedies to prevent torture and punish perpetrators are a privilege to be granted or withheld at the pleasure of the Prime Minister &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; is wrong.<br /><br />The Supreme Court of Canada confirmed that the government of Canada violated Omar Khadr's rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, that those violations continue, and that those violations contribute to his ongoing detention. The court was referring to the fact that officials from Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) interrogated Omar Khadr at Guantanamo Bay and gave their interrogation records to Khadr's U.S. captors after being told that U.S. officials had tortured Khadr (by severe sleep deprivation)[2] for three weeks to "make him more amenable and willing to talk" to the Canadians and that he would be placed in isolation after the interrogation.<br /><br />Ignoring the imperative international duties triggered by these appalling facts, the Supreme Court of Canada went on to rule it appropriate to leave "it to the government to decide how best to respond&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;"[3] The court set aside the 23 April 2009 order of the Federal Court of Canada &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; confirmed by the Federal Court of Appeal on 14 August 2009 &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; compelling the Prime Minister, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Commissioner of the RCMP, and the Director of CSIS to &quot;&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;request that the United States return Mr. Khadr to Canada as soon as practicable.&quot;<br /><br />The Federal Court order was in keeping with the decision made by the Canadian government in March 2009. In June 2008 the Committee struck to study the Omar Khadr case recommended to Parliament "&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;that the Government of Canada demand Omar Khadr's release from U.S. custody at Guantanamo Bay to the custody of Canadian law enforcement officials as soon as practical."[4] On 23 March 2009, Parliament voted by a majority to accept that recommendation, thereby directing the Prime Minister to act to secure Khadr's release and repatriation.<br /><br />In setting aside the lower court orders and overriding the will of Parliament, the court cited a need to respect the prerogative power of the executive to conduct foreign affairs, described as the "&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;arbitrary authority, which at any given time is legally left in the hand of the Crown&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;".<br /><br />To arrive at this conclusion, the court relied on a text published in 1915: long before the prohibition of torture became a norm of <span style="font-style:italic;">jus cogens</span>, a "peremptory norm of general international law" from which no derogation is permitted; long before the "&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;use of torture&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;by state authorities&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;&quot; had come to be regarded as an attack upon the international order[5]; long before the individual's right to freedom from torture took precedence over the right of states to conduct their affairs free from interference by other states. Under current international law, the duties of states to enact and enforce effective remedies to prevent and punish torture are not subservient to any other domestic or international purpose or circumstance including "comity" between states.<br /><br />In taking the extraordinary step of denying Khadr the remedy ordered by the courts below &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; the only remedy available &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; based on the existence of an arbitrary power not supported by law, the Supreme Court of Canada was simply wrong. It was simply wrong for the court to conclude that characterizing a remedy for torture as a foreign affairs policy matter displaces the imperative legal duties under the Convention against Torture to take effective action. Prime Minister Harper cannot clothe himself with the power to do what is prohibited by international and Canadian law. By law, torture against a Canadian citizen must be remedied through investigation and prosecution of suspects. Obviously the victim &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; in this case Khadr &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; must be removed from the control of the perpetrators of crimes against him. Neither the Prime Minister nor "government" has any "residual" right to "speak freely with a foreign state"[6] on the suspension or relaxation of the absolute prohibition against torture.[7] Torture can never be considered a legitimate act of state; neither can suspending or refusing remedies be legitimated as foreign policy.<br /><br />The language used by the court to describe key facts and principles creates the erroneous impression that U.S. accusations against Omar Khadr are more serious than, and therefore take precedence over, the crimes the U.S. is known to have committed against him.<br /><br />Here are examples of the misleading language used by the court in the Khadr judgment:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">"frequent flyer program"</span> is used to refer to the torture of Khadr by subjecting him to prolonged and severe sleep deprivation to enhance extraction of information by Canadian officials.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">"trial"</span> is used to refer to the military commissions process found by the U.S. Supreme Court to illegally violate the right to a fair trial by a "regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples."<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">"war crimes"</span> is used to describe charges against Khadr that have been challenged as illegitimate because they are: unknown to the laws of war; created after they are alleged to have been committed, for which reason prosecution is absolutely barred;[8] and inapplicable since as a child Khadr lacked the capacity to consent to involvement in war. <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"><br />"the trial is proceeding"</span> refers to a delay[9] of almost eight years - a delay that violates the right to be tried within a reasonable time under Canadian and U.S. law.[10] Were Khadr before a regularly constituted court, the prosecution would be stayed on the basis of that delay.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">"government"</span> is used to refer to Stephen Harper, the Commissioner of the RCMP, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Director of CSIS.[11]<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">"Mr. Khadr's rights under s. 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were violated"</span> refers to the most grave violations of Khadr's rights to liberty[12]; due process[13]; freedom from torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment[14]; freedom from arbitrary imprisonment[15]; freedom from prosecution for <span style="font-style:italic;">ex post facto</span> crimes; a fair trial; timely and confidential legal representation; determination of criminal charges by an impartial and independent tribunal; <span style="font-style:italic;">habeas corpus</span> for determination of the legality of imprisonment and treatment during imprisonment; equality before the law and equal access to the protection of the l
aw;[16] and, under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Convention on the Rights of the Child</span>, to rehabilitation, education and re-integration into free society.<br /><br />Finally, the Supreme Court of Canada decision in the Khadr case ignored the legal reality that without remedies there are no rights.[17] The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada has in the past observed that had freedom from torture and other basic rights been enforced, the Holocaust could not have occurred.[18]<br /><br />By allowing the Prime Minister to refuse to take the actions required by law and approved by Parliament to stop violations of Omar Khadr's rights, and by dubbing Mr. Harper's inaction "foreign affairs," the Supreme Court of Canada has put the rights of us all at risk.<br /><br /><br /><em>Gail Davidson is the founder and Executive Director of Lawyers Rights Watch Canada and the Chair and co-founder of Lawyers Against the War.</em><br /><br /><font SIZE=1><br /><br />Notes<br /><br />1. <a href="http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2010/2010scc3/2010scc3.html"><span style="font-style:italic;">Prime Minister of Canada, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Director of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service and Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police v. Omar Ahmed Khadr, Supreme Court of Canada</span></a>, January 29, 2010<br /><br />2. Sleep deprivation used to extract information from a prisoner is torture according to a variety of authorities. UN experts, reviewing international law, confirmed in a 2006 report on Guantanamo Bay that sleep deprivation, even for several consecutive days, is torture. The <span style="font-style:italic;">U.S. Army Field Manual on Interrogation</span> in force in 2004 listed sleep deprivation as a form of torture. The Canadian government publication, <span style="font-style:italic;">Torture &amp; Abuse Awareness</span>, lists the U.S. as one of the ten countries worldwide known to engage in torture and lists sleep deprivation as a form of torture.<br /><br />3. "&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;in view of the constitutional responsibility of the executive to make decisions on matters of foreign affairs and the inconclusive state of the record.

Instruments that impose a mandatory duty to provide effective remedies against torture include the: Geneva Conventions; <span style="font-style:italic;">Rome Statute of the International Court; International Covenant on Civil and Criminal Rights</span>; <span style="font-style:italic;">Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Punishment or Treatment</span>; <span style="font-style:italic;">Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to Remedy and Reparations for Victims of Violations of International Human Rights and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law</span>; The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, articles 56 and 60; <span style="font-style:italic;">Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment</span>.<br /><br />8. Freedom from <span style="font-style:italic;">ex post facto</span> prosecutions is absolute and cannot be displaced by any authority under any<br />circumstances.<br /><br />9. Factors contributing to the delay include: rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court that the military commissions are illegal; dismissal of the charges; non-disclosure by the prosecution; leaked documents indicating falsification of evidence by the U.S. military; the Pentagon sacking of the military "Presiding Officer" in charge of the Khadr case; investigation of professional misconduct complaints against Khadr's lead military attorney; a 120-day adjournment imposed by President Obama in January 2009 for a review the process; and a four month suspension imposed by the president in May 2009 to alter the military commissions.<br /><br />10. The U.S. Constitution, art. VI, cl.2 guarantees a trial within a reasonable time, as does the Speedy Trial Act. In Canada this right is guaranteed by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms s. 11(b). The Supreme Court of Canada recently ruled that a two year delay violated Charter rights and that the appropriate remedy was to stay the prosecution. (<span style="font-style:italic;">R. v. Godin</span>, 2009 SCC 26)<br /><br />11. <span style="font-style:italic;">Supra</span> note 4, a para. 3, page 6.<br /><br />12. The right to liberty and not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice is guaranteed by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Charter of Rights and Freedoms</span>; the <span style="font-style:italic;">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</span>; and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</span>.<br /><br />13. Due Process rights, including rights to a lawyer, notice of charges and evidence, a fair trial before a competent and independent tribunal, <span style="font-style:italic;">habeas corpus</span>, an appeal, the presumption of innocence are guaranteed by a number of Canadian statutes and international instruments binding on Canada, e.g., the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; Third Geneva Convention; Crimes against Humanity and War Crimes Act; Convention on the Rights of the Child; Hague Conventions, Annex, art. 23(h).<br /><br />14.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/students/faculty/BDavis/BDavis.htm">Benjamin Davis</a> of the University of Toledo College of Law says that the guilt or innocence of &quot;enhanced interrogation&quot; memo writers John Yoo and Jay Bybee should be determined in state or federal court by a jury of their peers, rather than under the forgiving gaze of the Office of Professional Responsibility....<br /><hr size="1"><br /><table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/forumy/benjamindavisnew.jpg" align="left" vspace="2" hspace="0"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" width="5" height="1"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" width="1" height="1"></td></tr></tbody></table> <font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he long awaited Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) report on Jay Bybee and John Yoo was released yesterday.  In the long cover memo, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) reviewer went to great lengths to explain his decision not to support the intentional misconduct (for Yoo) and misconduct (for Bybee) recommendations of the OPR and not to make a referral to the Bar Associations.  At the same time, he leaves the matter up to the Bar Associations to decide whether they should take up the matter.<br /><br />As happens, I was recently at a National Security Court conference held here at the University of Toledo College of Law at which torture was brought up and discussed.  We were favored with the presence of Mr. John Rizzo, former Acting General Counsel of the CIA who just retired after 34 years of service.  When questioned on the repeated water-boarding of Khalid Sheik Mohammed, Mr. Rizzo presented the matter (I am paraphrasing) as being one where the people in the agency said that they thought they needed to do these things and that it may be morally wrong but this was the situation.<br /><br />I spoke from the floor saying that the problem was that some smart lawyers were made to reinterpret various laws and treaties and that based on this we got into this huge mess, and now some people are trying to deal with that by creating a new national security court as a new solution to the mess that has been created.  This is an old game with the United States government.  Sometimes it is followed by an apology 50 years later or so.  I suggested the following plan of action:  1) criminally prosecute the torturers; 2) bring all of these cases we want to try in Article III courts which provide us with transparency; and 3) after we clean that up- look at what we need to do to change.  I was met with the view that this is an old argument and that we should move beyond that.<br /><br />I am just a citizen and I am exercising my little bit of sovereignty in a representational democracy &#8212; something I like to call "The Sparkle of Sovereignty." I am even writing a book about that idea.<br /><br />My view is that a wide variety of groups of concerned American citizens exercising their respective sparkles of sovereignty should refer the OPR report immediately to the relevant bar associations to determine whether there were ethical violations by Yoo and Bybee.<br /><br />Beyond that, here is a radical concept for all these DOJ types: let a jury decide.  I trust in twelve American jurors weighing the evidence competently presented by a US Attorney, and Yoo and Bybee being represented by competent defense attorneys in 1) an Article III court based on a federal prosecution by a special prosecutor or a state prosecutor pursuant to a  federal officer removal act proceeding from state court or 2) in a state court to be able to examine whether these persons have the requisite <span style="font-style:italic;">mens rea</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">actus reus</span> to have violated federal law and/or state law with regard to torture.<br /><br />I think it is important in our system of separation of powers and federalism to provide the double security to the protection of the rights of the people so cherished by James Madison in the Federalist Papers.  Madison wrote:<br /><br /><blockquote>"In the compound republic of America, the power surrendered by the people is first divided between two distinct governments, and then the portion allotted to each subdivided among distinct and separate departments. Hence a double security arises to the rights of the people. The different governments will control each other, at the same time that each will be controlled by itself."<br /><br /><a href="http://www.foundingfathers.info/federalistpapers/fedindex.htm">Federalist No. 51</a> (James Madison)</blockquote><br />Within the federal government, it appears clear that DOJ officials tend to have a terrible time handling the pressure as they move up the hierarchy.  As one person quoted in the report says, "we freaked out."  As an American citizen, I do not want the people who are subject to the public trust "freaking out" like some fifth grader.  During 9/11 I was teaching a class and while there were lots of students who "freaked out," one of the hallmarks of that class during the attack was a former Navy man who was an older fellow who said that the first thing we have to do is go back to first principles of who we are.  That, I would submit, is the kind of thinking we need to embrace.  Not panic and hubris.<br /><br />There is an effort in the OPR report to create space for what I will call the misfeasance at the top/malfeasance at the bottom game that I noted in my article Refluat Stercus.  The passive voice of "mistakes were made" &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; a litany from former people at the top of the Executive and Legislative &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; is one example of this game.  Grunts at Abu Ghraib get court-martialed and the higher ups are just seen to have made "errors of judgment".<br /><br />I would like a grand jury of American citizens to hear all the evidence and decide whether to issue an indictment.  I would like, if such an indictment is issued, for these defendants and plenty of material witnesses (such as John Rizzo who is named in the OPR report at key junctures) to be heard under oath in a public court providing the kind of record of their statements that helps give meaning to important trials such as Nuremberg. And I would like a jury of their peers to decide on the innocence or guilt of these people&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;not just the lawyers&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;so we can have a decision that gives clear guidance as to whether these acts amounted to a crime.  Why?  So that the next time someone "freaks out" because someone attacks us, when asked to do this kind of OLC memo, they will see a clear US precedent that says as clearly as possible what is a crime under our law.  If that conviction fails, it also provides an opportunity to Congress to see whether it should amend out statutes to better capture torture.  And, it would provide for those who have entered into international obligations with the United States an opportunity to see whether we are trying to extract ourselves from our international obligations in our compound republic in the manner that our jurisdiction to enforce, prescribe, and adjudicate is put together.<br /><br />Also, under the doctrine of complementarity, it reduces the possibility of similar cases happening about Americans being brought in other countries. I suspect that even as we speak the OPR report has been sent to the Spanish prosecutor prosecuting the U.S. lawyers who helped orchestrate the torture by the United States. Let's clean our very dirty laundry at home.<br /><br />I think this is important because it is clear that whatever the administration, there is a clear manifest need for a criminal prosecution to help the high-level civilians and generals of our government in the past, now and in the future understand that "word games" of reinterpretation on something as serious as torture &#8212; will get you into a jail cell. Especially now that we know that we were lied to about some detainees committing suicide down at Gitmo &#8212; they were murdered per Scott Horton's article out yesterday in Harper's.  En
ough is enough.<br /><br /><br /><em>Benjamin Davis is a professor at the University of Toledo College of Law</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnists Sharon Bradford Franklin, senior counsel at the <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/">Constitution Project</a>, and Karen Bloom, legal fellow with the Constitution Project, say that the US Supreme Court&#39;s decision in the upcoming <u>Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project</u> case challenging the constitutionality of laws prohibiting "material support" to terrorist groups may have serious implications for our First Amendment protections....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/forumscotus.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>W</strong></font>ould you consider any of the following to be criminal acts: advocating non-violent means of resolving conflicts, teaching English, educating a group about its humanitarian obligations, or providing legal services? <br /><br />They might be, if the U.S. Supreme Court upholds the current form of federal laws prohibiting "material support" to terrorist groups. On February 23rd, the Court is scheduled to hear oral argument in <u>Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project</u>, a case which challenges the constitutionality of certain provisions of these laws. Under those provisions, it is a criminal act to provide services, training, expert advice or assistance, or personnel to groups the government has designated as "terrorist." <br /><br />Although the material support statutes provide an important counter-terrorism tool, the existing law is so broad that the government has essentially maintained that all acts in support of designated organizations further their terrorist ends and are impermissible. As such, even humanitarian organizations' attempts to convince the designated groups to abandon violent tactics in pursuit of peace could be found to violate the laws. <br /><br />In addition to being vague and over-broad, the "material support" laws also run afoul of the First Amendment because they restrict association rights and discriminate between types of speech.  For example, providing religious materials (even if they are intended to further terrorist activity) is exempted from the prohibitions, but all provision of political aid (even if it is designed to counter-terrorism and promote peace) is prohibited. <br /><br />The district court and Court of Appeals that heard this case on its way to the Supreme Court recognized the constitutional problems with the "material support" laws. Both courts ruled that parts of the "material support" laws are unconstitutional in certain contexts because they could cover activities protected by the First Amendment. <br /><br />Nevertheless, the government maintains that the broad prohibition is necessary to its counter-terrorism efforts. Without question, cutting off support for terrorist activity is an essential part of the U.S.'s counter-terrorism strategy. Our government must have the tools needed to apprehend and punish those who work to facilitate and enable acts of terrorism, not just terrorist leaders. However, in providing the legal authority to prohibit and punish such conduct, it is essential that the law respect constitutional freedoms. <br /><br />Moreover, criminalizing even attempts to discourage the terrorist activities of designated groups not only violates the Constitution, but is counter-productive. Outlawing the very advocacy that is most likely to neutralize the threat of groups designated as "terrorist" undermines, rather than advancing, our counter-terrorism objectives. <br /><br />To address these issues, late last year the Constitution Project's bipartisan Liberty and Security Committee proposed a series of reforms to the "material support" laws that would better tailor them to our counter-terrorism objectives and would ensure that they do not violate fundamental constitutional rights. The consensus recommendations of this Committee, which is composed of prominent policy experts, former government officials, and legal scholars from across the political spectrum, are contained in its report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Reforming the Material Support Laws: Constitutional Concerns Presented by Prohibitions on Material Support to "Terrorist Organizations."  </span><br /><br />The Committee, among other proposals, called on Congress to (1) provide that pure speech may be punished only if it intended to further illegal conduct, and (2) exempt from the definition of "material support" humanitarian aid items such as medical services, civilian public health services and&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;if provided to noncombatants&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;food, water, clothing and shelter. Based upon this report, the Constitution Project filed an amicus brief in the Supreme Court in the <u>Humanitarian Law Project</u> case, arguing that the challenged provisions of the material support statute chill free speech and association in violation of the First Amendment. <br /><br />The Committee's proposals would go a long way toward making clear that counter-terrorism initiatives must not overstep constitutional restrictions and to ensure that the "material support" laws do not infringe on First Amendment rights. As the Constitution Project urged in its amicus brief, the Court should strike down the challenged provisions as unconstitutional. And hopefully Congress will soon revisit and revise the "material support" laws to address the remaining constitutional flaws not at issue in the Humanitarian Law Project case. <br /><br /><em>Sharon Bradford Franklin is senior counsel at the Constitution Project in Washington DC.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.mallat.com/">Chibli Mallat</a>, professor of law at the University of Utah and Saint Joseph&#39;s University, Lebanon, says that for the sake of stability in Iraq&#39;s upcoming elections, it&#39;s imperative that all parties respect the Iraqi judiciary&#39;s recent decision on candidate eligibility....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/chiblimallatnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>t took the US Supreme Court 180 pages to issue the controversial &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; and by most accounts, poor &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; <u>Citizens United</u> decision which equated corporations with individual human beings and which threw overboard a carefully crafted bipartisan law meant to reduce the power of money in US elections.<br /><br />In its <u>'Abd al-Amir</u> decision of February 3, 2010, it took the Iraqi Cassation Chamber ten lines to bring hope to an endangered electoral process in Iraq. It was published on February 4 on the <a href="http://www.iraqja.org/news/108justice.htm">Higher Judicial Council&#39;s website</a>, and is available <a href="http://www.gjpi.org/2010/02/03/appeal-panel-overturns-election-ban-and-postpones-de-baathification-examination/">here</a> in English.<br /><br />I have <a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=10&categ_id=30&article_id=111149">argued</a> that last month&#39;s <u>Citizens United</u> decision repeated the ill-bent precedent of the infamous <u>Bush v. Gore</u> decision of December 2000 in the sense that the judges appeared to act as mere political agents for the parties of the presidents who appointed each of them. At great cost to the judiciary&#39;s credibility, both cases split down the middle politically, with 5 Republicans against 4 Democrats. Hence the finesse, in contrast, of the Iraqi judiciary&#39;s <u>'Abd al-Amir</u> decision.<br /><br />In an occasionally endearing ruling about the risk of being a judge in a country like Iraq, the Cassation Chamber admitted the appeals lodged by some 500 candidates on the basis of their exclusion from the electoral lists. That exclusion was decreed by the Accountability and Justice Committee on account of the candidates&#39; organic ties with the previous Baath regime. The Court declared that it did not have time to examine the appeals, and that while candidates had a constitutional right to run for elections, the Court could cancel the results in case of success if the &#39;democratic credentials&#39; required by the anti-Baath law had not been met.<br /><br />At the origins of the electoral turmoil in Iraq was the precedent created by the <a href="http://mallat.com/WebPages/DossierAfghanistanLawPage.htm">botched Afghani presidential election</a>, which saw the rigging of the election of incumbent president Hamid Karzai go unpunished.<br /><br />Challenges to the stability of the electoral system in Iraq started with the late approval of the electoral law on November 8, 2009. From the start, this appeared to be a harbinger of fishy dealings because it left candidates with little time to establish their tactics and coalition strategy. Then Tareq al-Hashimi &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; one of the three members of the Iraqi Presidency Council &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; unreasonably vetoed the law on November 18, pushing the date beyond the January deadline requested by an earlier ruling of the Federal Supreme Court. In a country with deep national and sectarian divisions, this was perceived as a Sunni ploy &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; Hashimi being Sunni. The unease was continued by rumblings of the president of the Kurdish region, Mas&#39;ud Barzani, who threatened that same week to boycott the elections if certain Kurdish demands were not met. This was perceived as a Kurdish ploy. As soon as the date was finalized in the wake of a last-minute compromise between Hashimi and the Kurds, the crisis of the excluded candidates was set by the decision of the Accountability and Justice Commission on 19 January 2010. Since almost one-sixth of the candidates were excluded, the crisis became national. This was perceived as a Shi&#39;i ploy.<br /><br />At the heart of the last crisis lie two conflicting basic principles: the candidate&#39;s freedom to run, and the public&#39;s right to be shielded from self-styled advocates of the Baath system.<br /><br />The Court rendered nothing less than a Solomonic judgment. Tempers run high in elections, and Iraq is no exception. The Accountability and Justice Commission certainly erred in delaying the examination of candidates&#39; credentials until so late in the day, and disqualified too many people for its decision not to appear excessive so close to the elections. <br /><br />On the other hand, in a country where some politicians continue to boast about a ruthless &#39;resistance&#39; which continues to kill dozens of innocent civilians at a time when American troops are anxious to leave the country, there is a legitimate question as to whether some of the unrepentant Baathists should be allowed to use what they decry as &quot;US-imposed democracy&quot; to run for elections. By holding that their democratic credentials might still be examined after the elections, because it simply did not have the time to thoroughly and professionally examine every file, the Cassation Chamber achieved a Pyrrhic victory that saves the elections, but only if its writ is widely accepted in the country.<br /><br />It should be. The Seven-member court was appointed by the Higher Judicial Council on the request of Parliament in order to give the candidates banned by the Commission the right to see their appeals adjudicated in a court of law. The judges simply did not have time to examine several hundred cases, nor did the law allow them to accept candidates who supported or who continue to support the members or advocates of the former regime, which was rightly described by Tony Blair as &quot;monstrous&quot; in his recent appearance before the Chilcot commission. Candidates whose rights to run were reinstated should take the decision seriously and should avoid triumphalism during the campaign. Similarly, all factions in Iraq must abandon posturing and must run a decent campaign which has for all intents and purposes fully started, while the brutal bombings meant to derail them continue and intensify.<br /><br />When the ill-advised decision <u>Bush v. Gore</u> was issued, losing candidate Al Gore expressed impressive democratic poise when he stated on December 13, 2000: &quot;Now the U.S. Supreme Court has spoken.&quot; In a far better decision, Iraq should be shielded from further uncertainties created by suspicious candidates and parties who should now accept that the Iraqi Court has spoken. The Iraqi judiciary gave Iraqis a respite which will only take effect if its decision is appreciated for its extraordinary humane and legal quality.<br /><br /><br /><em>Chibli Mallat is professor of law at the University of Utah and Saint Joseph&#39;s University, Lebanon.

		<title>PITTSBURGH: Racial Profiling as Law and Policy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Max Parmelee, Pitt Law &#39;12, discusses the ways in which his views of racial profiling changed after attending a lecture by Pitt Law Professor David Harris and reflecting on the use of profiling by federal and local authorities...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><font size="3"><strong>E</strong></font>arlier this year, Jordan Miles was walking through Pittsburgh&#39;s Homewood neighborhood when three plainclothes police officers approached him. According to Miles, a young African-American student, the officers did not identify themselves, attacked him without cause, and arrested him, inflicting serious injuries in the process. He says that the Pittsburgh police officers assaulted him based largely on the color of his skin - a textbook example, he claims, of racial profiling. The officers, on the other hand, maintain that they had probable cause to stop Miles and search him, and that it was Miles&#39; own resistance which led to his arrest and injuries.  The encounter drew intense media scrutiny and public outcry, and City Councilor Rev. Ricky Burgess has proposed reforms which would require the installation of video cameras in all city police cars, the placement of all officers being investigated for excessive use of force on paid leave, and the creation of a task force focused on improving Police Bureau practices. The Pittsburgh City Council has also scheduled a public hearing on April 8, 2010, that will critically examine alleged racial profiling by the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police.<br /><br />I will admit that, as a member of the white, 18-30-year-old male demographic group, my personal experience with racial profiling is not what one could call &quot;extensive.&quot; Despite this lack of first-hand perspective, I thought I still had a good idea of what to expect when I attended Professor David Harris&#39; presentation on the subject earlier this year. I have always been uncomfortable with efforts to predict crime by selecting people for investigation and pat-frisk searches based largely on their facial features and the color of their skin. To me, it seems at odds with several of our basic rights, such as our right to be safe from unreasonable searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment, and our right to be treated equally under the Fourteenth Amendment. According to Amnesty International, &quot;26 states have no law explicitly prohibiting racial profiling&quot; despite rulings such as <u>Batson v. Kentucky</u>, in which the US Supreme Court ruled that allowing prosecutors to exclude jurors based on their race alone was unconstitutional.  <br /><br />However, it had always seemed as if the process of racial profiling itself was, from a law enforcement perspective, logically sound, and I accepted that it was a necessary evil in a dangerous world. With national attention focused on preventing terrorist attacks over the past few years, it was not surprising to me that racial profiling had become something more than a crime-fighting technique relegated solely to local law enforcement. I was forced to question my assumptions when I attended Professor Harris&#39; lecture, which convincingly exposed racial profiling as a practice which is not only ineffective and unnecessary, but also distinctly counterproductive to the goal of protecting our society from domestic and foreign criminals alike.<br /><br />Racial profiling, Harris asserts, does not mean that skin color is the sole basis for which a person is stopped or arrested. Rather, Harris defines racial profiling as: &quot;[T]he use of racial or ethnic appearance as one factor, among others, to decide which persons should be stopped, questioned, and/or searched.&quot; Police departments, officers, and associations across the country were at first hesitant to even admit the existence of the practice, said Harris, but later defended it as a justified approach to a difficult problem. The main problem with attempting to critically assess a tactic that was for years disavowed by its practitioners is the lack of records or data.<br /><br />It was not until the late 1990s that the first studies into racial profiling by police and law enforcement agencies were undertaken. The first study to receive national recognition was conducted by the New York Attorney General&#39;s Office in response to public outcry over the killing of Amadou Diallo by New York Police Department (NYPD) officers on February 4, 1999. The study examined data provided by the NYPD as a result of department policy requiring officers to record information on all &quot;stop and frisk&quot; encounters.  These &quot;Terry stops&quot; get their name from <u>Terry v. Ohio</u>, in which the US Supreme Court held that police have the right to detain someone in public if an officer reasonably suspects that that person is committing a crime. After taking office as mayor of New York in 1994, Rudy Giuliani attempted to tackle the city&#39;s rising crime rate by hiring former Boston and Los Angeles police commissioner William Bratton. Bratton and Giuliani made Terry stops a key tactic in their anti-crime strategy in areas with greater minority populations.  The NYPD provided data to the New York Attorney General&#39;s office for purposes of the study covering approximately 175,000 stop-and-frisk encounters over a period of about 15 months. The data was arranged by the percentage of whites, Latinos, and African-Americans living in New York, the percentage of whites, Latinos, and African-Americans who were stopped and frisked, and the &quot;hit rates,&quot; or how often officers found contraband during the search for each given category. While African-Americans made up only about one quarter of the city&#39;s population, just over half of the individuals frisked were African-American. A similar pattern emerged with respect to Latino residents. The NYPD hit rates did not justify the disproportionate focus on minorities, and were actually highest for the white population. In fact, the white hit rates were 20 percent higher than those for Latinos, which in turn were 20 percent higher than those for African Americans. Thus, according to Harris, although the police claimed that racial profiling increased accuracy, it actually diminished it.<br /><br />How do we account for this disparity? It would seem that if offenders are more often members of a particular group, then we should concentrate on that group to improve accuracy. Harris explained that concentrating on race only serves to distract law enforcement officers from the most effective way to prevent crime: rigorous observation of individual behavior. In other words, racial profiling takes the officers&#39; eyes off the ball, and causes them to look for &quot;criminals&quot; instead of criminal behavior. To make matters worse, the practice has unjustly oppressed particular minority groups in the community, causing fear and animosity. <br /><br />Despite the evidence against racial profiling, part of my brain stubbornly exclaims, &quot;A vast majority of the terrorists seem to be from the Middle East! We should start by looking for people from the Middle East, and focus our efforts on them!&quot; Harris disagrees with this approach, however, and suggests that in order to ensure our safety, we need to sacrifice a bit of comfort and ease. He also advocates abandoning our current approach of allowing technology to lead our airport security efforts. Even the most advanced technology can miss hidden explosives, which Harris reminds us are plentiful in today&#39;s world. He believes we must focus on training people to detect behaviors indicative of an imminent terrorist threat. I&#39;m not so sure about that, but one thing is certain: wasting valuable time and resources on a practice which has been proven ineffective, as it seems racial profiling has been, is not keeping us safe from the threat of terrorism. I believe that as the public grows more dissatisfied with racial profiling and complaints against police agencies increase in number, further investigations into the practice are inevitable. <br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">Mentioned in this arti

		<title>PITTSBURGH: Music, Copyrights, and Free Speech in the Digital Age</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Joseph Schaeffer, Pitt Law &#39;12, attended a panel on Music, Copyright, and Free Speech as part of the ACLU&#39;s Sex, Drugs, and Rock &amp; Roll series at Carnegie Mellon University...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><font size="3"><b>I</b></font>n the past 10 to 15 years, music has gone from a finite good available only in physical form from various brick and mortar retailers to an infinite good readily available for legal purchase and illegal download on the internet. As I write this post, I&#39;m listening to music on an iPhone, a device smaller than a deck of cards, which holds approximately 8 GB of music that has been ripped from CDs, purchased from iTunes, and downloaded from the internet. Music&#39;s relatively new status as an infinite good has led to an intense debate between the music industry and consumers. How far may the recording industry limit consumers&#39; free speech rights to hear and disseminate recorded works in the interest of protecting copyright? The ACLU event that I attended was led by staff attorney Sara Rose, and was an attempt to facilitate a discussion on this inherent conflict between copyright and free speech. However, it became clear that many of the audience members lacked an understanding of the basic economic, ethical, and technological issues impacting the music industry in the 21st century.<br /><br />I was surprised to hear most of the audience members come out strongly in favor of copyright protections, given that the event was sponsored by the ACLU. The recurring theme was: &quot;If a person creates a work, he should have the sole right to profit by it and determine its dissemination,&quot; and there appeared to be real anger directed toward individuals who download music illegally without compensating the content owners. Most of the audience members were in their 50s, and many likened sharing an mp3 to stealing a CD from Barnes &amp; Noble, but as the discussion progressed, some began to realize that CDs and mp3s are, in fact, not substitutable goods. When I purchase a CD, I may legally lend that CD to a friend so that he may also listen to it. I do not have the same right when I purchase an mp3. First, much of the music purchased online is protected by Digital Rights Management, a technology which limits a song to playback on specifically authorized computers and devices. Thus, sharing of legally purchased digital music is often limited by DRM, and removal of DRM is technically subject to criminal sanction under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) of 1998. Second, the DMCA prohibits the sharing even of legally purchased, unprotected files. This gives rise to the perverse situation where it would be legal to lend a friend a physical copy of &quot;Abbey Road,&quot; but illegal to send the same friend a digital copy of the same album.<br /><br />As the audience members began to understand more about the realities of digital music, they became more willing to discuss the need for the music industry to change its business model. Sara Rose introduced a possible solution advanced by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), under which every consumer with an internet connection would pay his ISP an additional $5 music download fee. Consumers who paid this fee would then have the right to download unlimited amounts of music from the source of their choice, and the music industry would be responsible for monitoring this traffic and apportioning the monies to the artists according to the popularity of their music. As the audience quickly recognized, however, a voluntary system would give rise to a free rider problem where the music industry would be in much the same position it is now - policing those who do not pay into the system. While a compulsory system would remove the need for enforcement, it would also limit consumers&#39; free speech rights by limiting their right to choose. The EFF&#39;s proposal thus appears to be an imperfect solution.<br /><br />Another option would be for the music industry to recognize that its business model is dead. This is a radical proposal under which artists would give away their music for free in order to sell the finite goods of concert tickets and merchandise. While the music industry has generally been reluctant to experiment with this model, major artists, such as Radiohead and Nine Inch Nails, have shown that it can be remarkably effective. Interestingly, this solution appeared to be more popular with audience members than the solution advanced by the EFF. Not only does this solution preserve the consumers&#39; choice, but it insures that the artist is compensated for his work. Further, consumers are used to the  concept of a free trial being used to sell a more expensive product.<br /><br />Ms. Rose then tried to shift the discussion to copyright law&#39;s impact on software and technology, but the audience appeared to be even less familiar with this subject. A discussion of file-sharing software such as Limewire was filled with factual errors, not the least of which was that using such software will make available all files on your computer to other users (this is not necessarily the case). Thus, while the recording industry copyright claims may shut down file-sharing programs with both legitimate and illegitimate uses, most participants didn&#39;t use these programs and were thus unconcerned.<br /><br />As was to be expected, the conversation became most lively where it concerned issues directly affecting the participants. A latecomer hijacked the discussion about music to discuss a lawsuit brought against him by the Carnegie Library demanding he transfer the domain <a href="http://www.carnegielibrary.us">carnegielibrary.us</a>. Another latecomer only marginally addressed issues of copyright and free speech, spending far more time criticizing corporate America. While Ms. Rose and most of the other participants tried to return the discussion to music, copyright, and free speech, it became clear that these new participants were determined to bend the panel to their personal agendas, and many of the audience members began to leave the room.<br /><br />In many ways, the ACLU panel on Music, Copyright, and Free Speech reflected the larger society debate on this issue. The participants tended to find the technology confusing, misunderstand the underlying issues, and hold strong positions without being able to fully support them. On the one hand, I found this disappointing, since I had hoped to learn more about the inherent legal conflict between copyright law and free speech rather than hear a rehashing of basic concepts. On the other hand, the experience was enlightening. As part of the Napster generation, I often fail to see, let alone understand, the more traditional copyright argument. By bringing together participants from different demographics and generations, the ACLU panel reminded me that there continue to be fundamental disagreements as to how copyright should work in a digital age.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://jcomm.uoregon.edu/faculty-staff/youm"><strong>Kyu Ho Youm</strong></a> [Jonathan Marshall First Amendment Chair, School of Journalism and Communication, <a href="http://uoregon.edu/">University of Oregon</a>]: &quot;The Icelandic Modern Media Initiative is a welcome <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/iceland-parliament-considering-new.php">development</a> in the ongoing global movement for press freedom.  It deserves serious attention from those who want to expand freedom of the press as a universal human right.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.immi.is/?l=en&p=vision">Initiative</a> should serve as a worthy benchmark on what ought to be minimally done to protect freedom of the press from various institutional and private constraints, whether real or perceived.  <br /><br />Most important, the Initiative is looking at press freedom more than as a passive concept. Access to information is a case in point.<br /><br />To  a considerable extent, the Initiative is borrowing from the 100-plus years of the US experience with freedom of speech and the press.  Not surprising.  But it goes far beyond the First Amendment &quot;exceptionalism&quot; of the United States.  International and foreign laws are sometimes more proactive in press freedom than US law, and the US needs to learn from them.  See, e.g., the journalistic source protection under European law.<br /><br />The practical and immediate or long-term impact of the Initiative is an open question.  Freedom of the press entails various choice of law and jurisdictional issues, especially when transnational media companies are involved.  <br /><br />Still, no one who knows about the perennial fragility of press freedom cannot and should not discount the Initiative&#39;s inspirational and aspirational vision for Iceland as a &quot;haven&quot; for freedom of the press. <br /><br />This is all the more true now than ever.  Consider the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative in connection with what Columbia University President Lee Bollinger eloquently expounds in his new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Uninhibited-Robust-Wide-Open-Century-Inalienable/dp/019530439X">UNINHIBITED, ROBUST, AND WIDE-OPEN: A Free Press for a New Century</a>&quot; (Oxford University Press, 2010).&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/experts/KorbLawrence.html"><strong>Lawrence Korb</strong></a> [Senior Fellow, <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/">Center for American Progress</a>]: &quot;In recent congressional testimony, Army Chief of Staff, General George Casey Jr., <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/us-army-leaders-express-concern-over.php">argued</a> that the Pentagon should not impose a moratorium on the discharge of military people who have come out or been outed as gay. This is both good news and bad news for those who support repealing the counterproductive and discriminatory Don&#39;t Ask, Don&#39;t Tell (DADT) policy that does not allow openly gay people to serve their country.<br /> <br />The good news is that imposing a moratorium might relieve the pressure for quickly repealing DADT. Moreover, imposing a moratorium could be viewed by some in Congress, who might otherwise support the repeal, as an unconstitutional and illegal attempt by the executive branch to subvert the will of the Congress and thus weaken their enthusiasm for repealing DADT. Finally, to paraphrase President George W. Bush, General Casey is not the decider in the Army, the Pentagon, or the Executive Branch. As Chief of Staff of the Army, General Casey is subordinate to his civilian superiors. The Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of Defense, and the President make the decisions. Casey only provides professional military advice which can be accepted or rejected by his civilian bosses.<br /><br />The bad news is that Casey&#39;s argument has been accepted by his civilian superiors. Army Secretary McHugh and Secretary of Defense Gates have already weighed in against the moratorium and the Commander-in-Chief, President Barack Obama, has remained silent on the issue. Moreover, Casey&#39;s position is most probably an indication that he does not support repeal. If he and his fellow military chiefs take that position, it could cause political problems for those in the executive and legislative branches who want to overturn the decision because these civilians could be accused of ignoring the professional military. Finally, dragging out this debate will give opponents of repealing DADT more time to marshal their arguments against the proposal. And while the American people support repeal, it is not a front burner issue for them. But, for opponents, this is the first step down the slippery slope that could eventually lead to repeal of the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=104_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ199.104.pdf">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [PDF file]. They believe that if they can stop DADT, the repeal of DOMA will never happen.&quot;<br />

		<title>McDonald v. City of Chicago ruling may prove a hollow victory for gun lobby</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dennis-a-henigan">Dennis A. Henigan</a></strong> [Vice President for Law and Policy, <a href="http://www.bradycenter.org/">Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence</a>]: &quot;I was in the courtroom on Tuesday for the Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-1521.pdf">argument</a> [PDF file] in <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-gun.php">McDonald v. City of Chicago</a>, in which the Court is considering whether the new Second Amendment right, created two years ago in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-290.ZO.html">District of Columbia v. Heller</a>, is incorporated under the Fourteenth Amendment as a constraint on state and local gun control laws. Unsurprisingly, the same five justices who formed the Heller majority and voted to strike down the District of Columbia&#39;s handgun ban, now seem poised to vote for incorporation and strike down Chicago&#39;s handgun ban.  Although this will be hailed by the gun lobby as a victory, there was much about Tuesday&#39;s argument suggesting it could eventually prove to be a hollow victory indeed.<br /><br />There was sharp disagreement among the justices about the incorporation issue (although there was absolutely no enthusiasm, even within the conservative majority, for the crusade of the petitioner&#39;s lawyer, Alan Gura, to resurrect the long-dead Privileges and Immunities Clause as a source of broad substantive constitutional rights).  There was, however, one idea around which the justices seemed to coalesce: even if the right is incorporated, states and localities will retain broad power to regulate the right in the interest of public safety.<br /><br />The discussion of necessary limits on the right to be armed began with a trenchant observation by Justice Breyer.  He asked Attorney Gura this question: &quot;Is this right different from others?&quot;  Justice Breyer then answered his own question by making two points.<br /><br />First, he noted that empirical issues involving guns are hotly contested (&quot;You know, one side says a million people killed by guns.  Chicago says that their &#8212; their gun law has saved hundreds, including...lots of women in domestic cases.  And the other side disputes it.&quot;) and that &quot;[w]ithout incorporation, it&#39;s decided by State legislatures; with, it&#39;s decided by Federal judges.&quot;<br /><br />Second, Justice Breyer pointed out that in First Amendment cases, the courts often have to balance free speech interests against other societal interests, but that this balancing does not often involve &quot;free speech versus life.&quot;  Indeed, &quot;[w]hen it&#39;s free speech versus life, we very often decide in favor of life.&quot;  What makes the Second Amendment different, Justice Breyer continued, is that &quot;[h]ere every case will be on one side guns, on the other side human life.&quot;  In other words, Second Amendment cases are inherently life and death matters.  He then questioned whether Federal judges are better suited to make such difficult decisions than state legislatures.<br /><br />These observations by Justice Breyer led to a series of statements by various Justices offering assurances that, despite <u>Heller</u>, legislative bodies at every level of government should retain broad authority to enact gun restrictions without judicial interference.  Of greatest significance were the comments of three of the five justices who made up the <u>Heller</u> majority.  Justice Roberts recognized that the right to keep and bear arms is &quot;still going to be subject to the political process if the Court determines that it is incorporated in the Due Process Clause.&quot;  Justice Kennedy, thought to be the swing vote in <u>Heller</u>, put it this way:  &quot;...there are provisions of...the Bill of Rights, that have been incorporated against the States, where the States have substantial latitude and ample authority to impose reasonable regulations....We look to see what the political process does...[W]hy can&#39;t we do the same thing with firearms?&quot;  And, perhaps of greatest significance, Justice Scalia commented that his opinion in <u>Heller</u> &quot;was very careful not to impose a broader definition&quot; of the Second Amendment right to apply to federal law because the Court &quot;realized that this is a national problem.&quot;  That&#39;s right, Justice Scalia, the Court&#39;s great gun enthusiast, recognizing the need for strong federal gun laws because gun violence is a national problem.  For gun control advocates, it doesn&#39;t get much better than that.<br /><br />These comments by members of the <u>Heller</u> majority appear to embrace the position argued in the <a href="http://www.bradycenter.org/xshare/final_brief.pdf">amicus brief</a> [PDF file] filed by the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence and several national police groups that, regardless of whether the Second Amendment applies to the states, it should be read to allow for reasonable gun regulations.  They also hearken back to language in the <u>Heller</u> opinion, clearly intended to respond to the dissent&#39;s charge that the majority opinion would put other gun laws at risk.  The majority memorably wrote that &quot;nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt&quot; on broad categories of gun laws, which remain &quot;presumptively legal&quot; even under the newly-discovered right, including laws imposing &quot;conditions and qualifications&quot; on the sale of firearms, prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons (which was mentioned as a permissible restriction several times in yesterday&#39;s argument), and bans on &quot;dangerous and unusual weapons.&quot;<br /><br />The argument in <u>McDonald</u> gives hope that the <u>McDonald</u> majority, even if it strikes down Chicago&#39;s handgun ban, will amplify the <u>Heller</u> message that the Second Amendment erects no constitutional barrier to reasonable laws &#8212; at any level of government - to make it harder for dangerous people to obtain dangerous weapons.  The gun lobby will be displeased, but the American people will have dodged a constitutional bullet.&quot;<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Dennis Henigan is Vice President for Law and Policy at the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence and author of Lethal Logic:  Exploding the Myths that Paralyze American Gun Policy (Potomac Books 2009). </span><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/contact-dpic"><strong>Richard Dieter</strong></a> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/">Death Penalty Information Center</a>]: &quot;The United States is often rightly seen as a world leader in human rights.  But we have become increasingly isolated from the international community in one respect - our persistent use of the death penalty.  The worldwide trend is clearly away from capital punishment.  The United Nations, a recent <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/un-official-applauds-states-efforts-to.php">World Congress</a> in Geneva, and our allies in the European Union are all calling for an end to the death penalty.  The US is not only among a dwindling minority of countries with an active death penalty, we are one of only a tiny handful of nations that actually carries out executions on a regular basis.  Only in the Middle East and in some Asian countries are the number of executions comparable to those in the US every year.  These are the same countries that the US frequently admonishes to improve their human rights record.<br /><br />The US should not amend its law simply because other countries have done so.  But our use of the death penalty is so far outside the stream of human rights that it is approaching the position of South Africa before apartheid was ended.  The US was in the forefront of that movement, applying pressure and international sanctions until world opinion prevailed.  The need for international cooperation is even more apparent than it was twenty years ago.  We cannot and do not want to &quot;go it alone&quot; in areas of trade, resisting terrorism, or improving the environment, but we may become the last country standing with the death penalty.<br /><br />The use of the death penalty is already declining in the US, reflecting the growing recognition that it is both too fallible and corruptible a system to meet the standards of justice in the twenty-first century.  Death sentences, executions, the size of death row, and even the number of states with the death penalty have all dropped in the past few years.  What we hold onto is a politically driven myth.  Clearly, the death penalty in the US is not needed - the vast majority of murders, including many of the most heinous, are not punished with the death penalty.  Police chiefs, leading criminologists, and the general public do not believe the death penalty serves as a deterrent to crime.  It is kept in place because it is politically hard to get rid of, not because it serves any criminological purpose.  It is time for a national dialogue on the death penalty, one that is open to what the rest of the world has to say.&quot;<br />

		<title>Federal criminal trials for terror suspects a clear advantage over military commissions</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal; "><strong><a href="http://www.nycriminallawfirm.com/who_jld.htm">Joshua L. Dratel</a></strong> [Senior Fellow for Legal Research, <a href="http://www.lawandsecurity.org/">Center on Law and Security</a>, <a href="http://www.law.nyu.edu/index.htm">NYU Law School</a>]: &quot;The advantages of <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/holder-praises-role-of-civilian-courts.php">federal criminal</a> trials over military commissions for terrorist prosecutions are certainly too numerous to list in a few short paragraphs. However, seeking to avoid redundancy, there are three that merit mention, not only because of their importance, but also because they either are often touted as advantages of the military commissions, or escape attention or analysis by the popular media and its pundits.<div><br />For example, the transparency of criminal trials in the civilian courts is woefully underappreciated. The reliability and legitimacy of verdicts is completely undermined by secret proceedings, or those that limit public and media access (which has been a hallmark of the Guantanamo military commissions). Also, more specifically, the 2001 federal court trial of those charged with responsibility for bombing the US Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 played an important role in revealing to the world &#8212; prior to 9/11 &#8212; al Qaeda&#39;s and Osama bin Laden&#39;s structure, history, ideology, and agenda, which in turn enabled the US to identify immediately and credibly for the world that al Qaeda and bin Laden were responsible for the 9/11 attacks. Indeed, as the end notes demonstrate, nearly the entirety of the <a href="http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf">9/11 Commission Report</a>&#39;s [PDF file] historical section on al Qaeda was gleaned from the transcripts of that Embassy Bombings trial.</div><div><br />In addition, while many fear that federal court trials will offer the defendants a &quot;soapbox&quot; for propaganda, that is a red herring on several levels. Federal judges control their courtrooms, and the terrorism trials in federal court, from the Embassy Bombings case through the trial of Zacarias Moussouai, establish that without question. In contrast, each session of the military commission for the 9/11 defendants in Guantanamo was marked by uncontrolled posturing by the defendants.</div><div><br />Also, Sheikh Abdel Rahman and Ramzi Youssef each spoke for more than an hour, espousing their anti-U.S. political philosophies, at their separate sentencings after their convictions in different cases more than a decade ago. Is there anyone who remembers a word of what they said? Even if they were memorable, are our institutions and values so indefensible and vulnerable that expression of al Qaeda&#39;s ideology will cause them to collapse?</div><div><br />Moreover, those who focus only on the defendants&#39; potential use of public trials suffer from myopia. In many respects, it is the US that needs the platform of a public trial to assure the world that the process of adjudication is legitimate and reliable. After eight years of a steadfast policy of anti-law, whether manifested by uncharged, incommunicado, indefinite detention, military commissions, or institutionally organized and approved torture, the US must by its actions convince other nations &#8212; our allies, enemies, and those sitting on the fence &#8212; that it has returned to the rule of law.</div><div><br />For those who oppose the use of federal courts, the resort to military commissions falls into the &quot;be careful what you wish for&quot; category. Given the delays that have afflicted the military commission process &#8212; due to lack of clear and specific rules, the need to address threshold challenges to the system as a whole, and the logistical difficulties in creating an entirely new system in an unfamiliar locale &#8212; those who seek resolution and closure will have far longer to wait if the military commissions, rather than federal courts, are utilized. And even if years from now there were guilty verdicts in a military commission, those results will hardly be dispositive or final. The shadow cast over the military commissions&#39; legitimacy, which in turn &#8212; in part as a result of reduced standards of evidentiary admissibility, and the potential use of evidence obtained via torture &#8212; impairs their reliability, will likely result in invalidating the results upon appeal. Certainly that has been the case thus far, and there is little reason to expect better under the revised commissions &#8212; the fifth iteration of a failed system.<br /><br /></div><div>The choice of military commissions over federal courts would have additional negative repercussions for US national security. Currently, the United Kingdom has at least a half dozen persons in custody awaiting extradition to the US. Some have been in that posture for 13 years, others for six, and others for three years or more. A significant obstacle to extradition is the European community&#39;s resistance to sending its nationals to the US to be subject to sub-standard justice and inhumane conditions in military commissions or as &quot;enemy combatants.&quot; By perpetuating what the world recognizes as an illegitimate and failed system, the US threatens to reduce its allies&#39; willingness to cooperate in counterterrorism investigations and initiatives.<br /><br /></div><div>These three factors, among many others, establish that federal criminal courts present a far superior choice to military commissions &#8212; even when evaluating the arguments that traditionally are offered by proponents of the military commissions.&quot;</div></span></strong><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.compassionandchoices.org/documents/Bio_BCL.pdf"><strong>Barbara Coombs Lee</strong></a> [President, <a href="http://www.compassionandchoices.org/">Compassion and Choices</a>]: &quot;The prosecutorial <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/uk-chief-prosecutor-publishes-new.php">guidelines</a> provide a bit of comfort and security for those citizens of the UK who would like to accompany a loved one to Switzerland if they chose to die at a clinic there. These family members embody the criteria making prosecution less likely - they are family, their role is supportive, not coercive, and accompaniment alone probably does not rise to the level of &quot;aiding and abetting.&quot;<br /><br />The fact the guidelines are issued at all represents a major watershed. It shows the law is no longer hard and fast in the area of assisted dying, and there is room in the law for a merciful, caring approach. Overwhelming majorities support legalization of what we call &quot;aid in dying&quot; - the ability of a terminally ill, mentally competent adult to request and receive life-ending medication, which they may choose to take by self-administration if suffering becomes intolerable. This assurance has become a necessity for peace of mind in an age when medical science has turned the dying process into a long, slow, tortuous path of pain and degradation of function and personhood.<br /><br />The Law Lords took a small step in asking for publication of prosecutorial guidelines and the prosecutor took a small step in complying. But it is small comfort indeed, for most dying patients have neither the means nor the functional capability to travel to another continent, and they do not want to die among strangers in a foreign, impersonal clinic. People want an option to unbearable suffering, but they want to die in their own home, among the things and people they love. They want their own doctor to be able to provide to them the means to a peaceful and humane death. This is not too much to ask and the law should provide it.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.sbalaw.com.au/team_stephen.asp"><strong>Stephen Blanks</strong></a> and <span style="font-weight:bold;">Corinne Reichert</span> [<a href="http://www.nswccl.org.au/">New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties</a>]: &quot;In February 2010, the NSW Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/australia-court-sentences-5-in-domestic.php">sentenced</a> five Australian citizens who were found guilty of conspiracy to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts to terms of imprisonment ranging from 23-28 years. The offenders had been arrested in 2005, and their trial lasted almost 11 months during 2009.<br /><br />The evidence that the men were preparing to plan a terrorist act was limited.  After months of wiretaps, searches and surveillance, the Australian Federal Police found stockpiles of firearms, ammunition, dangerous chemicals, bomb-making instructions, material glorifying Osama Bin Laden, images depicting violent hostage situations, and evidence showing that three had been on a &quot;paramilitary-style camp&quot;. One had also been to a similar camp in Pakistan, run by terrorist organisation Lashkar-e-Toiba.  However, no acts of violence or terrorism were actually planned, let alone ever committed.  Although there was testimony that the offenders had considered attacking a football final, a former Prime Minister, a government nuclear facility, the Sydney Harbour Bridge or the Sydney Opera House, there was insufficient evidence to support any of these claims.<br /><br />Thus, traditional conspiracy charges at common law would have failed, and the convictions were obtained on specific anti-terrorism laws passed by the Commonwealth in the period  2002 to 2005.  The Court was not &quot;satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that any of the offenders intended directly to kill or take human life.&quot;<br /><br />However, the Court found that it was &quot;clear beyond argument that the fanaticism and extremist position taken by each offender countenanced the possibility of the loss of life, if that were to occur.&quot;<br /><br />The length of the sentences appear to equate with sentences that would have been imposed had an actual conspiracy to commit a terrorist act taken place.  Unfortunately, the decision of the police to intervene by laying criminal charges at the point they did leaves open the question as to whether these offenders posed an actual threat or whether there may have been other avenues available to reduce any threat they did pose. &quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.aei.org/scholar/112">Kenneth Green</a></strong> [Resident Scholar, <a href="http://www.aei.org/home">American Enterprise Institute</a>]: &quot;China&#39;s agreement to <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/china-india-agree-to-non-binding.php">accept</a> the &quot;non-binding&quot; greenhouse gas reduction goals of the Copenhagen Accord is a combination public relations ploy, and an effort to ensure that western wealth continues to flow to China for the construction of low-cost &quot;renewable&quot; energy systems such as wind turbines and solar panels.<br /><br />As the world&#39;s largest emitter, China knows that it can not be seen to sit on the sidelines as their geopolitical and economic competitors hobble themselves with carbon controls. China has also largely lost the argument that the developed countries should &quot;go first&quot; with binding greenhouse gas controls, as it is universally recognized that greenhouse gas controls by the rest of the world is a complete waste of time and money unless China matches (or exceeds) those emission reductions.<br /><br />China&#39;s pledge to reduce carbon intensity by 45% has been characterized as nothing more than business as usual by the International Energy Agency, and, amusingly enough, puts them in the strange position of adopting the policy of George W. Bush from 2002. As readers might recall, the Bush administration tried to propose the exact same voluntary, emission-intensity based approach in 2002, and was rightfully lashed by foreign governments and environmental groups for having put forward a &quot;business as usual&quot; proposal that ultimately would allow for US emissions to rise, just as China&#39;s pledge would allow China&#39;s overall emissions to rise spectacularly, as they are predicted to do.<br /><br />Finally, there&#39;s the sticking point of verification. Unless China is willing to allow international entities to independently verify emission-intensity reductions as resulting from new, non-BAU activities, the international community is highly unlikely to accept China&#39;s proposal. Based on China&#39;s past response to such proposals, I would not expect to see foreign inspectors touring Chinese facilities any time soon.&quot;<br />

		<title>Shatzer decision permits coercive &#034;catch and release&#034; police questioning</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.quadrinoschwartz.com/attorneys/bio/nathaniel-e-burney/"><strong>Nathaniel Burney</strong></a> [Associate, <a href="http://www.quadrinoschwartz.com/">Quadrino Schwartz</a>]: &quot;If you are under arrest, and the police are interrogating you, they have to stop questioning when you ask to speak with a lawyer.  So long as you remain in custody, they can&#39;t keep asking you to waive your right to have a lawyer present.  That&#39;s coercive.  Like the other <span style="font-style:italic;">Miranda</span> rules, this rule helps ensure that the government doesn&#39;t extract a confession from you against your own free will.  But what if you&#39;ve been released from custody - do the <span style="font-style:italic;">Miranda</span> concerns go away?  Can the police try again?<br /><br />Last Wednesday, in the case of <span style="font-style:italic;"><a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-680">Maryland v. Shatzer</a></span>, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/supreme-court-rules-two-year-break-in.php">ruled</a> that they can.  Once you&#39;ve been released, the police can try to question you again, but only after 14 days have passed.  This is a bright-line rule, intended to be easy for the police to follow, and for the courts to enforce.  The Court&#39;s reasoning is that, after two weeks have gone by, any pressures from being at the mercy of the police will have dissipated, and your life will have gone back to normal.  So if this time you waive your right to an attorney, then it&#39;s probably voluntary.<br /><br />What does this mean for future Fifth Amendment claims?  Not much, in most cases.  Most suspects are not released when they ask for a lawyer.  But for those few who do get released, they need to know that the police may very well try again to get a confession.  So they may be taken back into custody, where the police will again ask for a waiver of the right to counsel during questioning.<br /><br />But two weeks is a purely arbitrary cutoff.  For some people, 14 days is not long enough to shake off the stress and pressure of having been in custody.  So for them, any new request is still going to be coercive.  Other, more resilient suspects may not feel coerced the first time, but the police could just play &quot;catch and release&quot; every couple of weeks until the suspect gives in and talks without a lawyer.  In these and other individual circumstances, however, defendants will always be free to argue that their waiver was involuntary.  The new rule is only a presumption - and nothing more - that a waiver is voluntary after 14 days went by.  If a defendant&#39;s free will was overridden by the police, that is always going to be an argument to get a confession suppressed.&quot;<br />

		<title>US can restore legitimacy  with federal trials of terror suspects at Guantanamo Bay</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal; "><strong>Eric Montalvo</strong> [Partner, <a href="http://www.puckettfaraj.com/">Puckett and Faraj, PC</a>]: &quot;The careless approach to the issues surrounding all things Guantanamo Bay is an affront to the Constitution and the credibility of our legal institutions. As the most recent &quot;flip flop&quot; by Attorney General Holder regarding the <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/holder-flexible-on-trying-911-suspects.php">prosecution </a>of Khalid Sheik Mohammed (KSM) demonstrates, the original quick and forceful end of Guantanamo has not, by association, led to the end of &quot;indefinite detention.&quot; The apparent conundrum is fractured into two basic issues which are the venue of the trial and the forum to be used. While the decision of where and how to prosecute is one of the most hotly contested contemporary political issues, there is a way ahead that will restore legitimacy to our broken system.<div><br />In a perfect world the conventional wisdom among legal scholars is that the United States should use the federal court system to prosecute KSM and do so in a location that provides for security while containing costs. The Obama administration spent close to a year figuring out that the federal court system provided the most credible and effective option for prosecution, however, they failed to foresee the incredibly high security costs, political backlash, and emotional anguish brought upon New York&#39;s citizens once again. This is where the plan derailed and now the Attorney General is contemplating the placement of KSM back into military commissions system. The answer lies in the fusion of these two ideas &#8212; holding federal court at Guantanamo Bay where a virtually brand new multimillion dollar state of the art court room awaits usage.</div><div><br />The legitimacy of federal courts compared to other prevailing options is truly without question. Federal courts have repeatedly demonstrated the ability to prosecute and successfully convict numerous alleged &quot;terrorists&quot; such as the &quot;shoe bomber&quot; Richard Reid, the &quot;American Taliban&quot; John Walker Lindh, Jose Padilla, the Lackawanna Six, and Zacarias Moussaoui. These examples demonstrate the capacity of our federal courts to handle the unique and complex issues latent in prosecuting alleged terrorists ranging from the pursuit of capital punishment to the national security legal morass.</div><div><br /></div><div>The implications regarding the legitimacy of KSM&#39;s prospective conviction impact our strategic and tactical interests, as well as, our moral authority in the war on terror. Our nation is at war and servicemen and women are dying to protect American democratic principles, not least of which is governance by the rule of law. &quot;Due process&quot; is not a &quot;dirty&quot; phrase or defense parlor trick. When notions of due process are adhered to justice is typically served regardless of the result. To run away from the gold standard in criminal justice for fear or concern of political consequence is antithetical to the whole purpose of the Bill of Rights, drafted to preserve the rights of the people against an unchecked government disabusing one of their rights based on what the government perceives to be its &quot;needs.&quot;</div><div><br /></div><div>Assuming that the relevant parties agree that federal courts are the appropriate forum to prosecute, the next question becomes what venue. The Department of Defense has spent hundreds of millions of tax payer dollars on the facilities at Guantanamo Bay. This includes a federal prison modeled after a stateside federal prison, as well as a state of the art court room specifically designed to prosecute &quot;high value detainees.&quot; The ability to handle national security issues and physical security is unparalleled and gathering dust. Using federal criminal law in a specifically tailored court venue seems like an obvious but illusive solution to the current conundrum. Judges travel all the time.</div><div><br />Pursuant to the Judiciary Act of 1789 the justices of the Supreme Court of the United States had the responsibility of &quot;riding circuit.&quot; The practice of &quot;bringing justices to the fight&quot; can be traced all the way back to the days of King Henry II. Indeed, this practice is still alive and well throughout the US federal courts. Federal judges from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, military judges, and judges from Department of Hearings and Appeals routinely travel to proceedings. Indeed, the military commission judges, prosecutors, defense counsel, witnesses, experts, 9/11 family members of victims and reporters have all traveled routinely to the base for proceedings.</div><div><br />This Beauty (federal law) and the Beast (Guantanamo) approach will save countless tax payer dollars, avert perpetual political inertia, and reacquire some legitimacy on this issue in the world arena. The calls to close Guantanamo were based on the idea that it was a quintessential example of all that was wrong with the war on terror. With some compromise and transparency, there exists a fleeting opportunity to recycle Guantanamo Bay from a symbol of shame to an example of Constitutional perseverance.&quot;</div></span></strong><br />

		<title>Prosecutors can&#039;t depend on &#034;positive identification&#034; in Maguindanao massacre case</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.upiasia.com/columnist/Danilo_Reyes/">Danilo Reyes</a></strong> [Staff member, <a href="http://www.ahrchk.net/index.php">Asian Human Rights Commission</a>]: &quot;The decision of the Department of Justice (DoJ) that 197 people can be <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/philippines-prosecutors-charge-197-for.php">prosecuted</a> for multiple murders in the deaths of 57 people in the November 2009 Maguindanao massacre, based largely on &quot;positive identification&quot; could be a concern.  In order for the case to have the possibility of securing a conviction in trial, it cannot afford to depend largely on witnesses&#39; oral testimonies and on the principle of &quot;positive identification&quot; alone.  <p class="MsoNoSpacing">In a country like the Philippines, where the public prosecutors and court judges still rely heavily on oral testimonies for deciding a &quot;probable cause&quot; to go for trial or to convict a person respectively, the prosecution of cases face the risk of being dismissed for lack of evidence or that the entire case could collapse once witnesses recant their testimonies or have their credibility questioned.</p>  <p class="MsoNoSpacing">In order for the &quot;positive identification&quot; to stand in trial, it requires not only a mere facial identification of the accused by a witness, but also an adequate proof that the witness knew of or had met the accused before the crime took place.  In the argument contained in the DoJ&#39;s resolution, however, this reasoning has not been fully explained.  The fundamental requirements in which each witness should have knowledge to each of the accused has not been adequately mentioned.  Having charges filed in court is not enough assurance that the families of the victims will obtain redress.</p>  <p class="MsoNoSpacing">The Philippines has the reputation of poor conviction rates in cases of extrajudicial killings of human rights and political activists.  For example, of over 900 cases of killings of activists reported since 2001, only three are known to have resulted to conviction. Most of the cases either could not be filed in court or were dismissed for lack of evidence, the failure to protect witnesses or the failure of the police to collect and preserve needed forensic evidence from the crime scene.</p>  <p class="MsoNoSpacing">One example is the case of Enrico Cabanit, a land reform activist murdered in Panabo City in Mindanao on April 24, 2006.  The local police failed to secure the material evidence needed from the crime scene; for example, not all the spent shells were recovered.  They also failed to take photographs and sketches of the crime scene.  Further, Cabanit&#39;s body was not subjected to autopsy and post-mortem examination, thereby deliberately depriving the possibility of promptly obtaining forensic evidence regarding the cause of his death.</p>  <p class="MsoNoSpacing">Although police investigators were able to produce sketches of the gunmen based on witness accounts, their descriptions contradicted those of other witnesses present at the crime scene. The police also deliberately weakened the case by planting false witnesses as those who provided the gunmen descriptions  were later found out to be persons who work as police informants or assets.</p>  <p class="MsoNoSpacing">Cabanit&#39;s daughter, Daffodil, who is herself an eyewitness to his father&#39;s murder, was never afforded any protection.  Her father&#39;s case ended up not having filed in court.</p>  <p class="MsoNoSpacing">Meanwhile, in the Maguindanao massacre case, police investigators have been seen on television allowing onlookers to dig up dead bodies with bare hands at the crime scene.  The process of autopsies and the collection of excavated bodies from the crime scene were also completely disorganized.  On one occasion, two families of the journalist victims ended up confused and squabbling over one dead body.</p>  <p class="MsoNoSpacing">Given the inability of the investigators to appreciate and employ forensic evidence as exposed in the early stage of investigation, oral testimonies should not be largely depended upon in the prosecution of this case.  The government prosecutors must ensure the evidence stands in trial. In the Philippines, filing of charges in court provides no guarantee that victims would obtain redress and that perpetrators are punished.</p>  <p class="MsoNoSpacing">In fact, early on in this case&#39;s investigation the DoJ lacked the urgency to even file it with the court as required by the time set by court rules.  Under Rule 112 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, the public prosecutors should have completed the investigation and the determination of &quot;probable cause&quot; within 50 days, but it took the DoJ over two months in this instance.</p>  <p class="MsoNoSpacing">Also, the DoJ&#39;s failure to conclude promptly that the Ampatuans, a powerful local clan, along with dozens of policemen, soldiers and militiamen could be prosecuted for the massacre demonstrates the reality of how difficult it is to pursue the prosecution of cases due to the government&#39;s failure.&quot;</p><br />

That the issue was even a matter of debate shows just how far the Court&#39;s jurisprudence had drifted from the elegant simplicity of &quot;Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech.&quot; The five Justices of the majority simply took that constitutional command seriously, and they should be commended for it.&quot;</div></span></strong><br />

		<title>Japanese Whaling: When Diplomacy Fails, Call the ICJ</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.anu.edu.au/scripts/StaffDetails.asp?StaffID=393">Don Rothwell</a> of Australian National University College of Law says that in the context of unpromising diplomatic negotiations between Japan and Australia with regard to Japanese whaling in the Southern Ocean area, the Australian government will likely be left with no choice but to file suit against Japan in the International Court of Justice....  <br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/donrothwellnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>fter more than 20 years of diplomatic confrontation over Japan's Southern Ocean whaling program, Australia has finally set a deadline for the Japanese to cease all whaling by the start of the 2010-11 whaling season or otherwise prepare to front up to the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Australia's position was outlined by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd when on 19 February he stated on national television that "what we're putting to the Japanese is to take where they are now, which is the slaughter of some hundreds of whales each year and reduce that to zero. If we don't get that as a diplomatic agreement &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; we'll be going to the International Court of Justice." Rudd set the deadline for a Japanese reduction of the whale catch to zero by November 2010, just before the start of the annual Japanese Southern Ocean whaling season.<br /><br />How has it come to this? To a degree, the seeds for the current dispute were sown in 1977 when the Liberal Coalition Government of Malcom Fraser took the then courageous step of banning all commercial whaling in Australian waters. Australia then commenced an international campaign alongside other conservation minded countries to halt commercial whaling and found success in the International Whaling Commission which endorsed a moratorium on commercial whaling that took effect in 1985-86. In response Japan commenced its first scientific whaling program in the Southern Ocean &#8212; known as JARPA &#8212; which ran until 2005 and which focused on an annual take of between 300-450 minke whales. For the 2005-06 Antarctic season, Japan announced it was commencing JARPA II which effectively doubled the annual take of whales to 950 including minke whales and a small number of threatened and endangered fin and humpback whales. JAPRA II became operational from the 2007-08 season and whilst the take of humpbacks was suspended as a result of diplomatic intervention by the US, hunting for minke and fin whales has continued.<br /><br />Maintaining the moratorium on commercial whaling has virtually became a bipartisan article of faith for Australian governments since 1986, and while Iceland and Norway have sought to avoid the ban, Japan has come under particular scrutiny because its Southern Ocean whaling is effectively seen as being in Australia's backyard. The declaration of an Australian Whale Sanctuary, which prohibits whaling out to 200 miles from the mainland, offshore islands, and the Australian Antarctic Territory, has given the issue further prominence. Notwithstanding a 2008 Australian Federal Court ruling that Japan's actions were illegal under Australian law, the Japanese have defied the court orders insisting that as they do not recognize Australia's Antarctic claim, they are not bound to respect Australian law. The Rudd government, not wanting to risk a challenge to Australian sovereignty over Antarctica, has not actively pursued enforcement of these court orders.<br /><br />In response to these developments, the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) commissioned several legal advices which were provided first to the Howard and then to the Rudd government outlining international legal arguments which could be mounted to halt the Japanese whaling program. At the core of these legal opinions was that Japan's interpretation of the 1946 International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling allowing for 'special permit' scientific research whaling was an abuse of right and inconsistent with Article 8 of the Convention. If the ICJ option was pursued it was recommended that Australia first seek provisional measures to immediately halt the Japanese hunt until such time as the court rules on the merits.<br /><br />The election of the Rudd Labor government in November 2007 brought great expectations that Australia would pursue these legal options; however, diplomatic options were initially favored. Mindful perhaps of the implications for the future of the International Whaling Commission, Australia brought forward an ambitious reform agenda seeking to place significant constraints on the unilateral special permit Japanese whaling program. At the 2008 IWC meeting this agenda gained traction, but since then has become bogged down in endless diplomatic wrangling. A March 2010 IWC inter-sessional meeting planned for Florida may provide some indication as to where this reform agenda is heading, but Prime Minister Rudd's recent comments suggest the Australian government has had enough of Japan's failure to engage in this process in good faith. Given the nature of IWC politics and procedure, the June 2010 IWC annual meeting in Morocco looms as the decisive moment for assessing whether a diplomatic breakthrough is possible.<br /><br />Japan's Foreign Minister, Katsuya Okada, recently visited Australia for bilateral talks. There was a polite agreement-to-disagree over whaling and a commitment from both governments to try and ensure that the whaling dispute would not derail what are otherwise excellent bilateral relations. Okada said that Japan seeks "a diplomatic solution to this issue through understanding of culture and position of each party". However, these statements fail to appreciate that Japan's actions on whaling run counter to the spirit of a global moratorium on commercial whaling, and its JARPA II program has only heightened suspicions that Japan is actually engaging in a form of commercial and not scientific whaling. It is beginning to look increasingly likely that Australia will finally call Japan's bluff and politely say "see you in court." <br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;"><br />Donald R.

As the debate over where to try terrorists intensifies in the wake of the attempted Detroit airplane bombing and the Obama Administration's announcement that it is going to reconsider its decision to try those responsible for 9/11 in federal court, it is clear that panic is once more driving policy.  <br /><br />The proposed bill mandates that any person detained on suspicion of terrorist acts or material support for terrorism be placed in military custody.  The detainee will not be entitled to <em>Miranda</em> rights and will remain in detention &#8212; and can be interrogated &#8212; while the Executive Branch makes a status determination.  If determined to be an unprivileged enemy belligerent, the detainee will be held until the end of hostilities. Needless to say, unlike the POW in the war paradigm, for detainees, end of hostilities in the terrorism paradigm is a euphemism for 'indefinite detention'.<br /><br />The legislation's panic response can be seen not only in the due process and rights denied, but in the categories of persons it addresses.  By encompassing those suspected of material support for terrorism &#8212; a federal crime indeed but never part of the law of war &#8212; the bill subjects an extraordinarily broad group of persons to indefinite detention.<br /><br />The proposed legislation's impact would be a fundamental miscarriage of justice created by the unconstitutional denial of the right to counsel, the right to remain silent, the right to be free from arbitrary, let alone indefinite detention, and the right to a day in court.<br /><br />Past practice in the US and abroad demonstrates, unfortunately, that panic and the desire to respond plays a dominant role over legitimate national security interests, respect for constitutional and international law considerations and careful analysis of the threat posed. That is, the response becomes what is important; its legitimacy and justification take a back seat. While terrorism poses a threat, that threat does not justify throwing our principles out the door in panic. <br /><br />After the December 13, 2001 attack on the Indian parliament, the Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA) created an overly broad definition of terrorism, and provided for detention of suspects for up to three months without charge.  On September 17, 2004, the new elected Indian government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh announced that it would honor its election pledge to repeal the POTA, which dispensed with the presumption of innocence, allowed the compulsory denial of bail, and enabled the admissibility of confessions despite the rampant use of torture and coercion by police and security forces.  <br /><br />In the aftermath of the Passover eve bombing in Netanya, Israel, considered one of the worst terrorist attack in the nation's history, Israel extended the time for detention of Palestinians suspected of involvement in terrorism to 18 days without judicial review. In striking down the law, the High Court of Justice made two key observations.  First, the legislation was a classic example of a short-term response that did not address the long-term impact or issues of morality and legality.  Second, democracies must adopt self-imposed restraints, recognizing that they must fight terrorism with "one arm behind their backs."<br /><br />Republicans and Democrats alike have failed to articulate, create and implement a lawful interrogation, detention and trial regime for post-9/11 detainees. That is shameful and reflects negatively on two Presidents, the Congress and the Supreme Court. <br /><br />The real issue runs deeper: how does American society define itself in the context of terrorism &#8212; by the rule of law or the rule of fear? The proposed McCain-Lieberman bill suggests a problematic stop-gap measure that significantly violates the rights of suspects. The examples from India and Israel highlight the danger of panic legislation, ultimately overturned. <br /><br />Although we must address - and resolve &#8212; the trinity of detention, interrogation and trial, discarding core principles is not the way. I have proposed the establishment of national security court in conjunction with <em>Miranda</em> guarantees for detainees. A protectionless interrogation regime predicated on indefinite detention does not contribute to counterterrorism. All it does is reflect panic. That has not worked before &#8212; why should it work now?<br /><br /><br /><em>Amos N.

The IAEA Legal Advisor&#39;s office issued an opinion in March 2009 in which it rejected Iran's unilateral declaration of reversion, and maintained that the agreed modified Code 3.1 provisions remained in force between Iran and the IAEA.  As the Legal Advisor's office concluded:<blockquote>The implementation of the provisions of Subsidiary Arrangements can only be amended or suspended with the agreement of both parties to them. . . The provisions cannot be amended or suspended unilaterally by the state.  Thus Iran's failure to provide design information in accordance with the modified Code 3.1 as agreed to by Iran in 2003 is inconsistent with Iran's obligations under the Subsidiary Arrangements to its Safeguards Agreement.</blockquote>This statement by the IAEA Legal Advisor&#39;s office is generally in harmony with Articles 54-58 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which address the termination or suspension of treaties.  Pursuant to these rules, a bilateral treaty without an explicit termination or suspension provision normally cannot be terminated or suspended unilaterally by one party to it. <br /><br />However, all of this analysis by the IAEA Legal Advisor's office, and by commentators like James Acton, assumes that the Subsidiary Arrangements agreement is in fact a treaty, or a legally binding agreement in and of itself, and is thus on par with the Safeguards Agreement.  But this is not clearly the case. <br /><br />Article 39 of Iran's Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA provides that "The Government of Iran and the Agency shall make Subsidiary Arrangements which shall specify in detail, to the extent necessary to permit the Agency to fulfill its responsibilities under this Agreement in an effective and efficient manner, how the procedures laid down in this Agreement are to be applied."   From this mention alone, it is not at all clear that the subsidiary arrangements to be subsequently concluded between Iran and the IAEA in order to implement the Safeguards Agreement are conceived of by the parties as constituting a treaty.  <br /><br />While terminology is not per se dispositive of legal character, the term "arrangements" is not one of the terms commonly employed by international lawyers to denote a legally binding treaty.  It is more commonly used to refer to non-binding international accords, such as the Basel I &amp; II standards issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, or the 1975 Helsinki Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.    <br /><br />The dispositive test for determining whether an international agreement is a legally binding treaty is found in Articles 11-17 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.  Essentially this test boils down to the intent of the parties.  If the parties to an agreement intend that agreement to constitute a legally binding treaty, and if that intention is manifest through the forms and procedures for concluding the agreement, then the agreement is legally binding.  However, if that intent cannot be found manifest in the forms of concluding the agreement, the agreement is not legally binding, and is simply an accord or understanding between two parties.<br /><br />Looking at the provisions of Iran's Safeguards Agreement, it is manifestly clear that the Safeguards Agreement itself was intended to be a treaty.  Its entry into force as a legally binding instrument is expressly contemplated by the parties in Article 25 of the agreement.  As Article 25 states:<br /><br />This Agreement shall enter into force on the date upon which the Agency receives from the Government of Iran written notification that Iran's statutory and constitutional requirements for entry into force have been met. <br /><br />Furthermore, amendments to the Safeguards Agreement are provided in Article 24 only to enter into force upon conclusion of the same procedure, i.e. upon notification that the amendment has been accepted by the domestic lawmaking authorities in Iran.  This formal process involving the acceptance of the agreement by domestic authorities is consistent with a manifestation of intent by Iran and the IAEA that the Safeguards Agreement itself is to be considered a legally binding instrument.  Indeed, according to Article 77 of Iran's Constitution, &quot;International treaties, protocols, contracts, and agreements must be approved by the by the Islamic Consultative Assembly.&quot;  Mindful of this limitation on their domestic authority, Iranian negotiators would have been sure to require this domestic approval as a prerequisite for the entry into force of any legally binding treaty or amendment thereto.<br /><br />However, with regard to Subsidiary Arrangements, the Safeguards Agreement states in Article 39 that "The Subsidiary Arrangements may be extended or changed by agreement between the Government of Iran and the Agency without amendment of the Agreement." While Article 40 of the Safeguards Agreement mentions the entry into force of the Subsidiary Arrangements, it gives no specifications on the process by which such entry into force is to be accomplished. This absence of specification regarding the process for entry into force of the Subsidiary Arrangements, in light of the detailed specification of the process for entry into force of the Safeguards Agreement and amendments to it, including the constitutionally required consent of the Iranian domestic lawmaking institutions, is probative textual evidence that Iran did not intend for the Subsidiary Arrangements to be legally binding per se.  Rather, the Subsidiary Arrangements would appear to be more
accurately characterized as agreed guidelines or understandings for implementation of the Safeguards Agreement by the parties, of a non-binding legal character.<br /><br />Again, not all international agreements are treaties.  States and other holders of international legal personality very frequently choose to conclude international agreements on a non-legally-binding basis.  This is particularly true when the subject of the agreements is detailed and technical, and/or subject to foreseeable change over time in light of technological and other circumstantial dynamics.  States do this for many reasons, including so that they do not have to seek the consent of their domestic lawmaking authorities for changes to such relatively minor agreements whenever they are needed.  <br /><br />It is, unfortunately, not possible for international observers generally to analyze either the Subsidiary Arrangements agreement between Iran and the IAEA, or the 1976, 2003, and 2007 letters exchanged between Iran and the IAEA relative to the Subsidiary Arrangements, as these documents have not been made public by the parties.  This is unfortunate because these documents would provide important additional evidence regarding the intent of the parties.  However, the text of the Safeguards Agreement between Iran and the IAEA seems to indicate that the Safeguards Agreement itself, which established the broad contours of the agreement between Iran and the IAEA, was intended to be a legally binding treaty, but that the Subsidiary Arrangements which were to follow by agreement between Iran and the IAEA were likely intended, at least by Iran, to comprise non-binding guidelines for implementation of the treaty, which could be modified by simple agreement between Iranian officials and IAEA officials without the requirement of consent from Iran's domestic lawmaking authorities.<br /><br />If this analysis is correct, neither Code 3.1 nor modified Code 3.1 of the Subsidiary Arrangements would constitute an international legal obligation.  Thus, it would not be possible for Iran to have breached any such obligation by the timing of its disclosure regarding the existence of the Qom facility.<br /><br />If the various Subsidiary Arrangements agreements between Iran and the IAEA were in fact non-legally-binding in character, the only legal obligation with regard to the disclosure of design details for enrichment facilities incumbent upon Iran would be the provision in Article 42 of its Safeguards Agreement which states that "such information shall be provided as early as possible before nuclear material is introduced into a new facility."  <br /><br />It is uncontested that no nuclear material had, as of September 2009, been introduced into the Qom facility.  Indeed, no centrifuges had at that time been installed in the facility.  Thus, again if the analysis presented herein is correct, Iran's September 2009 disclosure of the existence of the facility to the IAEA would indeed have been consistent with all applicable legal obligations contained in its agreements with the IAEA.<br /><br />It is likely impossible for general international observers to make a final determination of the legality of Iran's disclosure of the Qom facility due to the closed source nature of several of the primary documents relevant to this analysis.  However, from an analysis of the sources that are open to general review, and in particular the Safeguards Agreement itself which is the only source clearly comprising legal obligations for Iran regarding the disclosure of enrichment facilities, it is not at all clear that Iran violated any legal obligations incumbent upon it in the timing of its Qom declaration.<br /><br />So what does this legal analysis mean for the relationship between Iran and the West/Israel going forward? It may serve as an illustration of the intelligence and diplomatic savvy of Iranian leaders, and their ability to go right up to the line of Iran's treaty obligations without clearly crossing over it, and thereby deny the members of the Security Council, and Israel in particular, clear justification to significantly increase economic pressure on Iran or act militarily against it.  If Iran continues this strategy of legal brinksmanship, it could even potentially achieve a viable nuclear hedging position without formally breaching its Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and Safeguards Agreement legal obligations.[3]  <br /><br />If this is Iran's intention, the fact that it can do so within its nonproliferation treaty obligations is a cause for concern.[4]  Indeed, some have termed this ability of NPT Non-Nuclear Weapon States parties to achieve a nuclear breakout capability, while remaining formally compliant with the NPT and their Safeguards Agreement obligations, a "loophole" in the NPT normative regime.[5]  In the end, however, this "loophole" has much more to do with the fundamentally dual use nature of fissile materials, and the complex reflection of this reality in the grand bargain codified by the NPT, than with poor drafting of the NPT itself.  This central tension between nonproliferation and peaceful use, as well as the related tensions between these principles and the principle of disarmament, make for a thoroughly bedeviling issue area for international legal regulation. But that is the nature of the nuclear beast.<br /><br /><font SIZE=1>Notes  <br /><br />[1] &quot;IAEA: Iran Broke Law by Not Revealing Nuclear Facility," CNN.com, September 30, 2009<br /><br />[2] "Iran Violated International Obligations on Qom Facility." Available at  http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=23884 <br /><br />[3] Nuclear hedging means having the capacity to produce a sufficient amount of weapons grade fissile material, and the knowledge and capability to manufacture the warhead hardware of a nuclear weapon, possibly in a matter of weeks once the political decision to construct a weapon has been made.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.creighton.edu/law/faculty/kelly/index.php">Michael Kelly</a> of Creighton University School of Law says that while democracy in Iraq may look one way in second Iraqi general election on Sunday, it may evolve to look very different when the next election cycle rolls around and the American troops are gone...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/kellyupdated.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>merican Ambassador Christopher Hill said this coming Sunday's general election in Iraq will "determine the quality of Iraqi democracy."  His frank statement in an <a href="http://www.onpointradio.org/2010/03/elections-in-iraq">interview</a> with NPR's Tom Ashbrook begs the question: who exactly determines the quality of Iraqi democracy?  Is there a fixed standard?  Not to my knowledge. True, the general election in Iraq will seat a new government that is selected by the people at large.  In that sense, democracy is achieved.  The level of violence that accompanies the process and the degree of public acceptance of the results is probably what Ambassador Hill is referring to &#8212; less violence and more acceptance equals higher quality of democracy.  So stability seems to be a key benchmark for determining a democracy's maturity.  This is only Iraq's second general election.  Isn't that a bit unrealistic?  The country is still occupied by U.S. forces and remains largely split along sectarian lines (Sunni Kurds, Sunni Arabs and Shiite Arabs).<br /><br /><em>Webster's</em> authoritatively defines democracy as "a: government by the people; especially: rule of the majority b: a government in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised by them directly or indirectly through a system of representation usually involving periodically held free elections."  The <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> offers a more egalitarian version: "Government by the people; that form of government in which the sovereign power resides in the people as a whole, and is exercised either directly by them (as in the small republics of antiquity) or by officers elected by them. In modern use often more vaguely denoting a social state in which all have equal rights, without hereditary or arbitrary differences of rank or privilege."  <br /><br />Those who seek to define "democracy" face the same inherently inescapable dilemma as those who seek to define "terrorism."  Experiential and perspective-laden differences yield a general lack of agreement.  How, then, can we prescribe democracy as the antidote for what ails all societies?  As Iraqis go the polls on Sunday, the casual observer might pause to ponder that question.  The U.S. was roundly criticized for attempting to deliver democracy to the Middle East at the end of a rifle barrel &#8212; both in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The corrupt government of Hamid Karzai in Afghanistan, recently re-elected, but supported by drug money and warlords, is hardly a poster-child for democracy.  Yet the impulse to provide for self-determination of peoples, noble as it is, remains strong.<br /><br />So which version of democracy is right for a complex society like Iraq?  They currently use a parliamentary democratic structure within a nominally federal system.  Power distribution runs along ethnic/religious lines so that the president, the prime minister and the speaker are never of the same ethnic/religious sector.  The current distribution places a Sunni Kurd as president, a Shiite Arab as prime minister, and a Sunni Arab as speaker.  The models that states can use for democracy are varied &#8212; from presidential to parliamentarian.  And they can exist within unitary or federal structures.  Indeed, recent history has seen the advent of new descriptors such as "-style" democracies: western-style democracy rests atop a foundation of civil society and the rule of law, Latin-style democracy is more fluid yet subject to sudden economic and military disruptions, African-style democracy is chaotic, tribal, and often relies on local strongmen, and of course Russian or Chinese-style democracy isn't democracy at all.<br /><br />Western states argue that what's missing from these less stable forms of democracy is the healthy degree of civil society and respect for the rule of law that buttresses Western systems.  And they have a point.  But those societies place a high priority on such values.  Inculcating similar priorities in dissimilar societies is problematic.  Without such values, democratic elections can produce non-democratic results (e.g. the national socialists in Germany &#8212; 1933, or Hamas in Palestine &#8212; 2006, or Russia today) &#8212; proving Fareed Zakaria's central point in <a href="http://books.wwnorton.com/books/detail.aspx?ID=8370">The Future of Freedom: Illiberal Democracy at Home &amp; Abroad</a> that elections, in and of themselves, do not democracies make.  <br /><br />So is this a reflection of who is ready for democracy and who is not?  According to many international law scholars and the human rights community, democracy is a right accorded to everyone on the planet.  That's a fine ideal, and one that I certainly sympathize with.  People should have the right to self-determine in both the systemic sense and the larger Wilsonian sense.  But the real world offers divergent and sometimes discouraging examples.  Was the Belgian Congo ready for democracy when King Leopold quit the Dark Continent in 1960?  Or India and Pakistan when King George VI withdrew from the British Raj in 1947?  No.  Massive social cleavages sometimes result and no one can predict when and whether democracy will take root, let alone in what form or for how long.  India has since become a model of democratic ideals, Pakistan much less so.  Congo remains a disaster.  <br /><br />Moreover, while democracy in Iraq may look one way in this second general election on Sunday, it may evolve to look very different when the next election cycle rolls around and the American troops are gone.  Democracy is not static.  It is perhaps more situational.  Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8545883.stm">complained this week</a> about massive amounts of foreign money coming into the campaigns from Iran and Saudi Arabia in an attempt to influence the outcome of the election.  Perhaps this same dynamic will play out in the United States in our November 2010 mid-term elections, given the Supreme Court's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/us/politics/22scotus.html">recent ruling in <em>Citizens United</em></a> freeing up corporate campaign contributions, with Exxon and Microsoft playing the role of the Iranians and Saudis?  Ambassador Hill will be watching the Iraqi elections on Sunday to "determine the quality of Iraqi democracy," but many will also likely have to do a bit of navel-gazing here in the U.S. come November.<br /><br /><br /><em>Michael J.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/students/faculty/BDavis/BDavis.htm">Benjamin Davis</a> of the University of Toledo College of Law says a recent effort by a conservative advocacy website to besmirsch the reputations of current DOJ lawyers who previously represented detainees should not distract the US government from criminally prosecuting DOJ lawyers from the past administration who made torture possible....<br /><hr size="1"><br /><table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/forumy/benjamindavisnew.jpg" align="left" vspace="2" hspace="0"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" width="5" height="1"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" width="1" height="1"></td></tr></tbody></table> <font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font> recently came across an effort by a group calling itself <a href="http://www.keepamericasafe.com">Keep America Safe</a> to pressure DOJ lawyers who once represented detainees by outing them as the "Al Qaeda 9".  This new twist smacks of the "Cully" Stimson&#39;s effort in the last administration to "pressure" law firms that had lawyers working pro bono for the defense on those cases.  After an uproar, Stimson <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2007/02/02/cully-stimson-resigns/tab/article/">resigned</a>.  <br /><br />Keep America Safe and its surrogates appear to be conducting a thinly veiled effort to question the patriotism of those lawyers who represented detainees in resisting violations of the Geneva Conventions and bringing to light, in FOIA requests and litigation, the torture in the prior administration.  <br /><br />This kind of chilling effect on dissent from outrageous policy is nothing new under the sun.  Its natural impact is to attempt to intimidate both those who take on these cases and those who would hire such people after they take on these cases, especially those entering the government to serve the public trust.  Too much "controversy" about them.<br /><br />A further twist is an open letter in "support" of the lawyers, recently described <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/politico/20100308/pl_politico/34050_1">here</a>.  Among the signatories are a laundry list of persons who in the prior administration's time were strong advocates for torture (whatever the euphemism used at the time).  Of course, the zen of this letter is to try to put the current DOJ lawyers who defended detainees on the same level as the former DOJ lawyers who advocated for torture and thus rehabilitate the former DOJ lawyers.<br /><br />Sorry folks, even here in Toledo we can see that game and it will not work.  The former DOJ lawyers clearly advocated for a crime to be committed (though the OPR report glaringly did not even look at that canon of ethics in any meaningful sense).  The current DOJ lawyers advocated for the defense in adversarial proceedings.  These are fundamentally different animals and no effort at equivalence should be allowed to succeed to keep Americans in the dark.<br /><br />Look, my fellow Americans, you either resist torture or you acquiesce to it.  There is no middle ground.  If you are so fearful that you are willing to think torture is OK, then you are just joining a long line of Americans in our history who in moments of hysteria were willing to give up everything. If you are, like the top military JAG officers in that time, willing to see the detrimental consequences of torture for America and that a state crime was committed, then I would ask that you stand with people like me and seek the criminal prosecution of the DOJ lawyers from the past administration so we can wash our very dirty laundry here at home rather than in some court overseas in Spain.<br /><br />I recognize the effort to get you to acquiesce to torture is sophisticated and relentless.  That is what people who advocate for torture do to avoid a day of reckoning in court.  And those who you do not see named are the high-level civilians who were pushing for torture in the NSC Principals, the White House, and Congress.  These persons have a stake in Americans not being aware of what they really did and also in not having what they did &#8212; whether Democrat or Republican &#8212; brought out for the world to see.  I would even wager that there are leaders or former leaders of other countries that helped us who do not want to see their efforts to support torture come out in the public.<br /><br />But so what for the egos and reputations of these people?  They besmirched their reputations by putting torture in place, by perverting our soldiers to do their bidding, and then letting the grunts at the bottom take the fall when the Abu Ghraib scandal erupted.<br /><br />They are perfectly willing to instrumentalize anything, anything to prevent themselves from being prosecuted.  Do not let yourself be kept in the dark.  Ask for light to be brought in the cold brilliance of a court room.  It may not be good politics for this or that administration, but it would be a good thing for America.  When it comes out we will all know who was quiet and who took a stand against torture.  And that is the choice each American has to make when the forces are attempting to spin the problem into something else so that we sweep this all under the rug.<br /><br />This is not going under a rug.  Not if I can help it.<br /><br /><br /><em>Benjamin Davis is a professor at the University of Toledo College of Law</em><br />

		<title>LEBANON: Women&#039;s Citizenship and Nationality Rights</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Megan McKee, Pitt Law &#39;12, takes a personal perspective on citizenship and women&#39;s rights in Lebanon...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><font size="3"><b>S</b></font>ara Burhan Abdullah&#39;s recent JURIST <i>Dateline</i> <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/dateline/2010/01/iraq-citizenship-and-womens-rights.php">article</a> on women&#39;s rights and citizenship in Iraq reminded me of a similar predicament faced by Lebanese women. In Iraqi law, as in Lebanese law, citizenship may only be inherited through men, both in marriage and in the transference of citizenship to children. As a result, a child is considered Lebanese only if his father is Lebanese. Even if a child is born to a Lebanese mother in Lebanon, the mother cannot under any circumstances pass on her citizenship to the child. Furthermore, in the event a Lebanese woman marries a foreign man, the law requires that the woman choose between adopting the nationality of her husband and keeping her own Lebanese citizenship. A woman who chooses to take her husband&#39;s citizenship may later reclaim her Lebanese citizenship following her husband&#39;s death or the dissolution of her marriage, which is an improvement upon the prior law that automatically stripped a woman of her citizenship upon marriage to a foreigner. However, because Lebanese citizenship is paternally linked, men are never at risk of losing their citizenship, always enjoy the right of passing their citizenship onto their children, and may even pass their citizenship on to their foreign wives.<br /><br />As an American woman currently in a relationship with a Lebanese man, I am thankfully not affected by this law. However, I cannot help but imagine a situation where our roles were reversed. If I were a Lebanese woman in a relationship with an American man, I would be forced to choose between my future husband&#39;s nationality and my own. Any children resulting from the marriage would inherit their father&#39;s citizenship regardless of my wishes. Ultimately, the only way a Lebanese woman can ensure her children will have Lebanese citizenship is to marry a Lebanese man.   <br /><br />This situation persists despite the fact that Lebanon, like Iraq, has a constitutional provision prohibiting gender-based discrimination. In fact, Article VII of the Lebanese Constitution makes all citizens equal under the law. Nevertheless, Lebanese women continue to face systematic discrimination with respect to citizenship despite such legal provisions mandating equality <br /><br />The origins of this discrimination are particularly interesting. While it may be in fashion to cite &quot;backward&quot; cultural values or &quot;Islamic intolerance,&quot; this issue is actually a holdover from European colonialism. Current Lebanese law can be traced back to the transplantation of French civil law in Lebanon. When the Ottoman Empire was dissolved at the end of World War I, the Sykes-Picot Agreement partitioned the former Ottoman Empire into separate British and French mandates, with Great Britain having the mandate over present-day Iraq, Jordan, and Palestine, and France the mandate over present-day Syria and Lebanon. The French disbanded the region&#39;s existing governments, and in 1926, instituted a new Lebanese Constitution strongly modeled after the French Third Republic&#39;s civil code. Ever since, Lebanon has been governed by what is essentially the French Napoleonic Code.<br /><br />Developed following the French Revolution of the late 18th century, the Napoleonic Code is commonly regarded as a symbol of progressive modernization. The Code is remarkable for abolishing privileges based on birth and establishing freedom of religion, in addition to instituting other reforms, such as the prohibition of secret and <i>ex post facto</i> laws. However, the transplantation of the Code in Lebanon was actually a step backward for Lebanese women. <br /><br />French law placed women under the complete control of their male guardians, as was generally the case under all contemporary European law. In the French Third Republic, married French women, even those of the age of majority, were legally accorded the status of a minor. A married woman&#39;s legal status made her subordinate to her husband and made it impossible for her to enter into a contract or even defend herself in court without the presence or consent of her &quot;guardian.&quot; French law continued to decree that men alone enjoyed the right to pass on citizenship until the late 1960s.<br /><br />Despite the French-inspired Lebanese Constitution&#39;s attempt to distance Lebanon from its pre-colonial Ottoman history and place it on the &quot;path to progress,&quot; Ottoman law was far more progressive in terms of women&#39;s rights. Under Ottoman law, an adult woman was able to enter into contracts and use the court system independent of her husband, in addition to exercising other rights that were denied to her under the new, French-inspired legal code. Women enjoyed a particularly more advantageous position in the area of citizenship rights under Ottoman law. In fact, an Ottoman law dating from the early 1800&#39;s held that a woman had the right to pass on her nationality to her children, regardless of her spouse&#39;s nationality, as long as her child was born on Ottoman soil. In effect, Ottoman law allowed citizenship to be inherited from both the mother and the father.<br /><br />Clearly, the current law&#39;s origins are firmly French in nature. Despite its support in Lebanese circles, the nationality law is not so much a matter of Middle Eastern &quot;backwardness,&quot; but rather a reminder of what was not so long ago a Western norm. The 1926 transplantation of French law in Lebanon mandated that Lebanese citizenship could only be inherited through the father and generally restricted women&#39;s personal status. However, while France, along with the majority of the West, made reforms in this area in the 1960s, Lebanon continues to enforce France&#39;s archaic laws. Many Lebanese regard the situation as both humiliating for women and for Lebanon as whole, particularly since Lebanon has long prided itself on being at the vanguard of reform in the Middle East, especially reform related to the personal status of women. <br /><br />Citizenship rights have real implications for many Lebanese men, women, and children, as it is estimated that some 18,000 women married foreign men in Lebanon between 1995 and 2008. The children affected by the current law face problems inheriting estates, obtaining work, receiving health care and education, and can even be forced to leave the country upon turning 18. A draft law that would make nationality rights gender-neutral was submitted to Parliament in May 2009, but has not received much support. However, the National Commission for Lebanese Women recently marked International Women&#39;s Day by launching a new campaign to support full nationality rights for Lebanese women. It is my hope that Lebanon will soon reform its nationality law to reflect the equality that its constitution mandates, and, in doing so, allow for Lebanese women to enjoy the same citizenship rights as Lebanese men.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>WASHINGTON DC: Oral Arguments at the Supreme Court</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Zach Mueller, Pitt Law &#39;12, recently attended oral arguments in the case of <u>Humanitarian Law Project v. Holder</u> at the US Supreme Court in Washington, DC. He shares his thoughts on the experience...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><span style="font-size:100%;"><strong>T</strong></span>he red velvet curtain parted, and Chief Justice John Roberts emerged from the narrow opening behind the elevated bench, prepared to hear the oral arguments for each party. I instinctively closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and tried unsuccessfully to slow the pounding of my heart and the sweating of my palms. My body was reacting as if I were about to stand up and argue an important First Amendment case before the Court. In reality, I was one of many ordinary citizens there to observe the animated and often tedious probing exercise that is oral argument. As the justices assumed their respective positions on the bench (allocated by seniority), the portrait of the courtroom before me appeared complete. I recalled that I was now sitting in the same room where Thurgood Marshall once argued <u>Brown v. Board of Education</u>, where Richard Nixon was ordered to hand over incriminating tape recordings, and where the outcome of the 2000 Presidential race was effectively decided. Given the sweeping implications of the cases argued here, how could I not be nervous for the real attorneys?<br /><br />The only consolation for my crippling nerves was that my then-firm belief that the justices themselves had already determined the outcome, and that oral arguments only served the symbolic purpose of informing both parties that the merits of the case were duly noted and considered. Given the well-known judicial philosophies of each particular justice, a mere glance at the question before the court would provide enough information to predict the result with relative certainty. The case that was being heard, <u>Humanitarian Law Project v. Holder</u>, concerned the challenge of a federal law that prohibits any person from providing &quot;material support&quot; to a group that the Secretary of State has designated a terrorist organization. The likely result? By a 5-4 vote with Kennedy, Scalia, Thomas, Roberts, and Alito in the majority, the government prevails, and the decision tips the balance of law away from First Amendment protections in favor of national security concerns. Or at least so I thought. In essence, I expected oral arguments to be largely irrelevant, and my presence there was inspired more by a lifelong affinity for all things Supreme Court than by a belief that an important Constitutional question would actually be resolved in my midst. What transpired over the next 60 minutes, however, both confirmed and dashed my preconceived notions about the role of oral advocacy in the Supreme Court.<br /><br />Much attention and public scrutiny is directed at the behavior of the justices during arguments, primarily because verbal and nonverbal behavior is taken to indicate the direction in which a particular justice is leaning in deciding the case at bar. Justice Thomas continued his impressive streak of not speaking during arguments. (Incidentally, the last time Thomas did actively participate in oral arguments was February 22, 2006, nearly four years to the day of the Court&#39;s consideration of <u>Humanitarian Law Project</u>). Predictably, Justice Kennedy announced publicly that he was struggling with the case, as if to reassure the lawyers that the quality and efficacy of their efforts would ultimately influence his vote. Justice Scalia (whose reputation and stature alone were enough to draw me to these oral arguments) expressed his strong incredulity at the possibility of a person providing some type of service, even humanitarian training, to a terrorist group without necessarily advancing the organization&#39;s violent ends. However, as I listened attentively, I shifted my focus away from the justices and toward the attorneys, and began to reconsider my dismissive opinion of the purely symbolic quality of the oral arguments.<br /><br />Sitting there, I could not help but sense a correlation between the strength of each attorney&#39;s advocacy skills and the strengths of their respective cases. In a way, the merits are prejudiced by their presenters. For example, I suddenly became more suspicious of the government&#39;s position when its attorney, Solicitor General Elena Kagan, backed herself into a corner by intimating that a law firm could be criminally prosecuted for filing an amicus brief on behalf of a terrorist organization. Similarly, counsel for the Humanitarian Law Project drew several convincing analogies which elucidated the consequences of a ruling against them. (Could a <u>Washington Post</u> editor be prosecuted for publishing an op-ed written by the leader of Hamas?) Unfortunately, because the statute in this case was challenged only as it applied to the Humanitarian Law Project, the weight of these hypothetical situations was of little consequence. This fact was immaterial to those of us who were awe-stricken by the prowess of the exceptionally skilled and experienced advocates.<br /><br />I visited the Supreme Court because, as a student of the institution, I wanted to see in person the justices I have so long admired. However, like the cases themselves, everything I needed to know about the nine men and women who comprise the highest tribunal of the United States can be read in the appropriate literature. I did not need to experience oral arguments to confirm that Justice Scalia occasionally cracks a joke while badgering an attorney, or that Justice Kennedy will acknowledge that he is confounded by the legal issues in play. Rather, oral argument is the attorney&#39;s showcase, and despite the justices&#39; frequent interjections, the attorneys themselves impart invaluable lessons, and the strength of the arguments they present is reflected by the confidence and zeal they possess, and may go beyond the actual merits of a case. This explains the growth of an exclusive class of Supreme Court litigators whose services are only retained when a case reaches the Court. I was interested to learn that Chief Justice Rehnquist would often point out to the Court that the attorney presenting a case was an expert on the matter because that same attorney had argued several previous cases on the same issue. (One of these attorneys was the current Chief Justice, John Roberts, who clerked for Rehnquist and subsequently argued dozens of cases in the Supreme Court). I was left wondering whether or not the prestige and acumen of a particular litigator does affect the decision-making processes of the justices, albeit in a subconscious way. Whatever the answer may be, the over-glorification that had long influenced my views of the Supreme Court gave way to the reality that the Court is a very human institution, composed of very human judges who make determinations based on both written and oral presentations delivered by very human lawyers.<br /><br />The art of effective representation is the art of persuasion, and no person - judge, justice, lawyer, or casual observer - is impervious to the potent effects of sound oral advocacy. I left the courtroom, and contrary to my impressions prior to the argument, I was nearly convinced that the Law Project had the better case. After experiencing the oral argument first-hand, I would be surprised if the justices themselves were not undergoing the same re-evaluation.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">Mentioned in this article:<br /><br /><a href="/paperchase/2010/02/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on.php">JURIST</a> - Paper Chase Report on Oral Argument<br /><a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/pdfs/09-10/08-1498_HumanitarianLawProj.pdf">Brief for Humanitarian Law Project</a><br /><a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/pdfs/09-10/08-1498_HumanitarianLawProj.pdf">Brief for Holder</a><br /><a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-1498.pdf">Oral Argument Transcript</a></span><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>J&eacute;r&eacute;mie Zimmermann</strong> [Co-founder and spokesperson, <a href="http://www.laquadrature.net/en">La Quadrature du Net</a>]: &quot;The recent <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-fcc.php">decision</a> from the US Court of Appeals is a blow to the defense of a free, open, and therefore neutral Internet, but it is not definitive. The FCC can and should reconsider its policy and reclassify broadband providers so as to assert its authority in mandating net neutrality.<br /><br />The internet has become such a crucial tool for the exercice of fundamental freedoms of expression and communication - as stated by the French Constituional Council in the paragraph 12 of its <a href="http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/root/bank/download/2009-580DC-2009_580dc.pdf">decision</a> [PDF file] on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HADOPI_law">Hadopi</a> &quot;Three Strikes&quot; law - that any restriction to its access is a de facto restriction to these<br />freedoms.<br /><br />If operators tend to restrict Internet access, and, therefore fundamental freedoms, its the role of the public authorities to protect citizens and innovation. For that reason, should regulators encounter any obstacle in exerting authority on internet access providers, lawmakers will have to step in and enforce net neutrality through adequate legislation.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.sandlerreiff.com/attorneys/neil-reiff/"><strong>Neil P. Reiff</strong></a> [Founding member, <a href="http://www.sandlerreiff.com/">Sandler Reiff &amp; Young</a>]: &quot;Last week, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, sitting en banc, <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down.php">issued</a> a significant, yet unsurprising <a href="http://869789182725854870-a-speechnow-org-s-sites.googlegroups.com/a/speechnow.org/www/litigationpage/speechnowenbancdecision.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7cp43lmu2fMWY-yRG_KWO8lXURMe-mgQySKnbpGAumxNr7SMeCxTZOO5ASOkQrq_bqqrT5-tIm17HtW97121ZID1DoUEUEqxdWhAhCBg_EkhSas6Z6CGwYI9XrAG1eEpImhDZzgVya9JZmwAZUt8MiTdxyiu1Kc0hYOiERrYJFaXg-v6dE3DhYvPntlX4FGf9FQ-yDGf7zn4xPZHZ-8g8QCK5LgD6ZG3YIGIM3B7Mk7jxBodESQ%3D&attredirects=0">decision</a> [PDF File] in <u>Speechnow.org. v. FEC</u>.   In <u>Speechnow.org</u>, the Circuit Court ruled 9-0, that a federal political committee that engages exclusively in independent expenditures is not subject to the $5,000 annual limit placed on contributions to federal PACs.  Stated simply, if three individuals wanted to form a committee to run independent expenditures, each individual may contribute, without limit, to the federal committee.  And that committee, as long as it acts independently of any candidate or party committee could run ads saying anything - even vote for or against a federal candidate. Although there is still the possibility that the case could head to the Supreme Court, if recent cases are any indication, there is a good chance that this case will not be appealed and will, at least at the federal level, create a new type of federal committee that (at least for the time being) will be subject to the prohibitions of federal law (i.e. no corporate or union treasury contributions) but not the $5,000 annual limitation on contributions by individuals.  Considering the Supreme Court&#39;s recent decision in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-205.pdf">Citizens United v. FEC</a> [PDF File], the Solicitor General may think twice about seeking review in this case.  Indeed, considering the momentum in the DC Circuit and Supreme Court, the Solicitor General would be wise to let this one go and fight another day to minimize the damage, at least for now.<br /><br />The <u>Speechnow.org</u> case provided a relatively simple and appealing constitutional issue to consider - whether a group that only engages in independent expenditures can be &quot;corrupting.&quot;  Although there is some case law on the issue, including a Fourth Circuit decision striking down PAC limits for independent expenditure committees, there was considerable debate whether previous conflicting pronouncements regarding &quot;corruption&quot; in Supreme Court jurisprudence, combined with the lower level of scrutiny in contribution cases, could lead to a decision upholding a PAC contribution limit for such committees (lower courts have split on the issue).<br /><br />The death knell for the FEC&#39;s defense of the limits in <u>Speechnow.org</u> came just a few weeks earlier in <u>Citizens United v. FEC</u>.  In that case, Justice Kennedy significantly narrowed the Court&#39;s concept of corruption when he succinctly declared that independent expenditures, as a matter of law, do not corrupt, or create the appearance of corruption.  Any holdouts in the D.C. Circuit for the government&#39;s position were swayed, and the en banc court ruled swiftly and unanimously in favor of the plaintiffs.<br /><br />This case has potentially significant implications for future litigation, as well as the political landscape.  First, assuming the Solicitor General does not appeal this decision, the door is open for further erosion of the regulation of independent groups.  Next will most likely be a test case aiming to establish that independent expenditure committees can accept, in light of the <u>Citizens United</u> decision, corporate and union funds for the purpose of paying for independent express advocacy communications in connection with federal elections.  This is now something that corporations and unions may do directly after the <u>Citizens United</u> decision.  Taking these two opinions together, there is nothing to stop a future litigant to argue that the FECA&#39;s corporation and union prohibitions should not apply to these committees.  <br /><br />Second, the decision has some good public policy implications.  Before recent Court decisions, much of the independent political speech in federal elections occurred at the fringes of campaign regulation by groups such as &quot;527&#39;s&quot; and other &quot;non-profits&quot; who were either subject to the inadequate disclosure regime of the Internal Revenue Service or no disclosure at all.  Working on the margins, these groups were already using unlimited individual, union and corporate contributions to run &quot;issue ads&quot; that were ostensibly intended to influence elections.  The <u>Speechnow.org</u> decision (which also upheld political committee reporting requirements for independent expenditure committees) will bring more independent spending into the light by inducing committees to avoid the subterfuges of &quot;issue advocacy&quot; while subjecting their activity to the reporting regime of federal campaign finance law.  In the long run, this will be a very positive development.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ceps.be/member/piotr-maciej-kaczyński"><strong>Piotr Maciej Kaczy&Aring;&#8222;ski</strong></a> [Research Fellow, <a href="http://www.ceps.be/">Centre for European Policy Studies</a>]: &quot;On the tragic morning of the Black Saturday, 10 April 2010, the President of Poland Lech Kaczy&Aring;&#8222;ski travelling with his wife Maria and 94 other persons were <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/poland-lower-house-speaker-assumes.php">killed</a> in a plane crash near Smolensk, Russia.  They were going to Katy&Aring;&#8222;, a place where 70 years earlier the Soviet secret police NKVD slaughtered over 20,000 Polish intellectuals.  During the next 70 years the rulers of Moscow first denied the crime, and after the end of communism they were ambivalent about the Soviet responsibility for it.  Ever since Poland regained its sovereignty in 1989, it has been vital for the Polish political class to solve the mysteries of the Katy&Aring;&#8222; massacre and commemorate the victims every year.  The remembrance of the truth about the Katy&Aring;&#8222; murders has been particularly important for President Kaczy&Aring;&#8222;ski. It will be part of his legacy now that the whole world, once and for all, knows about the Katy&Aring;&#8222; massacre and who are responsible for it.<br /><br />Poland is a stable democratic country.  A massive tragedy like the one of 10 April does not undermine the stability of the state or the chain of command. Within hours of the tragedy, the Speaker of the Sejm (the Parliament) Bronis&Aring;&#8218;aw Komorowski became the acting head of state.  He has fourteen days to call for early presidential elections, which have to take place within the next 60 days. Deputy Chiefs of the National Central Bank, the Institute of National Remembrance and the Ombudsman Office took up their respective acting roles.  A new head of the National Security Bureau has been already appointed on Monday as well as a new head of the President&#39;s Chancellery. New members of the Sejm will be sworn in according to the procedure; the three new Senators will be elected in the by-election, possibly together with the earlier presidential elections.<br /><br />As in a parliamentary democracy, the prerogatives of the President are limited by the Constitution. It is the government with its Prime Minister who are the primary actors with executive powers.  The cabinet lost three deputy ministers: of defense, of foreign affairs and of culture.  None of the sitting government ministers were on the plane. It will now be the responsibility &#8212; in the absence of the President &#8212; of the de facto country leader Donald Tusk, the Prime Minister, to ensure the continuity of governance and stability of the system.<br /><br />All political families lost members. The Law and Justice Party (PiS, before the accident with +/- 25% public support) lost leadership of their parliamentary club, as five leading MPs and two senators have passed away, including former ministers G&Auml;&#8482;sicka, Gosiewski, Wassermann.  The late President together with his brother established the party back in 2001. His passing may have significant consequences for the future of the party. <br /><br />The governing Civic Platform (PO, +/- 50% public support) also lost important figures (3 MPs and Deputy Speaker of the Senate Bochenek).  The party leaders were not on the plane; Prime Minister Donald Tusk and three of his ministers were present at another Katy&Aring;&#8222; ceremony last Wednesday together with the Russian Prime Minister Putin.<br /><br />There were also three MPs of the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD, +/- 10% public support) who lost their lives in the tragedy, including the party&#39;s candidate for Poland&#39;s presidency, Jerzy Szmajdzi&Aring;&#8222;ski.  The left wing party has been especially hurt by the accident, as there are now very few middle-aged leaders left. Szmajdzi&Aring;&#8222;ski and another victim, Jolanta Szymanek-Deresz, were supposed to lead the process of regaining public support for the party following the fall elections, which once enjoyed over 40% support in the 2001 elections.<br /><br />The Polish People&#39;s Party (PSL, +/- 6% public support) also lost 3 MPs.  The last parliamentarian was no other then Maciej P&Aring;&#8218;a&Aring;&frac14;y&Aring;&#8222;ski, who was an independent MP, who was one of the co-founders of the PO back in 2001 and Speaker of the Sejm from 1997-2001.<br /><br />The unprecedented tragedy of 10 April does not stop time, and once the state of shock is over, normal politics will return. For the moment it is too early for a deep and comprehensive analysis of the political consequences and impact on the political stability of the system.  A lot will depend on how actors and individuals behave in the aftermath of the tragedy.  Will it cement the domination of the ruling PO?  What will be the impact on the PiS and its orphaned leader, Jaros&Aring;&#8218;aw Kaczy&Aring;&#8222;ski?  Will the party cease to exist or, quite the opposite, will its support flourish out of sympathy for the deceased President?  What will happen with the SLD, who also lost almost all remaining middle-aged leaders on Saturday?  Will another formation dominate the left flank?  Who will be Poland&#39;s next President and what will the campaign look like?  Will there be a campaign at all?  Would PiS and SLD put forward candidates?  Will the candidates have enough time to collect 100,000 signatures to run?  All those relevant questions are going to be answered when the political life of the country returns to reality.  But for the moment, the country is united in mourning and grief.&quot;<br />

		<title>Hutaree Militia arrests reflect growth of potentialy violent anti-government groups</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://splcenter.org/who-we-are/staff/heidi-beirich-phd">Heidi Beirich</a> [Director of Research, <a href="http://splcenter.org/?ref=logo">Southern Poverty Law Center</a>]: &quot;The <a href=" http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/03/militia-members-indicted-for-plotting.php">arrests</a> this past weekend of nine members of the Hutaree Militia in what federal authorities are describing as a plot to murder a law enforcement officer in Michigan and then attack other officials who gathered for the funeral is another reminder of how burning hatred for the federal government can quickly morph into violence. After all, it was another government-hater, Timothy McVeigh, who blew up the Alfred P. Murrah Building in Oklahoma City in 1995 killing 168 people, including 19 children in a day-care center.  <br /><br />The Hutaree Militia first came to the attention of the Southern Poverty Law Center early last year, when our researchers found the group&#39;s MySpace page, which advertised their paramilitary training events. The Hutaree are just one of dozens of new anti-government &quot;Patriot&quot; groups that popped up in the last year as right-wing extremism exploded across the country in the wake of broad-based populist anger at political, demographic and economic changes in America. In fact, the so-called &quot;Patriot&quot; groups - militias and other organizations that see the federal government as part of a plot to impose &quot;one-world government&quot; on liberty-loving Americans - rose from 149 groups in 2008 to 512 in 2009. Militias grew from 42 groups in 2008 to 127 in 2009. The last time America saw this much militia activity was in the months before the Oklahoma bombing. <br /><br />The Hutaree arrests are just the latest in a series of domestic terrorism plots that have occurred over the past year and a half. Just a few weeks ago, Joseph Stack flew his airplane into an IRS building in Austin, TX, in a fit of anti-government rage. In the past year, six law enforcement officers have been killed by domestic terrorists enraged at the government, and high profile institutions, including the Holocaust Memorial Museum, have been targeted by men with anti-government grievances. The health care vote has further inflamed right-wing extremists. In the wake of the vote, several democratic offices had bricks thrown through their windows, a tactic egged on by an Alabama militia member.  <br /><br />Sadly, given the rage seething across the American political landscape - over racial changes in the population, soaring public debt and the terrible economy, the bailouts of bankers and other elites, and an array of initiatives by the relatively liberal Obama Administration that are seen as &quot;socialist&quot; or even &quot;fascist&quot; - this will not be the last incident of this kind.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://reproductiverights.org/en/profile/stephanie-toti"><strong>Stephanie Toti</strong></a> [Staff attorney, US Legal Program, <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a>]: &quot;The Oklahoma Supreme Court recently <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/oklahoma-supreme-court-rejects-broad.php">struck down</a> an omnibus statute, S.B. 1878, that imposed a host of contradictory restrictions on the provisions of reproductive health care in the State.  The law included a provision that would have prohibited a woman from having an abortion unless she first had an ultrasound and listened to her doctor describe the image in detail.  Paradoxically, there was also a provision that would have prevented women from suing their obstetricians for intentionally withholding information about problems with their pregnancies, including fetal anomalies. In addition, abortion providers would be required to post signs in their offices stating that it is against the law for anyone to force a woman to have an abortion, but not for anyone to coerce her into carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term.  By manipulating the flow of information to pregnant women, the law undermined women&#39;s ability to make informed decisions about their reproductive health and insulted their dignity, autonomy, and intelligence.  <br /><br />S.B. 1878 was enacted by a super-majority of the Legislature over the Governor&#39;s veto. This, despite the fact that it suffered from numerous constitutional flaws, not the least of which was its consolidation of several distinct restrictions into a single measure.  But that kind of logrolling is strictly prohibited by the Oklahoma Constitution.  The Oklahoma Supreme Court held the Legislature accountable for its disregard of the Constitution, sternly admonishing the body for its violation of core state constitutional law.  In doing so, the Court vindicated both the rights of women and the rule of law.  <br /><br />The Court&#39;s decision was insufficient, however, to bring to a halt the relentless campaign waged by some legislators to make it harder for doctors to provide abortion and for women in Oklahoma to obtain abortion services.  The provisions of S.B. 1878 have all been reintroduced this legislative session, along with some additional restrictions, such as a ban on the sale of egg cells.  It is my sincere hope that those provisions will not be enacted into law.  Like their forerunners, they violate a myriad of constitutional principles, from freedom of speech to due process to equal protection of the law.  But regardless of what happens this legislative session, the Center for Reproductive Rights will continue to stand up for the rights of women and the rule of law, and we hope that the Oklahoma Supreme Court will continue to stand with us.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://energy.nationaljournal.com/contributors/bill-snape.php">William J. Snape, III</a> [Senior Counsel, <a href="http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/">Center for Biological Diversity</a>]: &quot;While it is encouraging that China and India now <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/china-india-agree-to-non-binding.php">recognize</a> their important role in reducing world greenhouse pollution, neither their current commitments nor the Copenhagen Accord are answers to the most serious environmental problem the world has ever faced.  The best available science tells us that we must reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide (and other greenhouse pollutants) to no more than 350 parts per million of CO2.  Current levels stand at roughly 390ppm.  This means that China, India, Europe, the United States and others must reduce their greenhouse pollutants at least 40% from 1990 levels in the next ten years.  None of the non-binding promises by the world&#39;s leading countries remotely approach this mark, nor even the mark of 450 parts per million at which global warming might avoid no-return climate tipping points.  In fact, the aspirational goals made so far barely bend the curve on ever increasing carbon pollution on their way to 700 parts per million and beyond, and leave us committed to temperature increases exceeding what life as we know it can sustain.<br /><br />In the United States, there already exists a legal infrastructure under the <a href="http://epw.senate.gov/envlaws/cleanair.pdf">Clean Air Act</a> [PDF file] and other laws to reduce greenhouse pollutants.  President Obama&#39;s Environmental Protection Agency is taking tentative steps toward implementing these laws, but a far greater sense of urgency is needed.  It certainly does not help that a group of at least 20 Republican Senators from fossil-fuel states are determined not only to block EPA&#39;s every protective move, but also to attack the reality of global warming that in fact is already here for all to see.  History will condemn these postures.<br /><br />But the current political reality is that the false attacks on climate science have had some of their intended pernicious effects, and that a larger majority of the American people must again demand national and international action to combat climate change without delay.  The US Congress, furthermore, will have to overcome its tendency to resist non-military forms of foreign spending, and help developing countries meet quite attainable technological improvements in reducing fossil fuel use and pollution.  Ironically, both national security and economic opportunities are greatly enhanced for the US and foreign businesses alike if such &quot;green investment&quot; is taken seriously.   The Obama administration seems to understand this situation, but must directly challenge the &quot;Know Nothings&quot; of the 21st Century.<br /><br />Candidate Obama and the new Congressional leadership promised &quot;change&quot; during the heady days of the 2008 campaign.  Such change cannot occur if the status quo political power of oil, gas and coal are allowed to maintain their grip on society at large.  The challenge is large, yet the stakes are much larger.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.famm.org/NewsandInformation/PressReleases/FAMMwelcomesDeborahFleischaker.aspx"><strong>Deborah Fleischaker</strong></a> [Director of State Legislative Affairs, <a href="http://www.famm.org/">Families Against Mandatory Minimums</a>]: &quot;Last week, John Gramlich of the indispensable news site, <a href="http://www.stateline.org">stateline.org</a>, reported on the <a href="http://www.stateline.org/live/details/story?contentId=463000">political fallout</a> in several states where policymakers have employed early prison release programs to combat overcrowded prisons and rising budget deficits. Several cash-strapped states from Florida to California have looked for budget savings by expediting the release of non-violent offenders, a move that has angered some police and victims&#39; rights groups. While early releases are sometimes effective, they are, at best, a short-term solution to a long-term problem.  States would be better off revisiting the mindless mandatory minimum laws they passed a generation ago which fill their prisons with non-violent offenders and stretch their budgets beyond repair.<br /><br />The problem state lawmakers are confronting is a real one. Last year, the Pew Center for the States, <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/1-in-31-us-adults-under-correctional.php">released</a> a jaw-dropping report revealing that one in thirty-one Americans are either in jail or prison, or on parole or probation. The report concluded that corrections spending was the fastest expanding major segment of state budgets. State corrections costs now top $50 billion annually and consume one in every 15 discretionary dollars.<br /><br />These budget figures are surprising, but according to the Pew researchers, their cause is not. &quot;The remarkable rise in corrections spending wasn&#39;t fate or even the natural consequence of spikes in crime,&quot; the authors wrote. &quot;It was the result of state policy choices that sent more people to prison and kept them there longer. The sentencing and release laws passed in the 1980s and 1990s put so many more people behind bars that last year the incarcerated population reached 2.3 million and, for the first time, one in 100 adults was in prison or jail.&quot;<br /><br />Skyrocketing prison populations beget exponential increases in corrections spending, with no corresponding increase in public safety. This explosion in unnecessary spending, on top of a soft economy, is wreaking havoc on state budgets. Unfortunately, it seems that many lawmakers are looking for any fix except the most obvious and necessary reform - that is, repealing the policies that caused the crisis.<br /><br />Some forward-looking states have already begun eliminating the mandatory minimum sentencing laws that cause these problems. Over the past year, New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island have repealed or narrowed their most egregious mandatory sentencing laws. Other states, such as Massachusetts, are debating significant reforms. In Pennsylvania, the legislature directed the state sentencing commission to examine the impact of mandatory minimum laws. The study&#39;s conclusion was that neither the length of the sentence nor the imposition of a mandatory minimum penalty had any impact on recidivism. This finding is consistent with other research which has been unable to verify the purported benefits of mandatory sentences on crime control.<br /><br />Conversely, there is no evidence to suggest that repealing mandatory sentences would lead to an increase in crime. In fact, states that have significantly reformed mandatory minimums, as Michigan did in 1998 and 2003, have not experienced increasing levels of crime. More and more states - notably, both red and blue states - are employing proven alternatives, such as drug courts and risk-based sentencing policies, which are more effective and cost-efficient than lengthy, mandatory sentences, especially when dealing with non-violent drug offenders.<br /><br />Families Against Mandatory Minimums (FAMM) knows well the challenges confronting states with overflowing prison populations. Further, we acknowledge that many prison release programs are designed in ways to protect public safety. Indeed, Mr. Gramlich&#39;s article cited a <a href="http://nccd-crc.issuelab.org/research/listing/accelerated_release_a_literature_review_focus">review</a> by the National Council on Crime and Delinquency of at least 12 prison release studies which found unchanged or lower recidivism rates among early released prisoners. Whether all programs have equally strong safeguards in place is not clear. What is clear, however, is that no matter how well-designed they are, prison release programs will continue to suffer from the impression that they are being employed solely to achieve a targeted level of budget savings.<br /><br />There is a better solution. Repealing mandatory minimum sentencing laws not only saves taxpayers the burden of subsidizing a bloated prison system, but it gives states (and courts) the freedom to choose more effective alternatives to reduce crime.&quot;<br />

		<title>US must give immigration offenders access to counsel and decrease focus on detention</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.karamah.org/bio_azizah.htm">Azizah al-Hibri</a> and <a href="http://www.ffhsj.com/index.cfm?pageID=42&itemID=620">William H. Taft, IV</a> [Liberty and Security Committee Members, <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/">The Constitution Project</a>]: &quot;Imagine your neighbor had been born and raised in Jamaica. Twenty years ago, he moved to the United States to marry an American woman and start a family. Your neighbor has a good job that enables him to support his family. He has had only one minor run-in with the law since moving to the states, a mistake for which he served no jail time but was on probation for twelve months.<br /> <br />Then, one day, his wife calls you in tears and tells you that her husband has been detained by federal immigration officials and sits in a jail three and a half hours from your town. She tells you that he has no idea what law he violated, if any. Without his income, the family can barely afford an attorney to advise them. If they run out of money, they will have to go without an attorney because, unlike in criminal cases, in immigration cases the government does not generally provide legal counsel to people who cannot afford it.<br /> <br />Days and then weeks pass by. Your neighbor finally is scheduled for a hearing but has no idea what to expect. In the meantime, his wife drives the seven-hour roundtrip to visit him every week and his children are distraught. His son, a college freshman, has taken on two jobs to help pay the bills and his 13-year-old daughter has not gone a single day without crying.<br /> <br />You might ask yourself if anything like this could happen here. The sad truth is that a story with those facts and many other similarly distressing tales have been <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/us-immigration-detention-system.php">reported</a> by immigrant advocacy groups.<br /> <br />Last year, the Obama administration determined that the system of immigrant detention needed a major overhaul. And earlier this year, the administration&#39;s head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced plans to reform certain aspects of the system. Some of the long overdue changes promised include improving health care services for detainees and ensuring that families of detainees are able to locate their loved ones in the system.<br /> <br />These are important first steps, but there is so much more that needs to be done. That&#39;s why we joined recently with a bipartisan panel of experts organized by the Constitution Project to issue specific <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/manage/file/359.pdf">recommendations</a> [PDF file] to reform our immigration detention system and promote access to counsel in immigration proceedings.<br /> <br />The number of non-citizens held each day by federal immigration authorities has increased threefold since 1996 due to stricter immigration laws. In addition to the enormous strain this growing practice puts on immigrants and their families, taxpayers are forced to bear the steep economic costs. Alleged immigration offenders like the hypothetical neighbor who pose no threat to public safety or risk of flight could be monitored electronically rather than detained. Alternative monitoring programs cost between $10 and $14 per day compared to an average of $95 a day for detention.<br /> <br />Perhaps the most serious shortcoming in today&#39;s immigration proceedings is the frequent absence of legal counsel for detainees. While non-citizens in removal proceedings have the right to be represented, the government is not obligated to provide counsel if the individual cannot afford it. The American Bar Association recently released a report revealing that 84 percent of immigration detainees do not have the assistance of counsel. The consequences are enormous. A 2007 study by legal scholars found that in asylum cases - in which individuals seek refuge here, on the grounds that they have been victims of abuse in their home countries - whether a noncitizen is represented is the single most important factor affecting the outcome of a case.<br /> <br />The Constitution Project report proposes four categories of recommendations to facilitate access to counsel, including securing government subsidized and pro bono services, as well as protecting the attorney-client relationship (in cases where detainees have managed to obtain counsel) by limiting the transfer of detainees to far away locations. The administration and Congress should work together to review these and other proposals with a goal of ensuring all immigrant detainees have adequate legal counsel. Finally, we urge lawmakers to stop relying so heavily on detention for individuals who are alleged to have violated our immigration laws but who pose no threat to the community and are not likely to flee. Implementing these common-sense recommendations will not only save taxpayers millions of dollars through more sensible enforcement, but also advance America&#39;s commitment to justice for all.&quot;<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Azizah al-Hibri is a professor at the T.C.

		<title>Irish referendum on blasphemy law seeks to remove morality from constitution</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Johanna Higgins</strong> [Barrister, <a href="http://catholiclawyersblog.wordpress.com/">Association of Catholic Lawyers of Ireland</a>]: &quot;Minister Ahern has stated in the past, regarding the <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/ireland-justice-minister-proposes.php">constitutional provision</a> on blasphemy: &quot;As a republican, my personal position is that Church and State should be separate. But I do not have the luxury of ignoring our Constitution.&quot; This then begs the question on what philosophy of law does Minister Ahern seek to rest his envisioned Constitution?<br /><br />The moral code on which the Irish system is presently based is Catholic. Of that one need look no further that the preamble to the Irish Constitution, as written by Taoiseach Eamon De Valera, to be persuaded:<br /><br />&quot;In the Name of the most Holy Trinity, from Whom is all authority and to Whom, as our final end, all actions both of men and States must be referred, We, the people of Eire, Humbly acknowledging all our obligations to our Divine Lord Jesus Christ, Who sustained our fathers through centuries of trial....&quot;<br /><br />The requirement in the Constitution that blasphemy &quot;shall be punishable&quot; is part and parcel of the jurisprudential framework of the Irish State. One cannot simply remove parts of the Constitution at will, blind as to the actual effect this will have on society and the function of the law.  Simply put, if one believes that murder is wrong because it offends against God&#39;s law, what happens to that belief if God is effectively removed from the law, so to speak, and nothing is holding up the legal system in His place?<br /><br />Lord Patrick Devlin stated &quot;A State which refuses to enforce Christian beliefs has lost the right to enforce Christian morals.&quot; The crime of blasphemy is a cornerstone in the Christian legal system, which is precisely why some wish for its removal. However if they succeed the State will have to justify the criminal law and the punishments it hands down in some way other than by morality.&quot;]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/about_us/staff/eviatar_d.aspx">Daphne Eviatar</a> [Senior Associate, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/index.aspx">Human Rights First</a>]: &quot;There may be no better example of why so-called &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques&quot; are a bad idea than the case of Mohamedou Ould Slahi, who a judge on Monday ordered <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/federal-judge-orders-release-of.php">released</a> after seven years in US custody.<br /><br />Prosecutors once insisted that Slahi <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,589769,00.html">was</a> &quot;the highest value detainee at Guantanamo Bay,&quot; a key al-Qaeda leader involved in plotting the 9/11 terrorist attacks and deserving of the death penalty. <br /><br />Critics are already <a href="http:/www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2010/03/24/2010-03-24_keep_the_cell_door_shut.html">chiding</a> the federal court judge for granting Slahi&#39;s petition for habeas corpus and using it to argue the merits of military commissions rather than civilian trials for suspected terrorists.<br /><br />But the government had already tried and failed to prosecute Slahi in a military commission for what&#39;s likely the same reason Judge Robinson ordered him freed:  Slahi was tortured in US custody.<br /><br />US District Judge James Robinson&#39;s order was filed under seal and an unclassified version is not yet available. But Slahi&#39;s lawyers argued to the court that his torture tainted his confession. The judge appears to have determined that any other evidence against him was equally unreliable or insufficient. <br /><br />Lt. Col. Stuart Couch, the military commission prosecutor assigned to Slahi&#39;s case, came to exactly that conclusion six years ago. Reviewing the classified evidence in the case, Couch <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB117529704337355155.html">concluded</a> that Slahi, who turned himself in for questioning in Mauritania before being transferred to Jordan, Afghanistan and finally Guantanamo Bay, had been mentally and physically tortured in order to induce a confession. In addition to threatening Slahi&#39;s life, Couch said in an interview last year, US interrogators threatened to bring his mother to the Guantanamo Bay prison camp, where, they implied, she would be gang-raped. To Couch, &quot;that was just over the top. For lack of a better term, that&#39;s just un-American.&quot;<br /><br />Couch resigned from the case in protest. <br /><br />Setting aside any moral concerns about treating a suspect this way, the problem with confessions elicited by torture is that, as top interrogators and intelligence officials have concluded repeatedly, they&#39;re simply <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/media/etn/2008/alert/313/">unreliable</a>.<br /><br />David Boren, the former Senator from Oklahoma, has <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/03/29/100329crbo_books_mayer?currentPage=2">said</a> that after receiving a classified briefing from CIA director Michael Hayden on the agency&#39;s &quot;enhanced&quot; tactics, &quot;I left the briefing by General Hayden completely unconvinced that the use of torture is an effective means of interrogation...Those who are being tortured will say anything.&quot;<br /><br />As Lt. Col. Couch, Slahi&#39;s would-be prosecutor, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/now/shows/536/guantanamo-justice.html">said</a> in an interview last year: &quot;If these techniques are being used to get evidence here at Guantanamo, then we have a problem with the evidence in some of our cases.&quot;<br /><br />That problem has now come to a head. More than 180 detainees remain imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay without charge, many after having been incarcerated for more than seven years. In 34 of 45 cases, independent federal judges, some of whom were appointed by President George W. Bush, have determined that the government lacks sufficient evidence to justify continuing to imprison the men. At least one other military commission case &#8212; the case of Mohammed al-Qatani -  had to be dropped altogether because the suspect had been tortured.  In another case, the suspect&#39;s statements were all suppressed for the same reason. His petition for release was granted.<br /><br />Some will <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/daphne-eviatar/march-madness-strikes-the_b_508681.htmloe=UTF-8&startIndex=&startPage=1">argue</a> that these judicial rulings, by both civilian and military judges, are the reason the United States needs to pass a new law authorizing indefinite detention of terrorist suspects without charge or trial.<br /><br />Couch would disagree. What he learned from the Slahi case, he says, is that &quot;we cannot compromise our respect for the dignity of every human being...It&#39;s a slippery slope if in the name of national security we decide to compromise that.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;If we compromise that,&quot; he continued, &quot;then Al Qaeda has been able to effect much more of an impact on this country than it has by driving a couple of airplanes into the World Trade Center or by crashing one into the Pentagon. Because they&#39;ve torn at the very fabric of who we are as Americans.&quot;<br />

Last month, Vice-President Joe Biden visited Israel to bolster peace negotiations with the Palestinians.  To shore up Israeli support, he told Prime Minister Netanyahu that the US had an 'absolute, total, unvarnished commitment to Israel's security'.  He did not expect that on the very same day, Israel's Interior Minister would announce that a decision had been made to construct 1,600 new housing units that would almost double the size of Ramat Shlomo, an ultra-Orthodox settlement in East Jerusalem.  The expansion of the settlement, which is contrary to international law, killed off the proximity talks with President Abbas which were supposed to have begun in earnest that week.  Biden reportedly left Israel embarrassed and angry.  The rift was not healed when Netanyahu arrived in Washington later that month to speak at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC).  The White House imposed a news blackout on the meeting between Netanyahu and Obama. There was no picture of the two men together and no press statement by the White House as is customary on such occasions.<br /><br />The Obama administration is on solid ground in its confrontation with the Israeli government over its refusal to stop constructing settlements in East Jerusalem morally, legally, and politically.  It has been long-standing US foreign policy to oppose Israel's attempts to alter the facts on the ground by constructing settlements in the occupied territories in an attempt to alter its ethnic and demographic composition.  Jerusalem is also home to the Holy Places which are of special significance to the three monotheistic religions.  This is why various attempts were made in the past to internationalise the city, to diffuse religious and racial tensions, by having it administered by a third party.  However, Israel has historically been opposed to plans to internationalise the city because it views Jerusalem as its 'eternal and undivided capital', although this has never been recognised by any other country, and for that reason they locate their embassies in Tel Aviv.  Moreover, the eastern part of the city is considered occupied territory, which means it has a distinct and special status under international law.  It is a cardinal rule of international humanitarian law that sovereignty does not pass to the occupying power which only has a right of temporary administration over the territory.  No state has recognised Israel's annexation of the eastern half of the city, where the Holy Places are located, and which has been condemned as 'null and void' by the UN Security Council.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Disputed or Occupied Territory?</span><br /><br />Israel has employed a number of arguments, both legal and political, to justify its four decades long policy of constructing settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories.  These arguments all relate to the legal status of the territory that was occupied by Israel in 1967.  Under international law when territory is captured in an armed conflict, it is placed under belligerent occupation, regardless of whether the conflict which preceded it was lawful or not.  One often comes across the argument that the territories are 'disputed' rather than 'occupied'.  Beyond the realm of propaganda, this argument is disingenuous since the Israeli government has in practice always treated the territories as occupied as has Israel's Supreme Court in a number of rulings.  This is why Israel uses military orders to channel Israeli legislation into the occupied territories for the benefit of the settlers, why the Supreme Court considers the norms of belligerent occupation in its assessment of government policy regarding 'targeted killings', its construction of the barrier, and the application of legislation from workers rights to human rights.  The only issue that Israel contests is the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949. It disputes that the Convention applies in its entirety to the occupied territories, a view no one outside Israel accepts, and which does not affect the status of the territory as occupied.  Israel has never contested the application of the Hague Regulations of 1907 concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land which applies to occupied territory.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">The Position under International Law</span> <br /><br />Article 49 (6) of the Fourth Geneva Convention provides that: 'The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies'.  The authoritative commentary of this convention prepared by the International Committee of the Red Cross states that this prohibition was adopted to prohibit the colonization of occupied territories. It does not distinguish between forcible and non-forcible population transfers and prohibits any and all population transfers from the occupying power to occupied territory.  On 9 June 2004, the International Court of Justice ruled unanimously in an advisory opinion that the Fourth Geneva Convention was applicable to the occupied Palestinian territories and that Israeli settlements there are illegal.  This included the opinion of Thomas Buergenthal, the US judge at the International Court and who, whilst exercising his discretion to refrain from hearing the case, concurred with the Court's finding on the illegality of Israeli settlements. <br /><br />It should be noted that the Israeli government was aware even before it began settling its population in the West Bank in the 1970s that its settlements policy would be illegal.  Theodor Meron, a former judge at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and presently Professor of Law at New York University's School of Law, made this clear in a legal memorandum he wrote when he was the legal adviser to Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  'My conclusion,' he advised the Israeli Government on 18 September 1967, 'is that civilian settlement in the administered territories contravenes explicit provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention'.  An authoritative English translation of the declassified legal advice is currently <a href="http://www.soas.ac.uk/lawpeacemideast/resources/file48485.pdf">available online</a> at the website of the Sir Joseph Hotung Project in Law, Human Rights, and Peace Building in the Middle East at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London. <br /><br />In 1978, Herbert J Hansell, the US State Department's Legal Adviser concurred with Meron's reasoning by reaching the same conclusion:  Israeli civilian settlement activity in occupied territory is contrary to international law because it breaches Article 49 (6) of the Fourth Geneva Convention 1949.  In addition to this legal advice there were a score of UN Security Council resolutions passed in the late 1970s and early 80s condemning Israeli settlement activity.  When former President George H. W. Bush was Ambassador to the United Nations in 1971 he expressed his regret that Israel had failed to abide by its obligations to refrain from constructing settlements which he said were, and I quote, 'contrary to the letter and spirit of the fourth Geneva Convention'.  It has recently been reported
that the US government may abstain from voting on any draft resolution presented to the Security Council condemning Israeli settlement activity should the disagreement with Israel over the settlements in Jerusalem remain unresolved.<br /> <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">The Missing Reversioner Thesis</span><br /><br />In December 2009,  Danny Ayalon, Israel's Deputy Foreign Minister, published an article in <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> in which he claimed that the occupied territories are not occupied but rather 'disputed' because the Palestinians 'had not attained recognised sovereignty before Israel's conquest'.   The argument that the Palestinian Arabs had not attained sovereignty after the Britain relinquished its mandate and before Israel's conquest in 1948-9 is highly questionable.  This is because upon the termination of the mandate sovereignty vested in the population of Palestine as of 15 May 1948 as a whole.  The majority of Palestine's inhabitants on that date viewed themselves as belonging to Palestine's Arab community to whom sovereignty would vest.  The demography of Palestine would vastly change after the war, but an unlawful conquest is no basis to deny them sovereignty to this day.  Moreover, Ayalon's argument is self-defeating because prior to Israel's conquest of Palestine in 1948-9, no state had recognised Jewish sovereignty over Palestine.  As regards the application of the Fourth Geneva Convention, Ayalon advanced the argument that Israel has better title to the West Bank because no one else had a stronger claim to sovereignty over it (apart from the Palestinian Arabs of course) after Britain relinquished its mandate over Palestine on 15 May.  This argument has been referred to by legal scholars who have adopted it as 'the missing reversioner thesis'.  It was expounded in a number of legal articles published in Israel and the United States in the 1970s which included an article published by Meir Shamgar, who was then Israel's Attorney-General.  The 'missing reversioner' argument was expressly rejected by the ICJ in the Wall advisory opinion. The ICJ ruled that the Convention applies to any armed conflict between High Contracting Parties and that it was irrelevant whether or not territory occupied during that conflict was under their sovereignty.  Judge Buergenthal expressly concurred with the opinion of the majority in his separate opinion on this point.  This conclusion is also foreshadowed by the Meron opinion, which noted that the international community had rejected Israel's claim that the territories were not occupied.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Eugene Rostow's Argument</span><br /><br />In 1979, Eugene Rostow, who served as Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs under President Lyndon B. Johnson and who was once Dean of Yale Law School. published a paper in the Yale Studies in World Public Order in which he invoked the history of the British Mandate of Palestine to support Israeli claims to sovereignty over the whole of the Holy Land including the West Bank and Gaza.  He attacked the US State Department's advice on the illegality of Israeli settlements and reached the rather strange opinion that, 'Jewish rights of immigration and close settlement in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, established by the [British] Mandate, have never been qualified'.<br /><br />The argument advanced by Rostow is at variance with British law and state practice in the mandatory era which I am familiar with as I wrote a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Coexistence-Conquest-International-Origins-Arab-Isra/dp/0745325785/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1243641024&sr=1-1">400-page book</a> on it.  This is because on 15 May 1948, the British Mandate was legally terminated by the British authorities in Palestine and Westminster.  One cannot rely on an international instrument which no longer exists.  Moreover, Jewish rights to settle in Palestine during the mandate were always subject to restrictions from immigration, to land usage, to the political rights of the indigenous Arab population.  This was implicit from the terms of the mandate and from the safeguard clauses in the Balfour Declaration protecting the civil and religious rights of the non-Jewish community.  Moreover, throughout the mandatory years the British government proposed several Partition Plans that envisaged the creation of an independent Arab state in Palestine.  Thus the right of the Palestine Arabs to self-determination and to establish an independent state of their own in Palestine was explicitly recognised even during the mandate era.  Continued Jewish settlement in the West Bank conflicts with the right of the Palestinians to self-determination which has since been recognised in numerous international instruments and resolutions.  In its 2004 opinion the ICJ referred to the Palestinian people's right of self-determination as an obligation erga omnes.   It is therefore incumbent on the international community to see to it that all efforts are made to secure a democratic, independent, and viable Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with Israel.  This can only emerge once Israel relinquishes control over the occupied territories and ceases settlement activity.<br /> <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"><br />Concluding Remarks</span><br /><br />In 1947, the United Kingdom turned over the future destiny of Palestine to the United Nations which voted in favour of the Partition Plan that sought to create a Jewish state and an Arab state in Palestine. Jerusalem was to be placed under some form of international administration as a <span style="font-style:italic;">corpus separatum</span>.  Israel accepted that Plan, which is mentioned in its Declaration of Independence.  It was also on the basis of Israel's acceptance of that Plan that many states afforded it recognition in 1948-49.   Thus they did not recognise Israeli claims to Jerusalem or to those areas which had been assigned to the Arab state in that Plan.  The Arab states opposed the UN Plan because they thought that it was unfair to the Palestinian Arabs who in 1948 still formed a majority of the population and owned most of the land.   After several Arab-Israeli wars, including the June 1967 War, when Israel occupied East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip, the Palestinians have come to accept that Israel is an accomplished fact.  In 1993, Yasser Arafat recognised the state of Israel, in the hope that Israel might one day reciprocate and recognise the right of his people to an independent homeland as well.  This has yet to happen.  In 2002, the Arab League&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;comprised of 22 member states including Egypt and Jordan who have already made peace with Israel&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;offered full normality and diplomatic relations with Israel if it would withdraw from the territories it occupied in 1967, cease settlement activity, and allow the Palestinian to create an independent state.  Israel spurned the offer.  Instead the party political platform of the Likud that Netanyahu chairs is totally uncompromising.  'The Government of Israel', the <a href="http://www.knesset.gov.il/elections/knesset15/elikud_m.htm">Platform</a> dictates, 'flatly rejects the establishment of a Palestinian Arab state west of the Jordan river'.  On the question of settlements, the Platform states that 'the Likud will continue to strengthen and develop' them, thus further diminishing the prospects for peace in the Middle East.<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Victor Kattan is a Teaching Fellow at the Centre for International Studies and Diplomacy at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London.

Signatories also cautioned against using a system of indefinite detention to hold suspects without charge or trial. These efforts were particularly timely given recent debate on these issues and pending legislation that could force the administration to pursue prosecutions of terrorism suspects only in military commissions. <br /><br />For far too long, the national debate around how and where to try suspected terrorists now held at Guantanamo has been incorrectly framed as a partisan dispute. It is simply wrong to believe that the national security debate has to pit Democrats against Republicans, and conservatives against progressives. Beyond Guantanamo is an example of policy experts from across the political spectrum who have come together to support federal court prosecutions for suspected terrorists and to oppose any policy of indefinite detention without charge. <br /><br />The range of voices that Beyond Guantanamo represents is vast, with former members of Congress, diplomats, federal judges and prosecutors, high-level military and government officials, as well as national security and foreign policy experts, bar leaders, and family members of 9/11 victims having joined the Declaration. At the conclusion of the day's events, we asked a few of our participants to summarize their thoughts about the full day of meetings and activities. <br /><br />From Stephen Abraham, retired Lieutenant Colonel in the U.S. Army Intelligence Corps (Reserves):<blockquote>The choice of trying terrorists in Article III courts or by military commissions is a false choice. This is not a choice between tested and untested forums. Rather, it is a choice between a system of justice that has endured as a light unto the nations for more than 200 years and a process created in haste, borne out of fear. Terrorists seek to weaken our faith in our nation and ultimately ourselves. Affirming our institutions, our laws, and our values is our greatest weapon. Each time we try a terrorist according to our laws, we have won a battle in the struggle against terrorism.</blockquote>From Bruce Einhorn, former federal judge and former Special Prosecutor and Chief of Litigation at the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Special Investigations:<blockquote>I came three thousand miles to urge our elected officials on Capitol Hill to end the unproductive and so far unconstitutional use of military commissions to try alleged terrorists at Guantanamo or wherever such suspects are found or held. For almost nine years, our government has attempted to employ military commissions without success. In case after case, the U.S. Supreme Court has found the Executive Branch rules and congressional legislation that authorized these commissions to be constitutionally defective. During that period, only three trials of alleged terrorist were actually held before military commissions.  In contrast, during that same period, hundreds of such trials have been successfully completed by the federal district courts, and 97% of those prosecutions have resulted in guilty verdicts.   <br /><br />The district courts have a long history of presiding over alleged terrorist cases in a fair and efficient manner, with no violence or security glitches&#39; interfering in the proceedings. Moreover, U.S. Justice Department prosecutors have extensive experience in prosecuting complex cases of terrorism, sabotage, violations of the laws of war, and criminal conspiracy. By contrast, most military prosecutors, while intelligent and industrious, lack the background to handle the unusually challenging and complicated issues associated with the prosecution of alleged Al Qaeda operatives and their terrorist allies.  <br /><br />It is time to stop offending our Constitution and stop wasting taxpayer money on a military commission system that has not worked. I again urge our senators and congresspersons to utilize the finest and most respected civilian court system in the world, which has functioned with minimal revisions and maximum fairness since its inception in 1789.</blockquote>From Don Guter, retired Rear Admiral in the U.S. Navy: <blockquote>These guys are not warriors. They are thugs and they deserve to be treated like any other common criminal, not as legitimate soldiers. Our federal civilian courts have a proven track record of delivering the swift and sure justice that Americans expect and deserve. Attorney General Holder made clear that federal courts are [the] best venue to prosecute these cases and the administration should not waiver in its determination to do so.</blockquote>From Donna Marsh O'Connor, member of September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows:<blockquote>September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrow is proud to partner with the Constitution Project as it works on the Beyond Guantanamo campaign. Knowing that we are surrounded by thoughtful and knowledgeable Americans (distinguished constitutional attorneys, military figures, and leaders of our nation from both sides of the political aisle) makes those of us who lost loved ones and continue to trust in the American rule of law feel supported, validated and energized. In our common goals we believe we will prevail. We support the closure of Guantanamo Bay, the end of indefinite detention and torture and we will work to dignify through its use the United States Constitution and the good citizens of the United States.</blockquote>From Richard Rossman, former U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan and former Chief of Staff for the Criminal Division at the U.S. Department of Justice:<blockquote>Our American values are based upon equal justice, not making up new rules whenever we are afraid. For over 200 hundred years, our Constitution and our form of justice have served our country quite well. We have, however, strayed from these concepts since 9/11.    <br /><br />We need to get back to our basics. Except for the battlefield combatant captured in a war zone, those persons who commit wrongs against the citizens of the United States should be brought to justice in our federal criminal courts. Guantanamo should be closed immediately and not just moved to Illinois. Those persons who are detained in Guantanamo and anywhere else the military is holding alleged terrorists should be charged with wrongdoing in Article III Courts or released. Until this happens, we will not truly be a nation of 'Equal Justice Under Law.'</blockquote>As recent headlines demonstrate, it is far from clear whether Attorney General Holder&#39;s decision last November to try five of the 9/11 suspects in federal courts will be overturned. Last month, however, the Constitution Project was proud to enable so many individuals with so much authority and expertise to make their voices heard in support of the Attorney General&#39;s original decision. We hope Congr
ess and the White House will listen.<br /><br /><em>Virginia Sloan is the president and founder of the <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/default.asp">Constitution Project</a></em>.<br />

Among other requirements, the House bill would require the President to notify members of Congress about certain intelligence developments. The Senate bill would go further and require every member of the intelligence committees to be informed of the "main features" of certain intelligence activity. In addition, provisions in both bills would amend current law to allow the General Accounting Office to conduct intelligence oversight, by allowing any Congressional committee with some jurisdiction over an intelligence program to request a GAO review. <br /><br />The White House has announced its opposition to these proposals. On March 15, 2010, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Peter Orszag, wrote the chairs of the Congressional intelligence committees to explain that the notification provisions, the GAO provisions, and the provisions concerning funding for the National Intelligence Program were problematic from the administration's perspective. Indeed, Orszag went so far as to suggest that President's senior advisers would recommend that he veto any bill containing these provisions. <br /><br />At least in respect to the notification and GAO provisions, what the administration seems to oppose is any change in the relationship between the President and Congress in respect to the latter's supervision of the work of the intelligence community. Currently, Congress is informed by proxy of significant intelligence activity &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; the President limits notification to senior leaders from both parties on the intelligence committees. In the administration's view, the bills encroach upon "the President's responsibility to protect sensitive national security information," according to the Conference Letter prepared by the Office of Management and Budget. <br /><br />Similarly, the administration argues that the GAO provisions would provide the GAO unprecedented authority. Currently, the intelligence community and the GAO have operated without any formal guidelines to govern their relationship. The administration fears that express GAO authority to engage in intelligence oversight would "alter the long-standing relationship and information flow between the [intelligence community] and intelligence committee members and staff," as the Conference Letter argues, and &quot;undermine the ability of the committees to contribute to improving the quality of intelligence operations through interaction with "a cadre of knowledgeable and experienced staff." <br /><br />The administration's qualms with these Congressional proposals miss the mark. Neither the notification procedures nor the GAO provisions would undermine the relationship between the Congressional intelligence committees and the intelligence community. Neither proposal would compel the executive to disclose any sensitive national security information. Rather, these proposals would simply enhance the ability of members of Congress to be informed about the nation's intelligence activities and, if necessary, to review those activities through GAO oversight that appear suspect. What the administration fears, in the end, appears to be a Congress that is better-informed and capable of acting more quickly to investigate executive actions in the area of national security.  <br /><br />Some might suggest Congress is simply operationalizing its constitutional obligation to keep the executive in check.  There is no question that the textual allocations of national security authority in the Constitution are divided between both the executive and Congress.  The Supreme Court, when called upon to determine where the line should be drawn between the executive and Congress on matters of national security, has held that the Constitution favors active political checks and balances.  (See <em>Youngstown Sheet and Tube Co. v. Sawyer</em>, <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em>, <em>Medellin v. Texas</em>).  <br /><br />Congress's effort through the authorization acts to gain greater oversight of certain intelligence actions is a clear example of a bi-partisan effort to exercise its shared constitutional responsibilities. One only has to look back a few years to see what can happen when Congress abdicates this responsibility.  The intelligence oversight regime in effect back in 2005, which the Obama administration wants to preserve, is a regime that allowed the executive to engage in a multi-year warrantless domestic surveillance program.  The full scope and details of this program remain unclear even to this day.  It is noteworthy that the oversight &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; or lack thereof &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; kept members of Congress in the dark about the very existence of the program until the story broke in the <em>New York Times</em> in December 2005. It was several years after the fact and only after a great deal of legislative effort that Congress was able to exercise some form of regulation and oversight in this area. With the kind of freedom of action that the current oversight regime allows the President, it is small wonder that the Obama administration would be opposed to any change. <br /><br />This is not an instance in which Congress should defer to the executive or to the intelligence community. Our constitutional structure is premised on the belief of the framers that each of the political branches of government should serve as a check on the excesses of the other, and should push back when the other branch pushes too far.  The oversight mechanisms envisioned under the Intelligence Authorization Acts are precisely the kinds of programs that would allow Congress to exercise these constitutional responsibilities.  This is not a partisan issue; Congress should not bow to the threat of a presidential veto.  These changes should be preserved in the proposed legislation, and Congress should fulfill its constitutional obligations.   <br /><br /><br /><em>Victor Hansen teaches criminal law and criminal procedure and Lawrence Friedman teaches constitutional law and state constitutional law at New England Law | Boston.

		<title>Court-martial: A Third Option for Trying Al Qaeda and Taliban Detainees</title>

Although there has been a great deal of attention to the Obama Administration's alleged choice between a federal district court and a suspect military commission, there has been no noticeable public discussion of the third forum for federal prosecution of members of al Qaeda and the Taliban and its advantages over military commissions &#8212; a military court-martial.<br /><br /> Clearly, trial in a federal district court can be useful for prosecution under various extraterritorial federal laws, such as those that cover murder of U.S. nationals abroad, attempts or conspiracy to kill a U.S. national, and serious bodily injury to a U.S. national under the Antiterrorism Act; anti-hijacking legislation; aircraft sabotage legislation; and any of the federal laws that formed the basis for the indictment in absentia of bin Laden in 2000 in the Southern District of New York.  Federal district courts can also be used to prosecute offenses against the laws of war under two sets of federal legislation (1) 10 U.S.C. &Acirc;&#167; 818 (which the Supreme Court has recognized with respect to similar language in its predecessor has incorporated all of the laws of war by reference as offenses against the laws of the United States) coupled with 18 U.S.C. &Acirc;&#167; 3231 (which assures federal district court jurisdiction over all offenses against the laws of the United States), and (2) the War Crimes Act (which merely incorporates some law of war offenses).<br /><br /> Clearly also, prosecution in federal district courts would allow the United States to comply with a number of U.S. obligations under customary and treaty-based international law that the President has a constitutionally-based duty to faithfully execute and that the Supreme Court has already recognized in <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em> are required under international law, including the need for use of at least minimal due process guarantees under human rights law and applicable laws of war in order to have a fair trial.  Fair trials would also serve short and long-term U.S. foreign policy interests and serve fundamental American values that must not be thrown aside.<br />  <br /> Federal district court prosecutions would also allow U.S. nationals to avoid criminal and civil liability here and abroad for violations of international law that can pertain with respect to use of present military commissions.  It is important to recall in this regard that Article 23(h) in the annex to the 1907 Hague Convention No. IV Respecting the Laws and Customs of War recognizes the customary and treaty-based war crime of declaring "abolished, suspended, or inadmissible in a court of law the rights and actions of the nationals of the hostile party."  Why would the Obama Administration want to set up possible war crime responsibility for military commission judges, military and civilian judges who might review military commission proceedings, and certain members of Congress who had the relevant mens rea when creating the Military Commissions Act?  Since international law is a two-way street and can shift with changing patterns of practice and opinio juris, why would the Administration potentially place our soldiers and civilians in harm's way by approving use of military commissions that simply cannot meet present human rights and law of war standards and might simply be copied in Syria, Iran, or some other country that might obtain jurisdiction over a U.S. national in the future?<br /><br /> As <a href="http://ssrn.com/abstract=1547364">documented</a> in an Amicus Brief of the Human Rights Committee of the American Branch of the International Law Association before the United States Court of Military Commission Review and a <a href="/forumy/2009/06/obamas-military-commission-and.php">prior JURIST ope-ed</a> a military commission operating under the Military Commissions Act is actually not a lawful alternative.  The military commissions are not "regularly constituted" or "previously established in accordance with pre-existing laws" and are therefore without jurisdiction under relevant international laws.  The military commissions at GTMO are also not constituted within a theatre of war or war-related occupied territory and are therefore without lawful jurisdiction. <br /> <br /> The majority opinion of Justice Stevens in <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em> recognized that common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions "is applicable ... and ... requires that ... [a detainee] be tried by a 'regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees'" recognized under customary international law.  As Justice Stevens noted, Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, among other instruments, sets forth "basic protections" regarding due process.  Justice Stevens also noted that "regularly constituted" courts include "'ordinary military courts' and 'definitely exclud[e] all special tribunals'" and that regularly constituted means "'established and organized in accordance with the laws and procedures already in force.'"  Justice Kennedy confirmed that common Article 3 applies as "binding law," that a "regularly constituted" court "relies upon ... standards deliberated upon and chosen in advance," and that a violation of common Article 3 is a war crime.  Justice Kennedy added: "[t]he regular military courts in our system are the courts-martial" and they "provide the relevant benchmark."<br /><br /> As noted in the Amicus Brief and in my book <em>Beyond the Law</em>, a military commission created <em>post hoc</em> and as a special military tribunal under the Military Commissions Act (which was not "already in force" or "chosen in advance") simply could not meet the "regularly constituted" test and would necessarily violate common Article 3.  The Amicus Brief and my book document why under venerable Supreme Court doctrine Geneva treaty-based law, other treaty law, and customary international law have primacy as law of the United States over subsequent federal legislation such as the MCA.  Even if this was not the result, the type of violations of international law recognized already in <em>Hamdan</em> would still exist, making the United States a law violator, and would subject several of our nationals to possible criminal and civil liability abroad.  Additionally, any tribunal that would only prosecute aliens would necessarily violate bilateral treaties with the state of nationality of the detainees that require equality of treatment, create a "denial of justice" for aliens under customary international law, and violate human rights law (treaty-based and customary) that requires "equality before the law" and "equal protection of the law" as well as the prohibition of national origin discrimination.<br /><br /> The third forum that can provide a lawful alternative in time of war over some members of al Qaeda, certain other civilians, and prisoners of war is a court-martial.  Prior to 2006, 10 U.S.C. &Acirc;&#167; 802(a)(10) (which is within the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)) allowed courts-martial jurisdiction "in time of war" over "persons serving with or accompanying an armed force in the field."  In 2006, the subsection was changed to limit "time of war" to a circumstance of "declared war or a contingency operation."  Perhaps interpr
etation of the statutory phrase "declared war" could be stretched to include a congressionally-authorized war such as those in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the phrase "contingency operation" might be interpreted to reach military operations in those countries.  This would be relevant to the reach of &Acirc;&#167; 802(a)(10) after 2006, but courts-martial would be regularly constituted under previous federal law vis-a-vis members of al Qaeda or the Taliban detained after October 7, 2001 (when the U.S. was at war with the Taliban in Afghanistan) that could reach even farther prior to 2006 &#8212; to "time of war" as such.  Another choice to be made would involve interpretation of the phrase "an armed force."  If it can include a Taliban armed force, some members of al Qaeda could have been serving with or accompanying such an armed force.  Courts-martial also have jurisdiction over prisoners of war under &Acirc;&#167; 802(a)(9) and (13) &#8212; which should include members of the regular armed forces of the Taliban, since membership is the only criterion for pow status under Article 4(A)(1) or (3) of the Geneva Prisoner of War Convention.<br /><br /> There are a panoply of offenses that can be tried in courts-martial under the UCMJ, including violations of the laws of war under &Acirc;&#167; 818 which provides a basis for jurisdiction independent of &Acirc;&#167; 802 with respect to prosecution of "any person who by the law of war is subject to trial by a military tribunal".  With respect to non-prisoners of war who are U.S. or foreign nationals, perhaps <em>Ex parte Milligan</em> (U.S. 1866) and <em>Reid v. Covert</em> (U.S. 1957) can be distinguished if merely violations of the laws of war by "enemies" are prosecuted.  See <em>Reid</em>, 354 U.S. 1, 34 n.61 (1957); see also <em>Ex parte Mudd</em> (milt. comm. 1868) and <em>United States v. Tiede</em> (U.S. Ct. for Berlin 1979, distinguishing several Supreme Court cases). Courts-martial would be regularly constituted by previous law set forth in the UCMJ, would not present the procedural improprieties that can arise in a military commission under the MCA, and are the type of tribunal that can allow prosecution of U.S. as well as foreign nationals and avoid violations of international legal requirements of equality of treatment and equal protection of the laws.<br /><br /><br /><em>Jordan J.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.stcl.edu/faculty-dir/Geoffrey_Corn.htm">Geoffrey S. Corn</a>, Lt. Col. US Army (Ret.), a former Special Assistant to the Judge Advocate General for Law of War Matters and currently a professor at South Texas College of Law, says that no matter how much the military commission system for trying detainees is modified, it will never match the legitimacy of a General Court-Martial...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/geoffreycornnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font> write to offer a brief supplement to Professor Paust's provocative JURIST editorial <a href="/forumy/2010/03/court-martial-third-option-for-trying.php">Court-martial: A Third Option for Trying Al Qaeda and Taliban Detainees</a> (and note that we both trace our roots back to the Army JAG Corps and now find ourselves planted in Houston!).  <br /><br />Like Professor Paust, I also believe that trial by court-martial is a viable alternative to trial by military commission for Guantanamo detainees.  In fact, I vividly recall the day that the Department of Defense announced that it would be creating the original military commissions.  I had just returned from a meeting in Bonn with our German Bundeswher counterparts to discuss cooperative security efforts in response to the threat of terrorism against U.S. forces in Germany.  When my Colonel told me the news, my initial reaction was "why don't we just try them by court-martial?"  I explained to him and others in the office how the UCMJ had always vested General Courts-Martial with jurisdiction over any person who was subject to trial by military tribunal pursuant to the law of war.  I also explained that while the question of whether international terrorism could properly be characterized as violations of the laws and customs of war would be complex, the answer would be dispositive to jurisdiction of either tribunal.  Why, therefore, would it be in the national interest to create a new tribunal instead of relying on the well established General Court-Martial?<br /><br />I was told to draft an extensive memorandum addressing these points that my Colonel submitted to The Judge Advocate General of the Army.  A reply was quickly received: 'thanks for the ideas; already considered and rejected.'  I was perplexed.  Then President Bush issued Military Order #1 creating the military commissions.  That cleared things up quite quickly: the last thing the Administration sought to achieve was a regularly constituted tribunal with meaningful trial procedures, rules of evidence, or appellate process. <br /> <br />Nine years later, much has changed.  Judicial and subsequent legislative interventions have substantially enhanced the legitimacy of the military commissions.  Indeed, these enhancements prevent me from concurring with Professor Paust that the current commissions are fundamentally invalid.  Nonetheless, I continue to believe, as I did from the day the commissions were announced, that trial by General Court-Martial would be a better course of action for any Administration determined to rely on military courts to try these detainees, and I applaud Professor Paust for suggesting this alternative.  In support of his suggestion, I offer this one observation.<br /><br />Professor Paust cites two provisions of the UCMJ as potential sources of jurisdiction over detainees: Article 2(10) and Article 18.  Article 18 defines offenses subject to the jurisdiction of General Courts-Martial.  The first prong of that article relates back to Article 2 of the UCMJ, which defines those individuals who are "subject to the Code."  This simply means that General Courts-Martial have jurisdiction over any person Congress subjects to the proscriptions of the UCMJ in Article 2.  Accordingly, trial pursuant to prong one of Article 18 would be for a violation of the domestic US military code - the UCMJ itself.  In addition, the second prong of Article 18 subjects any person who violates the laws and customs of war to trial by General Courts-Martial.  This jurisdiction is triggered not for a violation of the UCMJ (U.S. law), but for a violation of international law.  Through the second prong of Article 18 Congress has simply provided a forum for adjudicating such violations; the same forum established for adjudicating violations of the domestic military code (the UCMJ).<br /><br />There is a fundamental and critical distinction, however, between these two grants of jurisdiction.  In the first instance, the accused will be tried for violation of U.S. law, and therefore must be subject to that law at the time of the offense.  This is why Article 2 of the UCMJ defines who is in fact "subject to the Code."  In the second, because the accused is tried for a violation of international law, there is no requirement that he or she be "subject to the Code" at the time of the offense.  Article 2 is therefore the conduit that links an individual to the proscriptive jurisdiction of the UCMJ itself. <br /><br />Unsurprisingly, Congress has limited individuals "subject to the Code" to individuals with some link to the U.S. military.  The most obvious category is members of the regular armed forces.  But Article 2 also includes some other interesting categories, such as "persons serving with or accompanying an armed force in the field.&quot;  Civilian who accompany the U.S. armed forces in the field and provide support have always been subject to the U.S. military code, a tradition traced back to the British Articles of War.  When Congress enacted the UCMJ, it continued this tradition through Article 2(10).  This category does not, however, provide a court-martial with jurisdiction to try civilians accompanying an opposition armed force.  These individuals have no connection with the U.S. armed forces prior to capture, and therefore were not intended to fall within this category.  This does not mean Congress is prohibited from extending U.S. law to such individuals for pre-capture misconduct, but that intent must be clear.  There is absolutely no indication Article 2(10) was intended to have such reach.  Instead, there is ample evidence that only civilians supporting the U.S. armed forces fall into this category.  This was reinforced in 2006 when Congress amended the provision to eliminate an implied "declared war" qualifier, a change intended to ensure accountability for civilian contractors, not to provide jurisdiction over enemy civilians.<br /><br />Does this that individuals associated with enemy forces are immune from court-martial jurisdiction?  No.  This is where prong two of Article 18 becomes controlling.  Pursuant to Article 18, there is a critical condition precedent to the exercise of court-martial (and in my view any military) jurisdiction for pre-captured misconduct of a detainee: the U.S. must allege a violation of the laws and customs of war.  This is logical, as there is no issue of the U.S. projecting its law upon individuals not yet connected to the UCMJ.  It is international law &#8212; law that proscribes the conduct of all participants in armed conflict &#8212; that provides the proscriptive jurisdiction applied by the General Court-Martial.<br /><br />Fidelity to the distinction between the two categories of jurisdiction established by Article 18 is essential to future legitimacy.  The UCMJ includes dozens of statutory criminal proscriptions, including offenses it would be absurd to apply to an enemy operative or enemy civilian prior to capture (for example, could such a captive be tried for desertion if he surrenders to U.S. forces?).  Congress did not intend those statutory proscriptions to apply to captured personnel prior to capture (although upon capture they are subject to the UCMJ); instead, it merely provided a regularly constituted and legitimate forum for adjudicating allegations of pre-capture war crimes. <br /> <br />I therefore agree
 with the outcome of Professor Paust's calculation, although I question the ingredients.  One conclusion is, however, without dispute: no matter how much the military commission is modified, it will never match the legitimacy of a General Court-Martial. <br /><br /><br /><em>Geoffrey S.

Although the two courts may be unlikely to look to each other for guidance, the very existence of parallel cases about still unresolved issues speaks volumes.<br /><br />It tells us that the notion of jurisdictional immunity for states is no longer automatic.  It drives us to think about the role of sovereign immunity as a bar to jurisdiction and, more importantly, about the limited recourse victims of atrocities have to find justice through retribution and restitution.  Finally, it spurs us to think about the policy considerations that rarely come to light amid technical discussions of statutory interpretation.<br /><br /><em>Samantar v. Yousef</em> examines whether the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act grants a former Defense Minister of Somalia immunity from suit in U.S. courts for torture and extrajudicial killings.  In <em>Germany v. Italy</em>, the ICJ will consider whether Italian national courts have violated Germany's sovereign immunity by awarding damages to Italian victims of Nazi war crimes.<br /><br />Notwithstanding certain key differences &#8212; human rights violations or war crimes, individual state official or the state itself &#8212; the fundamental issues are decidedly similar.  Does sovereignty immunize a state, or state officials, from accountability for atrocities, whether during armed conflict or during a repressive regime?  Should victims lose the opportunity for redress simply because their oppressor is a state (or wears the cloak of state authority)?<br /><br />Long-standing notions of comity and the desire to avoid one state's courts sitting in judgment on another state's conduct, the traditional justifications for sovereign immunity, are important considerations and worthy of great weight in analyzing how to respond to atrocities committed by states and state officials.<br />  <br />However, history and current events have taught us that the state's capacity to commit atrocities knows no bounds.  In the aftermath of repression and conflict, options for justice and compensation are often limited, if not non-existent.  Germany's provision of billions of dollars in war reparations to Italians and other victims of the Third Reich serves as a model &#8212; but unfortunately one that is rarely followed in modern times.<br /><br />Beyond technical legal questions, therefore, lie broader policy reasons that should not be lost in sophisticated discussions of statutory interpretation and international comity.  In other words, the resolution of these cases will not only provide excellent teaching materials for the next semester of International Law, but can have powerful ramifications both at home and abroad.<br /><br />U.S. and international law prohibitions against torture, war crimes and other atrocities risk becoming meaningless without appropriate mechanisms for accountability.  As we so often hear, victims of atrocities who find refuge here in the United States no longer have such refuge if the very perpetrators of those atrocities are living with impunity, just down the road.<br /><br />But enabling perpetrators to find safe haven here has larger implications as well.  The U.S. and other nations have important military and national security interests in ensuring accountability for atrocities, whether by domestic or foreign perpetrators.  Our military's long tradition of accountability for violations of the laws of war, dating back to the Revolutionary War, for example, reflects our military's tradition of honor and adherence to the law. <br /> <br />More importantly, however, adherence to the law and accountability for abuses protect our military.  First, our troops deployed overseas (and civilians as well) benefit from the protections of the law not only because all countries have obligations to respect the law of war and human rights law, but because reciprocity means that our adherence to the law demands comparable behavior from others.<br /><br />Second, impunity for past abuses is a main ingredient in future abuses, which in turn foster the very instability and chaos that lead the U.S. and other nations to intervene in troubled spots to protect civilians and preserve or restore the rule of law.  Increased accountability can thus protect our troops by helping to reduce the need to deploy them in such circumstances.<br /><br />Debates about sovereign immunity most often center on principles of comity versus principles of victim access to justice.  Let's not forget about broader policy considerations and national security as well while we await the courts' decisions.<br /><br /><br /><em>Laurie R.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.williamgeorgeross.com/">William G. Ross</a> of Cumberland School of Law, Samford University, says recent comments by Chief Justice Roberts responding to President Obama&#39;s criticism of the Supreme Court&#39;s <em>Citizen&#39;s United</em> ruling were not disrespectful toward the institutions of Congress or the presidency or toward any particular person....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forumy/williamrossnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><strong>C</strong></font>hief Justice Roberts' comments last week concerning President Obama's controversial criticism of the Supreme Court's campaign financing decision in his State of the Union address have generated criticism and controversy of their own. Some commentators believe that Roberts expressed excessive sensitivity toward criticism, while others have questioned whether he should have made any remark at all about an essentially political issue. Taken in context, however, Roberts' remarks were appropriate for exactly the same reason that, as I explained in a <a href="/forumy/2010/02/constructive-criticism-presidential.php">JURIST column</a> last month, Obama's criticism of the Court was proper: the remarks of both Obama and Roberts were fair and reasonable and neither threatened judicial independence or integrity, or breached appropriate boundaries involving separation of powers. <br /><br /> Responding to a question from a student during an appearance at the University of Alabama School of Law on Tuesday, Roberts avoided any direct criticism of the President, whom he did not name. His remarks appear have been directed mostly and perhaps solely at the behavior of members of Congress, many of whom stood and cheered in the shadow of the silent and seated Justices after Obama forcefully criticized <em>Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</em>, in which the Court by a five to four vote nullified certain limitations on spending by corporations in political campaigns. <br /><br /> After acknowledging that "anybody can criticize the Supreme Court," Roberts added that "[o]n the other hand, there is the issue of the setting, the circumstances and the decorum." According to Roberts, "[t]he image of having the members of one branch of government standing up, literally surrounding the Supreme Court, cheering and hollering while the Court &#8212; according to the requirements of protocol &#8212; has to sit there expressionless, I think is very troubling." Roberts remarked that "[t]o the extent that it has degenerated into a political pep rally, I'm not sure why we're there" at State of the Union addresses.  <br /><br /> The controversy that Roberts' remarks has generated provides a reminder that judges, especially U.S. Supreme Court justices, need to be very circumspect in their public comments about any subject, particularly public affairs.  Judicial conduct codes, including the Code of Conduct for United States Judges, prohibit judges from making public comment about the merits of any matter pending or impending in any court. Canons in these codes also require judges to uphold the integrity and independence of the judiciary and to avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all activities. These canons imply that a judge should refrain from any public comment that might suggest that they have pre-judged any legal issue, even ones that have not come before their court.  They also imply that judges should steer clear of any political controversy in order to avoid any appearance that their decisions are influenced by partisan considerations.  The <em>Code of Conduct for United States Judges</em> states that while judges "may speak, write, lecture, and teach on both law-related and nonlegal subjects," a judge "should not participate in extrajudicial activities that detract from the dignity of the judge's office" or "reflect adversely on the judge's impartiality." <br /><br /> Roberts did not transgress those standards in his remarks this week. Since he spoke only in response to a question than in a prepared statement, he did not deliberately interject himself into the controversy over Obama's statement about <em>Citizens United</em>. His expressions of irritation did not transgress the bounds of dignity, although they may have teetered on the edge. Just as Obama's remarks about <em>Citizens United</em> did not express any disrespect for the Court as an institution or encourage any extra-constitutional defiance of the Court's decision, Roberts' remarks this week were not disrespectful toward the institutions of Congress or the presidency or toward any particular person. <br /> <br />  Moreover, Roberts said nothing that could have raised questions about his partiality concerning any issue that might come before the Court. Indeed, Roberts firmly refused several times during the question and answer session to respond to queries about issues that the Court adjudicates or might adjudicate, including the scope of the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, and problems arising from the spiraling costs of state judicial election campaigns.<br /><br /> Roberts' appearance this week at the University of Alabama is an example of how Supreme Court justices can educate the public about the judicial process. During recent decades, Justices often have met with students, lawyers, and various civic groups to discuss a multitude of issues and subjects, including methods of constitutional interpretation, the process by which the Court selects and decides cases, and the Court's history. These public appearances have served an important educative function and almost certainly have enhanced public respect for the Court as an institution. <br /><br /> All of the Justices have exhibited appropriate discretion in the vast majority of their public comments. When confronted with questions that would require them to comment on issues that might come before the Court or to speak about sensitive political issues, the Justices usually have not hesitated to decline to comment.<br /><br /> Roberts' musing about whether the Justices should continue to attend State of the Union addresses is an example of the interesting issues that judges can raise when they speak in public, and his doubts about the value of such attendance deserve further consideration. <br /><br /> Ever since President Wilson in 1913 restored the custom of delivering the State of the Union address in person to a joint session of Congress, most members of the Court have attended nearly all of the addresses. The most notable exception occurred in 1937, when none of the Justices attended because they knew or anticipated that President Franklin D. Roosevelt would criticize the Court for its invalidation of New Deal legislation. In our own time, Justice Clarence Thomas has absented himself from State of the Union addresses because he contends that they have become too partisan. Justice Antonin Scalia also has avoided them, as did former Justice David H. Souter. <br /><br /> The State of the Union speech provides a unique opportunity for all three branches of the federal government to come together at one place and at one time. This annual convocation of the nation's principal executive, legislative and judicial officials symbolizes both the unity of the federal government and the separation of its branches. But while there may be good reason to include the Justices in the joint session of Congress, there is no reason why they need to be present.<br /><br /> Indeed, the Constitution seems to pre-suppose their absence. Section 3 of Article II of the Constitution states that the President "shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient." The Framers therefore contemplated that the President's message would be a communicatio
n between the President and Congress rather than any communication to both the Congress and the Court. Although the language of the Constitution should not bar Congress from extending invitations to the Justices to attend the President's address, their attendance definitely is not part of their official constitutional roles or duties. <br /><br /> When legislators invite Justices to attend a joint session of Congress, they should not demonstrate disrespect toward the jurists. Although Obama properly used the "bully pulpit" of his State of the Union address to call attention to his objections to a very important judicial decision and to encourage Congress to enact legislation to ameliorate some of its effects, members of Congress did not need to pop out of their seats and erupt into applause in the presence of six Justices, including several who voted to strike down the campaign finance provisions. It is understandable that Roberts did not welcome the boisterous "pep rally" that Obama's remarks provoked among members of Congress.<br /><br /> Since presidents rarely criticize Supreme Court decisions in their State of the Union addresses, there is little reason for Roberts or other Justices to fear that they will suffer again any time soon the discomfort that they may have experienced during this year's State of the Union address. Indeed, their absence from next year's address in the wake of this year's controversy could suggest that they were unduly sensitive toward criticism or stir rumors that they bore some kind of animosity against Obama. Let's therefore hope that Roberts and some Associate Justices attend the State of the Union address again at least one more time. <br /><br /> <br /><em>William G.

		<title>Arizona Legalizes Racial Profiling</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.tjsl.edu/faculty_m_cohn">Marjorie Cohn</a> of Thomas Jefferson School of Law says that Arizona's new immigration legislation - requiring law enforcement officers to stop everyone whom they have "reasonable suspicion" to believe is an undocumented immigrant and arrest them if they fail to produce their papers - demeans us all by effectively legalizing racial profiling...<br />
<hr size=1><br />
<table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forumy/cohncolor.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img SRC="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img SRC="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>T</b></font>he conservative "states' rights" mantra sweeping our country has led to one of the most egregious wrongs in recent U.S. history. New legislation in Arizona requires law enforcement officers to stop everyone whom they have "reasonable suspicion" to believe is an undocumented immigrant and arrest them if they fail to produce their papers. What constitutes "reasonable suspicion"? When asked what an undocumented person looks like, Arizona Governor Jan Brewer, who signed SB 1070 into law last week, said, "I don't know what an undocumented person looks like." The bill does not prohibit police from relying on race or ethnicity in deciding who to stop. It is unlikely that officers will detain Irish or German immigrants to check their documents. This law unconstitutionally criminalizes "walking while brown" in Arizona.</p>

<p>Former Arizona attorney general Grant Woods explained to Brewer that SB 1070 would vest too much discretion in the state police and lead to racial profiling and expensive legal fees for the state. But the governor evidently succumbed to racist pressure as she faces a reelection campaign. Woods said, "[Brewer] really felt that the majority of Arizonans fall on the side of, 'Let's solve the problem and not worry about the Constitution.'" The polls Brewer apparently relied on, however, employed questionable methodology and were conducted before heavy media coverage of the controversial legislation. No Democrats and all but one Republican Arizona legislator voted for SB 1070.</p>

<p>Undocumented immigrants in Arizona now face six months in jail and a $500 fine for the first offense - misdemeanor trespass - and an additional $1,000 fine for the second offense, which becomes a felony.</p>

<p>By establishing a separate state crime for anyone who violates federal immigration law, the new Arizona law contravenes the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, which grants the federal government exclusive power to regulate U.S. borders.</p>

<p>SB 1070 creates a cause of action for any person to sue a city, town or county if he or she feels the police are not stopping enough undocumented immigrants. Even if a municipality is innocent, it will still be forced to rack up exorbitant legal fees to defend itself against frivolous lawsuits.</p>

<p>The bill also makes it a misdemeanor to attempt to hire or pick up day laborers to work at a different location if the driver impedes the normal flow of traffic, albeit briefly. How many New York taxi drivers impede the flow of traffic when they pick up fares? The law also criminalizes the solicitation of work by an undocumented immigrant in a public place, who gestures or nods to a would-be employer passing by. This part of the legislation is also unconstitutional as courts have held that the solicitation of work is protected speech under the First Amendment.</p>

<p>The new law effectively compels Arizona police to make immigration enforcement their top priority. Indeed several law enforcement groups oppose SB 1070. The Law Enforcement Engagement Initiative, an organization of police officials who favor federal immigration reform, condemned the law, saying it would probably result in racial profiling and threaten public safety because undocumented people would hesitate to come forward and report crimes or cooperate with police for fear of being deported. The Arizona Association of Chiefs of Police also criticized the legislation, saying it will "negatively affect the ability of law enforcement agencies across the state to fulfill their many responsibilities in a timely manner;" the group believes the immigration issue is best addressed at the federal level.</p>

<p>Many civil rights and faith-based organizations also oppose SB 1070.<br />
The Mexican American Legal Defense & Educational Fund (MALDEF) called the law "tantamount to a declaration of secession." The National Coalition of Latino Clergy and Christian Leaders Legal Defense Fund - which represents 30,000 evangelical churches nationwide - as well as MALDEF, the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON), and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), are preparing federal lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of SB 1070.</p>

<p>Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles called the ability of officials to demand documents akin to "Nazism."  Former Arizona Senate majority leader Alfredo Gutierrez said, "This is the most oppressive piece of legislation since the Japanese internment camp act" during World War II. Representative Raul M. Grijalva (Dem.-AZ) called for a convention boycott of Arizona. The American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) complied. AILA is moving its fall 2010 conference, scheduled for Arizona, to another state.</p>

<p>Even though SB 1070 will not take effect for at least 90 days, undocumented immigrants in Arizona are terrorized by the new law. A man in Mesa, Arizona looked around nervously as he stood on a street corner waiting for work. "We shop in their stores, we clean their yards, but they want us out and the police will be on us," Eric Ramirez told the New York Times.</p>

<p>Ironically, expelling unauthorized immigrants from Arizona would be costly. The Perryman Group calculated that Arizona would lose $26.4 billion in economic activity, $11.7 billion in gross state product, and approximately 140,324 jobs if all undocumented people were removed from the state.</p>

<p>"This bill does nothing to address human smuggling, the drug cartels, the arms smuggling," according to Democratic Senator Rebecca Rios.</p>

<p>"And, yes, I believe it will create somewhat of a police state," she added. "Police in Arizona already treat migrants worse than animals," said Francisco Loureiro, an immigration activist who runs a shelter in Nogales, Mexico. "There is already a hunt for migrants, and now it will be open season under the cover of a law."</p>

<p>SB 1070 is the latest, albeit one of the worst, racist attacks on undocumented immigrants. The federal program called 287(g) allows certain state and local law enforcement agencies to engage in federal immigration enforcement activities. But a report released earlier this month by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General found a lack of oversight and training without adequate safeguards against racial profiling.</p>

<p>We can expect SB 1070 to be replicated around the country as the ugly wave of immigrant-bashing continues. Lawmakers from four other states have sought advice from Michael Hethmon, general counsel for the Immigration Reform Law Institute, who helped draft the Arizona law.</p>

<p>"SB 1070 is tearing our state into two," said Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon, who called the bill "bitter, small-minded and full of hate."</p>

<p>He thinks "it humiliates us in the eyes of America and threatens our economic recovery."  More than 50,000 people signed petitions opposing SB 1070 and 2,500 students from high schools across Phoenix walked out of school and marched to the state Capitol to protest the bill before it passed. On Sunday, about 3,500 people gathered at the Capitol, chanting, "Yes we can," "We have rights," and "We are human."</p>

<p>President Obama criticized SB 1070 as "misguided," saying it will "undermine basic notions of fairness that we cherish as Americans, as well as the trust between police and our communities that is so crucial to keeping us safe." He called on Congress to enact federal immigration reform.</p>

<p>But Isabel Garcia, co-chair of the Coalition of Human Rights in Tucson, told <i>Democracy Now!</i> that there have been more deportations under the Obama administration than in any other administration. "This administration continues to follow the flawed concept that migration is somehow a law enforcement or national security issue," she noted.</p>

<p>"And it is not. It is an economic, social, political phenomenon." She mentioned that NAFTA has displaced millions of workers in Mexico who flood into the United States.</p>

<p>Instead of expressing gratitude for the back-breaking work migrant laborers contribute to our society, there is an increasingly virulent strain of racism that targets non-citizens. Republican lawmakers are joining together to oppose federal immigration reform, opting instead for a "states rights" approach where each state is free to enact its own racist law.</p>

<p>Let us join the voices of compassion and oppose the mean-spirited actions that aim to scapegoat immigrants. Laws like SB 1070 demean us all.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.tuckerlaw.com/att/alpha/T/tupi_bradley.html">Brad Tupi</a> [Allied attorney, <a href="http://www.alliancedefensefund.org/main/default.aspx">Alliance Defense Fund</a>]: &quot;<a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/04/supreme-court-hears-religious-student.php">Christian Legal Society v. Martinez</a> is another example of the conflict between secular morality and religious morality. In secular morality, homosexuality is a wholesome lifestyle choice and should not be the subject of criticism or discrimination. In religious morality, homosexuality is sinful conduct. Where institutions include &quot;sexual orientation&quot; in their diversity and non-discrimination policies, people of faith sometimes find themselves under pressure to surrender their religious beliefs.</p>

                <p>In the <u>CLS</u> case, Hastings School of Law has an anti-discrimination policy that, <i>inter alia</i>, prohibits <br />
                    discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Applying this policy, school officials denied CLS funding and recognition because CLS requires members to adhere to a Statement of Faith which, among other things, prohibits extramarital sex.</p>

                <p>In legal terms, CLS&#39; argument in the US Supreme Court on April 19 focused on freedom of association and freedom of religion under the First Amendment. In practical terms, the power of CLS&#39; argument is apparent by analogy. Would a gay club be required to admit members and elect officers opposed to homosexuality? Would the Campus Democrats be required to accept Republicans as members and officers? Would a black students association be  required to welcome members of the Klan?  The answer: Of course not. An organization formed around a given activity or belief must necessarily be entitled, both practically and Constitutionally, to limit membership to those of like mind. </p>

                <p>I predict that the district and circuit court decisions against CLS will be reversed, following the logic of <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/530/640/case.html">Boy Scouts v. Dale</a>.&quot;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> Anna Mandel, Boston College &#39;11 currently studying law in London, discusses the impact of recent clarifications to the United Kingdom&#39;s Suicide Act of 1961...<br />
<hr height="1"><br />
<font size="3"><b>A</b></font>ssisted suicide has become a controversial and provocative legal topic around the world, particularly in the European Union. JURIST has reported on assisted suicide law and policy in the United Kingdom since 2006, and scholars, legal practitioners, and the public have commented extensively on the new assisted suicide guidelines for England and Wales released on February 25, 2010. These guidelines were made public by the Director of Public Prosecutions of England and Wales (DPP), Keir Starmer, as the result of consistent pressure from citizens seeking clarification of the law. Prior to the introduction of the new guidelines, public confusion existed over when people would face criminal prosecution for assisting in another&#39;s suicide under the Suicide Act of 1961 (&quot;the Act&quot;). The DPP&#39;s role in criminal prosecutions for assisted suicide cases is critical because his permission is required for a case to be brought before the court for prosecution.</p>

<p>Nearly fifty years ago, the Act legalized suicide, yet codified assisting in another&#39;s suicide as a crime punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The Act is unique in criminalizing behavior closely tied to a legal activity by making it illegal to assist someone in attempting or completing a legal action. Other European countries take a different approach. In Luxembourg, for example, assisted suicide is not illegal because suicide itself is legal. The Act, therefore, stands apart from other criminal legislation that Europeans may be familiar with.</p>

<p>Section Two of the Act, which has been debated in British Parliament for several years, states that &quot;a person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the suicide of another, or an attempt by another to commit suicide, shall be [criminally] liable.&quot; Over the past decade, many terminally ill individuals in the United Kingdom have sought clarification of the meaning of &quot;aids, abets, counsels or procures&quot; and of the factors that prosecutors consider when deciding whether an assister will be held liable. Terminally ill patients sought these clarifications in order to assess how, with whom, and where to plan their deaths when their illnesses became unbearable. Since June 2008, for example, Debbie Purdy, a British woman suffering from multiple sclerosis, has fought for clarification of the law by seeking judicial review of the Act and asking for specific explanations from the DPP. Her efforts, along with those of thousands of other UK citizens, encouraged the introduction of the rules released in February. Purdy sought to ascertain the likelihood of her husband facing criminal prosecution were he to help end her life when her illness became too debilitating. Her efforts, and those of other similarly-situated individuals, came to fruition with the publication of the new guidelines, which provide prosecutors, patients, and potential assisters with essential information for determining criminal liability. Further, while the February rules only apply in England and Wales, Northern Ireland has a statute that is nearly indistinguishable from the Act.</p>

<p>Although the DPP stressed that potential prosecutions will be analyzed on a case-by-case basis, he emphasized that a particular focus will be placed on the assister&#39;s motivation, such as compassion for a loved one, self-interest, or a &quot;darker motive.&quot; However, this does not preclude other factors from being taken into consideration when deciding whether to criminally prosecute individuals. Interestingly, even if the assister would benefit slightly from the victim&#39;s suicide, a benevolent motive would very likely relieve him of criminal liability under the new rules. Other factors that prosecutors will now consider include the victim&#39;s mental state, whether the suicide and the assister&#39;s role was reported to law enforcement officials, whether there was a discussion between the assister and the victim of options other than suicide, the victim&#39;s age, the degree of assistance provided, the relationship history of the assister and victim, and the persistency of the victim&#39;s demands. Importantly, the new guidelines clarify the likelihood of prosecution where the assister is a family member or the victim&#39;s close friend, to assure terminally ill patients that their family members will probably not be prosecuted for assisting their suicides. In Purdy&#39;s case, the new rules increased her peace of mind because she felt she could wait to seek her husband&#39;s assistance at a later point, rather than being forced to plan suicide alone and while still physically able. Despite their importance, the new rules are but one of several changes to assisted suicide law in the United Kingdom.  </p>

<p>Some groups, including disabled and elderly care advocacy groups, such as the Scope Charity in the UK, are opposed to the new principles, arguing that they implicitly legalize euthanasia and subject vulnerable, ill patients to unnecessary pressure. Groups opposed to the new rules argue that the changes reduce obstacles to ending a person&#39;s life without his consent, and could persuade an ill or disabled patient to commit suicide rather than continue to consume medical resources. Other groups, including Dignity in Dying, strongly support the new guidelines as being respectful of personal autonomy, human dignity, and an individual&#39;s right to be free from emotional and physical pain. Groups in favor of the new regulations further argue that they alleviate terminally ill individuals&#39; monetary and time concerns, since they can seek assistance at home rather than traveling to foreign jurisdictions where assisted suicide is legal, such as Switzerland. Still others argue that the new rules do not change the letter of the law at all and are therefore unremarkable.</p>

<p>It is uncontested that the new principles clarify the existing law as enshrined in Section Two of the Act. They also represent a growing public need for elucidation of existing law so that citizens understand how to avoid potential punishment. In Scotland, for example, suicide is not a crime, but the law on assisted suicide is unclear and lacks legal certainty, just as in England and Wales. This may lead to a growth in the Scottish public&#39;s desire for legal clarifications, as it did in England over the past ten years. The DPP&#39;s clarification for England and Wales promotes legal certainty and prevents <i>ex-post facto</i> judgments, thereby supporting legal fairness, as well. No matter one&#39;s political views respecting assisted suicide, the importance of fairness and legal certainty is uncontested in a democratic society and should be welcomed. While Parliament has not amended the substantive letter of the law or the Act, despite recent attempts, the jurisdictional elements for bringing a criminal case in the first place have been publicly disclosed and outlined.</p>

<p>Since the new jurisdictional elements for initiating a case focus heavily on the assister&#39;s motivation rather than the victim&#39;s characteristics, they may also signal a slow trend toward decriminalizing assisted suicide in England and Wales in cases where the assister is deemed &quot;innocent&quot;. This trend would bring UK law into closer alignment with other European countries&#39; laws on the subject, such as those of Switzerland, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. These countries emphasize the assister&#39;s <i>mens rea</i>, and are more liberal than in the UK by permitting assisted suicide under certain enumerated conditions. Swiss law, for instance, provides that &quot;a person who, for selfish reasons, incites someone to commit suicide or assists that person in doing so&quot; will be held liable if the suicide is attempted or completed. If the assister shows &quot;decent&quot; motives, however, and does not commit the killing act but only facilitates the victim&#39;s death, the assister will not be held liable. In principle, this is similar to the new UK clarifications, under which an assister&#39;s motives are closely scrutinized. The difference between these laws, however, is that one explicitly codifies the law in statute while the other couples legislation with non-exhaustive guidelines for prosecution. </p>

<p>The February guidelines appear to focus more on prosecutorial discretion than on the substantive law of assisted suicide. Indeed, it is unlikely that the Act itself will be amended in the near future, as public opinion in the UK is divided and amendment would entail political consequences for members of both houses of Parliament. Yet, while providing legal certainty and fairness and satisfying the public desire to understand the law, the new guidelines have also brought UK law into further <i>de facto</i>, if not <i>de jure</i>, alignment with other European assisted suicide laws. Perhaps in the future, attempts will be made to codify the February guidelines to some extent, similar to the clarification of prosecutorial guidelines in Swiss law. This would be a positive step towards increasing legal certainty and public awareness of the law on both sides of the debate.   </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a target="_blank" href="http://www.williamgeorgeross.com/">William G. Ross</a> of Cumberland School of Law, Samford University, says Arizona's controversial new immigration law appears to be constitutional, at least on its face, but the state must be scrupulously careful to avoid even the appearance of any kind of discrimination against Hispanics....<br /><hr size="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forumy/williamrossnew.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table> <font size="3"><b>A</b></font>rizona's controversial new legislation to facilitate enforcement of federal immigration laws appears to be constitutional, at least on its face, although complex issues involving the statute's language and application create uncertainties about its ultimate legal fate. The law, signed by Governor Janice Kay Brewer on April 23, requires state and local law enforcement officials to enforce federal immigration laws to the full extent permitted by federal law. The statute creates state penalties for various violations of federal immigration laws, including the requirement that aliens carry identity documents; prohibits the harboring of illegal aliens; and requires police to verify the immigration status of persons about whose status they form a reasonable suspicion during the course of law enforcement action and to inform federal officials of their status if it is illegal. The statute also permits state officials to deliver illegal aliens to federal authorities.<br />
	<br />
One of the principal constitutional questions is whether federal immigration laws pre-empt the Arizona legislation. Many opponents of the Arizona statute contend that the measure is pre-empted by Article I, section 8 of the Constitution, which permits Congress "[t]o establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization," and by immigration legislation. Preemption is the focus of a federal lawsuit that was filed last week by the National Coalition of Latino Clergy and Christian Leaders to enjoin enforcement of the statute. </p>

<p>The co-called "preemption doctrine" is derived from the Supremacy Clause in Article VI of the Constitution, which provides that the "Constitution and the Laws of the United States...shall be the supreme Law of the Land...any Thing in the constitutions or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding." Preemption may be either expressly stated in a statute or it may be implied. As the Ninth Circuit explained in its recent decision in <u>Chicanos Por Causa v. Napolitano</u> (2008), implied preemption may arise from "field preemption" or "conflict preemption." In field preemption, congressional regulation is so pervasive that there is no room for state regulation. In conflict preemption, compliance with both federal and state law either would be logistically impossible or the enforcement of the state law would impede the accomplishment and execution of congressional purpose. </p>

<p>The U.S. Supreme Court relied on both types of implied preemption in its landmark decision in <u>Pennsylvania v. Nelson</u> in 1956, prohibiting state prosecutions for sedition against the United States because three federal anti-sedition statutes had created a "pervasive" federal structure that "occupied the field" and left "no room" for any action by the states. Decided at the height of the Cold War, the decision was widely assailed for hindering efforts to combat Communism. The Court warned, however, that redundant or meddling efforts by state officials to prosecute sedition could actually interfere with more effective actions by the federal government. </p>

<p>Even though Congress may enact naturalization legislation, however, and even if this power is exclusively federal, states are not necessarily barred from regulating illegal immigration. <br />
	<br />
In the Supreme Court's only decision addressing the preemption doctrine in the context of legislation involving illegal aliens, <u>De Canas v. Bica</u> (1976), the Court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of a California statute prohibiting employers from knowingly employing "an alien who is not entitled to lawful residence in the United States if such employment would have an adverse effect on lawful resident workers." In his opinion for the Court, Justice William J. Brennan, usually a strong proponent of federal power, rejected the argument that the statute was preempted by the Supremacy Clause because Congress has the exclusive power to regulate immigration. Brennan explained that the Immigration and Naturalization Act was principally concerned "with the terms and conditions of admission of the INA and the subsequent treatment of aliens lawfully in the country" and that it therefore did not necessarily prohibit restrictions on the hiring of illegal aliens.  The Court remanded for a determination of whether the statute was being enforced consistently with federal law.  </p>

<p>Six years later, Brennan in his opinion for the Court in <u>Plyler v. Doe</u> (1982) acknowledged that "the States do have some authority to act with respect to illegal aliens, at least where such action mirrors federal objectives and furthers a legitimate state goal."</p>

<p>Although the Arizona law seems to come closer to the subject matter of federal regulation than did the California law, the broad language of both of Brennan's opinions suggests that there may well be "room" for the Arizona legislation.  Further general support for this position may be found in the Ninth Circuit's recent decision in Napolitano, which held that the Immigration and Reform Control Act of 1995 (IRCA) did not preempt an Arizona law requiring employers to verify the immigration status of workers even though the statute expressly preempted state laws regulating the employment of illegal aliens because there was an express exemption for "licensing and similar laws." The presence of an express exception makes the decision distinguishable from the Arizona law, and the Ninth Circuit did not extensively address the issue of implied preemption. But a 2007 decision of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, <u>Lozano v. City of Hazelton</u>, relied heavily upon a theory of implied preemption in holding a similar law enacted by a city. In addition to finding a conflict, the court emphasized that the IRCA provides a "comprehensive scheme" that "leaves no room for state regulation." This decision, however, is under appeal in the Third Circuit. </p>

<p>Kris W. Kobach, a law professor who helped to draft the Arizona statute, plausibly contends that the Arizona law does not contravene the preemption doctrine because it provides for "concurrent" enforcement of federal law. Kobach has explained that the framers of the legislation were keenly aware of the preemption doctrine and took pains to craft it in a manner that would insulate it from a preemption challenge. In particular, the statute declares that it "shall be implemented in a manner consistent with federal laws regulating immigration." </p>

<p>One reason why a court might invoke the preemption doctrine is that the state's delivery of illegal aliens to federal authorities might impose a burden on the federal immigration system. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, a former Arizona governor, has warned that the legislation could "distract from and siphon resources" that the federal government needs for deportation of illegal immigrants who are violent or commit crimes. She has expressed concern that "at some point we'll be responsible to enforce or use our immigration resources against anyone who would be picked up in Arizona."Although proponents of the statute acknowledge that federal resources are strained, they urge federal government to appropriate more funds for border security and enforcement of immigration laws. Many Americans believe that a few more billion dollars spent in the Southwest would do far more to enhance national security than have the trillion dollars that the nation has spent on its military adventures in Iraq and Afghanistan during the past decade.</p>

<p>In its most recent decision on preemption, <u>Levine v. Wyeth</u> (2009), the Court declared that "[w]e start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superceded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress." Every state has an inherent "police power," which allows the state to legislate for the health, safety, morals, and welfare of its people. </p>

<p>In enacting its immigration statute, the Arizona legislature was exercising its police power in a reasonable attempt to protect its citizens from the many baneful effects of illegal immigration. In particular, the legislation should help to ameliorate crime, protect the natural environment, ease the ravages of the recession, promote social stability, and encourage respect for the rule of law. <br />
	<br />
Arizona's crime problem has generated much support for the statute, and this is the principal justification that Governor Brewer offered in explaining why she signed the legislation. Arizona always has had a severe crime problem that reflects the rootlessness of a society in which so many citizens - including most non-Hispanic whites - are from other places. When I was growing up in Phoenix during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, we always bolted our doors, day and night, at a time when many Americans still left their doors unlocked. Although the extent of the crime rate among illegal aliens is a subject of sharp controversy, there seems little doubt that illegal immigration has contributed to at least some additional crime. Economically affluent opponents of the Arizona law should consider that many of the victims of these crimes are working class persons - including Hispanics - who live in the low income neighborhoods that illegal aliens tend to inhabit.  Many Arizonans complain that crime by illegal aliens is particularly pernicious because they often can escape prosecution because they live "under the radar" or because those who come from Mexico can slip across the border. </p>

<p>Environmentalism likewise provides a compelling reason for the statute. Protection of the environment is a particularly sensitive subject in Arizona, where the influx of millions of persons has damaged the fragile eco-system in the desert areas. Phoenix had eight thousand residents a century ago, and 106,000 in 1950. Today the city has 1.6 million and the metropolitan area has 4.3 million. Much of the state's legal and political history has revolved around attempts to ensure a sufficient supply of water for its arid central and southern regions. The state's supply of water remained highly uncertain until the U.S. Supreme Court in 1963 in <u>Arizona v. California</u>  ruled in favor of Arizona in a dispute with California over the use of Colorado River water, and until Congress in 1968 enacted the Colorado River Basin Projects Act, a massive program for dams and reclamation. The staggering growth of Phoenix since the 1960s has raised questions about whether even a secure and steady flow of Colorado River water can sustain the state's burgeoning water needs. Phoenix also has suffered periodically from a severe smog problem. The presence of an estimated 460,000 illegal aliens in the state places a burden on an eco-system that already is over-strained. Even if the state wanted to restrict the flow of people into Arizona from other states, any attempt to bar the movement of people into the state would run afoul of the due process, privileges and immunities, and commerce clauses of the Constitution.</p>

<p>Arizona's explosive growth also has generated social and economic problems that are unique to this state. Although the state's present unemployment rate of 9.6 percent is no higher than average for the nation, Arizona has been harder hit than most states by the decline in real estate prices. The effects of the recession are less likely to be cushioned in a state where so many people lack an established social safety network because they left their family and friends behind in Ohio or Tennessee or New Jersey. Anyone who visits Phoenix and ventures out beyond the cloistered enclaves of its tony resorts will be shocked by the extent of raw poverty. Slums sprawl for miles, and legions of homeless persons trudge miserably throughout the city at all hours of the day and night. Much of the poverty and homelessness is the result of the transience and rootlessness that always has been pervasive in Arizona. Many troubled people move to Arizona to make a fresh start, only to find that Arizona is no Promised Land. Even more than most states, Arizona therefore has a compelling reason to ensure that illegal aliens do exacerbate unemployment or swamp public and private social services agencies that have been severely depleted by the recession. Even when illegal aliens do not take jobs away from citizens, their frequent willingness to work for exploitative wages pushes down compensation for working class people and thereby retards economic recovery and economic growth. The presence of large numbers of illegal aliens in Arizona and elsewhere also has contributed to a growing gap between rich and poor that during the past three decades has severely eroded egalitarian ideals and discouraged a sense of shared community.</p>

<p>The social and economic problems generated by explosive growth also provide Arizona with a compelling interest in promoting social stability. Arizona is one of the most cosmopolitan places on earth.  When I was growing up there, I was fortunate to know people who came from virtually all of the other forty-nine states and from many countries, including Mexico. A remarkably large proportion of public officials were first elected to office only a few years after arriving in the state - John McCain is an example. The state's population is even more fluid than the population growth statistics indicate because a huge number of people also leave Arizona. The state's marvelous diversity is one of  its greatest strengths, but the constant population shifts also tend to impede social and economic stability. It is ironic but quite understandable that a state in which so many persons are newcomers has gone farther than most other states in its efforts to forge a distinctive state identity. People from other states usually tell me that they don't know whether their states have a state song, but I know every word of the Arizona state anthem, Come to this land of sunshine, because we so often sang it in my elementary school in Phoenix during the 1960s. The Arizona flag, with its bright yellow and red rays of sun emanating from a gold star, is ubiquitous throughout the state. The presence of so many illegal aliens in a state in which so many persons are legal newcomers hinders the state's compelling interest in forging unity alongside a healthy diversity and exacerbates the rootlessness and transience that are the source of so many of the state's problems. It is therefore a sad irony that the immigration legislation is so divisive and that it is piercing a social fabric that already was fragile.</p>

<p>The Arizona statute also helps to encourage respect for the rule of law. The flagrant disregard of immigration laws by illegal aliens and the federal government's failure to properly enforce those laws tends to demoralize law abiding citizens and sets a terrible example for young people, who should understand that they live in a society in which all persons are expected to abide by the law and that those who fail to do so will be punished.</p>

<p>Even if a court found that the presumption of constitutionality under the police power enabled the statute to survive a preemption challenge, a court may conclude that the statute is unconstitutional if a court finds that the statute violates any constitutional right or denies equal protection of the law to any particular class of persons. </p>

<p>One potential complaint against the statute is that it illegally discriminates against illegal aliens as a class. This argument, too, is likely to fail. Although legal aliens are a "suspect class" to which strict judicial scrutiny applies, the Court's opinion in <u>Plyler v. Doe</u> applied a lower level of scrutiny to legislation affecting illegal aliens. The level of scrutiny applied in <u>Plyler</u> appears to have been somewhere between the "rational basis" standard, which requires only a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest, and an "intermediate" standard of review, which requires that a state demonstrate that its legislation serve an "important" interest and that this interest is "substantially related" to the legislation. The state's interests, as explained above, are clearly both rational and important, and there is a strong reason to suppose that a court would find a sufficient nexus between these interests and remedies prescribed by the legislation.</p>

<p>Some critics of the statute allege that it violates the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures. This is unlikely, however, since the statute makes clear that any inquiry into immigration status must be conducted according to the same standards that apply to any search. The statute states that "[f]or any <em>lawful</em> contact made by a law enforcement official or agency...where <em>reasonable</em> suspicion exists that the person is an alien who is unlawfully present in the United States, a <em>reasonable</em> attempt shall be made, when <em>practicable</em>, to determine the immigration status of the person" (italics are mine). </p>

<p>Although some opponents of the status have alleged that it would permit random detention of any person suspected of being an illegal alien and therefore could subject legal aliens or U.S. citizens of Hispanic heritage to harassment and abuse or could discourage them from reporting crimes to law enforcement officials, the "lawful contact" language indicates that the statute requires a predicate for any inquiry into one's citizenship status. As Professor Kobach has explained, "That means the officer is already engaged in some detention of an individual because he's violated some other law...The most likely context where this law would come into play is a traffic stop." The statute explicitly creates a presumption that a person is not an illegal alien if he or she provides any kind of valid federal, state, or local identification. Moreover, the statute specifically forbids consideration of "race, color or national origin" in its implementation.  Some proponents of the statute contend that random stops of Hispanics would be impracticable even if police were willing to violate the clear language of the statute since Hispanics constitute 30 percent of Arizona's population and most are U.S. citizens or legal aliens. Governor Brewer has promised that law enforcement officials will receive proper training to ensure that they do not apply it in a bullying or racially discriminatory manner. </p>

<p>The law therefore does not necessarily create any kind of racial classification that would require the application of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Even if a court somehow determined that the statute created some kind of racial classification, the statute still would not necessarily be unconstitutional. Although the U.S. Supreme Court has made clear that race is a "suspect class" that must be subjected to "strict judicial scrutiny," the statute could withstand such scrutiny to the extent that the state could demonstrate that it has a "compelling interest" in enforcement of immigration laws and that the statute is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. Since, however, strict scrutiny is often said to be "fatal in fact," it would be very difficult for the statute to survive an equal protection challenge based upon race, particularly if there were any evidence that any police officer had harassed or otherwise abused an Hispanic person on account of race or ethnicity.<br />
	<br />
In enforcing the legislation, however, Arizona must be scrupulously careful to avoid even the appearance of any kind of discrimination against Hispanics.  The state should do this at least as much for the sake of justice and decency as for the sake of ensuring that courts uphold the law's constitutionality. Arizona, like all states, has a sad history of discrimination against non-whites, particularly Hispanics. When I was a boy in Phoenix during the 1960s, I heard  my parents express indignation over the appalling conditions in migrant labor camps, and I was dismayed by my awareness of the discrimination and slights that Hispanics often endured.  During the early 1970s, the governor of Arizona refused to meet with labor leader Cesar Chavez, who was trying to unionize Hispanic farm workers, arrogantly dismissing him as "that little lettuce picker." Fortunately, times have changed. That governor is mostly forgotten, while Chavez is honored with a monument in the heart of downtown Phoenix. Arizona elected its first Hispanic governor, Raul Castro, way back in 1974. Meanwhile, the Anglo and Hispanic communities have grown increasingly intertwined. The Lutheran congregation in which I was raised during the 1960s (and in which future Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and his family were members from 1959-69) regarded itself as diverse back then because it included both Germans and Scandinavians. That parish today has Hispanic members, and Governor Brewer's Lutheran congregation conducts one of its Sunday services in Spanish. The tremendous outcry against the statute, however, indicates that such progress against prejudice and discrimination may not have been as pervasive as one would have hoped. Those of us who are not vulnerable to racial profiling should be not be too dismissive of the warnings of Hispanics who fear that the statute will be abused by law enforcement officials. </p>

<p>W.H. Auden once wrote that we should measure civilization by the amount of diversity attained and the amount of unity retained. In a nation that has so many races, ethnicities, and religions, our Constitution and our devotion to the principle of the rule of law have provided critically important sources of unity. It is unfortunate that the Arizona legislation, which is designed to encourage the rule of law, is generating so much divisiveness. Although the statute  appears to be constitutional on its face, its constitutionality ultimately depends upon whether law enforcement officials in Arizona will apply it in a manner that does not unfairly discriminate against persons who have broken no law.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/experts/GudeKen.html">Ken Gude</a> [Director, International Rights and Responsibility Program, <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/">Center for American Progress</a>] &quot;Spain is leading the way among US allies in <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/05/spain-accepts-second-guantanamo-detainee-1.php">assisting</a> the Obama administration in the critical counterterrorism mission to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay. With domestic efforts stalled due to political opposition and opportunism, the Obama administration is forced to turn to allies like Spain to bring down the population at the prison. Spain&#39;s leadership is crucial to persuading other countries, and hopefully the United States Congress, to join in this effort to close Guantanamo and prevent our terrorist enemies from using that symbol to recruit new members into their ranks.</p>

                <p>Regardless of the improvements that have been made to conditions at Guantanamo or to the military commission trials once again underway, closing the prison remains a national security imperative. Guantanamo is a symbol of American lawlessness and hypocrisy that has played into the hands of our enemies. President Obama accurately  described the net negative impact of the prison for US national security when he said last May that it &quot;created more terrorists around the world than it ever detained.&quot; Any plan to close Guantanamo must include dozens of transfers to third countries because international law restricts sending detainees to countries where they face the<br />
                    prospect of torture.</p>

                <p>Spain has accepted this responsibility and has consistently stepped up to the plate to help remove this terrorist recruiting tool. It originally pledged to resettle two detainees - the second of which arrived Tuesday - but recently upped their pledge to five as it became clear that more help would be needed to find homes for detainees released from Guantanamo. Spain&#39;s increased assistance is commendable because it comes in the face of outright refusal on the part of the US Congress to accept any detainees for resettlement into the United States. </p>

                <p>Spain&#39;s leadership is also essential to bring other countries, particularly major European countries like Germany, into the effort to close Guantanamo. Germany had previously refused to accept Guantanamo detainees but reports out last month indicate that they are close to agreeing to resettle some detainees. Such a move from Germany could induce France to add to its one detainee and others could follow suit, moving the Obama administration closer to its objective to close the prison.</p>

                <p>The Obama administration has never wavered in its commitment to close Guantanamo, even in the face of political opposition in the United States. It now relies more than ever on its allies to keep making progress toward that goal and Spain has consistently been willing to do its part and more. Spain and many other countries realize the danger that flows from increased terrorist recruitment and incitement is not only directed at the United States, it threatens us all. Let&#39;s hope that the US Congress can learn from that enlightened approach and finally put this tragic episode in US history behind us.&quot; </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Ninth Circuit&#039;s Khatib decision undermines free exercise of religion</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.christinaabraham.com/">Christina Abraham</a> [Civil Rights Director, <a href="http://www.cairchicago.org/">Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) -Illinois</a>] &quot;In a feat of apologetic acrobatics, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rendered a <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/05/03/08-56423.pdf">decision</a> [PDF file] in <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/05/ninth-circuit-rules-removing-headscarf.php">Khatib v. County of Orange</a> affirming a district court&#39;s dismissal of a complaint under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA).  The decision uses faulty legal reasoning to arrive at a conclusion that dangerously undermines the well-established principle that the government may not unnecessarily infringe upon an individual&#39;s right to exercise his or her religion. <br />
                <br />
                Souhair Khatib sued the County of Orange after she had been held in the county court&#39;s holding facility from 9am to 4:30pm and was forced to remove her religious headscarf (<em>hijab</em>) while in the presence of men - a violation of her sincerely held religious beliefs.  RLUIPA prohibits the government from imposing a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution.  In <u>Khatib</u>, the case centered on whether the holding facility at the Orange County Superior Court falls within the meaning of &quot;institution&quot; under RLUIPA.  The majority on the Ninth Circuit panel held that it did not.  In so doing, it ignored the statute&#39;s clear language and intent. </p>

                <p>RLUIPA defines &quot;institution&quot; as &quot;any facility or institution...(B) which is...(ii) a jail, prison, or other correctional facility&quot; or &quot;(ii) a pretrial detention facility.&quot;  The majority on the Ninth Circuit panel ultimately held that the court holding facility didn&#39;t constitute a pretrial detention facility because detainees could not &quot;reside&quot; there.  However, the clear language of RLUIPA states in its opening provision that the statute is intended to protect any person &quot;residing in or confined to an institution.&quot;  As Chief Judge Kozinki put it in his dissenting opinion, &quot;If Congress had meant to include only institutions with beds, there would have been no point in adding &#39;or confined to&#39; following residing.&quot;  In fact, nowhere in RLUIPA does Congress indicate a residency requirement for the statute to apply.  What Congress did do, however, was expressly instruct adjudicators to interpret the statute &quot;in favor of a <em>broad protection</em> of religious exercise, to the <em>maximum extent</em> permitted by the terms of this chapter and the Constitution.&quot;  That clearly did not happen here.<br />
                    <br />
                    Chief Judge Kozinski said it best in his dissent when he stated, &quot;Can we honestly say that a mammoth facility in the bowels of the Santa Ana courthouse, whose main purpose is to hold inmates while awaiting trial, cannot possibly be a pretrial detention facility?&quot;  The answer is no, we cannot <em>honestly</em> say that.  The decision rendered in the Ninth Circuit was not honest at all.  It was, at best, a shallow legal interpretation that needlessly permitted a government-run institution to impair the religious exercise of an individual entitled to that right.  Unless successfully appealed, this decision will set a crack in what is otherwise a solid body of jurisprudence designed to uphold one of this nation&#39;s most dearly-held rights.   </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://counterterrorismblog.org/experts/animesh-roul/bio/">Animesh Roul</a> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.sspconline.org/">Society for the Study of Peace and Conflict]</a> &quot;Mohammed Ajmal Amir Kasab, the lone surviving terrorist in the November 2008 Mumbai attacks has been sentenced to death by the court yesterday, May 6.  Kasab was found <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2010/05/india-court-convicts-mumbai.php">guilty</a> earlier this week and convicted for mindless murder and waging war against the country.</p>

                <p>The most surprising aspect of the trial was the acquittal of other two accused, Fahim Ansari and Sabauddin Ahmed for lack of evidence. Both of them are Indian nationals and accused of having surveyed Mumbai and drawn maps of the targets at the behest of Pakistan based Lashkar-e-Taiba.</p>

                <p>Though the death sentence was widely expected, many in India believe that the actual execution might be delayed due to number of legal factors.  For example, Kasab can appeal in the High Court and the apex court subsequently which is obviously time consuming. Even if he gets nothing from these courts, he still has one last chance - the Presidential pardon.</p>

                <p>Consider the example of Afzal Guru, the prime convict in the December 13, 2001 Parliament attack case, who was sentenced to death way back in 2006, and is still awaiting execution due to the archaic legal system prevalent in India. There are nearly 25 such cases awaiting Presidential approval.</p>

                <p>To recollect the horror, Mumbai terror incidents took nearly 170 lives including the nine terrorists affiliated to the Pakistan based Lashkar-e-Taiba. Kasab was involved in the railway platform shooting in that fateful night.</p>

                <p>Special  Judge M. L. Tahaliyani who handed out the verdict said Kasab has lost the right to any humanitarian benefits.</p>

                <p>However, the verdict serves two strategic purposes, besides pleasing the domestic clamor for capital punishment for Kasab. By giving the death penalty, India&#39;s judicial system proves that strong action can be taken against any killers, motivated, brainwashed or otherwise. Also, it aims to be a deterrent for any terrorists sitting across the border. Plausibly enough, any leniency towards Kasab would have sent a wrong signal to jihadis in Pakistan and their homegrown brethren in India.</p>

                <p>Whether swift death or a delayed execution, the end of Kasab might not help India to get all the masterminds of Mumbai carnage who are still moving freely in Pakistan. A living Kasab can give a better bargaining option against Pakistan and for the first time ever Kasab&#39;s capture caught Pakistan on a back foot since it adopted a proxy war strategy against its eastern neighbor.&quot; </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Thomas Moran</strong> [Consultant, <a href="http://www.canonlawconsultant.com/Site/Canon%20Law%20Consultations.html">Canon Law Consultations</a>]: &quot;In order to better appreciate the <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/vatican-releases-church-response.php">recently published</a> &quot;Guide to Understanding Basic Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) Procedures concerning Sexual Abuse Allegations,&quot; some background information might prove helpful. The Apostolic Constitution <span style="font-style:italic;">Pastor bonus</span> (June 28, 1988) established the CDF as the competent agency of the Roman Curia to examine delicts against the faith and &quot;more grave&quot; delicts against morals or committed in the celebration of the sacraments. This constitution also indicated that, whenever necessary, the CDF would proceed to declare and impose canonical sanctions according to the norm of law. In so doing, <span style="font-style:italic;">Pastor bonus</span> recognized the judicial competence of the CDF as an Apostolic Tribunal. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Motu Proprio Sacramentorum</span> sanctitatis tutela (April 30, 2001) promulgated norms governing the &quot;more grave&quot; delicts reserved to the CDF. However, the substantive and procedural norms themselves were published after the publication of the motu proprio. A CDF letter dated May 18, 2001  further addressed the subject of the &quot;more grave delicts&quot; against morals, which included the sexual abuse of minors.  <br /><br />The CDF guide identifies three significant preliminary procedures:  <blockquote>First, it emphasizes that the local diocese investigates every allegation of sexual abuse of a minor by a cleric. The purpose of this investigation is to determine whether there is evidence to suggest an offense occurred. When there is sufficient evidence that the sexual abuse of a minor has occurred, the case is then referred to the CDF. The local bishop transmits all relevant information to the congregation along with his opinion regarding the pertinent procedural and penal aspects of the case.  <br /><br />Second, it stipulates that the civil laws relative to reporting crimes of sexual abuse to the appropriate authorities should be followed. In the aftermath of the recent scandal in the United States, Catholics demanded greater accountability of church authorities. Victims have the right to report abuse to the civil authorities. Rather than impeding this right, local ecclesiastical authorities are to make reporting such offenses a priority. This rather proactive approach to reporting and cooperating with civil authorities is a positive step toward greater accountability. However, the issue of canonically privileged communications merits further discussion relative to reporting.  <br /><br />Third, the preliminary portion of this document indicates that before, during, and after any canonical proceeding, the local bishop, in virtue of his office, possess the executive power of governance that would allow him to prohibit an accused cleric from exercising his ministry either by removing him from office or by restricting his faculties. While, the criminal nature of such offenses and the obligation to protect minors seemingly require executive action, such restrictions should be utilized prudently and only when due cause is verifiable. Additionally, the local bishop must honor the cleric&#39;s right to be heard and  his right to recourse against the decision to limit his ministry by executive decree.</blockquote> After reviewing a case presented by a local bishop, as well as any necessary supplementary information, the CDF may authorize a judicial trial at the local level. In a judicial trial, the accused enjoys various procedural rights including the right to counsel, the right to present a defense, and ultimately the right to appeal the decision of the court to the CDF.  Papal derogations from the norms promulgated by <span style="font-style:italic;">Sacramentorum sanctitatis tutela</span> also allow for the possibility of non-trial solutions:<blockquote>&acirc;&#8364;&cent; An accused priest who repents and recognizes that his behavior is incompatible with ministry may request a dispensation from clerical obligations and laicization from the pope.<br />  <br />&acirc;&#8364;&cent; In particularly grave cases (where there has been a civil criminal conviction or the evidence is overwhelming), the pontiff may decide to dismiss one from the clerical state <span style="font-style:italic;">ex officio</span>. Generally, the CDF makes this request on the basis of the recommendation of the local bishop. Because the decision of the pope is not subject to appeal, provision must be made for the offending cleric&#39;s right of defense.  <br /><br />&acirc;&#8364;&cent; In those cases where the facts are grave and clear, the CDF can authorize the local bishop to impose a sanction by using the administrative penal process articulated in the code. If the bishop decides the penalty is dismissal from the clerical state, he  needs the &quot;approval&quot; of the CDF. In such administrative processes, the accused is to be afforded the opportunity to exercise fully his right of defense as well as his right to appeal the decision to impose a penalty to the CDF.  </blockquote>In those cases where the non-dismissed cleric has admitted his crimes and agreed to live a life of prayer and penance, the CDF authorizes the local bishop to issue by executive decree a penal precept (an injunction) that would either prohibit entirely or restrict the accused cleric&#39;s ministry. Violations of such precepts (i.e., non-compliance) are subject to canonical penalties, including dismissal from the clerical state. Some have questioned whether such penal precepts effectively amount to a dismissal from the clerical state. Although significant restrictions would be warranted relative to access to minors, one might consider whether prayer, penance, appropriate therapy, and adequate supervision might allow such an individual to engage in some form of meaningful, albeit very limited, ministry. <br /> <br />Finally, the CDF alluded to a limited revision of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sacramentorum sanctitatis tutela</span>. Although the procedures described above will remain inherently the same, other related issues warrant attention. First and foremost, the healing and ongoing pastoral care of victims and families must remain an ecclesial and canonical priority. Church authorities must continue to acknowledge and honor the canonical rights of both the victim and the accused in processing abuse cases. Relative to reporting alleged offenses to civil authorities, greater consideration must be given to communications protected by canon law, namely, the seal of confession and professional secrecy (confidentiality). Further, church authorities must carefully balance the alleged offender&#39;s right to reputation and privacy and the right of the community to be informed about criminal behavior. <br /><br />Because of their obligation to protect minors, church authorities must strive continually for greater transparency and accountability as they exercise their pastoral and governance responsibilities. Since the salvation of souls must be the supreme law of the church, ecclesiastical authorities ought to remain committed to examining disciplinary options that will enable them to minister effectively to those who have offended. Due to the substantial demands placed on it by the worldwide sexual abuse scandal, the CDF should make every effort to increase its staff in order to handle the influx of new cases in a timely manner. Since justice delayed is justice denied, every effort must be made to process these cases promptly and efficiently. Also, scholarly research regarding canonical procedures and penalties should be encouraged. Ongoing research and access to the jurisprudence of the CDF will enhance the ability of local authorities to handle these cases fairly, compassionately, and competently.&quot;<br />

		<title>Polish presidential plane crash a tragic postscript to Katyn massacre</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Donnorummo"><strong>Bob Donnorummo</strong></a> [Former Associate Director, Center for Russian &amp; East European Studies, <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/">University of Pittsburgh</a>]: &quot;On  April 10, JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/poland-lower-house-speaker-assumes.php">reported</a> the crash of the Polish presidential jet killing President Lech Kaczynski, two deputy speakers and 12 members of parliament, two senators, three deputy ministers, National Bank President, all the chiefs of the various branches of the military, high level advisors, and other dignitaries. In the week that has followed, three thoughts have come to mind. (1) Why has not a personal and political tragedy of this magnitude created at least a discernable ripple in the stabilization of the country? (2) The response of the Russian leadership has been warm, effective and welcomed. Finally, (3) my most vivid thought, can there be something one might call the &quot;ghost of Katyn?&quot; <br /><br />The speaker of the Parliament, Bronislaw Komorowski, will be the interim President. He will set a date for elections, and political life goes on in Warsaw. This is true despite the fact that Mr. Komorowki was to run against President Kaczynski and his nationalistic, anti-Russian Law and Justice Party in the approaching presidential elections.  I have been a frequent traveler to Poland since the 1970s, and I firmly believe that the former communist government of Poland would not have been nearly so stable under similar circumstances. The reason rests with the legitimacy of the present government. Simply put, communist rule never had legitimacy in Poland, but numerous open elections since 1989, as well as personal freedoms securely embedded in democratically passed legislation and interpreted by an accountable judiciary, have given the populace a feeling that the government is legitimate and they are stakeholders.  <br /><br />Poland and Russia have had a contentious, even hateful, relationship for centuries. In 1795, Warsaw and large sections of Poland most reluctantly became part of the Tsarist Russian Empire, against which it chaffed and rebelled in 1830, 1863, and 1905. In 1920, the Soviet Union and the newly independent state of Poland fought a war that the fledging USSR lost. After World War II, Poland became part of the Soviet orbit, but again reluctantly as the testimony of the Polish &quot;Solidarity&quot; movement strongly attests. To say that history presents a case of Polish-Russian distrust is an understatement. Yet in the wake of this tragedy, Russia has gone out of its way to express its sympathy.  Prime Minister Putin laid a wreath at the crash site with his Polish counterpart, Donald Tusk, and the Russian media has given the event extensive coverage. Moreover, April 12 was designated a national day of mourning in Russia, visa restrictions for relatives were eased, and the Polish film &quot;Katyn&quot; was aired on TV in prime time. Is this just a bit of real politik theatre, or can historically negative attitudes be refashioned into something more positive? I do not know, but again I think these seemingly ahistorical responses speak to the changed political nature of both countries. They must now pay attention to the domestic and international impact of their actions. These more scrutinized actions may not always be sympathetic (see Russia&#39;s heavy handed response to Georgia in August 2008), but there is at least a layer of protection against the more volatile, less accountable actions of non-democratic leaders. Whether heartfelt or not, I much prefer the Russian response to the alternative.<br /><br />As noted, I have been a long time visitor to Poland. In the 1970s and 1980s, when the killings of 20,000 Polish soldiers at Katyn Forest were never mentioned in public, in school text books or the media, I never met a parent who did not tell his children that Poles were killed by the Soviets in 1940 at Katyn and then they shamelessly tried to blame it on the Nazis. I could feel the depth of their pain, untouched by the semi-healing powers of cathartic outpourings. It was as if the Poles were living with one their worst nightmares (of which World War II provided a plethora), yet they could not openly talk about it. The subject was also taboo in the Soviet Union, but after 1985 and Mikhail Gorbachev, things began to change. By the 1990s discussions, even documents showing the order from the Kremlin, were made public. And on the 70th anniversary of Katyn, Prime Minister Tusk along with Vladimir Putin, were laying wreaths to honor the murdered soldiers. President Kaczynski&#39;s hard line anti-Russian positions caused him to avoid this ceremony, but he was coming on 10 April abroad the ill-fated jet. <br /><br />Western news media covering the event all make note of the Katyn anniversary, but then quickly pass onto to possible pilot decisions, the black box, or the political implications. As an historian who spends his life measuring aggregate human action, I know that the crash and the anniversary of Katyn are not related. Yet the memories of Katyn are more than footnotes to a tragic plane crash. Katyn, like the Holocaust or slavery in the US, can never be forgotten, and while it may not produce ghosts, it does leave behind a powerful collective memory.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.thelawyer.com/jeffrey-kerr-peta/128641.article"><strong>Jeffrey S. Kerr</strong></a> [General Counsel and Vice President of Corporate Affairs, <a href="http://www.petafoundation.org/">The PETA Foundation</a>]: &quot;Crush fetish videos, which this <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/search/display.html?terms=48&url=/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00000048----000-.html">law</a> was enacted in 1999 to prohibit, are made for a niche market of individuals who derive sexual satisfaction from watching animals being tortured and slowly killed.  The intent of the Founding Fathers in drafting the Bill of Rights was to reduce the likelihood of oppression, and the First Amendment was meant to protect the exchange of ideas and open discourse.  It is not in the spirit of the Constitution to allow or encourage gratuitous depictions of torture for sexual gratification or profit, which is why, in 1982, the US Supreme Court <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/458/747/case.html">ruled</a> that child pornography was not protected by the First Amendment.  Similarly, shouting &quot;Fire!&quot; in a crowded theater isn&#39;t a protected expression.  These actions offer no benefit - and only cause harm - which is why crush videos and other gratuitous depictions of cruelty to animals should remain illegal.  <br /><br />Allowing these videos to be distributed can incite harm by encouraging others who are inclined toward violence to engage in cruel and felonious acts - for the camera or otherwise.  Given the well-established link between cruelty to animals and violence toward humans, it is clear that animal abuse, as well as its gratuitous depictions, must be stamped out at every turn for the sake of the community&#39;s safety.<br /><br />While the Supreme Court did not argue with the fact that forcing dogs to fight and crushing animals to death for sexual gratification are illegal activities, it did <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/supreme-court-strikes-down-animal.php">rule</a> that the wording of the particular statute under which a man was charged for distributing videos that depicted cruelty was overly broad, meaning that now the legislature must immediately draft a new law to protect the public and animals while also protecting free speech.&quot;]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.aldf.org/article.php?id=908"><strong>Matthew Liebman</strong></a> [Staff Attorney, <a href="http://www.aldf.org/">Animal Legal Defense Fund</a>]: &quot;The Animal Legal Defense Fund filed an amicus brief in defense of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/search/display.html?terms=48&url=/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00000048----000-.html">18 U.S.C. Section 48</a>, so we are obviously disappointed by the Court&#39;s <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-769.pdf">opinion</a> [PDF file] in <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/supreme-court-strikes-down-animal.php">United States v. Stevens</a>.  Nevertheless, we are heartened by Justice Alito&#39;s dissent and the way in which the majority chose to frame its decision.<br /><br />First of all, we agree with Justice Alito&#39;s analysis of the case.  Although there are significant differences between child pornography and depictions of animal cruelty, the similarities are overwhelming.  Both involve the exploitation of vulnerable subjects; both involve commercial profit from suffering; both are produced in ways that make it difficult, if not impossible, to prosecute the underlying conduct depicted; and, perhaps most significantly from a constitutional perspective, the existence of a market for both kinds of depictions fuels the commission of the illegal conduct itself.  This last point is proven by the fact that the market for crush videos - gruesome videos that depict women crushing small animals with their feet - was virtually eradicated in the wake of Section 48&#39;s passage, then reemerged after the Third Circuit invalidated Section 48. <br /> <br />Obviously the majority disagreed, at least insofar as these arguments apply to depictions of animal cruelty generally.  It&#39;s always an uphill battle when you&#39;re urging the Supreme Court to recognize a new category of unprotected speech.  But I find it extremely significant that the majority did not follow the Third Circuit in holding that the prevention of animal cruelty is not a compelling government interest.  Such a holding would have had devastating implications for the hundreds of local, state, and federal laws that protect animals.  Instead, the Court based its opinion on overbreadth grounds, while recognizing that &quot;the prohibition of animal cruelty itself has a long history in American law, starting with the early settlement of the Colonies.&quot;  The Court did not explicitly hold that preventing animal cruelty is a compelling government interest, but it refused to foreclose the question when it had a clear invitation to do so.  I view that as an important sign of the progress of animal law and the evolving public consciousness of the importance of protecting animals.   <br /> <br />It is also important to recognize that the Court left open the question of whether a narrower law that covers only &quot;extreme&quot; forms of animal cruelty would pass constitutional muster.  The next steps are clear: we&#39;ll go back to Congress and push for a narrower law that prohibits depictions of crush videos, and perhaps other forms of extreme cruelty such as animal fighting.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.deathpenalty.org/section.php?id=10"><strong>Elizabeth Zitrin</strong></a> [International Outreach and Communications Coordinator, <a href="http://www.deathpenalty.org/">Death Penalty Focus</a>]: &quot;The United States of America, proud of its commitment to fairness and justice, is being left behind on one of the most important international human rights issues of our age.  We are way behind the curve.  Surpassed in human rights by, most recently, Togo and Burundi.  The US has a worse record on the essential human right to life than Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Liberia, Mexico and Rwanda.  And those are only a few of the nations that have left us in the dust, just in this century so far.<br /> <br />In 2009, only 18 nations on the planet <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/death-penalty-use-decreasing-worldwide.php">executed</a> human beings.  This great nation is in that small, shameful community.  To be precise, we placed at number five, behind Saudi Arabia, but with more state killing of people than Yemen, Sudan, Viet Nam and Syria.  China executed more than all other nations combined last year, but they&#39;re just the leader of a club we should not be proud to belong to.<br /><br />We&#39;re in bad company on death sentences too, ranking number six among nations in 2009.  On this horrific scale, we place behind Iraq, Pakistan, Egypt and Afghanistan, just edged out by Sri Lanka, but ahead of Algeria, Malaysia, Bangladesh and the 139 nations of the world that have abolished the death penalty in law or practice.<br /> <br />One hundred thirty-nine.  It&#39;s an important number for Americans to consider as we decide just how slow off the mark we want to be in deciding to join 47 of the 48 nations of Europe (only Belarus is dragging its feet), including all 27 in the European Union; how late to the party hosted by Eleanor Roosevelt, who championed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights over 60 years ago.<br /> <br />One hundred thirty-nine is also the number of people exonerated from death row in the United States since 1976.  The death penalty is not only wrong &#8212; it&#39;s dead wrong, riddled with error - fatal error - and does not keep us any safer, and costs an astronomical amount of money over and above the cost of permanent imprisonment, or life without the possibility of parole.<br /> <br />Positive trends within the US are showing the way, however.  Although US executions were up in 2009, there were many fewer than 10 years ago.  And death sentences were down in 2009, even in Texas and Virginia.  Almost 90% of US executions in 2009 were in the South, and over half of those were in Texas.  New Mexico became the 15th abolitionist state in 2009, and a total of 11 states considered abolition proposals.  And of the 35 states with the death penalty still available, only 11 executed people in 2009.<br /> <br />So, we have both international and home-grown examples of leadership in human rights.  Public opinion in the US slightly favors permanent imprisonment over death, and recent research in California shows that about 75% favor life over death if the life sentence includes working on behalf of the victims&#39; families.  This trend and the weight of history favors abandoning this inhumane and ineffective punishment.  The United States &#8212; all of the United States &#8212; should get on board.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://euc.org.pl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=83&Itemid=54"><strong>Agnieszka Bienczyk-Missala</strong></a> [Lecturer, <a href="http://www.ism.uw.edu.pl/">Institute of International Relations, University of Warsaw</a>]: &quot;On 10 April 2010 one of the most tragic events in Polish post-war history happened.  Polish president Lech Kaczy&Aring;&#8222;ski died in a <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/poland-lower-house-speaker-assumes.php">plane crash</a> on his way to Smolensk in Russia for a Katyn commemoration ceremony.  70 years ago at this place the Soviet Union massacred the Polish elite. The president was accompanied by his wife and distinguished guests. Nobody survived.  The 96 victims included top Polish politicians and servicemen such as the deputy foreign minister, deputy national defense minister, six of the most important military commanders, the head of the Polish National Bank, dozens of members of parliament and heads of national institutions.<br /><br />Seven days of mourning was announced in Poland and Bronis&Aring;&#8218;aw Komorowski, the chief of the lower house of parliament, <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/poland-lower-house-speaker-assumes.php">became</a> the acting president.  He was also nominated as a candidate for the forthcoming presidential elections by the ruling party <a href="http://www.platforma.org/en/">Civic Platform</a>. <br /><br />The tragic plane crash did not influence investors and the Polish Stock-Exchange.  Rather, it had political consequences.  There was a need to nominate the successors of late officials and organize an early presidential election.  However, two candidates died in the plane crash: President Kaczy&Aring;&#8222;ski supported by the main opposition party, <a href="http://www.pis.org.pl/main.php">Law and Justice</a>, and Jerzy Szmajdzi&Aring;&#8222;ski, the left party official candidate. It&#39;s not certain at this time which politicians will get nominations from these parties. <br /><br />The favorite to win the election is Bronis&Aring;&#8218;aw Komorowski, the candidate of ruling Civic Platform, which enjoys the most public support.  But it&#39;s not obvious how the catastrophe will influence Poles&#39; political preferences.  Law and Justice lost its top leaders and some conservative groups and commentators who sympathize with Law and Justice claim that it would be a disadvantage if all government and presidential seats would be in the hands of Civic Platform.  It&#39;s highly probable, that after the mourning period, the opposition will start asking questions concerning the responsibility of Civic Platform for the catastrophe.  The situation can still turn against the ruling party and Bronis&Aring;&#8218;aw Komorowski. <br /><br />Komorowski will try to use his unexpected presidential post to present himself from the best side.  He has given assurances that he would announce the election date after consultations with all political parties and it should be the best possible day for opposition parties that were strongly touched by the catastrophe.  One of his first decisions was the nomination of general Stanis&Aring;&#8218;aw Koziej as a new chief of National Security Office.  General Koziej is a very experienced professional, but according to Law and Justice sympathizers the decision was too fast and provides proof of Civic Platform&#39;s expansive aspirations.  Polish society&#39;s reaction to the loss of the President was extremely strong.  The question of whether that compassion and pain will turn into political support for the Law and Justice candidate seems to be crucial for the political future in Poland.<br /> <br />The tragedy, however, can positively influence Polish-Russian relations, which were extremely difficult after the collapse of communism in Poland in 1989.  The Katy&Aring;&#8222; massacre divided both countries.  Russian authorities did not agree to declassify all documents concerning the mass murder and open archives for Polish historians.  Genuine dialog was not possible, and even today around 30% of Russians still believe that the massacre was perpetrated by Nazis, as the official Soviet propaganda claimed. <br /><br />The climate in Polish-Russian relations was improved two years ago, after Civic Platform won the Polish election.  Political contacts between authorities started to be more intensive.  The Polish-Russian Group for Difficult Affairs was created to work for bilateral dialogue and some positive signs appeared also in the context of the Katy&Aring;&#8222; issue.  Three days before the catastrophe, Katyn was visited by the Polish prime minister Donald Tusk, who was invited by Wladimir Putin for common celebrations.  It happened for the first time in history and was appreciated by Poland.<br /> <br />It is a bitter irony that at the same place Poland again has lost its elite.  Russian authorities demonstrated great understanding and helped to organize evacuation and identification of victims.  The Russian president and prime minister addressed Poles, offering their condolences. The new climate between authorities and the societies of both countries became a matter of fact and this is a good basis for better relations in the future.  On the other hand, declared Polish and Russian interests have been different for years - for example in the spheres of NATO and EU enlargement, the Nord Stream pipe, and democratization in post-soviet areas. These interests cannot simply be changed from day to day.&quot;<br />

		<title>Vatican deserves praise for publishing policies regarding clergy abuse of minors</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.canonlawprofessionals.com/html/about.html"><strong>J. Michael Ritty</strong></a> [Partner, <a href="http://www.canonlawprofessionals.com/index.html">Canon Law Professionals</a>]: &quot;Any sexual abuse of a minor by a cleric is a terrible crime both in canon law and in secular law.  At the same time, the presence of a charge of sexually abusing a minor does not mean that an accused cleric loses the right to due process or the right to be considered innocent until proven guilty in a penal process.<br /> <br />The Vatican does deserve a measure of praise for being more forthcoming about its policies and procedures and for <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/vatican-releases-church-response.php">publishing</a> them on its website.  The <a href="http://www.vatican.va/resources/resources_guide-CDF-procedures_en.html">Guide</a> puts into more understandable language the path to be followed.  It is worth observing  that Msgr. Scicluna&#39;s document about the procedure and praxis of the CDF regarding cases of <span style="font-style:italic;">graviora delicta</span> (which includes clergy sexual abuse of minors) has been around since 2005, but it is good to see it gathered with the other pertinent documents. <br /> <br />I have been working with a number of cases of priests accused of sexual misconduct for quite some time.  In April 2001, Pope John Paul II promulgated <span style="font-style:italic;">Sacramentorum Sanctitatis Tutella</span> (SST).  There were some minor revisions in November 2002 that helped expand these procedures and make it easier to implement and use them.  It should be noted that this document was prepared and published prior to the USCCB meeting in Dallas 2002 that developed the &quot;Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People&quot;  and the &quot;Essential Norms for Diocesan/Eparchial Policies Dealing with Allegations of Sexual Abuse of Minors by Priests or Deacons.&quot; <br /> <br />While SST and the Essential Norms are considered part of the law of the Church in the United States, the Charter is not a law.  Rather, it would be best described as a mutual agreement among the bishops and as a guide that bishops should use as they deal with cases of abuse.<br /> <br />There were two recent documents, &quot;Guide to Understanding Basic CDF Procedures concerning Sexual Abuse Allegations&quot; and &quot;The Procedure and Praxis of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith regarding <span style="font-style:italic;">Graviora Delicta</span>,&quot; placed on the Vatican website.  Based on my work with CDF and with over 100 US dioceses, I have seen little change in the procedures over the last 10 years.  CDF has followed this procedure and praxis diligently.  Dioceses have continued to develop policies for reviewing cases within the diocese.<br /> <br />I have met with Monsignor Scicluna and other CDF officials and have found them to be most helpful to me and most concerned that the law is followed and that justice is obtained.  For those cases in which a person is guilty of abuse, they must be appropriately punished.  In cases where an accused is found innocent, they must be declared as such and where possible returned to ministry.  Sadly, sometimes it is not possible for an innocent priest to be returned to ministry because of the publicity and emotion surrounding a case. <br /> <br />I would note that in my case load about 20% of those accused have been cleared of the charges brought against them.  I would also note anecdotally that many of those who are guilty of multiple violations often have many more false accusations raised against them.  Yet, for most who are accused of sexual abuse, the stigma often remains even after it has been shown that they are not guilty.  There have been cases where civil law attorneys or insurance adjusters have advised bishops to keep anyone who has been accused of sexual abuse out of any ministry even if they are found innocent of the charges.<br /> <br />In summary, while there are times that I would like to have a greater transparency in this process and I would like to see this process move more quickly, the process works.  If there is a failure at any point, that failure usually occurs with an over-zealous diocesan official who acts on the belief that any and all allegations are automatically true regardless of the facts of the case.&quot;<br />

		<title>Holder should reject military commissions and indefinite detention policy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://ccrjustice.org/about-us/staff-board/kashani%2C-leili"><strong>Leili Kashani</strong></a> [Education and Outreach Associate, Guant&aacute;namo Global Justice Initiative, <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a>]: &quot;On April 14, 2010, Attorney General Eric Holder appeared at a <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/holder-not-ruling-out-civilian-trials.php">hearing</a> before the Senate Judiciary Committee to answer a range of questions about the Department of Justice. While CCR was glad to see that Holder has not ruled out trying the alleged 9/11 plotters in New York and in federal courts, we were dismayed that he did not reject the irredeemably flawed military commissions and an ongoing policy of indefinite detention without charge or trial that only serves to move Guant&aacute;namo to a new location and give it a new name.<br /><br />Military commissions are politically driven and constitute a second-rate system of justice reserved exclusively for Arab and Muslim men deemed unworthy of our criminal justice system. They were designed to manufacture convictions and allow men to be tried in secret without the right to confront their accusers and based on evidence obtained by coercion or compulsory self-incrimination, including illegal interrogation methods. They deservedly lack credibility in the United States and abroad, and their rulings will be delayed or overturned by many years of litigation. As an unfair system, they not only risk convicting the innocent, but also provide someone who is truly guilty with a valid complaint to challenge his conviction. This delays justice and doesn&#39;t help anyone. The United States has a long history of effectively and safely trying terrorism suspects as criminals in federal courts; there has never been any significant security breach, and there is no legitimate reason to turn away from federal courts now.<br /><br />Holder and Democratic lawmakers repeatedly defended using both federal courts and military commissions for trials by citing Justice Department statistics: more than 400 terrorists have been convicted in federal courts since September 11, 2001, while during the last 8 years only 3 men have been convicted in military commissions. CCR supports federal courts because they are more just and effective, not because, as one Democratic senator put it, they allow the government to have the flexibility to select the court best poised to secure a conviction. <br /><br />Holder&#39;s assertion that 48 men currently at Guant&aacute;namo will be held indefinitely without charge or trial should startle us, and again confirms that the Obama administration is more concerned with shutting down the symbol of Guant&aacute;namo than with ending the fundamental abuse of power and law that exists there. The administration has said that indefinite detention is necessary for &quot;people who cannot be prosecuted for past crimes, in some cases, because evidence may be tainted, but who, nonetheless, pose a threat to the security of the United States.&quot; What the Obama administration continues to obscure is that evidence &quot;tainted&quot; by torture or coercion is no evidence at all, and if a man cannot be proven guilty in a court of law based on legitimate evidence, then he must be released.<br /><br />Holder&#39;s weak response in the face of Senator Lindsey Graham&#39;s (R-S.C.) insistence that the country is fighting a war &quot;where the whole world is the battlefield&quot; revealed a key continuity between Bush and Obama administration policies. The Obama administration has justified inheriting the expansive detention powers claimed by the Bush administration by maintaining that the US is locked into a boundless war against an amorphous enemy. Accepting this premise undermines the Obama administration&#39;s capacity to forcefully defend its own policies against Right-wing attack. Having cast terrorists as combatants rather than criminals, and having characterized the country as being in an endless war with a stateless enemy, the Obama administration has a harder time advocating its policies of shutting down Guant&aacute;namo, supporting federal trials for terrorist suspects, respecting human rights, and restoring the rule of law.<br />  <br />The Center for Constitutional Rights has consistently rejected the logic of the so-called &quot;War on Terror&quot; and considers terrorism to be a criminal act rather than an act of war. CCR will continue to advocate an end to military commissions and indefinite detention wherever it occurs: whether it continues at Guant&aacute;namo, is brought to the United States, or is perpetuated elsewhere. The men detained must be charged in federal courts or released; there is no acceptable third category of individuals who can be held indefinitely without perpetuating the egregious abuses of that island-prison, further damaging our democratic institutions and threatening our collective safety.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.lw.com/Attorneys.aspx?page=AttorneyBio&attno=02954"><strong>Scott Ballenger</strong></a> [Partner, <a href="http://www.lw.com/">Latham &amp; Watkins, LLP</a>]: &quot;The Supreme Court&#39;s <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-769.pdf">decision</a> [PDF file] in <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/supreme-court-strikes-down-animal.php">United States v. Stevens</a> is remarkably narrow.  The Court <span style="font-style:italic;">did not</span> say that depictions of extreme animal cruelty are protected by the First Amendment.  The Court&#39;s majority held only that the present federal depictions law was facially overbroad because it could be interpreted to ban hunting videos that had some redeeming social value.  The majority did not even decide whether the statute was unconstitutional as applied to the dogfighting videos distributed by Mr. Stevens himself - merely that Stevens was entitled to benefit from the fact that the law would be unconstitutional as applied to hypothetical hunting videos.  The Court carefully left open whether Congress could draft a narrower law that would not reach hunting videos but only depictions of extreme and illegal cruelty, such as &quot;crush&quot; and animal fighting videos.<br /><br />There are at least two victories for the animal welfare movement embedded in the Court&#39;s opinion.  First, the Third Circuit had resolved the case by holding that there is no compelling interest in protecting animals from cruel and inhumane treatment.  As Justice Alito&#39;s dissent points out, &quot;[t]oday&#39;s decision does not endorse the Court of Appeals&#39; reasoning.&quot;  To the contrary, the Court unanimously recognized the long history of animal cruelty laws dating back to the founding of our country, and assumed for purposes of decision that a law targeting depictions only of extreme animal cruelty may be constitutional. Justice Alito&#39;s dissent explains that &quot;[t]he animals used in crush videos are living creatures that experience excruciating pain,&quot; and that &quot;the Court of Appeals erred in second-guessing the legislative judgment about the importance of preventing cruelty to animals.&quot;  Nothing in the majority opinion disagrees with those remarks in any way.  From an animal welfare perspective, the Supreme Court&#39;s opinion is an enormous improvement over the reasoning adopted by the court of appeals.<br /> <br />Second, as Justice Alito points out in a footnote, &quot;the Court has taken pains not to decide whether <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/search/display.html?terms=48&url=/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00000048----000-.html">section 48</a> would be unconstitutional as applied to graphic dogfight videos, including those depicting fights occurring in countries where dogfighting is legal.&quot;  Mr. Stevens and many of his <span style="font-style:italic;">amici</span> took the position in the Supreme Court that the statute could constitutionally be applied only to &quot;crush&quot; videos - which, because they have prurient (sexual) appeal to certain individuals, may be classified as &quot;obscene&quot; under established First Amendment doctrine.  The Humane Society had argued in its <span style="font-style:italic;">amicus</span> brief that animal fighting videos should be considered just as &quot;obscene&quot; for constitutional purposes, even though they have no particularly sexual content, because they appeal only to base instincts and have no redeeming social value.  The Supreme Court went out of its way not to reject that argument, and did not rely at all upon animal fighting videos when cataloguing the hypotheticals that it thought would be constitutionally protected.  Since there were no concurring opinions, the Supreme Court apparently believes <span style="font-style:italic;">unanimously</span> that Congress may have the power to ban trafficking in videos of animal fighting - even videos of fights that were legal where filmed, and even where traditional obscenity doctrine would not apply.&quot;<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Scott Ballenger represented the <a href="http://www.humanesociety.org/">Humane Society of the United States</a> in filing its amicus curiae brief with the Supreme Court in <u>United States v. Stevens</u>.</span>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Iraqi High Court&#039;s Understated Rise to Legitimacy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/faculty/researchpost.php?postid=427">Haider Ala Hamoudi</a> of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law says that a look at recent decisions by Iraq&#39;s Federal Supreme Court illustrates the court&#39;s growing authority as an independent and legitimate voice in matters of constitutional interpretation....<br /><hr size=1>  <br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/hamoudi.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><strong>T</strong></font>here has been much attention recently devoted to the Iraqi elections and the government that will result from them.  Unfortunately, the elections have detracted from a more interesting salutary legal development that has made the entire political process run much more smoothly.  This is the growing independence of the Federal Supreme Court and its ability to solve what would be rather intractable problems in a manner that has been broadly accepted as legitimate. <br /><br />Any number of cases come to mind, but perhaps the two which stand out most prominently are the Court's recent decision, No. 25 of 2010, as well as an earlier decision issued in December, No. 76 of 2009.  The latest decision issued by the Court, concerning Article 76 of the Iraqi Constitution, was probably the more important.  While Rod Nordland of the <em>New York Times</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/28/world/middleeast/28iraq.html">reported</a> recently that until the Court's ruling, the meaning of Article 76 was not contested, in fact almost the reverse was true.  The provision had been deeply and seriously debated in legal and political circles for months.  The provision requires the President to choose a prime minister-designate from the "representative bloc with the highest number," who would have first opportunity to form a government.  The phrase, however, is hardly clear in that it might refer to an election list&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;in which case the list that had done the best in the elections would have first opportunity&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;and it might refer to a post election coalition.  Ironically, throughout 2009 it was the Sunni coalitions&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;and most pointedly the Vice Chair of the Legal Committee, Selim Al-Jibouri&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;who had advanced with some passion the latter interpretation, and it was Maliki's men, Ali Allaq and Abbas Bayati, who had insisted that the phrase had to mean the winning pre-election list.  The reasons they held to these positions seemed rather clear from considerations of self interest&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;everyone assumed until rather early in 2010 that Maliki was most likely to win the plurality of seats in the election.  After the election, which a Sunni coalition had won, and in which Maliki came a close second, the positions of the two groups on the question of Article 76 were precisely reversed, precisely in keeping with their self interest. <br /><br />For those of us following Iraqi politics, this matter of Article 76 was of serious concern because of the rather fierce nature of the debates concerning its interpretation for some time. Given that the politicians themselves had flipped on the matter, they clearly had no credibility or authority to impose a sensible interpretation of the Article. It seemed as if the matter has to be resolved by the Federal Supreme Court, but that even if it did make a ruling there was a real risk the Court itself would be maligned by one side or the other.  Fortunately, the Court ruled and the criticisms were muted.  The Court, in a tersely worded one-page opinion, indicated that as the term "bloc" does not necessarily seem to reference any pre-electoral coalition, and as the sequence of events pursuant to which the government is formed is careful and detailed, the natural conclusion is that the bloc did not have to be a pre-election coalition.  As contested as the continuing political wrangling has become, this particular decision, of potentially enormous consequence, has been accepted by the major parties.  The Court had thus used the law to defuse a potentially violent debate.<br /><br />The second important decision came last year just as the Iraqi Council of Representatives was getting ready to approve a resolution concerning the interpretation of an Amended Electoral Law, as demanded by Vice President Hashimi if he was not to veto the law.  Some parliamentarians, however, argued that the ten-day deadline to veto the law had already passed and that Hashimi's veto threat was therefore empty.  Again, the matter was referred to the Federal Supreme Court for clarification.  The narrow legal issue was whether Article 138 of the Constitution, which required a veto within ten days, included only business days, or whether all calendar days were included.  Analogizing from similar provisions in the Civil Procedure Code, the Court concluded that in fact the days did not include any holidays, but that if the last day of the ten-day period fell on a non-working day, then the period extended until the next working day.  Applying this rule, the Court ruled that the veto would not expire until Sunday, December 6.  Again, the decision was followed without objection from the legislature, which did in the end issue a resolution that avoided a veto before the deadline.<br /><br />To be clear, Iraq's Federal Supreme Court is hardly able to defuse all political crises within Iraq that have a legal component, and if it were to attempt to do so, its credibility could be damaged.  This may well be why the Court has wisely avoided attempting to deal with the thorny constitutional issues concerning ownership and management of oil and gas, or the fate of Kirkuk.   But this limitation of judicial authority in the realm of the political is true of all judicial institutions, including our own Supreme Court, which&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;when it has entered into highly charged political debates, whether those concern the election of a President in this century, or the institution of slavery in an earlier one&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;seems to have lost some credibility in the process. <br /><br />The remarkable fact is not therefore the limitations of the Iraqi High Court, but rather its rising authority as an independent and legitimate voice in matters of constitutional interpretation.   We can only hope that this encouraging trend will continue.<br /><br /><br /><em>Haider Ala Hamoudi is a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.

		<title>Is Health Care Reform Constitutional?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.washington.edu/directory/Profile.aspx?ID=261">Sallie Sanford</a> of the University of Washington School of Law says that although challenges to the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act are valuable for inspiring dialogue within and outside the legal community, they are unlikely to succeed in the face of decades of Supreme Court case law....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/salliesanford.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->T<odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->he ink had barely dried on the president's signature when the lawsuits commenced.  Three lawsuits filed in federal court now challenge the constitutionality of key provisions in the new health care reform law.    <br /><br />If a court does reach the merits in these lawsuits, it will almost certainly uphold the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Under existing case law, Congress has appropriate authority under either its power to regulate interstate commerce or its power to tax and spend for the general welfare. To find otherwise would require a significant shift in Constitutional jurisprudence.  <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">The Individual Mandate</span> <br /><br />The primary challenge in each of the lawsuits is to the "individual mandate" &#8212; the requirement in the new law that most citizens have health insurance or pay a tax penalty.  There are several statutory exemptions, including for religious objections, for financial hardship, and if the least expensive plan would cost more than 8% of household income.  <br /><br />Unless an exemption applies, however, each citizen will be required to have health insurance, either through Medicare, Medicaid, an employer-sponsored plan, or individual purchase; premium and cost-sharing subsidies will be available for those with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty level. People who are required to have insurance and do not will be taxed, with the tax rate ratcheting up over time to reach $695 per person or 2.5% of household income, whichever is greater. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Commerce Clause and Tax and Spend Authority</span><br /><br />Under our system of government, Congress may exercise only those powers that are specified by the Constitution or that are "necessary and proper" for exercising those express powers.  Among the express powers is the regulation of interstate commerce.  <br /><br />In the 1942 case of <u>Wickard v. Filburn</u>, the US Supreme Court considered a challenge to the federal government's authority to regulate, under a Depression-era price-stabilization law, wheat grown for a farmer's own personal use.  The court concluded that this wheat production, though not for sale, did impact interstate commerce because it reduced the amount the farmer would buy and, considering the activities of similar-minded farmers, would impact the total amount grown.  <br /><br />Following this decision, a variety of federal laws have been upheld as authorized under this power to regulate activities that "arise out of or are connected with a commercial transaction, which viewed in the aggregate, substantially affects interstate commerce."  In the <u>Heart of Atlanta Motel</u> case, for example, the Court held that a motel owner's decision not to allow black people to rent rooms impacts interstate commerce and thus could be prohibited by the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Even the federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban was grounded in Congress' interstate commerce powers.  <br /><br />Health care constitutes a huge portion of our nation's economy, currently constituting more than 17% of the GDP.  Both health care and health insurance indisputably impact interstate commerce.   <br /><br />Two modern cases have, on a 5-4 basis, overturned federal laws as beyond the scope of the Commerce Clause.  In the 1995 case of <u>United States v. Lopez</u>, the Court struck down a law mandating a gun-free zone around public schools because it was "a criminal statute that by its terms had nothing to do with 'commerce' or any sort of economic enterprise." The court wrote that there must be a distinction between Congress' authority and the general police powers retained by the states, between "what is truly national and what is truly local."  Utilizing a similar rationale, and also on a 5-4 basis, the Court's 2000 decision in <u>United States v. Morrison</u> invalidated part of the Violence Against Women Act.   <br /><br />In 2005, however, a 6-3 Supreme Court decision, <u>Gonzales v. Raich</u>, once again affirmed an expansive view of the Commerce Clause.  The Court held that the federal government has the power to supersede state law, and to prohibit marijuana cultivation, even if grown at home for personal medical use and not for sale.   <br /><br />Writing for the majority, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote that: "We need not determine whether respondents' activities, taken in the aggregate, substantially affect interstate commerce in fact, but only whether a 'rational basis' exists for so concluding."  Congress could rationally conclude that medical marijuana might find its way into interstate commerce, and, as with Farmer Filburn's wheat, that growing one's own could impact the overall market, particularly considering the cumulative impact of numerous growers. <br /><br />Justices Anthony Kennedy and Antonin Scalia formed part of the Raich majority.  Justice Scalia's concurrence explains that this case differed from Lopez and Morrison (in which both he and Kennedy had voted to limit Congress' authority) and that Congress may in the appropriate circumstance regulate non-economic intrastate activity.  <br /><br />In his <u>Raich</u> concurrence, Justice Scalia maintains that "the authority to enact laws necessary and proper for the regulation of interstate commerce is not limited to laws governing intrastate activities that substantially affect interstate commerce. Where necessary to make a regulation of interstate commerce effective, Congress may regulate even those intrastate activities that do not themselves substantially affect interstate commerce." Under the structure of the new health reform law, the requirement to have insurance is integral to Congress' overall approach to regulating insurance practices and attempting to stabilize the insurance market.  <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">The Inactivity Argument</span><br /><br />The plaintiffs in the pending lawsuits argue, however, that the individual mandate is different because it attempts to regulate inactivity.  By definition, they maintain, a person who declines to purchase health insurance is not engaging in commerce at all.   <br /><br />A gamble to remain uninsured does, however, impose economic costs in at least two ways.  The first is when an uninsured person seeks medical treatment. Because of a federal emergency care law, state legal requirements, hospital mission obligation, and actions rooted in medical ethics, that care is sometimes mandated and is often provided. Particularly when the patient comes in through the emergency room, as is not infrequently the case, costs are substantial and often go unpaid, either because of a decision at the outset to provide "charity care" or because the patient does not pay the bill.   <br /><br />Findings in the new law estimate the costs of providing uncompensated care at $43 billion in 2008.  While many of these costs are ultimately borne by federal, state, and local governments (in the form of subsidies to hospitals and clinics), a substantial amount is shifted to insured patients.  Findings in the new law estimate that $1,000 of the cost of an employer-provided family insurance premium (out of an average of about $13,000) is attributable to uncompensated care
.   <br /><br />The second way that being uninsured imposes economic costs is by shifting the insured risk pool.  Among the approximately one in seven United States citizens who lack insurance, a significant percentage is young and healthy.  By not participating in the insurance market, by gambling that they will not need expensive health care (or that if they do, someone else will pick up the tab), they skew insurance pools towards an older and sicker population, raising the premium costs. Thus, this sort of inactivity or non-participation does have an economic impact, and certainly a far more substantial economic impact than the growing of marijuana for personal, medical use.  <br /><br />The plaintiffs also argue that unlike with state requirements to have car insurance, one cannot avoid the requirement by declining the activity.  One can avoid a state's requirement to purchase car insurance by not driving. Unless an exemption applies, however, one cannot avoid the requirement to have health insurance, as it is attached simply to the condition of being a citizen.  <br /><br />There is no direct precedent for a federal law requiring purchase of a private product without the option to not engage in the triggering activity. Businesses can in theory avoid federal requirements to install (privately purchased) environmental or safety equipment by not engaging in the business.  Those of us who did not want to buy a new television or sign up for cable service to maintain realistic access after the recent conversion could simply not watch television at home.  <br /><br />More to the point, though, the health reform law does offer a choice.  Rather than purchasing health insurance (though an employer-sponsored plan or on the individual market) one can choose to pay the tax.  The tax has been criticized by many, in fact, as being too low to act as an incentive.  These critics raise the policy concern that some will choose to pay the tax until they get expensively sick or injured and then, based on other, inexorably linked provisions in the new law, insurance companies will be obligated to sell them a plan without pre-existing condition limits or cost adjustments. <br /><br />The Supreme Court has long upheld the ability of the federal government to regulate behavior through taxation.  In a 1937 case, the Court noted that "[e]very tax is in some measure regulatory. . . . But [it] is not any less a tax because it has a regulatory effect[.]" Congress' taxation power cannot burden a fundamental right, but there is no fundamental right to be uninsured.  Some have argued that if this is not really a behavior-encouraging and revenue-raising tax but more of a pure penalty, then there needs to be a separate source of authority, such as the power to regulate interstate commerce.  <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">The Current Court</span><br /><br />Even if that is true, the Supreme Court, as described above, has recently reaffirmed a broad interpretation of the commerce clause.  The two most recent justices to join the court replaced two dissenters, and thus if they change the calculus it would be to add support to the view that the law is constitutional.  Justice Scalia, however, who concurred in the judgment in <u>Raich</u>, has long advocated an "originalist" or more limited view of federal power.  It is conceivable that he might find that the health care reform's individual mandate goes beyond the reach of federal powers and into the state's police power domain.   <br /><br />That potentially leaves Justice Kennedy as the swing vote.  And, of course, the author of the <u>Raich</u> opinion has just announced that he will retire at the end of the current term.  The loss of Justice Steven's persuasive force might have an impact on the court's analysis.  <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Medicaid Expansion and Insurance Exchanges</span><br /><br />The Florida Attorney General's lawsuit, which a dozen other attorneys general have joined, also contends that the new law encroaches on state sovereignty by creating state-based insurance exchanges and by expanding Medicaid eligibility.  Both of these provisions, they argue, will impose on the states increased costs and expanded administrative burdens and, generally, will "commandeer" them into the service of the federal government.   <br /><br />These arguments have even less of a chance of success than do those related to the individual mandate.  The states are not required to set up the exchanges.  Under the terms of the law, if a state does not do so, the federal government will.  To encourage states to use their regulatory and administrative powers to set up these exchanges, the law offers some funding.   <br /><br />Similarly, states are legally free to drop out of the Medicaid program and to forego the matching dollars that accompany it.  Medicaid is a joint federal-state program in which the federal government sends financial support to state programs that, in compliance with federal guidelines, provide health care to low-income people. Wealthier states have a baseline 50/50 match, meaning that for every dollar they spend, the federal government contributes at least a dollar.  The less well-off states have at least a 25/75 match.   <br /><br />It is true that, as a practical matter, states are heavily reliant on the matching Medicaid dollars to care for their poorest citizens and to support key safety-net health care providers.  It is also true that Medicaid funding is a significant part of most states' beleaguered budgets.  The new law expands eligibility by opening the program up to all citizens and legal residents with incomes below 133% of the federal poverty level.  This will have the effect of adding many adults to the program.  Initially, the federal government will cover all of the costs of providing care to the newly eligible, though this coverage will ratchet down to 90% over a few years.  <br /><br />The Supreme Court has upheld similar conditional-spending arrangements as valid exercises of Congress' tax and spend authority.  In <u>South Dakota v. Dole</u>, for example, the Court upheld a federal law that withheld 5% of highway funds from any state that did not raise its legal drinking age to 21. The Court did recognize in Dole that "in some circumstances the financial inducement offered by Congress might be so coercive as to pass the point at which 'pressure turns into compulsion.'&quot;  To date, the Court has not identified such a circumstance. <br /><br />It is hard to reasonably argue that the new law's Medicaid expansion inducement reaches the point of compulsion.  Congress has changed Medicaid conditions numerous times over the years and, with this new eligibility expansion, the federal government will initially assume most of the costs of the newly eligible. The exchanges present even less of a case for compulsion as they do not yet exist, and the new law provides some administrative funds for their establishment. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Procedural Hurdles</span><br /><br />The plaintiffs also face significant hurdles before a court would get to the merits of their claims. One hurdle is ripeness.  The challenged provisions do not go into effect for several years.  In general, a claim is not ripe for adjudication if it rests upon contingent future events that might not occur; an exception might be made for a purely legal challenge to a law, such as this one, that will require significant advance groundwork.  However, with Republican calls to "repeal and replace," it is not far-fetched to wonder if the challenged provisions will survive.  Such was the fate of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act, which, in the late 1980s, was repealed before it went into effect.  <br /><br />Another procedural hurdle is standing.  In general, only those who are being, or imminently will be harmed by a law can challenge its constitutionality.  The individual mandate, if it were in effect, would certainly harm some individuals.  Its harm to the states is less clear, and it is on the states' behalf that the plaintiffs in the Florida case have filed their complain
t.  <br /><br />In a 2007 case, the Supreme Court did grant states standing to challenge the EPA's inaction on greenhouse gas regulation, finding sufficient injury on the theory that the states were impacted by potential changes to their coastlines and to overall environmental wellbeing. Drawing on this 5-4 decision, perhaps the states could make a not-yet-articulated argument having to do with diverted state tax revenue and population wellbeing, but this seems a stretch. The separate complaint filed by the Virginia attorney general is based on that state's recent enactment of a law purporting to nullify the individual mandate as to Virginia residents, and the defense of that law perhaps provides a toe-hold into standing.  The Thomas More Law Center plaintiffs do include four individual citizens.   And of course, if the other complaints survive the ripeness and other challenges, individuals might join as plaintiffs.  <br /><br />Nonetheless, based on decades of Supreme Court case law, the substantive challenges to the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act are unlikely to succeed.  They are likely, though, to continue to inspire discussions within the legal community and within the general public about the role of government, the nature of health care, and the obligations of citizens. Perhaps that, in itself, is a valuable outcome.  <br />    <br /><br /><em>Sallie Sanford is an Assistant Professor of Law at the University of Washington.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist Lt. Col. Chris Jenks (USA), Chief of the International Law Branch of the Office of the Judge Advocate General, says that the discussion on child soldiers in general and Omar Khadr in particular should be broadened to move past misperceptions of the applicable law and norms concerning detention and prosecution of child combatants....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/chrisjenks.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->I<odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->n the fall of 2009, Attorney General Eric Holder announced that Canadian Omar Khadr would likely be tried by military commission for, among other offenses, the murder of U.S. Army Sergeant First Class <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/khadr-likely-to-face-military.php">Christopher Speer</a>. Khadr is alleged to have thrown a grenade which killed Speer and wounded another U.S. Army soldier during a 2002 engagement in Afghanistan.  Khadr also faces other <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/commissionsKhadr.html">charges</a> which stem from his alleged participation in: al Qaeda "basic training," land mine training, the conversion of land mines into improvised explosive devices, and the shooting and killing of two Afghan militia members. <br /><br />Canada's <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/canada-government-will-not-seek-khadr.php">announcement</a> that it will not seek Khadr's repatriation means that not only is Khadr likely to face trial by military commission, he may well be the first to do so under the revised commissions the Obama administration employs. <br /><br />Much of the attention on Khadr's case has focused on his age &#8212; according to his defense counsel he was 15 years and 10 months at the time of his alleged offenses. Much of the attendant criticism which flows from Khadr's age when detained, and the authority to hold him criminally responsible, is misdirected if not misplaced. Such critiques overlook well established international norms which provide not only for restricting Khadr's liberty but also for holding him accountable for any crimes he may have committed.  These norms are extant both in the <span style="font-style:italic;">lex specialis</span>, the law of armed conflict (LOAC), and in more general international law writ large.  The discussion about child soldiers could, and should, be broader.<br /><br />Under the LOAC, the Fourth Geneva Convention on civilians discusses the detention of individuals who, like Khadr, don't qualify as either members of a regular or irregular armed force and thus are not considered prisoners of war under the Third Geneva Convention. Additionally (and more specifically), regardless of whether you characterize the armed conflict in Afghanistan in 2002 as international (IAC) or non-international (NIAC) in nature, the Additional Protocols (AP) to the Geneva Convention clearly envision the detention of "children" who directly participate in hostilities. While the United States has not ratified either of the APs, and one can argue about the applicability of the various Geneva Conventions to the current conflicts, through Department of Defense Directive 2311.01E, the United States policy is to apply the law of war during all armed conflicts, regardless of how such conflicts are characterized. Perhaps more relevant to this discussion, the majority of the world has ratified the APs and detention of individuals like Khadr is consistent with those widely subscribed instruments.<br /><br />Additional Protocol I, which deals with IAC, discusses the protection of children in art. 77. While art. 77 affords special protections, those protections apply to children under 15.  Even then, the special protections do not preclude children, even those under 15, from being arrested, detained, or interned if they take a direct part in hostilities.  Under AP I, persons who had not reached 18 years of age when they committed an offense related to armed conflict are not subject to the death penalty.  The clear inference is that such individuals may be held criminally responsible for their actions and subject to punishment, just not capital punishment.<br /><br />Additional Protocol II, which deals with NIAC, describes the care and aid children require in art. 4, and in slightly more detail than AP I.  It does so first as applied to children who do not take a direct part in hostilities or who have ceased to take part in hostilities.  It then qualifies that the special protections remain applicable to children under 15 who have taken a direct part of hostilities. Again though, the special protections do not include protection or immunity from internment or detention, and wouldn't apply to Khadr anyway as he was not under 15.<br /><br />Most of the provisions of the APs reflect current U.S. practice (see Michael Matheson, The US Position on the Relation of Customary International Law to the 1977 Protocols Additional to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, Remarks before Session One of the Humanitarian Law Conference (Fall 1987), 2 AM. U. J. Int&#39;l Law &amp; Pol&#39;y 419 (1987). But to the extent that the APs are considered anachronisms and not indicative of evolving norms against child soldiers, fair enough.  Yet the normative evolution focuses on increasing the minimum age for direct participation in hostilities and for recruitment into armed groups--not on preventing prosecutions of those in violation of the norm.  The detention provisions of the LOAC should not be viewed as an aberration or radical departure from how the world community otherwise views detention and prosecution of child offenders.  They are not.<br /><br />The international community has struggled to reach consensus on at what age children may be held criminally responsible. The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) defines a child as anyone under 18 and while the CRC provides special protections to children, those protections don't include immunity from prosecution and punishment (other than capital punishment or life imprisonment without possibility of release).  The United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice (Beijing Rules) were also not able to agree on an age trigger for criminal responsibility, instead that decision is left to individuals States with the guidance that the age should not be set at too low a level and should reflect emotional, mental, and intellectual maturity.  Under the Rome Statute, the International Criminal Court lacks jurisdiction over persons under the age of 18 while the Statute for the Special Court for Sierra Leone allowed for prosecution of children age 15 and older, although no such prosecutions occurred.<br /><br />The era of the <span style="font-style:italic;">doli incapax</span> rule, an irrebutable presumption that children may not be held criminally responsibly, is over. Even when it existed, it did not extend past the age of 14. This is borne out in international practice, for example in 1993 the United Kingdom found two 11-year-olds criminally responsible for kidnapping and murdering a two year old boy.  In reviewing that decision, the European Court for Human Rights, in <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=1&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=24888/94&sessionid=50821553&skin=hudoc-en">T and V v. UK</a>, ruled that attributing criminal responsibility to a 10 year old did not in and of itself give rise to a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.  The Court also noted that the age of ten cannot be said to be so young as to differ disproportionately from the age-limit followed by other European States. <br /><br />While aspects of children and criminal responsibility are either unsettled or left to individual nations, at a minimum we should acknowledge that the LOAC provides authority to detain and prosecute i
ndividuals like Khadr. Moreover, in the broader sense, there isn't a norm governing the age of criminal responsibility but if there was (or is), the prosecution of an individual two months shy of their 16th birthday for murder would fit safely within its ambit.<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Chris Jenks is a Lieutenant Colonel and Judge Advocate in the United States Army.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a target="_blank" href="http://ccrjustice.org/about-us/staff-board/kadidal%2C-shayana">Shayana Kadidal</a>, senior managing attorney of the Guantanamo project at the Center for Constitutional Rights, says the question of whether the government can criminally prosecute an attorney for representing a client said by the executive to be a member of al Qaeda is unfortunately unresolved under current law....<br /><hr size="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forumy/shanekadidal.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table> <font size="3"><b>N</b></font>oted pundits Bill Kristol and Liz Cheney have dubbed a number of US Justice Department lawyers the "Al Qaeda 7" for representing or advocating on behalf of the rights of Guantanamo detainees. Kristol and Cheney seemingly claim that anyone representing people the executive labels as terrorists is supporting terrorism themselves. Of course, just because your dad says someone is a terrorist doesn't make them a terrorist; that's why we have courts, due process, and lawyers in this country. The "Al Qaeda 7" campaign has justifiably received harsh criticism on these grounds from critics on the political Left and Right (including one person who lost his job for attempting a similarly scurrilous attack on Guantanamo lawyers in 2007).</p>

<p>These critics would surely be surprised to find out that the very question of whether the government can criminally prosecute an attorney for representing a client said by the executive to be a member of al Qaeda is unresolved under current law. It is by no means clear under current caselaw that an attorney can form an attorney-client relationship - even pro bono - in such circumstances without exposing themselves to criminal liability under a variety of sanctions regimes prohibiting support for terrorism.</p>

<p>A variant on this question was just before the Supreme Court in <u>Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project</u>, a case challenging one of these regimes, the "material support" statute. Under that criminal statute (18 U.S.C. § 2339B), created in 1996, the government can create lists of foreign terrorist organizations. There are few restrictions on the scope of the designation power--a group that uses violence only against property and harms only the economic interests of the United States can be included--and little opportunity to get off the list. Once a group is on the list (which for all federal sanctions schemes is <a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/sdn/t11sdn.pdf">currently 450 pages long</a>), almost any form of association with the group or its members becomes a serious felony--providing material support to a terrorist organization--punishable by 15 years in prison. While a layperson might assume that "material support" was limited to providing arms or money to such a group, it is defined much more broadly in the statute. And through three administrations, the government has consistently claimed that things like writing an op-ed or an amicus brief on behalf of a blacklisted organization constitutes providing your own personal "services" (or yourself as "personnel," or your "expert advice or assistance" or any number of amorphous terms in the statute) to the group.</p>

<p>When <u>Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project</u> was argued to the Court on February 23, the government argued (as it has for years) that submitting amicus briefs "for" a blacklisted organization is a criminal act. The Court, understandably, was intrigued, and for seven pages of the transcript the Court explored the issue, eventually asking when a lawyer could even represent a group (or, by extension, its members) in an American court: </p>

<p>Justice Breyer: "I just want to know if [this] is what you're saying ... an organization that [is] engaged in terrible stuff, that they are not entitled under the Constitution to have a lawyer in the Untied States who does legal work like filing amicus briefs."</p>

<p>Obama's Solicitor General Elena Kagan: "To the extent that there is any constitutional claim that they would be entitled to representation, whether it's a Sixth Amendment claim or a due process claim that might exist in criminal cases, that might exist in habeas cases, that might exist in civil cases, then the government believes that the statute should be read so as not to include that [in the scope of what is criminally prohibited]." </p>

<p>(Here's a <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-1498.pdf">link to the transcript</a>, at page/line 49:15 to 50:2.) The hypothetical continued past the notion of actually writing the brief, and into whether a lawyer could explain how to submit such a brief:</p>

<p>Justice Kennedy: "Can you [say] ... here's how to file an amicus brief?"</p>

<p>Kagan: "....you can't. Because when you tell people [that], you've given them an extremely valuable skill that they can use for all kinds of purposes."</p>

<p>(That's at pages 51:18 to 52:6 of <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-1498.pdf">the transcript</a>.)</p>

<p>These answers actually hew quite closely to the most comfort the caselaw can give attorneys on this score: an opinion, written by Justice Ginsburg when she was a judge on the D.C. Circuit, called <u>American Airways Charters, Inc. v. Regan</u>, 746 F.2d 872 (D.C. Cir. 1984). That opinion concerned whether a lawyer could represent an entity that was targeted under the Cuban economic embargo regulations, which bar most transactions (whether they involve money or not) between Cuban nationals and Americans. The court said that the government could ban payments to the lawyer (and in fact the Cuban government's lawyers in the U.S. need annual licenses to get paid for their work). But on the question of whether the lawyer could form an attorney-client relationship with his blacklisted client - that is, whether he could represent them at all, even <i>pro bono</i> - the court only offered this small comfort: where the Due Process clause of the Constitution guaranteed some rights enforceable in court to the client, then the lawyer could provide his legal "services" for free without fear of criminal prosecution.</p>

<p>That is small comfort to attorneys in the public interest community. After all, we spent six years representing Guantanamo detainees in the course of convincing the government that they had some constitutional right to habeas corpus. (According to the government, that was only established with the Supreme Court's <u>Boumediene v. Bush</u> decision in 2008.)</p>

<p>We know now, after many years of litigation and the release of some 590 detainees, that most of the men held at Guantanamo were not in fact members of Al Qaeda or the Taliban. It turns out Liz Cheney's dad <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article7092435.ece">understood</a> that <a href="http://www.truthout.org/files/Wilkerson.pdf">from the start</a>. But if Cheney père's public statements at the time had been correct in claiming that there were many members of banned groups there, then we lawyers would have been risking more than just our careers and reputations when we stepped into this work in 2002.</p>

<p>Kagan's position has been picked up on by the lunatic fringe. Note how former Bush speechwriter and current extremist-in-residence at the <i>Washington Post</i>, Marc Thiessen, put the case against the "Al Qaeda 7" in a <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/postpartisan/2010/03/the_al-qaeda_seven_arent_like_john.html">posting last month</a> on the WaPo blog (yes, the blog - they have standards for the columns they actually print): "Unless they have been charged before military commissions or civilian courts, the al-Qaeda terrorists held at Guantanamo do not have a right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment. They are not accused criminals. They are enemy combatants held in a war authorized by Congress." Few of his readers will have understood that this position has implications for public interest lawyers as well as for the men they seek to represent.</p>

<p>Now, even the Bush administration Justice Department declined to focus in on this question of whether we had the right to represent our clients without criminal liability. But for several years the administration claimed that <u>Rasul v. Bush</u> hadn't established any constitutional right to habeas. The administration argued that <u>Rasul</u> only established a statutory right (later swept away by the 2006 Military Commissions Act). Could a statutory habeas right have been tempered by statutory sanctions regimes criminalizing the representation of members of banned "Foreign Terrorist Organizations"? Who knows?</p>

<p>"Who knows?" is surely an answer hated by law firm managing partners trying to determine their firms' exposure to criminal liability for taking on unpopular <i>pro bono</i> representation. Yet in an era where the extraterritorial reach of the federal courts is increasingly a subject of litigation, establishing the bounds of jurisdiction will require the participation of lawyers willing to take on cases near the limits. Add this to the list, then, of reforms to the material support statute and related sanctions schemes that Congress should undertake after the Supreme Court decides the HLP case.</p>

Over the past several months, the focus of that debate has changed and intensified. Politicians and others opposed to the Obama administration's plans to try some of the September 11 suspects in federal court have struck up a new theme - that these individuals do not and should not enjoy the same rights that are enjoyed by United States citizens, and should be tried before military commissions. Critics of the President have argued that, if terrorism suspects are tried in federal court, they will have to be read their Miranda rights on the battlefield, and that they will have to be provided lawyers who will complicate these cases. As well, critics maintain that, if these suspects are tried in federal court, the government will be forced to disclose classified evidence and these criminal proceedings will expose valuable intelligence information. </p>

<p>Of course, these claims make for good sound bites, and after the attempted airplane bombing in December 2009 and the even more recent bombing attempt in Times Square, fear of terrorism has once again got the attention of many Americans. Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown has gone so far as to attribute part of the reason for his surprising win in January's special senatorial election to these concerns.  </p>

<p>Nonetheless, it is important to look beyond the sound bites to see just how different a trial in a military commission might be as compared to a trial in federal district court. Last month, the Department of Defense released the Manual for Military Commissions (MMC).  The MMC provides the detailed set of rules and procedures that are to apply to trials in military commissions.  A careful examination of the rights to counsel in military commissions and how the military commissions will handle classified information reveals that these processes will not look all that different than the procedures in federal court.</p>

<p><b>Rights to Counsel</b></p>

<p>A suspect's rights to counsel in the military commissions are considerable and in some regards even more expansive than in federal court. Under Rule for Military Commissions (R.M.C.) 506, an accused in a military commission has the right to be represented by a military defense counsel free of charge. The provision of defense counsel does not depend upon financial need--it is automatic. In addition, the Chief Defense Counsel can, at his or her discretion, detail a second military counsel to represent the accused, also free of charge, and given the complexity of these cases, this second counsel will almost always be detailed.   </p>

<p>In addition, an accused in a military commission has the right to make a by-name request of any military attorney to represent him, and if that attorney is reasonably available, he or she will be appointed to the defense.  An accused also has the right to be represented by civilian counsel, at no expense to the government.  Finally, in all death penalty eligible cases, the accused has the right to a second defense attorney who is "learned in the applicable law relating to capital cases." This second learned counsel also will be appointed at no expense to the accused.  Because there are very few capital cases tried in the military, in many, if not all death penalty eligible cases, this second attorney will most likely be a civilian.</p>

<p>In contrast, in federal court there is no automatic right to a government provided defense counsel--a defendant must first show a financial need. In federal court, moreover, there is no right for a defendant to make a by-name request of any government attorney to represent him or her. The right to the appointment of a counsel learned in capital cases in federal court is very similar to the rule in military commissions, except that the appointment of this counsel is not automatic in federal court; the defendant must formally request such representation. </p>

<p><b>Classified Information</b></p>

<p>Classified information under the military commission rules is treated under military commission rules in much the same way as it would be treated in federal court. In federal court, classified information is governed by the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA), enacted in 1980 to manage the tension between the government's interest in preventing the disclosure of classified information and the criminal defendant's need for such information in his or defense. The law aims to preclude the government from denying the defense access to relevant information that happens to be classified, and the statute essentially compels the government to choose whether to disclose the information (possibly in an altered but usable form), or to forgo the prosecution. </p>

<p>Under Military Commissions Rule of Evidence 505, the guidelines now explicitly provide, for example, that the accused is entitled to see any information admitted into evidence. As under CIPA, then, the accused is not to be tried on the basis of secret evidence. Further, Rule 505 requires there be reciprocity--if a judge allows an accused to introduce classified information in his defense, then the government must disclose the evidence it plans to use in rebuttal. Should the government refuse to do so, the judge may forbid the government from making a rebuttal. This is very similar to the balance CIPA strikes--to compel the government to choose whether to proceed along a certain path requiring the disclosure of classified information, or to abandon that path for one in which the evidence against the accused may be disclosed, if that is possible.</p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>

<p>A comparison of the rights to counsel in federal court and military commission would seem to contradict the concerns of those critics who want terrorism cases tried by the latter to prevent suspected terrorists from "lawyering up." And it seems that, in respect to protecting classified information from disclosure, the military commissions will operate under guidelines similar to those that apply in federal court. These comparisons suggest that we can set aside our fear that trying terrorism suspects in federal court necessarily will make securing convictions and punishment appreciably more difficult to obtain and impose.</p>

<p>Indeed, if we are going to have a serious debate about where terrorism suspects should be tried, it should be driven by substantive issues and not headline-generating sound bites.  For us, the overriding substantive question is this: which forum is most capable of delivering justice that will stand the test of time, producing a judgment that will have the respect of the American people and the world? We conclude that trial in federal court will be the best option in most, if not all, terrorism cases.  </p>

<p>Federal courts have many years of experience with classified evidence and the delicate balance between protecting individual rights and protecting national security interests. In contrast, the judges likely to sit on military commissions have likely either never tried, or have limited experience with, cases involving the use of classified evidence, since these cases come up only very rarely in the military courts-martial.  Since 1999, there has only been one reported case by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces in which classified evidence was an issue.  </p>

<p>Further, many of these cases, including the trial of the September 11 conspirators, are very complex joint trials involving multiple defendants. These complex trials are quite common in federal court. They are much less common in military courts-martial, where joint trials involving multiple co-defendants are rare.  This means that the military judges in these cases would likely be presiding over the first joint trial in their careers.</p>

<p>Perhaps most importantly, trial of these cases in federal court would be conducted using established procedures that have been scrutinized by the appellate courts, while all of the rules and all of the procedures in the military commissions are new and untested.  There is virtually no established case law, meaning that every single rule is subject to endless rounds of challenge and appellate review.  This explains why, after over nine year, the commissions process has only managed to try three individuals. </p>

<p>When we set aside fear and politics, and focus on the actual goal of doing justice for everyone, including--perhaps especially--for the American people, trial of terrorism suspects in federal district court is the appropriate choice.</p>

At the beginning of the lecture, Ms. Osmani asked the group what came to mind when it first thought of Kosovo. To be honest, I knew little about Kosovo prior to taking Ms. Osmani&#39;s State Building and the Law course and my first instinct was to mention the conflicts in the Balkans. My entire knowledge of this tiny country came solely from its connections to the United States and NATO and its conflicts with Serbia. It was only through class and this lecture that I began to learn about Kosovo and its complicated history.</p>

<p>Ms. Osmani&#39;s lecture was held in conjunction with the celebration of Kosovo&#39;s second year of independence. While many Kosovars see this as cause for celebration, there are significant legal issues accompanying Kosovo&#39;s independence. Within the international community, one of the most important questions is whether Kosovo&#39;s declaration of independence establishes a precedent for other contested territories. However, there are strong arguments that Kosovo&#39;s situation should be treated as <i>sui  generis</i> (unique). For many years, Yugoslavia was defined by turmoil between its ethnic Serb and ethnic Albanian populations, culminating in state-sanctioned oppression of the Albanian population in Kosovo by Yugoslavian (later Serbian) President Slobodan Milosevic. It was only after significant international pressure that the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) charged Milosevic and others with crimes against humanity.</p>

<p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/dateline/uploaded_images/23518_409066551263_783006263_5115214_5103785_n-722938.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:4px 10px 10px 4px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 209px;" src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/dateline/uploaded_images/23518_409066551263_783006263_5115214_5103785_n-722935.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>While Kosovo is a new state, the international community has been involved in the Kosovo conflict since George Bush&#39;s secret Christmas Warning to Serbia in 1992, where Bush warned Milosevic that Serbian aggression in Kosovo would provoke an international response. When Serbia did not remove its troops from the Kosovo territory, NATO responded with an air campaign against the former Yugoslavia. Even after the NATO bombings, it became apparent during negotiations on Kosovo&#39;s status that Serbia was unwilling to cede control of the territory. At the same time, Kosovar Albanians were beginning to assert their rights independent of the international negotiations. Eventually, the UN passed Resolution 1244, which placed Kosovo under UN administration for an interim period. As peace talks continued, Finland&#39;s former president, Maarti Ahtisaari, drafted a settlement proposal between the leaders of Serbia and Kosovo, but after years of negotiations, it became clear in 2008 that independence was the most appropriate solution to the Kosovo conflict.  While Ms. Osmani discussed Kosovo&#39;s long path to independence, I realized how little attention the media had given the conflict. For over a decade Kosovo&#39;s status had been indeterminate, but the majority of the audience seemed to be learning about Kosovo&#39;s history for the first time.</p>

<p>As Ms. Osmani noted in her opening, though, Kosovars faced numerous problems even after gaining independence. First, Kosovars had been largely denied educational and career opportunities during Milosevic&#39;s presidency. As a result, Kosovo had no economy, no rule of law, and no other governmental institutions. Second, most of Kosovo&#39;s population had been displaced during the war and had emigrated to other countries. Therefore, the daunting task of state-building fell upon a population composed primarily of younger Albanians, who through luck and hard work had obtained enough of an education to assist in the rebuilding process. Ms. Osmani, who became became a legal advisor to Kosovo&#39;s President at 23, is one such example.</p>

Due to its narrow drafting, the question fails to address the situation in Kosovo before and after the declaration&#39;s signing. As illustrated by the extensive negotiations in Rambouillet, France, the conflict between the two parties was irreconcilable. Further, the question also assumes a law prohibiting states from declaring independence - a law, which, as Ms. Osmani notes, does not exit. At the moment, the ICJ is currently deliberating the merits of Serbia&#39;s claim, but until it renders an opinion, Kosovo is a sovereign state with a firm belief in its legitimacy and compliance with international law.</p>

		<title>TAIWAN: The Rights of Migrant Laborers</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Polly Chien, Pitt Law &#39;12, writes about the rights of migrant workers in her home country of Taiwan...<br />
<hr height="1"><br />
<font size="3"><b>M</b></font>any Americans need a cup of coffee in the morning. <img alt="Taiwan1.png" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Taiwan1.png" width="225" height="169" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" />As a first year law student, I walk down the street from the law school to McDonald&#39;s to buy mine. Sometimes, the clerk is not fluent in English, and I have to repeat myself a couple times to get the correct order. This experience is typical for many Americans living in big cities and is representative of the issues arising in an economy that is reliant on migrant and other foreign workers to fill basic jobs. Every year, hundreds of thousands of immigrants, many with limited employment skills, flow into the United States in search of better jobs and a better life. With limited resources, most immigrants are confined to minimum wage and seasonal jobs concentrated in restaurants and other similar establishments, and they rarely enjoy social welfare protection. Often, immigrants without legal immigration status are cut off from most social aid services, and the controversy surrounding this issue is intense on both sides.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is not confined to the United States. In Taiwan, there are approximately 360,000 migrant workers, of whom nearly 160,000 are domestic workers or caretakers. In addition, Taiwan has a robust guest worker program, in which foreign workers from other, typically less-developed countries, are sponsored by employers in Taiwan, and allowed to travel to the country and stay there for purposes of their pre-arranged employment. The workers are barred from the general benefits and protections of Taiwan&#39;s Labor Standard Act (LSA) and are also vulnerable to physical abuse and mistreatment from employers.</p>

<p>I first became aware of the troubles facing foreign and migrant workers in Taiwan in September of 2005, when a huge scandal was uncovered at the Kaohsiung Municipal Subway Construction Project. Nearly 1,700 migrant Thai workers rioted, attacking police and destroying property in protest against working conditions at the project. <img alt="Taiwan2.png" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Taiwan2.png" width="225" height="169" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" />The workers&#39; employer had allegedly struck two of the Thai laborers with electric clubs. The migrant workers also claimed that they were deprived of their basic rights, consistently abused, housed in a segregated camp at the construction site, and barred from contact with the local Taiwanese population. They claimed that they were forced to work 18-20 hours a day for a salary of about $300 a month.</p>

<p>I was fortunate to attend the Migrant Worker Rally on World Human Rights Day in 2008. The rally that year, organized around the theme of &quot;No Slave Labor,&quot; was intended to draw attention to the poor working conditions and violations of basic rights at the Koahsiung Subway Construction Project. The parade eventually became a biennial demonstration seeking legislative change to combat the trafficking of illegal workers and to increase the protection of workers&#39; rights under the Taiwanese guest worker program.</p>

<p><img alt="Taiwan3.png" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Taiwan3.png" width="225" height="169" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" />Guest worker programs are especially popular in developing, socially homogeneous, Asian and European countries that base their immigration policies on the principles of <i>jus sanguinis</i>. According to <i>jus sanguinis</i>, nationality is determined by ancestry rather than birthplace. In 1989, the Taiwanese government adopted a guest worker program modeled after Germany&#39;s that  allows foreign nationals to work temporarily in Taiwan in an attempt to address the country&#39;s ongoing labor shortage. The program differentiates between unskilled laborers and white-collar professionals from Western countries, and many of the restrictions only apply to the unskilled migrant workers. For example, guest workers may stay in Taiwan for a maximum of six years, may not bring their families with them, and may not marry during their employment. Additionally, each laborer is required to undergo a complete physical health examination every six months.</p>

<p><img alt="Taiwan4.png" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Taiwan4.png" width="225" height="169" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" />The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) is the agency responsible for enforcing the LSA, but has only limited power to regulate laborers and protect their rights. For example, the LSA allows migrant workers to bring claims against their employers for violating their basic rights. However, this protection is ineffective since the laborers cannot afford to bear the economic burden of a lawsuit. Rather than challenge their mistreatment, they are forced to return to their home countries and &quot;voluntarily&quot; end their employment in Taiwan. This unfortunate situation was somewhat ameliorated by a 2007 amendment to the country&#39;s Immigration Act, which allowed migrant workers to extend their residency status in Taiwan during the pendency of a lawsuit against an employer.</p>

<p>The theme of the most recent Migrant Worker Rally on December 13, 2009, was &quot;The Robot Also Gets Tired.&quot; Friends currently employed with the International Workers Association (IWA) discussed the organization&#39;s plans for amending the LSA to better protect domestic workers&#39; legal rights. In particular, the IWA is focused on ensuring workers&#39; rights to rest and leisure. The group&#39;s planned amendment brought to mind interviews I conducted in 2005 with migrant domestic workers in Taiwan. Most of the interviewees were 20- to 30-year old women from the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam who cared for the elderly or sick as home nurses or at senior citizen homes, known as senior sanctuaries in Taiwan. The women who work at the senior sanctuaries are generally in a better position than the others because they are allowed rest breaks during their shifts and are able to spend time with friends on and off duty, among other benefits, due to their protection under the LSA. However, those working in individual homes are not as lucky, since the LSA does not protect migrant or guest workers employed in private homes.</p>

<p>My very first interview was with a woman named Alice (name changed). She was caring for a 72 year old man who had suffered numerous strokes and had a very bad temper. Since the man only slept four hours a day, Alice was required to work 20 hours a day, seven days a week, and was rarely allowed time off on the weekends. As a result, she was close to suffering a nervous breakdown as a result of her exhausting work situation. Her story was typical of the other home caretakers I interviewed.<img alt="Taiwan5.png" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Taiwan5.png" width="169" height="225" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" /></p>

<p>In order to prevent the abuse of migrant home caretakers, the Taiwanese government has attempted to lessen demand for their employment by introducing legislation that provides national health care coverage to senior citizens. However, this coverage is not available to senior citizens who employ migrant domestic workers. The impact of this legislation is that workers in private homes are still not allowed breaks since the households have no temporary assistance during a migrant worker&#39;s absence. If the employer is unwilling or unable to allow the worker rest or time off, the worker is permanently on duty, and still outside the LSA&#39;s protections. This troubling development is in direct contravention of Article 24 of the Universal Declaration of Human rights, which guarantees workers&#39; fundamental rights to rest and leisure. Without these rights, migrant workers have become isolated machines deprived of the freedom and opportunity to claim and exercise their rights.</p>

<p><img alt="Taiwan6.png" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Taiwan6.png" width="225" height="169" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" />Those who attended last year&#39;s Migrant Worker Rally are seeking additional protections for foreign and migrant workers. The rally&#39;s organizers and supporters want the government to loosen regulations on senior citizen health care in private homes in order to protect currently-employed migrant workers. Notably, many employers marched in the rally side-by-side with their employees to fight for workers&#39; rights and to demand government protection of their fundamental freedoms. Through the efforts of the International Workers Association and the Migrant Worker Rallies, I believe that more Taiwanese people will become aware of migrant workers, their rights, and the troublesome issues that many of them currently face. Hopefully, Taiwanese citizens will then realize that these workers are indispensable to the national economy and deserve the protection of Taiwanese labor laws.</p>

		<title>SERBIA: Belgrade and Kosovo</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kristine Long, Pitt Law &#39;11, traveled to Belgrade, Serbia, for a pre-moot prior to the Willem C. Vis International Commercial Arbitration Moot in Vienna, Austria...<br />
<hr height="1"><br />
<font size="3"><b>T</b></font>he conflict between Kosovo and Serbia is so contentious that it seemed appropriate to follow my recent article about Kosovo&#39;s independence with an article from the Serbian perspective. Luckily, I had the opportunity to travel with my moot team to Belgrade, where the University of Belgrade School of Law hosts one of the more prestigious pre-moots prior to the Vis competition in Vienna. Although I already begun to learn about Kosovo in the United States, my time in Belgrade provided me with first-hand experience as to how the two countries interact.</p>

<p><img alt="IMG_0384.jpg" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/IMG_0384.jpg" width="205" height="160" class="mt-image-right" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" />During my first cab ride through the city, I was immediately exposed to Belgrade&#39;s city center and its unique history. Perhaps the cab driver knew that we were Americans and consequently gave us a scenic tour, but he drove through the most historically significant and awe-inspiring parts of the city. When driving or walking through Belgrade, one is constantly reminded of NATO&#39;s 1999 bombing of the city by the destroyed buildings interspersed among new construction. While I had read about the Kosovo conflict and the NATO bombings in the United States, it was entirely different to see the long-term consequences of the international community&#39;s response. While most people remember the conflict from past classes or news stories, it was quite evident that the Serbs confront daily reminders of their conflict with their neighbors. </p>

<p>Belgrade is interesting because of how it juxtaposes conflict with daily life. There are many parts of the city where one can forget that Belgrade was the site of protests and conflict only several years ago. However, the members of the Kosovo team, which traveled with our Pitt Law team, were sensitive to the continuously strained relationship between Serbia and Kosovo. Currently, the ICJ is deliberating as to whether Kosovo&#39;s declaration of independence is in compliance with international law, and it will render a highly anticipated decision by the end of 2010. While Kosovo and Serbia have the strongest interest in the decision, other countries have chosen sides because of the ICJ opinion&#39;s possible implications on international relations. Of particular interest is whether a ruling in Kosovo&#39;s favor will allow other contested territories to declare independence, as well.</p>

<p>While the ICJ opinion will have important implications for both Kosovars and Serbs, these groups face real issues outside the scope of the ICJ case. For instance, the Serbian government does not recognize Kosovar passports as valid travel documentation, so only half of Kosovo&#39;s team - those members with a second passport  - were permitted to travel to Belgrade. This is but one example of the challenges Kosovars face in this region. While Kosovo&#39;s statehood is recognized by 65 other countries, until it is universally accepted, Kosovar citizens can and will continue to face discrimination. </p>

<p><img alt="The VIS 017.jpg" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/The%20VIS%20017.jpg" width="236" height="178" class="mt-image-left" style="float: right; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" />The ICJ has an important role in determining Kosovo and Serbia&#39;s fate. However, as Kosovo&#39;s advocates have previously stated, the question before the ICJ is too narrow to reflect the full conflict between these two countries. While I supported Kosovo&#39;s statehood before traveling to Belgrade, my experience in Serbia solidified my belief that Kosovo should remain an independent state. In Kosovo&#39;s two years of independence, it has begun to rebuild its economy and government, in addition to asserting its independence in smaller ways. Kosovo&#39;s government has created a new flag, a new national anthem, and instilled ideas of nationalism and statehood in its citizens. However, Serbia&#39;s refusal to recognize Kosovar passports made me wonder how many laws and policies each country would need to change in order for the two countries to truly move forward.</p>

<p><img alt="IMG_0407.jpg" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/IMG_0407.jpg" width="241" height="180" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" />From my observation, Belgrade can be part of this change, as it appears that some of its citizens have already moved on. Only a few years ago, Belgrade&#39;s streets were filled with protestors and anti-Kosovo propaganda, but the Belgrade I visited was peaceful and mostly accepting of the group of Kosovars and Americans traveling together. For example, the Belgrade faculty gracefully permitted the Kosovar team to participate in the pre-moot rounds in the interest of promoting international unity and competition. Although a small step toward permanent peace, granting Serbian and Kosovar students the opportunity to work together is instrumental in shaping their countries&#39; future relationship. The participants in the pre-moot are their countries&#39; future legal minds, and Belgrade was the perfect site for these young, bright scholars to begin to set their differences aside and learn to work together.  </p>

<p>While the ICJ&#39;s final decision will inevitably have its supporters and detractors, it will allow the ICJ to solidify Kosovo&#39;s status. If the ICJ upholds Kosovo&#39;s declaration of independence, Kosovo and its citizens will be better able to address discrimination and assert those rights universal to all citizens. Finally, the ICJ&#39;s decision will bring closure to a conflict that has spanned many years and hopefully convince both populations to pursue a more harmonious future.</p>

		<title>The BP Blowout: Legal Claims and Questions</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Itzchak Kornfeld of the Faculty of Law at The Hebrew University in Jerusalem says the blowout at BP's Deepwater Horizon Well in the Gulf of Mexico will lead to a plethora of legal claims...<br /><hr size="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forumy/itzchakkornfeld.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table> <font size="3"><b>T</b></font>he tragic blowout at BP's Deepwater Horizon well will likely cause damage in excess of $8 billion. An ecological disaster faces the Gulf Coast. In a 52-page filing with the Minerals Management Service, the unit in the US Interior Department that leases offshore tracts for drilling, BP insisted that such a catastrophe could never happen. Now the company says that this incident is 'unprecedented'.</p>

<p>The disaster will cause untold devastation to birds, fisheries, oyster reefs, crab and shrimp nurseries, beaches, as well as tens of thousands of small businesses. It will likely also cause a tectonic shift in the tone of the "drill baby drill" crowd and the policies of the federal and state governments. Unfortunately, the story of the eleven men killed in the explosion of the rig has been subsumed by the environmental tragedy.  And on Sunday, May 16, 2010 marine scientists working on board the research vessel <i>Pelican</i> found three enormous plumes of oil in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico.  Some of these plumes are more than 10 miles long and 300 feet deep and are moving towards the southern Florida coastline. </p>

<p>Lawyers, as is true following any catastrophe, will be called upon to fix the post-cleanup mess - via litigation and legislation. What causes of action will the lawyers who will represent aggrieved businesses and individuals employ? In this article I list some of the common claims that will most likely be employed. And as a former Texaco geologist I will pose two questions.</p>

<p>A number of class action law suits have already been filed. On April 30 an <a href="http://www.levinlaw.com/PDFs/04.30.10-BP-Oil-Spill-Class-Action-Complaint.pdf">action</a> was filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of Florida on behalf of seafood wholesalers, fishermen, seafood processors, charter boat operators and rental condominium owners, who are seeking damages sounding in tort and strict liability. Two commercial shrimpers have meanwhile filed an action in Mississippi federal court seeking $5 million in damages based on claims that the oil spill could destroy their livelihoods. In Louisiana, lawyers have proposed class actions in the Eastern District of Louisiana, located in New Orleans, on behalf of fishing companies who assert that they are and will suffer pecuniary injuries from the ongoing spill. </p>

<p>Other suits are inevitable. The first foreseeable cause of action will be the wrongful death suits on behalf of the dead workers. A second may be filed under the Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSHA"), 29 U.S.C. s.651 et seq., on behalf of current workers who will allege that their work place was not safe. A third cause of action will doubtless be filed pursuant to the post-Exxon Valdez Oil Pollution Act ("OPA") of 1990, 33 U.S.C. ss.2701ff, et seq. </p>

<p>OPA extended the former limits on liability, and there is a special twist for "offshore facilities," such as BP's well. Pursuant to 33 U.S.C. s.2704. Limits on Liability, subsection (a) general rule, provides that <blockquote>[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this section, the total of the liability of a responsible party under section 1002 [33 U.S.C. s.2702] and any removal costs incurred by, or on behalf of, the responsible party, with respect to each incident shall not exceed--<br />
. . . (3) for an offshore facility except a deepwater port, the total of all removal costs plus $75,000,000.</blockquote>As the operator of the rig, BP is the responsible party here. Therefore, it will be on the hook to the United States for all of the cleanup costs - a very broad scope of action - plus $75 million on top of cleanup costs.   Indeed, BP plc's CEO, Tony Hayward has promised that his company's compensation payouts to people affected by the ongoing oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico won't be limited by the $75 million legal cap on such liabilities.  Hayward was quoted in a <i>Wall Street Journal</i> article dated May 17, 2010, as having asserted the following in a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar: "We believe claims related to this event will exceed the limit. We are prepared to pay above $75 million on these claims and we will not seek reimbursement from the U.S. government or the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund."</p>

<p>The United States will also seek recovery for damage to natural resources. OPA's Title I, s.1006, provides that "Federal trustees shall assess natural resource damages for natural resources under their trusteeship. Federal trustees may, upon request from a State or Indian tribe, assess damages to natural resources for them as well. Trustees shall develop and implement a plan for the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, or acquisition of the equivalent of natural resources under their trusteeship." If the oil slick or the cleanup operation interferes or impedes marine shipping, a number of marine statutes may be employed against BP and the other defendants. </p>

<p>Suits sounding in negligence will certainly abound. They will be filed against BP and the rig's owner, Transocean - whose rig measured 396' long by 256' wide and operated at water depths up to 8,000' deep, and up to a maximum drilling depth of 30,000'.  The rig was built in 2001 by Hyundai Heavy Industries, and leased to BP through September 2013.  Hyundai may also face claims for product defects. In addition, suits sounding in negligence and possibly strict liability will be filed against Cameron International Corp. due to a hydraulic leak and a failed battery that most likely prevented the blowout preventer that Cameron designed and built from working as designed.  Negligence actions will likely also be filed against Halliburton, which is said to have had problems with cementing the hole - cementing is a procedure used when drilling oil and natural gas wells in order to prevent oil and gas from leaking or escaping out of the drilling hole, by filling the gaps between the casing, the pipe in which the entire drill stem and bit circulate, as the drilling operation progresses. Halliburton's cementing operation procedure is coming under scrutiny as a possible cause of the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig. </p>

<p>According to the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, "regulators have previously identified problems in the cementing process as a leading cause of well blowouts, in which oil and natural gas surge out of a well with explosive force. When cement develops cracks or doesn't set properly, oil and gas can escape, ultimately flowing out of control. The gas is highly combustible and prone to ignite, as it appears to have done aboard the Deepwater Horizon." BP will also face negligence actions because it failed to install remote-control or acoustically-activated shut-off valves, designed in case of emergencies, e.g., loss of pressure or the rig sinking. Norway and Brazil require them on all offshore rigs. However, oil companies persuaded U.S. regulators that such backup devices, which cost $500,000, were an unnecessary expense. </p>

<p>Negligence claims have already be filed and will certainly continue to be filed by fishermen, crab, oyster and shrimp processing facilities, hotels on the beaches, charter operators, and many others. Moreover, if plaintiffs can demonstrate that the rig operations were inherently dangerous they will file strict liability causes of action. Robert Kennedy, Jr., one of the lawyers who already has filed a class action suit, recently stated on the Larry King Show that BP's permit allowed it to drill to 18,000' but in fact the well was drilled deeper, approaching 25,000'. There will surely be additional claims for equitable remedies.   </p>

<p>Concomitantly, given BP's dubious safety record, including the leaks in its Alaskan pipeline, an explosion at its Texas City refinery and a whistleblower's suit, BP may be found liable for punitive damages. In <u>Abbott v. Salazar</u>, 4:10-cv-01759, (S.D. Tex.), plaintiffs have requested that the court issues an order requiring BP to shut down its Atlantis platform - which is situated in the Gulf of Mexico and is capable of producing 200,000 barrels of oil and 180 million cubic feet of gas daily - until the company can prove that the system, one of the Gulf's largest, was built according to engineer-certified designs and is operating safely.   Ken Abbott, who was in charge of BPs documents regarding the Atlantis project supplied documents to an environmental goup.  Some of these written by Barry Duff, then an Atlantis project manager in BP's Houston operations headquarters, said in an Aug. 15, 2008, message that partially complete and unapproved design specs had been provided to platform operators in violation of federal law and the company's own safety policies.  This, Duff wrote, "could lead to catastrophic operator errors due to their assuming the drawing is correct,"  and that "there are hundreds if not thousands of subsea documents that have never been finalized, yet the facilities have been turned over" to operators who rely on the design specs to safely operate Atlantis, he said.</p>

<p>The MMS and the Interior Department may also face suits for violating the National Environmental Policy Act ("NEPA"), 42 USC § 4321, which, provides in 42 USC § 4332 that <blockquote>(2) all agencies of the Federal Government shall . . . (C) include in every recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, a detailed statement by the responsible official on -- (i) the environmental impact of the proposed action, (ii) any adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented, (iii) alternatives to the proposed action...</blockquote> MMS' activities in leasing the tract to BP and its partners as well as permitting the well triggered the requirement for the Agency to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement ("EIS").  The EIS must contain a worst case scenario and alternatives.   Current reports suggest that these two factors were not addressed at all.  If true, the EIS was flawed and violated NEPA's non-delegable and compulsory mandate. </p>

<p>Finally, the following questions should be answered. Why did Transocean apparently keep rescued workers on the dock for up to twenty hours following their arrival there without allowing them to contact their families? And why did no one, including the news media, address the common sense possibility of blowing up the well so that it would implode in on itself and seal the hole? </p>

The average African often lacks access to electricity; adequate housing, food, and healthcare - and sometimes even clean drinking water. Concededly, as Western countries like to point out, some of this is due to Africans' misuse of their own resources and the resources sometimes gifted to them by richer countries. Efficient and effective use of African resources is important, but it is not the greatest problem facing Africa today. The greatest obstacle to African development - and indeed the survival of millions of Africans - is likely the threat posed by climate change.</p>

<p>Africans' rights to health, life, adequate food and adequate housing, self-determination, humane treatment, water, equal rights, benefit from one's own resources, and democracy are among those human rights that are very seriously affected by climate change. All of these human rights will be affected by a slight rise in global temperatures of perhaps 2&#176;C. Such a rise will lead to a 6&#176;C increase in sub-Saharan African countries and the consequential loss of agricultural land on a continent where up to 80 percent of some nations' populations depend on agriculture for survival. The increase in arid land will also likely lead to increasing land disputes. </p>

<p>The situation in Darfur is a striking example. The complicating factors of human intervention have received the most attention. Nevertheless, a much larger culprit is likely the receding belt of land that supports the agrarian products and access to water that are necessary for the survival of both the Southern Darfurian agrarian peoples and the Northern Darfurian cattle herders. The lack of water and land is likely to become an increasing source of conflict in Africa as global warming literally bakes the land, removing its agricultural nutrients and evaporating its water. The warming of Africa will also bring an increase in diseases such as malaria, which is already the largest killer of children. </p>

<p>Lower-lying regions of Africa may completely disappear, denying the indigenous people their way of life and even their right to self-determination. The biodiversity that is the trademark of the African continent could be depleted by as much as 40 percent due to climate change. In other words, almost half the plants and animals that we know today, and on which so many Africans depend, may disappear forever.</p>

<p>As is often the case, women and children in Africa are the first to experience the adverse effects of climate change. Already, NGOs report that women have to spend more time gathering water or firewood or planting crops. The children who often assist their mothers in these tasks are also increasingly likely to be denied the chance to get an education, as they are spending more time helping their families to survive. The susceptibility of children and women in childbirth to deadly disease is also likely to increase as these diseases become more prevalent due to climate change.</p>

<p>In other words, the consequences that climate change might have for the African continent could be even worse than the harrowing damage the gas chambers of the Nazis had for the Jews of Germany. When the <a href="http://www.g77.org/">G77</a> representative to the climate change negotiations in Copenhagen last year dared to make this comparison, he was rebuked, apparently because, unlike the Nazi furnaces, it was allegedly not clear who was really responsible for climate change.</p>

<p><b>What the World Knows</b></p>

<p>The consequences of climate change described above are widely agreed upon, but this does not mean that everyone has agreed on them. Indeed, two hundred years after it was proven that the world was round, there were still those who challenged this fact. Similarly, despite the fact that the international community has created the <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> (IPCC), there is still doubt. The hundreds of scientists involved in the IPCC do not do their own research but review the research of thousands of other scientists. It is their concerted opinion that climate change is taking place and that it will have the adverse impacts described above. </p>

<p>Moreover, the IPCC has even given odds as to the chances that these consequences will occur, and the odds are so strong that to bet against them would be tantamount to betting against a football team that is leading 4-0 in the 89th minute of the match. Yet this is exactly what the sceptics have done. They claim that because the outcome is not 100 percent certain, it will not happen.</p>

<p>African countries have not been among these sceptics. Instead, their views during negotiations have been very much based on the climate change science of the IPCC. Although the IPCC was only formed in the 1990s, in less than 20 years it has been able to draw a consistent picture of who and what is causing climate change. It has determined that climate change is largely man made. While the IPCC does not dispute that there are regular climate cycles on earth, it has recognised that these cycles have been significantly accelerated by human activities. In other words, the science shows that human beings cause climate change.</p>

<p>The IPCC has also determined with a high degree of certainty that, since 1750, it has been mainly developed states that have contributed to the release of anthropogenic gases (greenhouse gases) into the earth's atmosphere that have caused climate change. Even today, although states with large populations release significant amounts of greenhouses gases into the atmosphere as they struggle to achieve equal development, viewed in an historical perspective, or even per capita, even the largest developing states like China and India are way behind the largest polluters, such as the United States, the European Union states, Australia, and Japan.</p>

<p>All of these determinations by the IPCC have formed the basis of the arguments of African negotiators to international talks to ensure action on climate change. The overwhelming majority of the international community has also agreed with the IPCC and its scientific data. This broad agreement has been translated into binding legal commitments.</p>

<p>The primary expression of the international community's commitment to deal with climate change is the<a href="http://unfccc.int/2860.php">United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</a> (UNFCCC) that was adopted in 1992 and that has been joined by 194 states to date. This treaty unambiguously defines climate change as "a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods." The treaty further states that its objective is to achieve a "stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system." In other words, greenhouse gas omissions, which are produced by burning fossil fuels or oil and other non-ecological means of producing energy, must be limited. </p>

<p>The UNFCCC further reiterates commitments to basic principles central to combating the adverse effects of climate change. These include the principle that the earth's environment must be used for the common benefit of all peoples, that states that have benefited the most from the exploitation of the environment must contribute the most to addressing the effects caused by climate change, that preventative action must be taken, and that states must cooperate with each other to ensure sustainable development while addressing climate change. These principles make it clear that climate change is a common problem that all states must cooperate to address.</p>

<p>These principles must also be understood in the context of already existing legal obligations. Among these are international human rights obligations that require states to take action to ensure that activities emanating from their territory do not contribute to climate change when the adverse impacts will have serious consequences for human rights. The duty of states to cooperate has extraterritorial consequences that are expressly stated in some treaties, such as the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cescr.htm">International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</a> that has been ratified by more than 150 states. Under this treaty, the social and economic welfare of poorer, less developed states is the responsibility of richer, more developed states. </p>

<p>The obligation to cooperate to achieve development and respect for human rights is also embedded in Articles 55 and 56 of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/">Charter of the United Nations</a>, which according to Article 103, is the supreme treaty for all 192 member states. In other words, the obligations of states to cooperate with each other to address the adverse impacts of climate change could hardly be better established under international law. Nevertheless, as is so often the case, politics has come between the legal obligations to ensure the most basic human rights of individuals and peoples and their realisation.</p>

<p><b>The Politics of Climate Change</b></p>

<p>The problem facing Africans today is that there is an increasing risk that legal commitments will be belittled, ignored, and remain unfulfilled. If this happens, the consequences for the continent will likely be catastrophic. The problem is essentially one of sharing resources. Rich, developed countries, which have benefited from centuries of exploitation of natural resources, are unwilling to share the benefits that they have reaped with countries that are less economically developed. At the same time, the rich, developed countries want all other countries, including developing countries, to contribute more to limiting greenhouse gas omissions by taking steps to adapt to and mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change. </p>

<p>African countries, together with many other developing countries, have responded by pointing out the historical responsibility of states that have disproportionately benefited from the unlimited emission of greenhouse gases as they pursued their development. While African governments are not unwilling to cut back on their already meagre emissions of greenhouse gases, they want to ensure that their actions do not handicap their development. For this reason, among other things, they have asked for patent protections on ecologically-friendly technology to be removed, for technology needed to adapt to climate change to be made available to them at affordable prices, and for their obligations to cut greenhouse gas emissions to take into account their current state of development.</p>

<p>The bottom line of these appeals by African countries is that an estimated $500-800 billion would have to be transferred from the economic North to the economic South every year to deal with the adverse effects of climate change without handicapping African development, at least until Africa is able to achieve a state of development on par with the rich, developed countries. To date, the rich, developed countries have offered Africa and other developing countries between $10-20 billion a year - or about 2.5 percent of the minimum amount that is needed. Even this offer has not been made in a legally binding document. And despite this <i>de minimus</i> offer, the rich, developed countries claim that the major concern should be whether the developing countries use this money effectively. </p>

<p>African negotiators have pointed out that the problem is not how the governments use the money, but if it will ever even materialise. Indeed, the record of the rich, developed countries of keeping their promises to provide resources is not very good. These countries agreed more than three decades ago to provide one percent of their GDP to overseas development assistance. They have reiterated this agreement many times since lowering the rate to 0.07 percent of GDP, yet only a handful of rich, developed countries have honoured this commitment, and many developed countries have never even come close to doing so. Many of the developed countries refuse to even recognise their legally binding obligations to cooperate to ensure respect for universal human rights.</p>

<p>As a consequence, the rich, developed countries have taken positions obstructing any efforts to get them to live up to the obligations that they have already agreed to in the UNFCCC and subsequent treaties aimed at implementing these obligations. The <a href="http://unfccc.int/home/items/5262.php">Copenhagen Accord</a> - promulgated after secret negotiations at the last meeting of the states party to the UNFCCC - is one such effort. This instrument attempts to replace binding legal obligations with discretionary commitments. It also effectively calls for the end of existing binding legal commitments, such as the <a href="http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/items/2830.php">Kyoto Protocol</a>. </p>

<p>At the same time, as most developing states are defaulting on the commitments to limit greenhouse gas emissions that they agreed to in the Kyoto Protocol, which implements the UNFCCC, they are pushing for its non-renewal and its replacement with lower targets that would most certainly lead to the 6˚C temperature rise in Africa and the deadly consequences noted above. Worse yet are the games being played to remove the most competent African actors from climate negotiations. Under pressure from Western countries, especially the United States, the government of Yemen, which heads the G77, has virtually ignored the input of the well-respected former Sudanese negotiator, Lumumba Di-Aping. At the same time, Yemen admits to having neither the expertise nor the resources to defend the interests of developing states by itself.</p>

<p>Some developing countries have even been forced to turn to developed countries to request that they pay for the developing countries' advisors. One such country, presumably on the advice of its Western advisors, even agreed to a negotiating position during the last meeting of the state parties in Copenhagen that meant that its own country would disappear from the face of the earth, submerged by rising sea waters due to the melting polar ice caps. Under pressure from developed countries, and developing countries that had been so pressured, the African chief negotiator from Algeria, Kamel Djemouai, has been silenced, and the Ethiopian prime minister, Meles Zenawi, who speaks for Africa at high-level meetings, has taken positions that will not prevent the disastrous consequences of climate change for his continent. </p>

<p>Earlier this year, African Union states renewed the Ethiopian prime minister's mandate to represent Africa. As a consequence, the slow but consistent progress towards an "African science-based approach to climate change" has been stalled. The Ethiopian prime minister has even steered the African position in the direction of US President Barack Obama's "gentlemen's agreement," or the Copenhagen Accord. This happened even though adoption of the accord as the point of reference is likely to condemn millions of Africans to death from the adverse consequences of climate change. The rationale for this reversal was never explained, except to the extent that it was the most achievable outcome. </p>

<p>As the meeting leading to the next Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (<a href="http://www.cop16.mx/es/index.htm">COP16</a>, to be held in Cancun, Mexico, in November-December 2010) begins in earnest, the African position on climate change action remains unclear. One option for African states at COP16 is to stick with their science-based approach, which is reflected in submissions that they have made to the meeting, and perhaps even more consistently in the submission made by Bolivia, which many African states joined. These submissions demand, among other things, that global temperature increases be kept under 1˚C, that developed countries bear their historical responsibility for climate change by providing developing countries with adequate resources for adaptation and mitigation, and that that developed countries ensure affordable access to ecologically-friendly technology for meeting energy needs.<br />
 <br />
The alternative championed by primarily rich, developed countries in the Copenhagen Accord foresees no historical responsibility, <i>de minimus</i> and non-binding financial commitments, no commitments on technology transfers, and allows global warming to continue at a pace that will make Africa a furnace of death and destruction.  </p>

<p>The decisions that African leaders make might be the most important decisions they will ever make for ensuring a future where their peoples' human rights can be respected. In making these decisions, African leaders might want to remember the counsel of Ghanaian Walter Rodney, who warned almost a half-century ago that if Africans don't have the courage to stand up for their rights, no one else will.</p>

Until now, the general rule has been impunity for the perpetrators and neglect of the victims' rights to truth, justice, and reparation for war crimes and crimes against humanity. </p>

<p>On 14 April 2010, a criminal claim for genocide and crimes against humanity was filed in the Argentinian Federal Chamber, asserting universal jurisdiction. This initiative comes in a judicial and political environment where, after decades of neglect, the Spanish victims of war crimes and crimes against humanity continue to face obstacles to addressing injustice in their home country. The election of Argentinian courts for jurisdiction is not coincidental. For many years, the Spanish courts gave the victims of the military junta an opportunity to seek justice. Now, the Spanish victims of the Franco dictatorship are similarly seeking justice, albeit one that the Spanish courts no longer seem able to provide.</p>

<p>The two claimants are both residents of Argentina are related to four victims: Severino Rivas, a town mayor assassinated in 1936 and buried in a mass grave until 2005, when, after years of searching, his remains were transferred to his family's vault; Vicente Garcia Holgado, dissapeared; Elias Garcia Holgado, tortured and summarily executed in 1937; and Luis Garcia Holgado, executed on the side of a road and buried in a mass grave until the 1950s. The claim is also signed by a group of human rights and victims associations, including the Asociacion de Recuperacion de la Memoria Historica (Spanish Association for the Recuperation of the Historical Memory) and the Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo. If the claim is successful, surviving members of the Franco regime and its supporting organizations could stand trial for the first time.    </p>

<p>The claim describes how these individuals were victims of the ultranationalistic, right-wing extremist party Falange Espanola de las JONS (Spanish Phalanx) and other fascist and paramilitary groups, whose technique in the weeks following the fascist uprising of July 1936 was that of the <i>paseo</i>, or "stroll," where individuals were kidnapped in their homes or taken from detention centers, shot in the back, and abandoned on the side of the road. Thousands of these victims remain buried in those ditches. These assassinations were part of a systematic, generalised, and deliberate plan to terrorize the civilian population, which supported the democratically-elected government, and to eliminate the government's most representative figures. In bringing their claim, the claimants considered that the facts constitute crimes under the Argentinian Criminal Code, including genocide and/or crimes against humanity. </p>

<p>The claim based most of its factual interpretation and legal reasoning in Judge Baltasar Garzon's judicial resolutions on the crimes of the Spanish Civil War and Franco's regime (16 October and 18 November 2008). Garzon had held, among other things, that the acts committed during, and subsequent to, the civil war were forbidden by <em>ius in bello</em>, or laws of war. According to Judge Garzon, at the time of the acts' commission, they were already considered to be crimes against the Laws and Customs of War and Laws of Humanity, as identified by the Multinational Commission on Responsibilities, Paris 29 March 1919. This would mean that international law is not being retroactively applied and that, therefore, the judge has been respectful of the principle of <em>nullum crimen sine lege</em> (no crime, no punishment without previous penal law). This argument could possibly support the recognition of crimes against humanity as a special category of war crimes as early as 1936 (using reasoning similar to that put forward by the International Military Tribunal of Nuremberg in 1946). The claim before the Argentinian courts also argued that the crime of genocide existed before the beginning of the Spanish Civil War in 1936. This argument is more difficult to sustain, considering that the concept of genocide wasn't theoretically described by Raphael Lemkin until 1944 and legally established by the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide until 1948.</p>

<p>One of the claim's central arguments concerns the validity of the Spanish Amnesty Law of 1977. This law predates the Spanish Democratic Constitution, and it is arguably contrary to the Spanish constitutional principles of justice and judicial remedy. But more importantly, it does not comply with international legal principles establishing victims' rights to justice, truth, and reparation. This law should not be an obstacle to the trial of these crimes in Spain. In any event, the Spanish Amnesty Law does not affect the jurisdiction of judicial bodies in other countries. Therefore, not only does it not prevent the Argentinian judicial system from acting, as pointed out in the claim, but it allows it to do so while fully respecting the principle of <em>non bis in idem</em>, or "not twice for the same", given that the facts have never been tried before. </p>

<p>Despite this support, the claim was dismissed on 7 May 2010 by the judge of the Federal Chamber in charge of the case, only a few days after the Prosecutor had reported against its admissibility. The core issue in this case was whether Argentinian courts have jurisdiction under the principle of universal jurisdiction, which is arguably implicit in Article 118 of the Argentinian Constitution. Article 118 provides that a special law will determine the place of trial for crimes against the <em>ius gentium</em> (law of nations), which were committed outside the borders of the Nation. According to the claimants, this requirement is met by law 26200, or the International Criminal Court Statute Implementation Law (ICC Statute), passed on 13 December 2006, which grants jurisdiction to the Argentinian Federal Courts to try crimes of the competence of the ICC (Article 5). </p>

<p>The invocation of the ICC Implementation Law might pose some problems for the assertion of universal jurisdiction by the Argentinian courts, though. Article 3 provides that the law applies to (a) crimes committed in a territory under Argentinian jurisdiction, (b) crimes committed abroad by Argentinian agents or authorities in their official duties or (c) by Argentinian citizens or residents in Argentina, and (d) in any other case where jurisdiction is provided by international treaties to which Argentina is a party. This last option seems to be the only one applicable to the case of the Spanish victims. While the claimants have alleged crimes against humanity and/or genocide, the treaties to which Argentina is a party only extend universal jurisdiction over crimes of genocide. As a result, while the possibility of universal jurisdiction over crimes against humanity was arguably admitted by the National Chember of Appeal on the Criminal and Federal Correctional, the Argentinian courts will presumably focus on the allegations of genocide. </p>

<p>If the Argentinian courts focus on genocide, a second legal obstacle might result from the claim's broad interpretation of the groups protected against genocide on national grounds. The claim asserts that groups attacked on political grounds can be considered as protected by the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. However, according to the Convention's preparatory work, confirmed by Article 6 of the ICC Statute, this interpretation must be excluded. If the Argentinian court asserts jurisdiction based on option (d), it would be difficult for the claimants to support such an expansive interpretation of protected groups.</p>

<p>The grounds for exclusion of jurisdiction by the Argentinian court have still not been made public. However, it is very likely that the judge followed the Prosecutor's report. In his report, the Prosecutor did not consider any of the arguments outlined above. Instead he stated that universal jurisdiction could not apply because trials for these crimes had already been carried out in Spain. According to the Prosecutor, Argentinian courts could only hear the case if the country with territorial jurisdiction had not done so. Given that avenues for justice were still open in Spain, the Argentinian courts could not exercise jurisdiction. Such criminal procedures, though, do not currently exist in Spain. Importantly, the claimant's appeal against the dismissal has now been admitted, and the fight against criminal impunity continues.  </p>

Simply put, the Court's unanimous decision violates human rights.</p>

<p>The Court argued that detainees held in an "active theater of war in a territory under neither the <em>de facto</em> nor <em>de jure</em> sovereignty of the United States and within the territory of another <em>de jure</em> sovereign" are not entitled to <em>habeas corpus</em>. The decision results in a judicially sanctioned indefinite detention regime. <br />
 <br />
In its decision the Circuit Court sanctions the indefinite detention regime implemented by President Bush, largely maintained by President Obama. Indefinite detention flies in the face both of the rule of law and morality in armed conflict. In other words, the Court guarantees continued denial of basic due process rights to thousands of detained individuals.</p>

<p>Those individuals--some justifiably detained, others not---are innocent until proven guilty. Because of the Circuit Court, adjudication of guilt or innocence, much less <em>habeas</em> protection is but a pipe dream.</p>

<p>My 20 years experience in operational counterterrorism decision making unequivocally convinced me that detainees must have their 'day in court'.  Otherwise, adjudication of individual responsibility is placed in abeyance, more permanent than temporary. </p>

<p>While former Chief Justice of the Israeli Supreme Court, Aharon Barak, wrote "the logistical considerations of the state must not be a barrier to individual rights," late Chief Justice Rehnquist argued that in times of armed conflict the Court must be reticent with respect to the executive branch. </p>

<p>Regrettably, the DC Circuit Court adopted Rehnquist's approach; its decision flies in the face of Barak's thesis that detainee rights outweigh other considerations. Operational counterterrorism demands respect for and application of human rights. </p>

<p>To that end, even under extraordinarily complicated operational circumstances, both initial detention and subsequent remand of Palestinians suspected of involvement in terrorism were subject to independent judicial review. In accordance with prosecutorial discretion, indictments were filed when supported by evidence. </p>

<p>At trial, either before Israeli civilian courts or Military Courts in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, defendants confronted their accusers in accordance with rules of criminal procedure and evidentiary requirements befitting a Western democracy. In other words, adjudication of criminal responsibility was guaranteed in a trial before a court of law.</p>

<p>Critics have pointed out that the overwhelming majority of Palestinians are convicted based on plea bargains, thereby suggesting a fundamental flaw in the system. However, similar statistics can be found in criminal cases in most major American cities. In both systems defendants have the right to a full trial. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the approximately 25,000 individuals held--directly and indirectly--by the US in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Israel has, over the years, administratively detained tens of thousands of Palestinians. The primary justification is the requirement to protect intelligence sources that provide vital information regarding future terrorist attacks. During my military service I served both as military prosecutor and judge in administrative detention hearings. In addition, I was tasked with providing senior military commanders legal advice regarding individual detention decisions.<br />
 <br />
The process is highly problematic and controversial because the detainee is denied the right to confront his accuser; it has been widely criticized by the human rights community. However, the decision to detain is subject to independent judicial review by the Israel Supreme Court and is term-limited. The measure represents an unsatisfactory resolution to an improbable dilemma confronting decision makers seeking to prevent future terrorist attacks. </p>

<p>Flawed as it may be, this process seeks balancing legitimate national security considerations with equally legitimate civil liberties. There is, obviously, no perfect process with respect to counterterrorism. I have made innumerable decisions with inherently flawed and problematic dilemmas. However, the guiding light must be granting the detained individual rights.</p>

<p>Decision makers hiding behind the cloak of convoluted judicial decisions significantly hamper legitimate counterterrorism. The test is facilitating justice under fire. It is an extraordinarily complicated mission. Precedent suggests it can be achieved provided the executive branch is committed and the judiciary does not provide unwarranted protection of government. </p>

<p>The decision by the DC Circuit Court provides the executive branch deeply troubling cover. Comparative counterterrorism analysis demonstrates granting detainees' rights are essential to lawful operational counterterrorism. It is easy to create legal constructions that justify denial of basic rights.</p>

<p>Our legal system is the beacon on the hill, when it protects otherwise deniable rights.  The paradigm must be 'why', not 'why not'.</p>

<p>Hopefully the DC Circuit's decision is not the last word and the Supreme Court will render justice where justice is due. That is the essence of operational counterterrorism subject to the rule of law.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/faculty/profiles/bratmanbe">Ben Bratman</a> of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law says that while Republican Senate candidate Rand Paul claims he opposes repealing the foundational Civil Rights Act of 1964, his controversial comments on race discrimination leave one wondering whether he might support curtailing for private business the protections against race-based employment discrimination provided by other broader federal laws, such as &#167; 1981 of Title 42 of the US Code...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forumy/benbratman.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>K</b></font>entucky Republican Senatorial candidate Rand Paul recently got himself in some hot water - with the "liberal media," Paul claims on his website - by expressing in a series of interviews his fiercely Libertarian, free-market view that the federal government ought to leave private businesses alone, even when it comes to their decisions to discriminate.<br />
 <br />
The conventional wisdom seems to be that Paul's views on this subject are decidedly outside the mainstream of American political thought and contrary to long-standing law, particularly the Civil Rights Act of 1964. (Paul has now promised that he will "not support any efforts to repeal the Civil Rights Act of 1964.") However, as is often the case, the matter is more nuanced than the talk-show discourse, blogosphere, or Paul's own statements reveal. Paul's free-market position actually finds considerable favor under the exemptions and exceptions within most of our various anti-discrimination laws, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964. When it comes specifically to race discrimination though, Paul's position is indeed problematic, but in considerable part because of statutes <i>other than</i> the Civil Rights Act of 1964.   </p>

<p>The two statutes that Paul has discussed in his recent interviews - the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) - both contain multiple titles that directly regulate behavior by private businesses. First, they both prohibit private businesses from discriminating in employment decisions. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination because of race, color, sex, national origin, or religion; Title I of the ADA prohibits discrimination because of disability, mandating that employers provide a reasonable accommodation to an employee with a covered disability. Second, in separate titles, both statutes also prohibit private businesses that provide accommodations to the public (hotels, restaurants, theaters, etc.) from discriminating in their provision of those accommodations.<br />
 <br />
Based on his comments regarding the government's role in securing civil rights within the private sector, Paul's philosophy can be boiled down to two theories: (1) Libertarianism--government should leave private business alone as much as possible, and the free market will resolve most problems; and (2) States' Rights--the federal government has very limited powers under the Constitution, and most domestic matters should be addressed by state and local governments. </p>

<p>By way of illustration, as to the Civil Rights Act, Paul has said repeatedly that he supports its elimination of discrimination by the <i>public</i> sector, but he has defended the right of a private business to discriminate because of race. That is full-throated Libertarianism. When Paul was asked by Robert Siegel during an interview on NPR if he thought both the ADA and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 were "overreaches and that business shouldn't be bothered by people with a basis in law to sue them for redress," Paul responded, "Right. I think a lot of things could be handled locally. . . . [T]he more local the better, and the more common sense the decisions are, rather than having a federal government make those decisions." That is a defense of states' rights within a federalist system.</p>

<p>The truth is that to a limited but significant extent, Paul's positions are not at all outside the mainstream and are even consistent with existing law. Paul's Libertarian and States' Rights positions actually prevail as to a huge swath of the private sector that Congress repeatedly has chosen not to regulate. For example, in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (as amended in 1972) and Title I of the ADA, Congress expressly exempted from coverage all employers with 14 or fewer employees.  Based on the Small Business Administration's 2006 statistics, this leaves nearly 18 million employees, approximately 15 percent of the country's employees, without any protection under Title VII, the ADA, or several other discrimination statutes. It also puts a staggering <i>85 percent</i> of private firms with employees outside the coverage of these statutes. In the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), Congress expressly exempted all employers with 19 or fewer employees, leaving even more employers free to discriminate and even more employees unprotected. Other statutes have even higher employee minimums. </p>

<p>At least some of the reason for these small-firm exemptions is acceptance of the free-market view that anti-discrimination regulation of private business is burdensome. As Professor Richard Carlson has pointed out, "[n]early all of the congressional debates that preceded enactment of the major employment laws with small firm exemptions were animated with reference to 'corner' stores, entrepreneurs working out of their garage, family-owned retail and service operations, and other independent business people struggling to provide work for themselves as well as jobs for others despite stifling government regulation." </p>

<p>The exemptions are also a nod to states' rights: The federal government has limited power or should exercise its power conservatively when it comes to regulation of private business. Indeed, Congress derives its power to regulate private discrimination in employment and accommodations from the Constitution's Interstate Commerce Clause. Notwithstanding the Supreme Court's broad definition of interstate commerce, it is at least plausible that very small employers don't play enough of a role in it to justify federal regulation. </p>

<p>Even state anti-discrimination laws do not fully fill in the gaps left by the exemptions in the federal laws. For example, in Kentucky, the threshold for coverage under the state employment discrimination statute is eight employees. Private employers in Kentucky with seven or fewer employees can legally choose to fire, not hire, or otherwise discriminate against anyone because of national origin, sex, religion, age, or disability. A few states have no law prohibiting employment discrimination in the private sector at all, and neither the federal government nor most states (including Kentucky) prohibit private employers from discriminating because of sexual orientation. </p>

<p>What's more, the vast majority of employment discrimination statutes, state or federal, protect only employees. Independent contractors--essentially self-employed people engaging in contract work for one or more businesses--are not protected from discrimination under Title VII, the ADA, or any other statutes specifically prohibiting discrimination in employment. According to the United States Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2005 there were 10.3 million people in this country working as independent contractors, representing 7.4 percent of the employed.  Though the Bureau's definition of independent contractor might differ from the law's, there can be little doubt that several million more workers in the private sector, no matter the size of the entity for which they work, are not protected from most types of discrimination. </p>

<p>Even the public accommodations title of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides an exemption for private homes run as a bed and breakfast that rent out five or fewer rooms. Congress was persuaded that, at least for the smallest of the small and the most private of the private, the federal government should not intervene.  </p>

<p>No doubt this is all music to Rand Paul's ears. </p>

<p>What is likely not music to Paul's ears, and what renders inadequate his promise merely to leave the venerable 1964 statute alone, is that we have other federal laws that regulate race discrimination in the private sector much more comprehensively and aggressively than the 1964 law does, both inside and outside employment. Much of Paul's recent commentary has centered on race discrimination specifically, and it is here that his views find little favor in existing law and seem largely outside of the mainstream. </p>

<p>In the wake of the Civil War and ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment, which outlawed slavery, Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1866. In a section now appearing in Title 42, Section 1981 of the United States Code, Congress provided that everyone shall be entitled to the same rights to "make and enforce contracts" as are "enjoyed by white citizens." In another section, now appearing in Title 42, Section 1982, Congress provided that everyone shall have the same rights to "inherit, purchase, lease, hold and convey real and personal property" as are "enjoyed by white citizens." Over 100 years later, in the 1968 decision of <i>Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.</i>, 392 U.S. 409, the Supreme Court held that &#167; 1982 prohibits all racial discrimination in the private sale or rental of property. Seven years after that, in the 1975 decision of <i>Johnson v. Railway Express Agency</i>, 421 U.S. 454, the Court concluded that &#167; 1981 specifically prohibits racial discrimination in private employment. </p>

<p>In the 1989 decision of <i>Patterson v. McLean Credit Union</i>, 491 U.S. 164, the Court restricted &#167; 1981's coverage to only some aspects of the employment relationship. This did not sit well with Congress, which two years later in the Civil Rights Act of 1991, overruled the Supreme Court and amended &#167; 1981 to cover all aspects of a contractual relationship. </p>

<p>As a result, &#167; 1981 is an anti-discrimination law with remarkably expansive coverage. While it prohibits only race discrimination, it covers <i>all</i> employers, no matter how many employees they have, and it applies to any adverse employment action taken at any stage of the employment relationship. Because it is phrased in terms of contractual rights, &#167; 1981 also applies to all other private contractual relationships, including those between a private business and an independent contractor. Other standard contractual relationships are covered as well, including buyer-seller, lessor-lessee, and myriad others. Moreover, while Title VII and the ADA have caps on damages, &#167; 1981 has no caps at all. </p>

<p>The existence of &#167; 1981 results in significant discrepancies in anti-discrimination coverage and deterrence between race discrimination and other types of discrimination (sex, national origin, religion, disability, age, sexual orientation), most notably in employment. As recently as 2007, several senators, among them Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton, cosponsored legislation to remedy one aspect of that discrepancy by eliminating the damage caps provided in Title VII. The bill died in committee.  </p>

<p>Clearly, Rand Paul would oppose such a bill or any bill that expands the federal government's role in securing civil rights within the private sector. But, in light of Paul's recent comments about race discrimination, one is left to wonder whether he would support curtailing the protections currently provided under &#167; 1981. Would he want to bring the law on race discrimination in the private sector in line with the law on sex, national origin and other forms of discrimination by furnishing private businesses with the various exemptions, exceptions, and limitations that they are afforded under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other anti-discrimination statutes?</p>

<p>Paul's commitment not to seek repeal of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 thereby leaves at least one stone unturned and leaves open the question of just how far outside the mainstream he really is.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ekaterina Sivolobova, a student in the Faculty of Law at the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina, writes about the problem of legal impunity in Uruguay...<br />
<hr height="1"><br />
<font size="3"><b>W</b></font>ithout a doubt, legal impunity is a problem affecting Latin America. Most South American states have issued amnesty laws that prevent the investigation of human rights violations committed during dictatorships. Although some of these amnesty laws have already been nullified, others remain valid, allowing human rights violations to go unpunished. One such case is Uruguay&#39;s amnesty law.</p>

<p><img alt="Uruguay1.jpg" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Uruguay1.jpg" width="246" height="184" title="Uruguay Parliament" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" />The amnesty law of Uruguay, Law 15.848, is also known as the &quot;Ley de Caducidad&quot; (Expiry Law) and was enacted in December 1986 as a result of an agreement between the political parties and the military. This amnesty law has prevented the investigation and adjudication of Uruguay&#39;s military and police for illegal detentions, systematic tortures, killings, and forced disappearances committed during the country&#39;s civil-military dictatorship. </p>

<p>By enacting the Expiry Law, Uruguay has certainly violated international human rights principles and treaties signed and ratified by the state. The Expiry Law violates the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the American Convention of Human Rights, and the Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture.    </p>

<p>The Expiry Law disregards fundamental legal rights. It obstructs investigations, prevents access to justice, and violates the right to be heard by a competent, independent, and impartial tribunal. Additionally, it contravenes the right to judicial protection by not guaranteeing victims and their families protection against acts that violated fundamental rights recognized by Uruguay&#39;s constitution. The Expiry Law also prevents access to the truth, frustrating the investigation of violations of the rights to life, liberty, and physical and psychological integrity. Furthermore, Articles 3 and 4 of the Expiry Law grant the executive the authority to decide, without the right of appeal, whether cases filed in Uruguay&#39;s courts would be subject to the Expiry Law. This is in direct contravention of the principle of separation of powers embodied in the Uruguay Constitution. By enacting this law and perpetuating it for 24 years, Uruguay has both guaranteed complete impunity from prosecution for crimes committed during the dictatorship and ignored its obligations as a state.   </p>

<p><img alt="Uruguay2.jpg" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Uruguay2.jpg" width="246" height="184" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" />Nevertheless, there have been two attempts to use the referendum provision set forth in Article 79 of Uruguay&#39;s constitution to overturn the Expiry Law. Article 79 establishes the right to call for a referendum on a given law, and is an institutionalized form of direct democracy that permits the citizenry to enact or nullify a law. On April 1989, the first referendum was called on the legitimacy of the Expiry Law, which had been enacted four years earlier.  By a popular vote, the Expiry Law was upheld with 57% of the votes in its favor. This disappointing decision was attributed to the then-current transition to democracy, institutional instability, and tensions between the military and civilian government. As a result of this referendum, human rights violations and criminal impunity went unaddressed for 20 years.    </p>

<p>A second referendum on the Expiry Law was called on October 25, 2009. Once again, the referendum failed to pass, with 53% of the votes supporting its validity and 47% calling for its nullification. This result has been attributed to Uruguayans&#39; ignorance of the referendum due to a lack of information available in the media. The continued validity of the Expiry Law has been a disappointment to the victims of the Uruguayan dictatorship and their families.  However, as Jose Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch, has said, &quot;the plebiscite results are disappointing, but let&#39;s not forget that accountability is not a popularity contest that should be decided by majorities, [...] Uruguay has an international legal obligation to investigate, prosecute, and try those responsible for heinous crimes, and the courts should continue to prosecute appropriate cases.&quot;     </p>

<p>After two failed attempts to overturn the Expiry Law through referendums, opponents have discussed other possibilities. Currently, the discussion has centered on whether this law could or should be reinterpreted, derogated, or declared null and void. Without addressing the implications of international human rights law, the discussion persists due to different political interests. Because these three options vary widely in legal effect, it is important to clearly understand each when considering Uruguay&#39;s obligations.    </p>

<p>A reinterpretation of the Expiry Law would examine and clarify the law&#39;s textual meaning. Generally, reinterpretation presupposes different or contradictory interpretations and applications among courts. Until 2005, however, Uruguay&#39;s Expiry Law had been interpreted and applied uniformly. Nevertheless, if this law were to be reinterpreted, its new reading would only take effect from that date forward, with no application to previously concluded cases. Those cases would remain covered by the amnesty law. Furthermore, reinterpretation would not nullify the Expiry Law, but rather affirm its validity and purpose. Because re interpretation of the Expiry Law would result in the law&#39;s continued legal force, it should not be considered a serious option.   </p>

<p><img alt="Uruguay3.jpg" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Uruguay3.jpg" width="246" height="184" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" />A second option is to derogate the Expiry Law. Derogation would result in the Expiry Law&#39;s cancellation and prevent its application to future cases. However, just like reinterpretation, derogation would not have any effect on previously concluded cases. Furthermore, to derogate the amnesty law would imply that the law has legal status, whereas the Expiry Law should not be given any legal credence. Because derogation of the Expiry Law would preserve prior legal impunity, it should also be rejected.   </p>

<p>The third option is to declare the Expiry Law null and void.  This would imply that the amnesty law, because it violates <i>jus cogens</i> (compelling law) norms, is, and always has been, illegitimate. Therefore, nullification of the amnesty law would extinguish all of its effects, including decisions from previous cases. This would return to victims the right to truth, the right to justice, and the right to reparations. As a result, I hope that nullification is the course chosen by Uruguay.</p>

<p>Nullification is a valid option, as the Uruguayan Constitution gives the legislature the power to issue new laws, modify existing ones, and declare laws unconstitutional. Using this power, Uruguay&#39;s legislature has previously declared at least 2 laws null and void, setting a precedent for nullification of the Expiry Law.    </p>

<p>The Expiry Law&#39;s 20 year history in Uruguay has constituted a continuous violation of human rights, contravening fundamental rights granted by the Constitution and by the international human rights treaties to which Uruguay is a party. Uruguay has an obligation to remove all obstacles to the investigation and punishment of those responsible for the tortures, killings, illegal detentions, and forced disappearances during the dictatorship - including those cases that have already been decided. Uruguay must adopt the necessary legislative measures to comply with international standards and provide retributive and restorative justice to the victims of the Uruguayan civil-military dictatorship.</p>

She shares her experiences with the issue of environmental protection in Iraq...<br />
<hr height="1"><br />
<font size="3"><b>T</b></font>he environmental catastrophe caused by the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico reminded me of a vigorous debate concerning environmental protection between members of the Iraqi government and representatives of the autonomous Kurdish Region. As an extern student in Iraq in Summer 2009, I worked closely and regularly with the Iraqi Parliament and attended the meetings of the <a href="http://www.parliament.iq/english/Iraqi_Council_of_Representatives.php?name=singal9asdasdas9dasda8w9wervw8vw854wvw5w0v98457475v38937456033t64tg34t64gi4dow7wnf4w4y4t386b5w6576i75page&pa=showpage&pid=29">Constitutional Review Committee</a> (&quot;CRC&quot;), where I had the opportunity to witness this debate. Both sides were passionate about the principle of federalism and how power should be divided between the federal and regional governments. Unfortunately, however, the federal and regional representatives were much less concerned with the <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forumy/2009/09/reconsidering-rule-of-law-in-iraq.php">actual exercise of this disputed authority</a> in important areas, such as environmental protection.</p>

<p><img alt="Tigris River, Baghdad" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Baghdad1.jpg" width="326" height="245" title="Tigris River, Baghdad" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" />The debate occurred within the Constitutional Review Committee while it was considering revision of the federal and regional governments&#39; shared powers under Article 114 of the <a href="http://www.parliament.iq/manshurat/dastoreng.pdf">Constitution</a> [PDF]. The Kurdish representative argued strongly that the Kurdish region should have the sole power to monitor and protect its environment. On the other hand, the federal government argued that primary responsibility for drafting environmental policy should be federal, although implementation could be left to the regions. The CRC members debated this single point for over an hour, with each side attempting to grab as much power as possible. While the Kurdish region has enjoyed some autonomy from the Iraqi central government since 1991, the issue of Kurdish political autonomy is historically contentious and <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/07/kurdistan-parliament-delays.php">continues to be politically sensitive</a>. As a result, the issue of environmental protection had become a political tug of war between the country&#39;s two main governmental authorities - the central government in Baghdad and the Kurdish regional government based in Erbil. </p>

<p>The debate&#39;s contentiousness is not surprising given the sensitivity surrounding the proper allocation of power between the Iraqi central government and the Kurdish regional government. The irony, however, is that in the legal context of environmental policy, the tug-of-war between the two governments was over a fiction. Neither the Kurdish nor the federal government has a real environmental protection policy. </p>

<p><img alt="Tigris River, Baghdad" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Baghdad2.jpg" width="326" height="245" title="Tigris River, Baghdad" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" />The absence of an environmental protection policy is not due to a lack of laws regulating the environment. Both the federal government and the Kurdish region have passed laws and regulations for environmental protection. The Iraqi Parliament recently enacted <a href="http://www.parliament.iq/dirrasd/law/2009/27.pdf">Law No. 27 of 2009</a> [PDF, Arabic], For the Improvement and Protection of Environment, issued in Official Gazette No. 4142 of 2010. This detailed and strict law sets forth punishments for companies and individuals that violate environmental standards. It also upheld and affirmed existing regulations that outline environmental standards in specific detail. The Kurdish region has a similar law, <a href="http://www.kurdistan-parliament.org/files/articles/261008085744.pdf">No. 8 of 2008</a> [PDF, Arabic].</p>

<p>Yet, the reality of environmental protection is somewhat different. While the committee members were in the midst of their debate, I had mental images familiar to every Iraqi currently living in Baghdad -- the Tigris River filled with trash, untreated sewage, and garbage, all in violation of Law 27. In the Kurdish region, the situation is hardly different. The lovely mountains of the Kurdish region, where Iraqis picnic on the weekends, are invariably covered with trash, and thousands of empty bottles lie in unsightly piles on green fields. I started to laugh as I listened to the members&#39; heated arguments, since the passion surrounding policy control was in apparent ignorance of the reality of the country&#39;s neglected, serious environmental condition. There just does not seem to be the political will to take the actions necessary to implement a real environmental policy.</p>

<p>The session ended that day with the members having made no progress, divided as ever over who should control a non-existent policy. I decided to prepare a brief documentary report for the committee by taking photos of the country&#39;s environment. I wanted the committee to look at environmental problems across the country and then develop a policy or plan to implement and enforce existing laws and related regulations in areas clearly under their control, whether Baghdad for the federal government or Sulaymaniya for the Kurdish government. Then a fight over policy might make more sense. Federalism had become such a sensitive issue that it was provoking debates over who could exercise authority in an area of law - environmental protection - where neither government seemed anxious to actually act.</p>

<p><img alt="Azmar Mountain, Sulaymaniya" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Baghdad3.jpg" width="320" title="Azmar Mountain, Sulaymaniya" height="240" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" />I tried to take some photos of the part of the Tigris River that upset me the most - an area near Baghdad&#39;s Historic &quot;Suspension Bridge&quot; that I crossed every day, hoping for a nice and relaxing view of the river but instead finding floating garbage and empty bottles. Unfortunately, security regulations prevented me from taking a photograph of the river from that point. I could only secretly take photos of other areas of the river that were farther from checkpoints or other military bases or police stations. Then, during a trip to visit my family in Sulaymaniya, in the heart of the Kurdish region, I had the chance to take photos of the Azmar Mountain&#39;s most beautiful picnic area, which is covered by thousands of empty bottles and trash. Some of these photos can be seen in this article, but sadly, I never had the opportunity to submit them to the committee. The committee never met regularly again, and as election time neared, the members became occupied with their reelection. </p>

<p>The litter I saw on the mountains and in the streams represents only a small part of the environmental problems faced by the Iraqi people. The Iraqi government, both regional and federal, has failed to address these problems and other environmental concerns such as the consequences of Saddam Hussein&#39;s use of chemical weapons. All contribute to Iraq&#39;s water, air, and soil pollution, and affect the health of Iraqi people. </p>

<p>These problems require urgent action by some authority, regional or national. I hope that a younger and more assertive generation will ask more from its leaders and demand that they take a step toward bringing actual policy into force, rather than arguing about who is responsible.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Nicole Nishimura</strong> [<a href="http://www.envirorights.org/">California Environmental Rights Alliance]</a> &quot;The California Environmental Rights Alliance is an environmental justice organization based in Southern California - home to the worst air quality in the United States. Our organization works with those hardest hit by the effects of pollution. Oftentimes the most polluted neighborhoods are in low-income communities and communities of color - those least equipped to deal with the consequences. We work with these communities on the policy level helping to implement regulations that are protective of community health. That said, naturally, we are strong advocates of compliance when it comes to environmental regulations.</p>

                <p>It is unfortunate that the UK <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/06/european-commission-to-pursue-legal-action-against-uk-for-air-pollution.php">has yet to comply</a> with the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:152:0001:0044:EN:PDF">2008/50 directive</a> [PDF]. Given the amount of research done, the effects of pollution - PM 10 (particulate matter smaller than 10 micrometers) included - are devastating. By reducing emissions, we have the power to save lives and prevent debilitating illnesses. Saving lives should not be negotiable.</p>

                <p>To underscore the impacts of air pollution, a study conducted by the California Air Resources Board found that PM 2.5 alone is responsible for 5,400 premature deaths in the South Coast Air basin, a four-county area in Southern California with an approximate population of 16 million people. These are people <i>dying</i> from the air they breathe.</p>

                <p>With the advancement of technology and pollution control devices, there is no longer an excuse to keep functioning the way we have. Thousands of deaths attributed to air pollution is unacceptable. It is time for us to start cleaning up our act - which means it is imperative that companies, cities, states and nations comply with regulations and strive to reach emission reduction targets.&quot;  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Itzchak Kornfeld of the Faculty of Law at The Hebrew University in Jerusalem says that Israel is in a state of war with Hamas and, pursuant to the UN Charter, has the right to self-defense, including the right to inspect foreign vessels for weapons being brought to the group...<br /><hr size="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forumy/itzchakkornfeld.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table> <font size="3"><b>T</b></font>he recent Israeli Navy commando raid on the six-vessel Turkish Free Gaza flotilla has again exploded the Israeli-Palestinian conflict onto the world stage. And as usual, the two sides have staked out their positions. According to Ha'aretz, Captain R., a member of the Israeli naval commando force that raided the lead ship, the Mavi Marmara, characterized the ship's on-deck welcome as follows: "every commando who entered the ship was met by a number of activists who charged at the soldiers and attacked them. At least 75 percent of the activists took part in what the soldiers later described as a 'lynch.'" A "lynch" is how the Israeli government is now characterizing the entire affair. On the other side, Turkish activist Nilufer Cetin, who hid with her 1 year old baby in her cabin's bathroom aboard the Mavi Marmara, told reporters in Istanbul that "[t]he ship turned into a lake of blood...." </p>

<p>In turn, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and other Turkish leaders claim that the commando raid was a pirate attack on Turkish citizens. Erdogan told lawmakers in the Turkish parliament that "this bloody massacre by Israel on ships that were taking humanitarian aid to Gaza deserves every kind of curse," and called the Israeli action an "attack on international law." According to Reuters, Hamas Chief Khaled Meshal called "on all states... to cut diplomatic ties with Israel and urged Moscow and Washington to make it end its blockade of Gaza, after nine people died when Israel raided Gaza-bound aid ships." Finally, Israeli journalist, Gideon Levy, a reporter for Ha'aretz, wrote mordantly, in an article headlined, <em>Netanyahu Was Right</em>: "Some 7 billion human beings (less about 5 million Israeli Jews ) are wrong. They haven't got a leader like Netanyahu, and that's why they go on thinking that seizing passenger ships in international waters is an act of piracy, no different from the deeds committed by the pirates of Somalia."</p>

<p>The Israeli military has already begun an investigation into the incident that may reveal the facts, or at least some of them. International investigations may follow. However, lawyers across the world have been weighing in on whether Israel violated international law. For example, in a commentary in the Times of London, Mark Stephens, a London based Solicitor, claims that "[t]he actions of the commandos amounted to piracy and a breach of international law... [t]here are strict rules governing what can be done in international waters, and many countries also have laws similar to our Piracy Act of 1837." However, Mr. Stephens fails to cite any international law to support his claim. Similarly, a leading international lawyer, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei "called for Israel's prime minister and defence minister to face trial for the deadly raid on a Gaza aid flotilla in the eastern Mediterranean. The United States, Britain and France must also be held accountable for Monday's Israeli raid on the aid ships, said Khamenei, who is all-powerful in the Islamic republic," according to the AFP. </p>

<p>Alternatively, Professor Julian Ku, of the Opinio Juris international law blog wrote an incisive article titled "Did the Israeli Defense Forces Commandos Commit "Piracy"? Nope." in which he addressed the charge that Israel's commando raid was an act of piracy. Responding to these political claims Professor Ku cites the United Nations' Convention on the Law of the Sea ("UNCLOS").  UNCLOS governs numerous maritime activities including the jurisdiction of coastal States and the rights and freedoms of other States. Article 101 defines acts of piracy as follows:<br />
<blockquote>Piracy consists of any of the following acts:</p>

<p>(a) any illegal acts of violence or detention, or any act of depredation, <em>committed for private ends by the crew or the passengers of a private ship or a private aircraft</em>, and directed:</p>

<p>      (i) on the high seas, against another ship or aircraft, or against persons or property on board such ship or aircraft;</p>

<p>      (ii) against a ship, aircraft, persons or property in a place outside the jurisdiction of any State;</p>

<p>(b) any act of voluntary participation in the operation of a ship or of an aircraft with knowledge of facts making it a pirate ship or aircraft....</p>

<p>(Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>Based on current reports, it does not appear that even the members of the six-ship Free Gaza flotilla or their defenders claim that the Israeli Navy commando raid was "committed for private ends."  Indeed, the commandos boarded the ships for public purposes, which are just the opposite of private purposes. Moreover, in the broad legal spectrum, piracy cannot be committed by national ships, only by private ships or by national ships that have been taken over by their crews.</p>

<p>UNCLOS article 101 is considered a general definition of piracy under customary law. <em>See e.g.</em>, the International Law Commission's 1956 commentary to their draft convention on the law of the sea, later adopted as the Convention on the High Seas.   </p>

<p>By way of background, prior to UNCLOS' adoption in 1982, customary law did not authoritatively define piracy. For example, in its 1927 decision on the S.S. Lotus, the Permanent Court of International Justice held that "[P]iracy by the law of nations, in its jurisdictional aspects, is <em>sui generis</em>." Indeed, as the noted twentieth century British international law publicist J. L. Brierly noted in his book The Law of Nations: "There is no authoritative definition of international piracy, but it is of the essence of a piratical act to be an act of violence, committed at sea or at any rate closely connected with the sea, by persons not acting under proper authority."  </p>

<p><strong>The Proportionality Question</strong></p>

<p>Luca Schicho, Dr. Iur. candidate, at University of Vienna, Faculty of Law, has asked the following question: if piracy is not the central question here what is? The answer is how much "legal" force Israel used against the flotilla, <em>i.e.</em>, the question then revolves upon the European concept of proportionality. This issue was also raised by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on May 31, 2010, who also noted that a neutral fact finding determination is required if the questions regarding proportionality are to be truly answered. Chancellor Merkel appears to be raising a political issue.  </p>

<p>In contrast, the legal answer was was dealt with by the the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea ("ITLOS"), the tribunal set up by UNCLOS,  in its 1999 decision in the <em>MV Saiga Nr. 2</em> (St. Vincent v. Guinea) case. In discussing whether the force used by Guinea in stopping and boarding the Saiga was excessive, the Tribunal asserted that it was required to consider the circumstances of the ship's arrest, ruling that "Although the Convention does not contain express provisions on the use of force in the arrest of ships, international law, which is applicable by virtue of article 293 of the Convention [of the Law of the Sea], requires that the use of force must be avoided as far as possible and, where force is unavoidable, it must not go beyond what is reasonable and necessary in the circumstances. Considerations of humanity must apply in the law of the sea, as they do in other areas of international law." (para. 155 of the opinion).  </p>

<p>Finally, where does Israel - or for that matter any State - base its jurisdiction to board the flotilla's ships? That power arises from Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. Article 51 provides the following: <blockquote>Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.</blockquote>This entire episode arose out of Israel's blockade of Gaza. It is well known that Israel is at war with Hamas, the governing body in Gaza - who is also at war with the Fatah (the Palestinian Liberation Organization), which governs the West Bank, and whose members were cast off of the tops of buildings to their death in June 2006 - and therefore, pursuant to the UN Charter, has the right to self-defense, which includes boarding foreign vessels to check if they are bringing weapons to its enemy.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Yifat Susskind</strong> [Policy and Communications Director, <a href="www.madre.org/index.php?video=1">MADRE</a>]: "The <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/node/90862/section/2">report</a> by Human Rights Watch on female genital mutilation (FGM) in Kurdistan reveals the troubling reality facing women and girls compelled to undergo the procedure. Human Rights Watch references specifically the <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/06/rights-group-urges-iraqi-kurdistan-to-end-female-genital-mutilation.php">failure of the Kurdistan Regional Government</a> to take seriously the issue of FGM and to enact legislation to curb the practice.</p>

                <p>In investigating this issue, many have sought to demonstrate that Islam does not require this practice and that most Muslims practice their faith without FGM. Others have countered with the reverse, claiming that FGM forms an essential part of traditional culture. This debate about whether or not FGM is "cultural" obscures a fundamental reality: culture alone explains very little. It provides a context but does not serve as a useful explanation for harmful practices against women. </p>

                <p>Like all behavior, FGM has a cultural dimension, but its prevalence is equally shaped by social and economic factors (like poverty) and discourses (like women's rights) that can be deployed to either combat or promote FGM. Once we recognize the conditions and discourses that advance women's rights, we can also see how a legacy of US sanctions, invasion and occupation has undermined progress for women. War invariably constricts the civil society spaces where discussions on women's rights could occur.</p>

                <p>The work to end the practice of FGM must happen in concert with an effort to re-open and expand spaces for progressive discussion on women's human rights that have been shut down by the reality of war and violence. The Kurdish Regional Government must take a strong stance, but we must also work to eliminate the conditions that hamper the progress of a women's rights movement against FGM and all human rights violations."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Richard C. Dieter</strong> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/">Death Penalty Information Center</a>]: &quot;<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/us_and_canada/10254279.stm">Ronnie Lee Gardner</a> [BBC Backgrounder] was <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/06/utah-convict-executed-by-firing-squad.php">executed</a> in a hail of bullets as he sat strapped to a chair in a Utah prison a few nights ago.  Gardner got the kind of execution he wanted--death by firing squad--and Utah finally got what it wanted--retribution for the murder Gardner had committed twenty-five years ago.  We the people (and in this case, there was a worldwide audience) probably scratched our heads wondering what that was all about.</p>

                <p>Even though the U.S. is averaging one execution per week, no one pays much attention to such events because they are not news.  They are not the first or the last, the most or the least of anything.  Gardner&#39;s execution was news because it was the first use of the firing squad in 14 years and probably one of the last such executions in U.S. history.  We just don&#39;t do things like that any more.  The firing squad, like the electric chair, the gas chamber, and the gallows, is more appropriately found in museums and old movies, not in modern civilized society.  We don&#39;t shoot or hang people because such actions are repulsive to our sensibilities, demeaning to human life, and accomplish nothing worthwhile.</p>

                <p>But while the firing squad is clearly on the way out, executions by lethal injection continue under a cloak of antiseptic obscurity.  The death penalty is winding down, as overwhelming evidence in this country and around the world demonstrates.  Death sentences, executions, and the number of states with the death penalty have dropped sharply in the past decade.  The U.S. is now one of a very small number of countries to carry out executions annually.  The strong stream of progress in human rights implies that capital punishment itself will eventually be relegated to the same history as slavery, apartheid, and torture.  Even as vestiges of these practices remain, they are clearly condemned in the world community.  We continue to execute people in this country not because such actions are necessary but because we have not yet figured out how to extricate ourselves from this practice.  In the meantime, people like Ronnie Gardner are chosen from among thousands on death row and killed because their number has come up.  Occasionally they &quot;go out in a blaze of glory,&quot; but as retiring Justice John Paul Stevens recently concluded, it is the pointless and needless extinction of life.&quot;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The ICC Review Conference: The Forgotten Issues</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.uel.ac.uk/chrc/about/staff.htm">Chandra Lekha Sriram</a> of the University of East London says that a stocktaking of the impact of the ICC thus far should have been given priority during the ICC review conference given that this is likely to shape perceptions of the court for years to come....<br /><hr size="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forumy/chandrasriramnew2.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table> <font size="3"><b>T</b></font>he first major review conference of the International Criminal Court (ICC), was held 31 May-11 June in  most <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/exeres/CF95BB41-B15A-45DA-B8CF-33E873E73829.htm">inapposite settings</a>: at a luxury resort on the shores of Lake Victoria outside Kampala.  However, bucolic setting aside,  the first major review conference of the International Criminal Court (ICC) had serious business on its agenda.  </p>

<p>The conference engaged in a wide-ranging stocktaking of the operation of the court to date, as well as considering significant amendments to the statute.  It has considered the relation between peace and justice, the impact of the ICC on victims and other affected communities, ways in which national jurisdictions can be supported in addressing violations which would otherwise be under the jurisdiction of the court, and the addition of the use of certain categories of weapons as war crimes in internal conflict. However, it is the treatment of the crime of aggression--discussion of which began late last week--that is being treated as "the main event," which is something of a shame. The stocktaking of the effects of the court to date should be viewed as equally important, given that this is likely to shape perceptions of the court for years to come.</p>

<p>While defining the crime of aggression and determining who can trigger or restrain (filter) an application is undoubtedly important, so too were the other items on the agenda for the two weeks of this conference.  A number of critical issues have been underreported in the international press, save for notional attention to the major speeches of senior figures such as the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Prosecutor of the ICC which touched on them.  It is these issues, and not the as-yet unprosecutable crime of aggression, which will continue shape the impact of the ICC and perceptions of its legitimacy. </p>

<p>The ICC and its advocates have pinned their hopes for its legitimacy and legacy on its effects at various levels.  It is expected to help promote peace and deter future crimes; it is expected through complementarity to promote national efforts at accountability; and it is expected to have a positive impact for victims.  All of these are laudable goals.  However, the discussions, and the draft resolutions  on these topics, included precious little by way of specifics. Take, for example, the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/BC21BFDF-88CD-426B-BAC3-D0981E4ABE02/281751/PolicyPaperonVictimsParticipationApril2010.pd">discussion of the impact of the court on victims</a>.  This is relatively novel for international criminal tribunals in that it has a victims' trust fund, to which states can contribute and into which fines imposed on some convicted will be deposited.  However, the actual effects of this remain to be assessed; a conference engaged in stock-taking might have done this and more. Indeed, there remains confusion among many with regard to who counts as a victim for the court: for actual trial proceedings it is clearly victims of the named accused, while for the victims' trust fund it is potentially rather wider. </p>

<p>Similarly, with regard to the impact of the court on peace and justice, and the actual operation of complementarity, discussions have been unfortunately vague.  Interventions have posited the opposition of peace and justice, with delegates simultaneously asserting that peace and justice might in fact be consistent, without offering specifics.  Sitting in Uganda, with debates about the impact of the court on peace negotiations with the Lord's Resistance Army continuing to reverberate, this seems a missed opportunity. </p>

<p>Complementarity, the principle that the court will not exercise jurisdiction unless the state in question is genuinely unable or unwilling to conduct investigations or prosecutions, has been re-cast by the prosecutor of the ICC, in a move embraced by party states, as "<a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/66A8DCDC-3650-4514-AA62-D229D1128F65/281506/OTPProsecutorialStrategy20092013.pdf">positive complementarity</a>".  This is the idea that the court can and should help to promote investigation and prosecution by affected states, and even promote national capacity.  Yet precisely what this means seems to be a matter of some confusion, as the prosecutor's promotion of a failed "three pronged strategy" of commission of inquiry, local tribunal, and ICC prosecutions for Kenya seems to demonstrate.  Yet the discussion of positive complementarity has been largely vague and self-congratulatory, with no recognition of the ways in which governments such as those in Kenya may seek to use this conception to evade ICC scrutiny. </p>

<p>As if to demonstrate the failure of positive complementarity, two competing delegations from Kenya (only one formally recognized), which is the subject of ICC investigation in relation to post-election violence, <a href="http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/editorial/InsidePage.php?id=2000010916&cid=16&]">held competing press conferences</a> and shouted at one another at the review conference last Thursday, while ostensibly discussing Kenya's cooperation with the court.</p>

<p>Should the review conference be judged on its stock-taking activities alone, it could well be judged a missed opportunity.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist Andrea Prasow, senior counter-terrorism counsel at Human Rights Watch, says that while the new system of  Detainee Review Boards at Bagram is a significant improvement over past US practice, the US and its coalition partners need to do much more to get a functioning Afghan judicial system up and running...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forumy/andreaprasownew.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>E</b></font>ven as he sat before a panel of US military officers who would determine his fate, the prisoner - I'll call him Abdul - did not try to hide the reason he had come to Afghanistan from Pakistan. He had come to fight Americans, he said, because he had heard they were torturing Afghans, and he wanted to defend his brothers.<br />
 <br />
Shortly after entering Afghanistan in July 2009, the group Abdul was traveling with was decimated by US and coalition forces. Most of Abdul's fellow fighters were killed, but Abdul survived and was taken to Bagram, where he had been held ever since. Now, he faced a Detainee Review Board (DRB), which would determine whether he was properly detained by US forces, whether he would pose a threat to US or coalition forces if released, and whether or not he did anything that might warrant his being handed over to the Afghan government for criminal prosecution.<br />
 <br />
Abdul told the officers presiding over his DRB hearing that his time at Bagram had taught him that he had made a terrible mistake and that now he simply wished to return home to his family and lead a peaceful life. "If I get released," Abdul said through an interpreter, "I will tell everyone that they [Americans] treated me well, even though I was the enemy."</p>

<p>Thousands of detainees have been held at Bagram since the early days of US involvement in Afghanistan after 9/11. Under the Bush administration, detainees were initially denied access to any form of review.  Then, in 2005, the military started a limited administrative review process, which it revamped in 2009. The DRBs are modeled after the Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs) previously used at Guantanamo Bay.</p>

<p>The Guantanamo CSRTs were hastily created in 2004 after the Supreme Court ruled that detainees at Guantanamo were entitled to a hearing to challenge the grounds for their detention. But these hearings were deeply flawed and rarely resulted in detainees being freed. Rather, they were set up to validate the president's determination that everyone held at Guantanamo was an "enemy combatant" and was properly detained. </p>

<p>The CSRTs did not permit the detainees to have lawyers, and although they were allowed in theory to call witnesses, no witness requested by a detainee was ever produced. Rarely was a detainee ever found not to be an enemy combatant, and when it did happen, the CSRTs were almost always repeated a second and even third time until the desired outcome -- continued detention -- was reached. Eventually, the Supreme Court ruled that the CSRTs were inadequate, and each detainee at Guantanamo is now entitled to a habeas corpus hearing in federal court.</p>

<p>The Obama administration asserts that detainees at Bagram have no right to habeas corpus review.  That view was affirmed by a three-judge panel in Washington on May 21, which ruled that detainees captured elsewhere in the world and brought to Bagram are not entitled to judicial review in a US court.  While that decision might ultimately be overturned by the Supreme Court, currently no detainee held by the US in Afghanistan has the right to judicial review.</p>

<p>During the Bush administration, Bagram cases were reviewed by a military panel known as an Unlawful Enemy Combatant Review Board. Those review boards were deemed by a federal judge to be even less protective of detainees' rights than the deficient CSRTs. The DRBs established by the Obama administration -- operating since September under interim guidelines -- are designed not only to review the basis for detention but also to serve as a relationship-building exercise between the US military and the local population. In March, the US military invited several international nongovernmental organizations, including <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a>, to observe the new DRBs for the first time. </p>

<p>The invitation to observe the proceedings was a welcome move toward increasing the openness and transparency of US detention policy. It stands in sharp contrast to the position that the administration has taken in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a>. While the US agreed to release the names of the detainees held at Bagram, it has refused to release other pertinent information, such as the internment serial number given to each detainee and the date and place he was captured, as well as the circumstances surrounding his capture.</p>

<p>Bagram has a torrid history. In the early years of the US involvement in Afghanistan it was the site of torture and abuse that resulted in the deaths of at least two detainees. But last year the US built a new prison complex and implemented vocational training programs and art and English classes, as well as the new DRBs. The new prison is sometimes called the Detention Facility in Parwan, although it is technically unnamed. The US military plans to turn over operation of the facility to the Afghan government as part of a new rule of law initiative, and wants to leave the official name up to the Afghans.</p>

<p>The Afghan government feels that this is long overdue, but sadly, so is the reform of Afghan detention practices. Torture in Afghan detention is still commonplace, making transfer of detainees to Afghan custody problematic under international law. Although billions of dollars have been spent on capacity building and training in Afghanistan, helping to stop torture has not been a priority for the US and other international actors.</p>

<p>The DRBs are intended to determine whether each detainee has been properly detained by US forces. If the military panel determines that he may appropriately be detained, there remains an additional consideration: will he pose a future threat to US or coalition forces if released? If the answer is no, the man is supposed to be set free. There is also a third option: detainees may be turned over to the custody of the Afghan government for criminal prosecution. Since September 2009, more than 80 detainees have been recommended for release, and the US government reports that the current release rate is around 50 percent. While this high release rate might be based on the new consideration of whether detainees pose a future threat, it also suggests that some of these men should never have been detained in the first place. </p>

<p>For those wrongfully detained, improvements in the process by which they may ultimately be released will provide little comfort. The fact is that the US is still obtaining flawed intelligence, and the wrong people are still picked up and detained. That same flawed intelligence guides "night raids" by US forces on suspected insurgent locations that in recent months have killed over a dozen civilians. Despite improved tactical directives about how the US can apprehend suspected insurgents, poor intelligence and a failure to use "soft knocks" -- which show greater respect for civilians -- continue to cost too many lives.    </p>

<p>I observed five DRBs, and every detainee I saw that day told the review board that he had been treated well.  Some may have been motivated by a desire to appear as a good candidate for release, although there have been few reports in recent years of serious abuses at the main prison at Bagram. Of course, without independent monitors who can report publicly on abuse, it is difficult to know for sure what the conditions are like. Even the human rights observers like myself, while permitted to observe the review boards, were not allowed to interview detainees. And recent reports of abuse have come from former detainees who claim to have been held at another detention site at Bagram, a detention facility the US has denied exists. It is only by reading between the lines of carefully worded US government statements that it becomes clear that there is indeed another facility at Bagram, which the US considers a transit center and not a detention facility. And so, while human rights observers watched mostly open proceedings in Parwan, a largely secret prison still operates just down the road.  </p>

<p>Nevertheless, at the Detention Facility in Parwan, the US officers in charge seemed genuinely interested to hear my thoughts about the process, as well as those of the other NGO observers in attendance. This contrasts with the practice at Guantanamo, where NGO observers are treated as both a nuisance and a security threat. There, we are escorted by a service member at all times and must all stay together, not only in sight of the escort but often within arm's reach. (On a recent trip to Guantanamo, a colleague wanted to use a telephone that was 50 feet away in plain view. We were all forced to follow her and stand beside her so that the escort could simultaneously supervise all of us.)</p>

<p>The Parwan team's greater interest in engaging with NGOs is not simply a reflection of individual personalities.  It also appears to reflect an increasing US government focus on Afghanistan. Guantanamo is a messy, old problem that the Obama administration is surely unhappy to have inherited, but it is only one aspect of the greater "detainee problem." Recent articles have suggested that the administration is searching for a place to detain alleged terrorists captured abroad. With the closure of Guantanamo on the horizon, Bagram may be under consideration as a possible site for future "war on terror" detentions.  The administration's refusal to release additional identifying information about the detainees there -- including their citizenship -- is therefore of even greater concern. The information that the government claims is classified and protected from release under the Freedom of Information Act is exactly the same information that I heard in an unclassified DRB hearing. No restrictions were placed on my ability to take notes, and I have changed people's names here to protect their privacy, not because of any rule or requirement that restricts my ability to share that information.   </p>

<p>Despite the high-level focus and evident dedication of the personnel involved, the DRBs remain flawed. As with the CSRTs, detainees don't have access to legal counsel. Instead, they have a military officer called a Personal Representative appointed to assist them. But they don't truly represent them - there is no lawyer-client confidentiality and no reason for the detainees to trust the US military officers. As it is, conscientious Personal Representatives are overworked -- there are 800 detainees and only 8 Personal Representatives.  Although detainees can meet with family members in person or by video conference, they are unable to meet with a lawyer. And secret evidence -- unavailable to the detainee -- continues to be used in almost every case. </p>

<p>In the DRBs I observed, several detainees were asked why an unnamed source might have turned them in. The source's identity was classified, causing the detainee to speculate as to who in his village might dislike him enough to provide information -- false or otherwise -- to US forces. It is simply impossible for a detainee to fairly rebut the accusations against him without being able to see the evidence. </p>

<p>But despite the flaws, what struck me as most significant at Bagram was that the detainees had a real opportunity to tell their stories. In the five hearings I observed, each man provided a statement to the board that explained his version of the facts, and answered questions. (At Guantanamo, detainees often boycotted the CSRT hearings because they had no faith in the process.) </p>

<p>At most of the hearings I attended, live witnesses testified -- local or provincial elders who knew the man in question or could attest to the family support he would receive if he were released. The witnesses served two purposes. In some cases, they provided factual evidence to corroborate a detainee's story, such as one man's story that he kept explosives in his house because he sometimes breaks up rock in a nearby quarry to sell to the Provincial Reconstruction Team -- a joint military-civilian unit that assists in rebuilding the country. Some witnesses testified that they knew he tried to make extra money by selling rocks, corroborating the man's testimony. In other cases, witnesses were called to talk about the impact of a detainee's release into his community. </p>

<p>The US' new approach to Afghan detainees purportedly seeks to determine, among other things, whether releasing a detainee back into his community will improve perceptions of US forces among Afghans. Many of the witnesses said that a release would do exactly that. Village elders told the military officers that their communities would appreciate that their elders' views were taken into account, and respect the US for releasing someone who had been wrongly detained. In the murky Afghan conflict, where some people are the proverbial farmers by day and fighters by night, the US really does need to win the hearts and minds of the populace if it ever hopes to accomplish lasting change. But why then does it insist on hiding information about the detainees it holds outside of the Parwan detention facility, or claiming that additional identifying information about them -- the same information you are reading about here -- is classified?</p>

<p>My day of observing was long, and by 8 pm I was getting tired. I had already seen three detainees explain why they should be released, and I thought perhaps we would recess for the night and continue in the morning. But at Bagram, the schedule is five hearings a day, five days a week. Anything less and the US military would not be able to adhere to its schedule of biannual reviews for every detainee in its custody at Parwan.</p>

<p>And so the fourth detainee, who I will call Khan, entered the room, hands in shackles; he would remain shackled throughout the proceeding. A military lawyer serving in the role of Recorder presented evidence in what was supposed to be a neutral manner to a three-person panel of senior military officers. The Personal Representative attempted to defend Khan -- asking him questions that permitted him to relate his version of events -- and then Khan was allowed to make his own statement.</p>

<p>"Everyone, even the governor, knows me and knows I am innocent," Khan said.  When questioned by the Recorder about why he had phone numbers of various people, including those believed to be associated with the Taliban, in his cell phone, Khan explained that he is a mechanic and does business with his cell phone. It appeared that Khan's nephew might be a member of the Taliban, or maybe he just shared the same name as a Taliban commander, whose number may have been in the phone. When asked about the issuse, Khan responded, "I don't know anything about that.  I don't deny he is my nephew.  If I had his phone number I wouldn't deny that either."</p>

<p>An old man from Loghar Province entered the room, called as a witness by the Personal Representative. Najib, as I will call him, an elder from the local council from Khan's region, testified that he had known Khan for fifteen years. "Does he have any enemies?" asked the Recorder. "Maybe," Najib responded. "If he didn't have any enemies, why would he be here?"</p>

<p>It was a good question. </p>

<p>Various witnesses throughout the day urged the US government to be more open with the Afghans about the people they wish to detain. One witness asked, "In the future, I hope if you want these people you will come to us and tell us.  It will be easier than you coming with tanks and airplanes." Although they seemed grateful for the opportunity to attend the DRBs, the experience must have been a little like that of Alice after falling through the rabbit hole. "You helped us do jihad," said another elder. "And now you ask us why we did jihad?" </p>

<p>And then there was Abdul -- the young man from Pakistan who had traveled to Afghanistan to fight the people he claimed to believe were abusing Afghans. His hearing began shortly before 11 pm. I couldn't tell if Abdul was scared, tired, resigned, or all of the above, as he sat quietly while the Recorder read out the accusations against him. </p>

<p>Abdul's case was a difficult one. I was grateful that I was not responsible for deciding whether to detain him or set him free. Under the DRB rules, even if the review board believed Abdul planned to attack US forces, he would have to be released if he would not pose a future threat. And indeed, the review board did recommend release, and Abdul is currently awaiting transfer back to Pakistan. </p>

<p>The treatment of detainees in Afghanistan is still a far cry from what is required under international law during a civil war: detainees should be brought before a court, charged with a criminal offense, and tried before a court that meets basic fair trial standards. Or they should be released. The US and its coalition partners need to do much more to get a functioning Afghan judicial system up and running, but the new system at Bagram is a significant improvement over past US practice. Those detained at least had the chance to show up and be heard. And some of them, after presenting their side of the story, will be released and will go home.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnists Michael Kearney, a lecturer in international law at the University of York (UK), and Victor Kattan, Teaching Fellow at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, argue for the recognition of Palestine as a State competent to accept the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court pursuant to Article 12 of the Rome Statute...</p>

<hr height="1">

<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 align=left> <tr><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forumy/michaelkearney.jpg" align=left hspace=0 vspace=2></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height=1 width=5></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height=1 width=1></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forumy/victorkattan.jpg" align=left hspace=0 vspace=2></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height=1 width=5></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height=1 width=1></td></tr></table><font size="3"><b>O</b></font>n May 6, the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (OTP) published a summary of various papers submitted to it concerning the declaration lodged by the Palestinian National Authority (PA) pursuant to Article 12 of the Rome Statute. Article 12(3) of the Statute enables a State not party to the Statute to accept the exercise of jurisdiction by the Court.  The <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/D3C77FA6-9DEE-45B1-ACC0-B41706BB41E5/281887/PALESTINEFINAL3.pdf">Summary</a> includes an annex with links to a number of papers arguing both for and against the OTP's acceptance of the declaration. The key arguments advanced in these submissions are that 1) Palestine is not a state and therefore cannot submit a valid declaration, 2) Palestine is a state, 3) Palestine can be considered a state for the purposes of the Rome Statute and submit a valid declaration.

<p>Several distinct themes recur throughout the submissions, with the core of the debate revolving around the question of the status of Palestine and the powers of the Court.  Whilst Palestine is not universally recognized as a sovereign and independent state, there is nonetheless widespread recognition that it has a special status under international law, which differentiates it from other actors seeking independence.  According to the latest <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/">UN Development Program's Human Development Index Rankings</a>, the Occupied Palestinian Territories are graded above many of the world's established states, including Egypt, India, Indonesia, Namibia, Pakistan, South Africa, and Sudan.  Palestine is effectively being kept in limbo until Israel agrees to end its occupation, yet no state accepts that the occupation can continue indefinitely. If one had to invent a category of state, one might call Palestine an "occupied state."  Accordingly, we concur with the view of those submissions that argue that Palestine can be considered a state for the purposes of the Rome Statute even though its territory is occupied and that the declaration lodged on 21 January 2009 by the Minister of Justice of the PA should be deemed valid. </p>

<p>The international community as represented by the Quartet, through its prioritization of the political peace process, has deemed it appropriate to withhold recognition of a Palestinian state until such time as Israel signals its approval by ending its occupation. Meanwhile, the Palestinians are urged to establish and to shore up state institutions in preparation for the awarding of such recognition. To this end, the PA is receiving substantial political and financial support from the EU and US, which declared the emergence of an independent Palestinian state a policy priority and inevitability. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Israel consistently asserts that it can never cede its control over Jerusalem, the Jordan Valley, and the major settlement blocks, and that the future Palestinian state that it will recognize must remain demilitarized and subject to Israeli oversight. Such a contradictory situation appears to be accepted by the Quartet, as well as by the major powers that can offer the Palestinians the recognition they claim. </p>

<p>Thus, should future negotiations follow the well traveled route of previous efforts, and subordinate Palestinian legal rights to political expediency, what will emerge as a Palestinian state will be a fragmented and politically castrated entity, whose claim to sovereignty and independence will be hollow in light of the right of the Palestinians to self-determination on all of the territory occupied in 1967. This right has been recognized by the UN in many resolutions, in numerous international instruments, and by the International Court of Justice in its Wall opinion of 2004.</p>

<p>There is little doubt that such an outcome can only lead to further violence and rebellion, since the core Palestinian right will remain frustrated. We would suggest that, given the vacuous nature of the ongoing political process and a clear failure of negotiations, it is imperative that international law be brought to bear against all parties in order to secure a just and lasting end to the conflict. The recognition of the Palestinian state for the purposes of the Rome Statute would be a key step in this direction. </p>

<p>Whereas we believe that the recognition and emergence of a Palestinian state and an end to the occupation is a prerequisite for peace in the region and the guarantee of full and equal rights for all, such a suggestion is not made for purposes of political expediency. A clear, forceful, and persuasive case has been made in several of the submissions annexed to the OTP's summary that Palestine can, and should be, accepted as a state for the purposes of the Rome Statute.  In the first instance, Palestine fulfills all of the criteria set out in the <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/intam03.asp">Montevideo Convention</a>, including the capacity to enter into international relations with other states.  Palestine has signed many treaties with states and international organizations.  It has its own Basic Law, its own nationality laws, legal system and courts, and exercises authority over its territory, albeit subject to the Israeli military control.  Palestinians can travel abroad on PA issued travel documents, and Palestinian embassies, consulates, and representative offices are hosted all over the globe.  </p>

<p>According to Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad al-Malki, Palestine has been recognized as a state by at least 67 countries and has signed bilateral treaties with states in Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Europe.  As the Permanent Court of International Justice observed in the <u>Case of the S.S. "Wimbledon"</u>, "the right of entering into an international engagement is an attribute of State sovereignty."  Al-Malki's conservative estimate of state recognition (others put the figure at over 100) is similar to the number of states that have recognized Kosovo.  The recognition that has been granted Palestine is manifested not just in the traditional manner of state recognition, but has developed in line with the increasing engagement of Palestine with international law over the past decade. Thus, when considering whether Palestine is a state or not, the ICC must look not only to the quantity of states that have recognized Palestine, but also to the practice of international organizations and states in recognizing Palestine as an actor that is willing and able to engage with international institutions.  For instance, in 1998, in an often overlooked and little reported event, Palestine was admitted as a member of the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), whose Statute defines a member country as "an independent state recognized by the international community." Palestine was also given standing before the ICJ by being allowed to submit written and oral pleadings prior to the ICJ rendering its Advisory Opinion on the Wall in June 2004, a privilege that is normally reserved for states and international organizations. </p>

<p>Another key development was the <a href="http://unispal.un.org/unispal.nsf/181c4bf00c44e5fd85256cef0073c426/9cc062414581d038852576c10055b066?OpenDocument">UN General Assembly Resolution 64/10</a> of November 2009, <a href="http://unispal.un.org/unispal.nsf/181c4bf00c44e5fd85256cef0073c426/9e2dc74f7aaed8a4852576d5004e7c68?OpenDocument">reaffirmed in February 2010</a>, which called upon Palestine to conduct investigations "that are independent, credible and in conformity with international standards into the serious violations of international humanitarian and international human rights law."  Many of these breaches of humanitarian law amount to grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions that fall within the jurisdiction of the ICC, and this resolution must be acknowledged as having been a recognition that Palestine exercises adequate state-like powers such that it is expected to follow through upon and implement obligations, which otherwise only fall to states. Despite opposing the Resolutions, the US also recognized this Palestinian capacity and urged the Palestinians to conduct such investigations and prosecutions. Given this combination of explicit and implicit recognition it would be incongruous to claim that Palestine is just another non-state actor on par with armed guerrilla groups. Furthermore, there is no doubting that Palestine is recognized as exercising jurisdiction over crimes set forth in the Rome Statute, and thus, in light of all other factors, must be permitted to transfer such jurisdiction to the Court.   </p>

<p>To characterize Palestine as a non-state actor is to adopt a manifestly unreasonable interpretation rooted in a backward-looking approach that is blind to the factual and legal situation that exists today.  Such a characterization serves only to continue to hold Palestine to act in accordance with obligations reserved to states, while at the same time denying Palestine the corresponding rights of states. The OTP must not repeat the mistakes of the ICJ in the South/South-West Africa dispute of 1966 that led to the Court being depicted as the "white man's court" by the developing nations.  </p>

<p>Claims that acceptance of the Palestinian declaration by the OTP would be <i>ultra vires</i> are without foundation. The OTP has the discretion to accept the Palestinian declaration by reference to the legal and factual evidence before it. In any case, a positive decision by the OTP will be subject to review by the bench of the Court itself, which will have the opportunity to rule as to whether the decision was in keeping with the Court's Statute. </p>

<p>That a positive decision and the acceptance of the Palestinian declaration would be controversial is undeniable. The political ramifications would no doubt be enormous. Recent steps towards the application of international law to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, such as the General Assembly's endorsement of the Goldstone Report and the issuance of an arrest warrant against the leader of the Israeli opposition, Tzipi Livni, on war crimes charges by a London magistrate court, have led to diplomatic outrage. </p>

<p>Charges of politicization, and even of the subversive use of international law, have followed each Palestinian step towards engagement with the international legal framework. Such a situation is unlikely to change, but it should be of no concern to the OTP or to the International Criminal Court, which is charged with acting independently and in line with the Rome Statute and the precepts of international law, regardless of the political offence it causes to states.</p>

<p>Palestine is widely recognized as being a state, in many respects Palestine acts and is treated as a state, and Palestine is almost universally recognized as sharing the obligations of states when it comes to the suppression, investigation, and prosecution of crimes within the jurisdiction of the Rome Statute of the ICC. Given the ICC's purpose of exercising jurisdiction wherever it may legitimately do so, to deny the Palestinian declaration on the basis that certain powers continue to obstruct Palestine's full political recognition of statehood would be to do a disservice not only to the Israeli and Palestinian people, caught in a region where impunity has for too long been permitted to prevail, but to the very Statute of the ICC itself.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Dave Sidhu, founding director of the <a href="http://pluralism.org/affiliates/kaur_sidhu/">Discrimination and National Security Initiative</a> (DNSI) and a fellow at the <a href="http://pluralism.org/">Pluralism Project</a> at Harvard University, says that the soon-likely-to-be-complete domination of the US Supreme Court by graduates of two Ivy League American law schools is cause for considerable concern, despite elite contentions to the contrary...<br /><hr size="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forumy/davesidhu.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table> <font size="3"><b>I</b></font>f Elena Kagan is confirmed as the next Supreme Court justice, all nine members of the highest court in the land will be graduates of the nation's two most exclusive law schools - Harvard and Yale.  Christopher Edley, a former law professor at Harvard Law School when Kagan was its dean, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/14/AR2010051403641.html">defends</a> this likely outcome, arguing that we should prefer judges with excellence and that schools such as Harvard and Yale are part of an "elite meritocracy" whose selectiveness generally filters out all but the excellent.  In what follows, I suggest that Edley, now dean of UC Berkeley School of Law, misses the mark and that the elitist composition of the Supreme Court is problematic notwithstanding Edley's apologia.</p>

<p>In touting excellence as the touchstone of a quality justice, Edley contends that what matters on the Supreme Court is "intellectual horsepower," "wisdom and analysis," and "not personal experiences."  But a judge's intellect, wisdom, and analytical abilities are informed by, if not dependent upon, his or her personal experiences.  In <i>The Common Law</i>, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes astutely observed that, "The life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience." University of Chicago law professor and federal appellate court judge Richard A. Posner similarly stated that there is "a considerable residue of cases . . . against which logic and science will be unavailing and practical reason will break its often none-too-sturdy lance." "Practical reason," Posner explains, consists of "anecdote, introspection, imagination, common sense, empathy . . . , metaphor, analogy, precedent, custom, memory, 'experience,' intuition, and induction," among other things.</p>

<p>That personal experiences play a critical role in the development of the law is more than legal theory - it is confirmed by Supreme Court history.  Justice Holmes's experience as a civil war veteran, for example, clearly shaped his judicial decisionmaking.  As Jeffrey Rosen <a href="http://www.shopthirteen.org/product/show/29471">notes</a>, "Holmes insisted that his three years as a lieutenant in the Civil War had influenced his judicial philosophy even more than his thirty years on the Supreme Court."  Moreover, Justice John Paul Stevens - the man Kagan is tapped to replace - served in the U.S. Navy during World War II, which <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2010/04/the-path-from-chevron-to-hamdan/">enlarged</a> his perspectives on various legal issues, especially national security, foreign affairs, and claims of executive authority.  Practical experience is thus important.  Edley's belief to the contrary, that "Kagan has excelled in the legal field" and that this "ought to be enough," is unconvincing.</p>

<p>Edley seems to believe that conversations surrounding practical experience are a mere sideshow or naked effort to humanize an otherwise smart individual.  He writes that "to be safe," Kagan "must explain what beer she drinks while slugging softballs."  This sarcastic comment completely ignores the substantive value that one's background and life experiences have on one's view of the law, as demonstrated by Justices Holmes's and Stevens's tenures on the Court.  It dodges the question of what, if anything, in Kagan's <a href="http://www.concurringopinions.com/archives/2010/05/the-unbearable-lightness-of-empathy.html">biography</a> or her <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2253505">writings</a> indicates that she possesses life experiences that can enrich her understanding (and by extension her prospective colleagues' collective understanding) of the law, or that she possesses a particular appreciation for certain individuals, groups, or communities that will appear before her.  This inquiry is not designed to determine whether she is an "ordinary" person, as Edley derisively remarks, but to ensure she is extraordinary in terms of her rational thinking and practical reason.  (Edley mentions his wife, who "grew up picking crops in an immigrant farmworker family," but one wishes Edley could point to something, anything, in Kagan's life as similar evidence of her empathy.)</p>

<p>Assuming that excellence alone defines an appropriate Supreme Court justice, Edley acknowledges that elite schools do not have a monopoly on excellence - some "good people" are "denied entry" and are consequently compelled to study elsewhere.  And he admits that there have been some "false positives," that is, "not-so-good people mistakenly admitted to elite settings."   But he fails to concede that because not every student at an elite school is "good," elite schools are not a proxy for excellent students.  Edley does not provide any information showing that elite schools measure or identify excellence any more accurately or reliably as compared to other schools, nor does he give meaningful credit to the fact that some quality students opt to attend non-elite schools for financial, geographic, family, or other reasons, including attractive and affordable programs at state schools.  (Financial limitations and admissions considerations, such as "legacy" relationships or membership to an underrepresented minority group, cut against Edley's attempt to associate Berkeley and other elite law schools with merit-based democratic institutions.)</p>

<p>Even if all students at elite schools are not excellent as a matter of fact, the perception exists nonetheless that the uppermost echelons of professional success are restricted to those who attend Harvard, Yale, and the other Ivies.  Indeed, Kagan's nomination sends a powerful message to aspiring lawyers, law students, attorneys, and the general public: you must graduate from an elite law school in order to be a Supreme Court justice and thereby reach the height of American legal practice.  In an age when President Obama's ascendance was thought to shatter certain glass ceilings, his selection of Kagan perpetuates another: the dominance of elite schools, including his own, over the top strata of American governance and public service.  </p>

<p>Thomas Jefferson, founder of the University of Virginia, believed in a "natural aristocracy" in which "merit and talent," not "connections and influence," were to be the proper criteria for selecting our leaders.  This is not to say that Kagan herself is without merit.  She is amply qualified for the post of Supreme Court justice.  But her nomination comes at a cost - the reinforced perception that merit matters, and it matters most when it has been validated by certain rarefied institutions.  In picking Kagan, Obama regrettably bypassed the opportunity to send a different statement to youth and the people - sadder still is that Edley does not appear to think a different statement is needed at all. </p>

		<title>EUROPE: Privacy and Free Speech</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>M. Patrick Yingling, Pitt Law &#39;11, recently studied at Bucerius Law School in Hamburg, Germany, and is currently studying at the University of Bologna in Italy...<br />
<hr height="1"><br />
<font size="3"><b>E</b></font>urope and the United States share many legal principles.  But they differ as regards notions of privacy and free speech. While European media outlets have been prohibited from publishing truthful information that the courts have found to be irrelevant, the American press has not faced such a restriction. This distinction has become increasingly controversial due to the internet&#39;s growing international reach. The controversy can be seen, for example, in the case of two recently released murderers in Germany who filed suit against the Wikipedia Foundation because Wikipedia refused to remove their names from an article about their victim, a former German actor. Due to the German courts&#39; custom of suppressing the names of convicted criminals, the two men were able to convince Wikipedia&#39;s German editors to delete their names from the German-language version of the article. However, American courts interpret privacy rights differently, and it is very likely that the Wikipedia Foundation, which is based in the United States, will find safe haven under the First Amendment.</p>

<p>In order to effectively deal with differing notions of privacy and free speech on an international level, it is necessary to understand why these differences exist.  In the case of Europe and the United States, it may seem like a simple constitutional issue.  The United States Constitution protects freedom of speech without explicitly providing for a countervailing right to privacy. In contrast, the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), in addition to protecting freedom of speech, specifically defines a right to privacy. Nonetheless, such a simplistic explanation only scratches the surface.  In order to dig deeper, one must recognize a distinction between privacy from the government as opposed to privacy between citizens.  Americans typically put a high value on privacy from the government.  However, privacy between citizens requires privacy rights to be balanced against the freedom of speech, and in the United States, freedom of speech is king.<br />
 <br />
Some European courts have been willing to restrict freedom of speech when such speech impedes upon privacy.  In doing so, they have passed judgment on the relevance of certain information to the public.  In comparison, American courts have allowed private persons to make such decisions on an individual basis.  This approach is related to the popular notion of protecting the &quot;marketplace of ideas,&quot; a concept that stems from Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.&#39;s dissenting opinion in <u>Abrams v. United States</u>, in which he stated that &quot;the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market.&quot;  </p>

<p>Swiss law provides a clear example of the transatlantic gap between European and American concepts of privacy and free speech. The Swiss Federal Constitution provides that the ECHR supersedes Swiss federal law and that Swiss courts must therefore obey the ECHR&#39;s explicit right to a private life (Art. 8), as well as the right to freedom of expression (Art. 10). These rights are often balanced against each other, and the Swiss courts have attempted to determine the exact point where one right ends and the other begins. The Swiss case of <u>R. AG v. W.</u> provides a good example. In <u>R. AG v. W</u>., an executive convicted of white-collar crimes filed an action for invasion of privacy against a publisher who had reported truthful facts about the executive&#39;s past conviction. The court found for the plaintiff and held that such information was irrelevant and no longer of public interest.</p>

<p>The American case of <u>Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn</u> exemplifies a different approach. In <u>Cox</u>, a news company published the name of a deceased rape victim in the course of covering the alleged rapist&#39;s trial. Publication of the victim&#39;s name was in contravention of Georgia law, and the victim&#39;s father brought suit for invasion of privacy. The United States Supreme Court ultimately held that the Georgia statute violated the First Amendment and that the defendant news company was not liable. Rather than evaluating the published information&#39;s relevance, the court established a precedent of presuming the relevance of all such information, provided that it was a matter of public record.</p>

<p>Until recently, these conflicting approaches have not posed problems for international harmony.  Naturally, this has changed with the emergence of the internet. Strong privacy laws, such as those existing in Europe, are in danger of being compromised by international entities like Wikipedia and Google. These companies have the ability to disperse information around the world from an American jurisdiction that places a strong emphasis on the &quot;marketplace of ideas.&quot; The dispute between Wikipedia and the two German ex-convicts is perhaps indicative of future clashes in this area of the law.</p>

<p>Google has addressed these differing concepts of privacy and free speech through self-regulatory measures that block users in a particular country from accessing websites that are illegal under local law. For example, because Holocaust denial is illegal in Germany, Google&#39;s search engine for Germany, <a href="http://www.google.de">Google.de</a>, will not locate Holocaust-denial sites. However, Google&#39;s attempts to comply with local law are not always successful. Recently, three Google executives were criminally convicted in an Italian court for hosting a video that showed an autistic teenager being bullied. The Italian court convicted the executives despite the fact that Google attempted to comply with Italian law by removing the video within two hours of being notified of its existence.  <br />
 <br />
Self-enforcement measures have not yet been applied to situations in which truthful, yet arguably irrelevant, online information constitutes an invasion of privacy. Even if self-enforcement were used in this way, it would be unrealistic to expect a small group of people to effectively balance privacy and free speech concerns for the entire world.  For the sake of international harmony, we can hope that companies like Google and Wikipedia are able to devise policies that maintain respect for various international interests. Unfortunately, conflicting legal traditions and values are sure to present obstacles for any entity that attempts to accommodate these differing notions of privacy and free speech.</p>

		<title>TANZANIA: Meeting the ICTR Chief Prosecutor</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brittany Conkle, Pitt Law '10, recently visited the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha, Tanzania, as part of a program sponsored by the University of Pittsburgh School of Law and the <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/cile">Center for International Legal Education</a>. She shares her perspective...<br />
<hr height="1"><br />
<font size="3"><b>I</b></font> would be deliberately nonchalant if I neglected to say how excited I was to meet with Chief Prosecutor Hassan B. Jallow on our class trip to the <a href="http://www.unictr.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR). Although other activities were planned, I knew from the minute the meeting was announced that it would be one of the highlights of my trip. It isn't every day that a person has the opportunity to meet an internationally respected prosecutor and jurist and to soak up their knowledge and experience. For a law student fascinated by international law and, specifically, the evolving state of international criminal law, this was big.</p>

<p>While I would normally classify my luck as uneven to bad, my fortune changed when the University of Pittsburgh hired <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/faculty/profiles/%5Bfield_fprofile_path-raw%5D-11">Professor Charles C. Jalloh</a> before the start of my third year. Professor Jalloh has worked as counsel in the Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Section of the Canadian Department of Justice and as the Legal Advisor to the Office of the Principal Defender at the Special Court for Sierra Leone. In addition, he has clerked for two judges at the ICTR and has written insightful scholarly articles on many topics. Given his impressive accomplishments, when I saw that Professor Jalloh was teaching an International Criminal Law Seminar in my last semester as a law student, I couldn't sign up fast enough. At that time, I was unaware that there would be a special component to the class:  an optional trip to the ICTR in Arusha, Tanzania, over spring break. This was not just a sightseeing trip with a few hours spent at the ICTR. Rather, it was planned down to the minute and included lectures and presentations from every department of the Tribunal, in addition to informal opportunities to meet other young lawyers and ask questions about their experiences as interns at the Tribunal.</p>

<p>Our meeting with the Chief Prosecutor was scheduled for our first day in Arusha. We could tell that he was coming before he even made it down the hall to our conference room. There was a flurry of activity outside the door, a woman instructed us to stand when he entered, and the sound of swishing robes filled the room. Then, suddenly, there he was, a tall man with traditional Gambian robes and an inviting smile. While I'm fairly certain that all of us were nervous to be meeting with him, we were put at ease when we noticed that the Chief Prosecutor didn't seem to take himself, or the trappings of his office, too seriously.</p>

<p>I knew that we had only twenty minutes to meet with the Prosecutor, as he was only scheduled to briefly introduce us to the prosecution's perspective on the ICTR before leaving to attend to other business. Professor Jalloh had stressed to us that the Chief Prosecutor is exceptionally busy and that we were lucky to get any time with him. After all, this is a man who must make extremely difficult prosecutorial decisions regarding genocide and other crimes against humanity on a daily basis. Knowing all of this, I assumed that the Prosecutor would breeze in, briefly welcome us to Arusha and the Tribunal, and then go about his busy day.</p>

<p>However, Chief Prosecutor Jallow started the meeting by asking us to introduce ourselves. We went around the room, stated our names and, as prompted by the Prosecutor, named our specific interests in law. I was the first to introduce myself, and thought I could get by with just my name. "And would you like to work in international criminal law when you finish your schooling?" he asked.  I blurted out the first thing that came to mind:  "I'd actually like to work here."  Inwardly, I cringed, but the Prosecutor just smiled and chuckled in a way unique to those who hire others for very desirable positions.</p>

<p>The Prosecutor's opening remarks centered on the ICTR and prosecution's accomplishments to date, in addition to the ICTR's goals for the future. The Prosecutor outlined the prosecution's present focus: to finish the cases remaining on the ICTR's docket, to continue tracking the eleven remaining fugitives from justice and encourage state cooperation in arresting them, to continue working with the Rwandan judiciary in preparation for the transfer of cases to Rwanda, and to preserve evidence in cases against those who have not yet been arrested. In the interest of preserving evidence for future cases, the Prosecutor can now call witnesses prior to trial in order to record their testimony in case of the witnesses' death or unavailability when the fugitive is finally apprehended. Of course, the witness is cross-examined by a lawyer from the defense, as well.</p>

<p>After his remarks, the Prosecutor opened the floor to questions from our group. He answered questions on the disclosure problems existing within the ICTR, as witnesses regularly provide information relevant to many separate cases that must be discovered and disclosed. He also spoke of the problems that the ICTR has faced in relocating witnesses and the difficulty of getting countries to accept them. Finally, he talked about the improvement of Rwanda's judicial system and his hope that the Tribunal judges will allow cases to be transferred to Rwanda.</p>

<p>I could tell from the rapt expressions around the room that the other visitors were also enjoying this rare opportunity to hear from someone who makes such difficult decisions. But what made the meeting truly exciting was that the Prosecutor really seemed to enjoy himself. He encouraged our questions, gave thoughtful and seemingly candid answers, and appeared thoroughly interested in what eleven law students from the University of Pittsburgh had to say. As a result, twenty minutes turned into forty-five. It was only after he finally left the room and we all exhaled that we realized our good fortune. It is a rare opportunity to spend time with a man who is changing and advancing international criminal law every day in his capacity as Chief Prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>TANZANIA: Transferring Cases from the ICTR to Rwanda Courts</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ingrid Burke, Pitt Law '11, traveled to the ICTR in Tanzania with Professor Charles Jalloh through Pitt Law's <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/cile">Center for International Legal Education</a>...<br />
<hr height="1"><br />
<font size="3"><b>A</b></font>s part of a group of Pitt Law students, I recently had the opportunity to spend three days observing the inner workings of the <a href="http://www.ictr.org">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) in Arusha, Tanzania. During my visit, I met numerous ICTR representatives, including members of the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP), the Registry, and various defense teams and judicial chambers. However, I was most excited by the opportunity to meet with Prosecutor Hassan Bubacar Jallow and defense counsel representatives because of my curiosity about the status of the cases remaining to be decided by the ICTR. </p>

<p>The ICTR was created in 1994 by the United Nations Security Council to prosecute violations of international law committed during the Rwandan genocide. To date, the ICTR Trial Chambers have completed the trials of 50 accused individuals and are in various stages of completing an additional 16 trials. At present, 11 fugitives remain at large. The ICTR Appeals Chamber in the Hague has completed the trials of 31 accused individuals and expects to complete another 19 trials by the end of 2013. While the Appeals Chamber has another two and a half years to reduce its caseload, the ICTR's trial chamber has only until the end of 2011, in accordance with the Tribunal's most recent <a href="http://liveunictr.altmansolutions.com/Portals/0/English%5CFactSheets%5CCompletion_St%5CS-2010-259e.pdf">Report on the completion strategy of the ICTR</a> (closure report). This leaves open an important question: are Rwandan courts suitable for the transfer of lower to mid-level, at-large indictees?</p>

<p><img alt="Rwanda (1).jpg" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Rwanda%20%281%29.jpg" title ="Rwandans dancing" width="247" height="165" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" />Even before visiting the ICTR, I had formed an opinion on this question. While Rwanda's ability to fairly try and punish genocide defendants has been debated in recent years, I believed that it would be most beneficial for the Tribunal to transfer its remaining lower to mid-level cases to Rwanda's national jurisdiction upon closure. While Prosecutor Jallow reaffirmed this belief, it was challenged by representatives of the defense counsel.</p>

<p>Procedurally, the ICTR has primary jurisdiction over individuals charged with genocide, war crimes, and<br />
crimes against humanity. While Rwandan courts may exercise jurisdiction over genocide suspects by indicting and prosecuting them, the ICTR retains the right to request the transfer of such individuals to its chambers for prosecution. This broad jurisdictional grant was deemed necessary for the sake of uniformity and the Tribunal's ultimate effectiveness. However, the ICTR now has an interest in transferring cases of lower to mid-level indictees to the Rwandan national courts due to its impending closure. Key ICTR officials have manifested this interest in both express and implied actions. For instance, Prosecutor Jallow sought to refer five cases to Rwandan national courts, but in each case, the Prosecutor's transfer request was denied on the basis of fair trial concerns. The ICTR has also implied a desire to transfer appropriate cases to Rwandan national courts pending reform of the country's judicial system. The Prosecutor and the Tribunal's president have given speeches on the topic, and the ICTR has published <a href="http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/speeches/jallow070606.htm">press releases</a> concerning its efforts to rebuild the Rwandan judicial system.</p>

<p><img alt="Rwanda (2).jpg" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Rwanda%20%282%29.jpg" width="247" height="165" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" / title="Graves">The ICTR's interest in transferring cases to Rwandan courts can also be traced to evolving language in the ICTR's <a href="http://www.unictr.org/Legal/RulesofProcedureandEvidence/tabid/95/Default.aspx">Rules of Procedure and Evidence</a> (RPE). The RPE were amended to include Rule 11 <em>bis</em>, which gives the Tribunal discretion to transfer cases to appropriate national jurisdictions. Rule 11 <em>bis</em> serves the dual purpose of granting the Tribunal jurisdiction over the most notorious indictees while allowing it to reduce its caseload by transferring indictees charged with less serious crimes to other jurisdictions. In the rule's original form, there were only a few jurisdictions designated as appropriate for the transfer of ICTR cases. In its amended form, Rule 11 <em>bis</em> establishes three options for transferring cases at the ICTR President's discretion. The ICTR may transfer the case to the state where the crime was committed, the state where the defendant was arrested, or a state that has jurisdiction and is willing and able to hear the case. The language of Rule 11 <em>bis</em> has changed several times since being added to the RPE, and each evolution seems to be intended to ease the transfer of cases to Rwanda. </p>

<p>As mentioned above, the Prosecutor has unsuccessfully attempted to transfer cases to Rwanda's national courts on five separate occasions. These cases were rejected for several reasons, including concerns over the appropriateness and applicability of punishments for genocide, the adequacy of protection for defense witnesses, witnesses' ability to enter Rwanda to testify, and ethnic biases that could affect the trials' impartiality. Nevertheless, when I asked Prosecutor Jallow about future attempts to transfer cases to Rwanda under Rule 11 <em>bis</em>, he seemed confident that the cases would be accepted. At the time, he had planned to file another Rule 11 <em>bis</em> case early this summer. However, according to the most recent closure report, he now expects to hold off on filing a new Rule 11 <em>bis</em> request for the transfer of cases to Rwanda until the end of 2010:<br />
<blockquote>Consultations are ongoing with Rwanda with a view to resolving a number of issues related to witness protection and other matters raised by the Trial Chambers and the Appeals Chamber in their decisions on prior requests for referrals under Rule 11 <em>bis</em>. The Prosecutor intends to file further applications for referral of fugitives' cases to Rwanda. It is expected that the applications will be made towards the last quarter of 2010.</blockquote> Some of the concerns surrounding the original transfer requests have been alleviated, as the Tribunal recently trained Rwandan legal professionals and established a witness protection program with video link capabilities. However, the recent arrest of American defense counsel and JURIST Forum contributor <a href="http://www.wmitchell.edu/academics/faculty/erlinder.asp">Peter Erlinder</a> may have thrown the Prosecutor's plans into disarray. </p>

<p><img alt="Rwanda (3).jpg" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Rwanda%20%283%29.jpg" title="Graves" width="247" height="165" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" />The Tribunal's various defense teams were less assured about Rwanda's capacity to fairly adjudicate cases. They expressed concern about the fairness of trials, citing a well-documented trend of difficulties faced by defense counsel in locating and obtaining evidence. Rwanda also has a history of witness intimidation and harassment, which poses a serious threat to defense teams and their ability to fairly advocate for their clients. </p>

<p>The ICTR is currently divided on the issue of case transfers. On the one hand, Rule 11 <em>bis</em> seems to be constructed with the intention of ultimately transferring cases to Rwanda. On the other hand, the language of Rule 11 <em>bis</em> is contradicted by case law, i.e., the five previous refusals of Rule 11 <em>bis</em> cases.</p>

<p><img alt="Rwanda (4).jpg" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Rwanda%20%284%29.jpg" title="Graves" width="247" height="165" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" />In light of Rwanda's progress, concern expressed by defense counsel, while well-founded, is likely outdated. In reality, the ICTR has done a great deal to address the problems that led to fair trial concerns in the five previous Rule 11 <em>bis</em> cases. Accordingly, it is my opinion that transfer of the Tribunal's lower to mid-level cases to Rwanda is in the best interest of both Rwanda and the international community. As a consequence of the genocide, Rwanda's government was dismantled, and afterward, the judiciary was forced to rebuild. Since the end of violence, the Tribunal has played an active role in rebuilding Rwanda's institutions by providing funding, training, and promises of future monitoring. If Rwanda accepts the transfer cases, its judicial infrastructure will become more stable and experienced. In turn, judicial stability will promote reconciliation and peace, because the judiciary has proven itself as the sole governmental body capable of treating the issues that have plagued the country's recent past.  Rwandan courts will also have easier access to evidence and witnesses than the ICTR. Currently, there are costs associated with transporting witnesses and evidence from Rwanda to Tanzania. In addition to wasting money and prolonging the judicial process, these costs could be burdensome for other jurisdictions if Rwanda declines to accept the transfer cases. Finally, there are public policy grounds for supporting the transfers of suitable cases to Rwanda. The international community's recognition of Rwanda's judicial and political stability will promote foreign investment and trade, thereby facilitating economic growth and, ultimately, domestic business and entrepreneurship.</p>

<p><img alt="Rwanda (5).jpg" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Rwanda%20%285%29.jpg" title="Mass grave" width="247" height="165" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" />The international community will benefit from the transfer of cases to Rwanda, as well. A successful closure to the ICTR would constitute a welcome return on the international community's investment, since the ICTR has been funded by foreign governments since its inception. Furthermore, it would lend legitimacy to international criminal tribunals. Prior to 1994, tribunals like the ICTR and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) did not exist. The United Nations Security Council based these tribunals' creation on its <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter7.shtml">Chapter VII</a> power to take non-military action to restore international peace and security. This was a tenuous basis for authority, and there was a significant risk that the tribunals' legitimacy would be challenged. However, the tribunals have had many successes, and their legacies have important implications for the future of international criminal law. The satisfaction of the Security Council's original goals of national reconciliation and restored peace in Rwanda would set an important precedent for the effective adjudication of future international atrocities.</p>

<p>While it is impossible to predict the outcome of the Prosecutor's Rule 11 <em>bis</em> case, I side with Prosecutor Jallow in hoping that it will be successfully transferred to Rwanda. This is in the best interest of both the Rwandan judiciary's stability and the benefit of international criminal law in the future. </p>

		<title>PITTSBURGH: Terrorism and the Law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kristine Long, Jurist Student Staff Association (JSSA) President, Pitt Law '11, attended the First Annual JSSA Debate...<br />
<hr height="1"><br />
<font size="3"><b>T</b></font>he first debate hosted by the JURIST Student Staff Association concerned the heated topics of terrorism and national security. These topics have became increasingly relevant to Americans in the wake of 9/11, as the United States responded to the threat of terrorism by changing airline security procedures, drafting and passing the Patriot Act, and launching Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. In the nearly 10 years since 9/11, the War on Terror has impacted every American, and, as such, the debate was both timely and important. </p>

<p>The two participants, <a href="http://www.stmarytx.edu/ctl/index.php?site=centerForTerrorismLawDirectors">Jeffrey Addicott</a>, Director of the <a href="http://www.stmarytx.edu/ctl/index.php">Center for Terrorism Law</a> at St. Mary's University of Law and <a href="http://www.aclu.org/leader/susan-n-herman">Susan Herman</a>, President of the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), have written prolifically on national security and terrorism issues. Both have been featured writers on JURIST's Forum service, and it was incredibly fortunate to have both speak about the relevant legal changes in terrorism law. At the beginning of the debate, I incorrectly assumed that the speakers would hold opposing views based on their respective organizations. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Addicott and Herman had common concerns and beliefs about terrorism and national security.</p>

<p><embed src="http://www.law.pitt.edu/sites/all/plugins/mediaplayer/player.swf" width="420" height="300" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="image=%2F&file=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.law.pitt.edu%2Fvideo%2Fjurist.mp4&provider=http&autostart=false" /></p>

<p>Professor Addicott launched the debate with a single question: "Are we at war?" If so, he argued, the United States under both Presidents Bush and Obama has acted in accordance with the laws of war with respect to its treatment of enemy combatants at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Addicott said that if the United States is not at war, then the government's actions are illegal and in violation of both domestic and international law. He argued that the United States is indeed at war and said that it is within the President's power to make war under <a href="http://www.house.gov/house/Constitution/Constitution.html">Article I of the Constitution</a>. He further cited a September 20, 2001 <a href="http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/09/20/gen.bush.transcript/">address to Congress</a> in which President Bush made clear that the 9/11 attacks were an act of war and that the US government would respond with a War on Terror against Al Qaeda.  In addition, he said, both Congress and the Supreme Court have acknowledged a state of war with the creation and affirmation of decisions rendered by Military Tribunals, which are permitted only during times of war. </p>

<p>But even if the question of whether the United States is at war is binary, the process by which the United States finds and tries enemy combatants is not as simple.</p>

<p>This murky and vague process is exactly what concerns Professor Herman. While she does not necessarily question whether the US is at war, she is troubled by the scope with which the US applies its traditional war powers to a non-traditional enemy. In the past, she said, war and enemies were readily discernible - enemies wore distinct uniforms and countries formally declared war on one another. However, terrorism and terrorists do not fit this traditional paradigm. The concern posed by Professor Herman, in response to Professor Addicott's question, is: "What are the limits to the United States' war powers? She said that under the guise of its state of war in Afghanistan, the United States can detain American and foreign citizens, both domestically and internationally.  She said that by labeling citizens "enemy combatants," the United States can question and detain them for years with limited rights. Yet, Professor Herman wonders, if the international legal community cannot cohesively define a terrorist act, how can it begin to define the term "enemy combatant"? She did not disagree with Professor Addicott's state-of-war analysis, but she was adamant that the US needed to establish a transparent process by which citizens or enemy combatants can receive a fair trial and due process.</p>

<p>Despite some diverging opinions, both Addicott and Herman agreed that there are differences between criminal and terrorist acts and that the legal community has yet to clearly distinguish between the two extremes. Both participants cited anecdotal evidence that is troubling to either side: a college student was detained and questioned in an airport for merely having Arabic flashcards whereas detainees found innocent and released went on to commit terrorist acts. </p>

<p>Currently, governments are at odds as to how to combat the War on Terror with traditional legal principles, and the US Supreme Court continues to wrestle with the issue of what constitutes fair process. In the cases <u>Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</u> and <u>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</u>, the Court failed to form a majority opinion as to the proper legal position courts should take with respect to enemy combatants. The cases did hold, however, that US citizens have the right to challenge their detention on the basis of due process. In contrast, under the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/genevaconventions">Geneva Conventions</a>, the government has the right to indefinitely detain non-citizens until the end of the war. </p>

<p>The speakers' questions illuminated the difficult task governments and legislatures have in creating terrorism policy. While the participants did not take completely opposite positions, there does appear to be tension between robust national security and individual civil liberties. In my opinion, the two principles must be balanced, but such a balancing act has eluded this government for generations. As Alexander Hamilton stated in Federalist No. 8, "safety from external danger is the most powerful director of national conduct. Even the ardent love of liberty will, after a time, give way to its dictates." In maintaining that balance, our government must be aware of the consequences of moving too far in either direction. </p>

<p>The questions posed by legal scholars and governments are integral to how the general public perceives the war on terror. Thus, informed public debates such as this one are vitally important to maintaining America's legal tradition of a marketplace of ideas. The dissemination of information is a positive step toward properly addressing the murky issues of terrorism and national security.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Richard Aborn</strong> [President, <a href="http://www.nycrimecommission.org/">Citizens Crime Commission</a>]: "What is most important to the gun control movement is the ability to pass reasonable laws designed to break up the illegal gun markets. While I disagree with <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-rules-second-amendment-applies-to-states.php">this</a> decision, as I do with <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-dc-gun-ban.php">District of Columbia v. Heller</a>, these rulings do not deter us from pursuing laws that would close the gun show loophole and address licensing and registration.  These laws are all vital to public safety and do not violate either the Supreme Court decisions or the rights of legitimate gun owners. </p>

                <p>Presented with two opportunities to do so, the Court declined to indicate that reasonable regulations of guns - and in particular handguns - would violate the individual right to bear arms that the Court has now established . This is critical to our ability to continue to pass laws that will make everyone safer.</p>

                <p>These decisions will, however, cause an endless stream of challenges to gun control laws. Resisting these challenges will absorb large amounts of vital resources that could be much better spent elsewhere. This is unfortunate.  We remain resolute in our determination to reduce gun violence in its many forms.  These two decisions do not diminish that resolve.  We are undeterred."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Andrew Vogeler, Pitt Law '12 and Nordenberg Fellow at the <a href="http://www.mpipriv.de/ww/en/pub/news.cfm">Max Planck Institute for Comparative Private and International Private Law</a> in Hamburg, Germany, writes about attempts to harmonize contract law in the European Union...<br />
<hr height="1"><br />
<font size="3"><b>L</b></font>ately, there has been much debate over the proper direction of the <a href="http://europa.eu/">European Union</a> in response to the ongoing fiscal and monetary crises.  These debates have well demonstrated the difficulty of bringing together a number of economies, and the particular problem of establishing the political arrangements necessary to do so successfully.</p>

<p><img alt="Max Planck Institute" title="Max Planck Institute" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Hamburg.jpg" width="352" height="264" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" />As a <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/academics/cile/jdprogram/competitions/nord">Nordenberg Fellow</a> at the Max Planck Institute for Comparative and International Private Law in Hamburg, I have had the chance to study a similarly challenging project that intends to simplify and harmonize the legal systems in Europe in areas key to the development of the Internal Market of the European Union.</p>

<p>My research has focused on the process of developing a <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/cons_int/safe_shop/fair_bus_pract/cont_law/common_frame_ref_en.htm">Common Frame of Reference</a>, or CFR, for contract law in the European Union.  This has, of course, been very useful for getting the "lay of the land" of contract law in Europe, particularly the relationship between the European Community and national law.  But it has also provided a powerful example of the dynamics of legal change through comparative study, a model that characterizes the development of international law in the modern world.</p>

<p>My time at the Max Planck Institute has not only provided access to an unmatched collection of scholarship on the topic of contract law harmonization, but has also afforded rare opportunities to interact with leading scholars in European private law, including two of the institutes' directors, Professor <a href="http://www.mpipriv.de/ww/en/pub/staff/basedow_juergen.cfm">Jürgen Basedow</a> and Professor <a href="http://www.mpipriv.de/ww/en/pub/staff/zimmermann_reinhard.cfm">Reinhard Zimmerman</a>.  They, and others at the institute, have enriched my understanding of issues facing harmonization of European private law by sharing their experience and knowledge on this topic and offering insight into the dynamic and changing legal culture that accompanies harmonization. </p>

<p>To give a sense of the CFR process, I offer some of my findings and reflections on a topic that, though not widely known in the United States, could have a great impact on international transactions in the future.</p>

<p>The perceived need for contract law harmonization, which has justified the effort to develop a CFR, is essentially twofold.  First, the diversity of national laws among the twenty-seven Member States is said to pose an undue obstacle to the Internal Market.  It is argued that businesses and consumers are deterred from contracting across borders due to uncertainty in dealing with foreign law and increased transaction costs for hiring foreign law specialists.  </p>

<p>Second, where the European Community (Community) has already acted with respect to contracts, mainly in the area of consumer protection, it has taken a fragmentary approach, addressing particular needs as they are perceived.  Furthermore, it has mainly acted in the form of Directives, which are not law themselves, but merely set out legal objectives which the Member States are then bound to satisfy through national legislation.  </p>

<p>The result is a labyrinth of national legislation accompanied by a patchwork of Community law, which is applied and interpreted differently in the various Member States. In response to this fragmentation, the European Commission (Commission) issued a Communication in 2001 (<a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&lg=en&type_doc=COMfinal&an_doc=2001&nu_doc=398">2001 Communication</a>) calling for the development of a strategy to consolidate and clarify contract law. This 2001 Communication offered four basic choices for Community action, moving forward.</p>

<p>First, the Commission could do nothing and simply allow legal market forces to correct inefficiencies.  Second, it could develop common principles of contract law so that member states would have a coherent body of European standards to serve as a model for national-level reform and encourage convergence. Third, it could improve existing legislation by clarifying terminology and consolidating Directives in the interest of coherency. Finally, it could adopt comprehensive legislation or a new instrument at the Community level.  </p>

<p>The 2001 Communication thus figured in an ongoing debate about the proper direction any harmonization efforts should take.  On the one hand, an eventual European Civil Code was advocated on the basis that the obstacles caused by national law divergence could only be fully eliminated through codification.</p>

<p>On the other hand, skeptics of codification argued that removing all legal diversity would also remove legal competition and would thus remove an important source of innovation for addressing new legal problems in the Community.  Furthermore, skeptics noted that since Member states would be reluctant to quickly desert their own contract laws, codification would take place gradually and be subject to implementation and interpretation on the national level. Thus, legal uncertainty could actually be exacerbated, and the problem of divergence would simply take a new form rather than being eliminated.</p>

<p>The responses to the 2001 Communication came from a wide range of businesses, consumer groups, and interest groups and enabled the Commission to reach a couple of general conclusions for moving forward.  First, the problems with the extant contract law were real enough that inaction was not a favorable option. Second, the idea of consolidating and clarifying existing Community law was widely embraced. And third, diversity of law could pose an obstacle, but not to the extent that uniformity would be necessary. Thus, the Commission determined that finding common principles and developing a common terminology might be a useful idea, but that something like codification would not be widely embraced.</p>

<p>In response to these reactions, the European Commission released an <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2003:0068:FIN:EN:PDF">Action Plan</a> [PDF] in 2003 that called for improving the <i>acquis</i>, or the body of European contract law, by developing a Common Frame of Reference, or CFR. The CFR is to be a political project through which common principles of European contract law and common terminology will enable a clearer understanding and interpretation of legal concepts by legislators, courts or practitioners throughout Europe.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Action Plan called for reflection on the development of a possible "optional instrument," which would allow parties to subject their agreements to a Community instrument of contract rules, but would also leave national rules intact.  </p>

<p>In a <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2004:0651:FIN:EN:PDF">2004 Communication</a> [PDF], the Commission further articulated goals for the CFR: that it would offer clear definitions of legal concepts, articulate fundamental principles of contract law, and develop a coherent set of model rules, based upon the <i>acquis</i> and perceived best practice solutions from the various national laws.</p>

<p>Additionally, the European Commission and Parliament offered possible applications for the CFR.  Beyond improving the <i>acquis</i>,  it could be used as a "legislator's toolbox," both for adopting EU Directives in a consistent way and in national contract law reforms.  It could also provide the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo2_7024/">European Court of Justic</a>e with a persuasive source in disputes concerning Community law.  In this sense, it would serve a function quite similar to the <a href="http://www.ali.org/">American Law Institute's</a> Restatements or the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/ucc.table.html">Uniform Commercial Code</a>, and could also draw upon prior projects, such as the <i><a href="http://frontpage.cbs.dk/law/commission_on_european_contract_law/PECL%20engelsk/engelsk_partI_og_II.htm">Principles of European Contract Law</a></i>, published by the so-called "Lando Commission" between 1995 and 2003.</p>

<p>Further, the CFR could serve as the basis for an optional instrument available in arbitration cases because it would allow parties to choose a neutral set of rules to govern their contracts, much like the <a href="http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/sale_goods/1980CISG.html">United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of International Goods</a> (CISG) in sales contracts or the <a href="http://www.unidroit.org/">International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT)</a> principles.  </p>

<p>In 2005, the Commission charged the <a href="http://www.copecl.org/">Joint Network on European Private Law</a> (Joint Network) to develop a draft CFR, or the DCFR. The Joint Network includes a number of groups, including the successor to the Lando Commission, the "<a href="http://www.acquis-group.org/"><i>Acquis</i> Group</a>," to draft "Principles of European Law."  Additionally, various groups were charged with researching issues ranging from the cultural bases of national laws to the economic impacts of various proposals.  A couple of groups, such as the Project Group Restatement of European Insurance Contract Law, which had already been working on developing principles of insurance law, were brought in to support the DCFR's work in particularly important areas.  </p>

<p>The Joint Network published an outline edition of the DCFR in 2007 and released a full, multi-volume edition with commentary in <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/civil/docs/dcfr_outline_edition_en.pdf">2009</a> [Outline edition, PDF].  However, while the DCFR represents great progress in the process of harmonization, it has ignited or re-ignited debates in a number of areas. A foundational concern is the competence of the EU to pursue a CFR.  It is undisputed that the European Union does not have a general power to act in contract law, which leaves the question of whether its limited ability to affect contract law through areas like consumer protection and the advancement of the Internal Market is sufficient.  </p>

<p>There is also concern about the proper scope of the DCFR and future CFR, and how they should be applied. Where is the line between contract law and other areas of private law?  Does the DCFR look too much like the beginning of a general law of obligations?  Would the proposed optional instrument be "opt-in" or "opt-out?" Would such an instrument supplant national mandatory rules if chosen? If so, would it provide adequate protection of weaker parties? What would its relation be to existing international agreements, such as the CISG? Finally, there could be endless debates about the substantive details of the principles, definitions, and model rules contained in the DCFR.</p>

<p>Questions have also been raised about the manner of developing a CFR on the basis of the DCFR.  On the one hand, though academic committees are perhaps best able to develop a comprehensive and coherent set of principles, they are often criticized as being elitist and unaccountable to democratic processes. On the other hand, the compromises necessary to any parliamentary process could threaten the coherency of the principles and undermine their effectiveness.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, if a CFR is created in according to the Commission's goals, it would provide a number of benefits beyond simplifying transactions within the Internal Market. It would provide a useful guide to non-European lawyers in transactions involving European parties.  It would provide a potential model for contract law reform in other parts of the world, particularly because it would represent the mixture of diverse legal systems. Finally, it could offer valuable lessons in future international contract law harmonization projects.</p>

<p>To that end, the DCFR represents an important step along the path to harmonization if for no other reason than that it provides a substantive basis upon which the debate can continue.  Where prior debates have depended entirely upon speculation as to what kind of harmonization might be possible, let alone its effects or desirability, the DCFR provides a much more substantial basis upon which qualitative and quantitative research and debates can be conducted.  </p>

<p>However it might be evaluated directly, therefore, it represents an undeniable step forward for the process of contract law harmonization in Europe and should certainly encourage future progress.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.syr.edu/faculty/facultymember.aspx?fac=202">Keith Bybee</a> of Syracuse University says that regardless of other issues that may arise, the confirmation hearings of Elena Kagan, like those of other recent Supreme Court nominees, will be dominated by the tension between images of judicial impartiality and political ideology... <br /><hr size="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/KeithBybee125x150.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table> <font size="3"><b>A</b></font>s soon as President Obama nominated Elena Kagan for the seat on the United States Supreme Court held by the retiring Justice John Paul Stevens, questions about the nominee began to pile up: Is Kagan a stealth liberal or a stealth conservative? Is her lack of judicial experience a plus or minus?  Is she gay or straight? Does that matter?</p>

<p>With the Senate confirmation hearings upon us, no one can say for sure how the details of public discussion will develop.  But just about anyone familiar with Supreme Court appointments already knows that the debate over Kagan will ultimately be dominated by two conflicting images.</p>

<p>Just as has been the case in the past, the first image central to the current confirmation will be that of the nominee claiming to embody conventional ideals of judicial decision making.</p>

<p>John Roberts invoked the ideal of judicial neutrality, telling us that he would be like an umpire, calling balls and strikes rather than rounding the bases and scoring runs.  "Judges and justices are servants of the law, not the other way around," Roberts said.  "Judges are like umpires.  Umpires don't make the rules; they apply them."</p>

<p>During his confirmation, Samuel Alito identified himself with the ideal of judicial fairness, pledging to avoid prejudgments and to listen carefully to the facts and arguments in each case.  Good judges, Alito said, are "always open to the possibility of changing their minds based on the next brief that they read or the next argument that's made by an attorney" in court.</p>

<p>For her part, Sonia Sotomayor draped herself in the mantle of judicial restraint, arguing that principles that drive judicial decisions come solely from the Constitution and statutes rather than from the judge's personal experiences.  "Many senators have asked me about my judicial philosophy," Sotomayor said.  "It is simple:  fidelity to the law."</p>

<p>There is also the second image in the confirmation process that will vie for attention with the image of the nominee embracing the conventional judicial ideals of neutrality, fairness, and restraint.</p>

<p>This second image will be of elected officials and interest groups working energetically to select a nominee who is deeply and unalterably committed to specific political views.  Partisans will, of course, frame their arguments in terms of the very ideals that the nominee endorses.  But it will be plain that behind the talk of umpires and legal fidelity, politicians and pressure groups are competing to install ideological fellow travelers on the bench.  So we can expect that we will hear senators and party activists reprise the roles they played during the Roberts, Alito, and Sotomayor hearings.  With one voice, political actors will decry the influence of politics on the high bench.  They will deny that they are applying any kind of ideological "litmus test" and will insist that they are simply supporting judicial nominees who will adhere to the law.  And, yet, even as they extol the very judicial virtues that the nominee claims to possess, it will be obvious that political actors actually want something quite different:  rather than impartiality and open-mindedness, they seek a person who will reliably advance issues of interest to important political constituencies.</p>

<p>What will happen when the Kagan confirmation is beset by these two competing images, when the nominee's pledges of impartiality are surrounded by partisan efforts to pick a justice who will decide cases in a preferred direction?</p>

<p>Here, too, it turns out that we already have a pretty clear idea of what will occur.</p>

<p>A number of pundits and commentators will lament the corrosive force of politics.  The aggressive campaign to select a politically minded justice will stoke suspicions that Kagan does not really mean it when she affirms her unwavering allegiance to conventional judicial ideals.   The second image of a process shot through with politics will begin to eat away at the first image of the nominee as an impartial arbiter.  As a result, claims of judicial neutrality, fairness, and restraint will begin to look like a mere means of smuggling political commitments onto the bench.</p>

<p>The worry that Kagan's confirmation is becoming a kind of a sham will not, however, stop the process from going forward.   After all, the idea that confirmation is an artificial and misleading performance is not news.  In 2005, Joe Biden claimed that the Supreme Court confirmation process had devolved into an empty "kabuki dance," and 10 years before that Kagan herself called confirmation a "vapid and hollow charade."</p>

<p>We tolerate the uneasy mix of principle, posturing, and political pressure in confirmations because we value a process that simultaneously permits us to demand impartiality and to advance our own narrow interests.  We want to have a fair system and at the same time we also want to make sure that our side wins.</p>

<p>We knew that long before the questions about Kagan were ever posed.</p>

		<title>Prosecute Defendants, Not Their Counsel</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.pepperdine.edu/academics/faculty/default.php?faculty=bruce_einhorn">Bruce J. Einhorn</a> of Pepperdine University School of Law says that provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 that would allow for special investigations of lawyers representing Guantanamo Bay detainees should be removed from the bill... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/beinhorn.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>F</b></font>or 11 years, I had the great privilege of serving my country as a prosecutor and supervisory attorney with the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice.  Specifically, I worked with the Office of Special Investigations ("OSI"), which was charged with the identification and prosecution of fugitive Nazi war criminals living illegally in the United States. My dedicated OSI colleagues and I were aggressive and relentless in bringing to justice former death camp guards, SS members, Gestapo informants, and non-German collaborators in the persecution and execution of prisoners of war and civilians. Yet, as dedicated as we were to bringing these individuals to justice, the defense counsel appointed to represent and ethically bound to zealously defend the accused often caused us frustration with their dilatory tactics and gross misrepresentations.  Still, my OSI colleagues and I never made the mistake of taking our eyes - or the courts' or the public's - off the defendants who had allegedly committed the horrendous acts of persecution that occasioned our investigations or prosecutions. </p>

<p>Nazi Germany has been flung in defeat into the ash heap of history.  Now we are engaged in a struggle with another, relentless evil - terrorism fueled by religious extremism and a homicidal hatred of the West.  In the course of that struggle, we have detained alleged terrorists and others at Guantanamo Bay who are being investigated and may be prosecuted for serious violations of U.S. and international law.  </p>

<p>In this struggle, however, our government is about to make the very mistake we at OSI avoided - the mistake of diverting its attention from the suspected terrorists and casting it onto the American defense counsel retained to represent them.  </p>

<p>Section 1037 of the House version of the <a href="http://armedservices.house.gov/pdfs/HR5136BillLanguage052110.pdf">National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011</a> (H.R. 5136) [PDF] would require the Inspector General to conduct a 90-day investigation of any attorneys - including civilian attorneys - who represent Guantanamo detainees for whom there is "reasonable suspicion" (a phrase the bill does not define) that they have engaged in any practice or conduct that has (1) interfered with the operations at Guantanamo, (2) violated any applicable Defense Department policy, (3) violated any law of the United States, or (4) generated any "material risk to any member of the Armed Forces."  This legislative provision attempts to subject the private practice of criminal law to military regulation and restraint.  Indeed, the provision attempts to make quasi-prisoners out of the attorneys in the course of their professional duties at Guantanamo.  </p>

<p>Not only does the bill impose martial law on the right to counsel, it does so unnecessarily.  Federal and state bar rules provide severe penalties, including disbarment, for lawyers who engage in unethical, deceptive, and fraudulent practices or demonstrate grave disrespect and contempt for judicial and court security officers and other government officials. Furthermore, federal and state laws also provide for heavy fines and imprisonment for any attorney who engages in the theft or misuse of classified information or military property or the providing of material support for terrorist activity.  </p>

<p>Section 1307 is nothing more than a means of deterring defense attorneys from representing detainees at Guantanamo, meant to chill the defense bar from dissenting from the treatment of the detainees, lest those lawyers themselves become the target of military scrutiny.  The bill undermines the promise of the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of Boumediene v. Bush: that Guantanamo detainees and their advocates will have meaningful access to courts of justice to review their confinement.</p>

<p>Our Constitutional system of justice recognizes that defense counsel in criminal cases should never be subject to government diktat on how they should advise their clients or conduct themselves as zealous advocates in opposition to the state's role as prosecutor.  That is why the American Bar Association, the American College of Trial Lawyers, and dozens of former judges and prosecutors, including officials from the Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush Administrations, organized by the non-partisan Constitution Project have all publicly opposed Section 1307 of H.R. 5136.  They understand, as I do, and as the Supreme Court in the case of Berger v. United States did, that while the prosecuting authorities, whether military or civilian, "may strike hard blows" they are "not at liberty to strike foul ones."  Section 1307 is foul play, and should be removed from the Defense Authorization Act. The Senate should not allow for an equivalent of Section 1307 to be included in its version of the National Defense Authorization Act, which the Senate will consider shortly and it certainly should not be included in the conference bill.  </p>

<p>During my time prosecuting Nazi war criminals, the OSI never put the defendants' attorneys on trial - figuratively or literally.  We at OSI and the Justice Department understood that the zealous representation of even individuals accused of the most heinous crimes made our legal system the fairest in the world, and ensured that judgments finally obtained against Nazi criminals would withstand attack both on appeal and in the court of public opinion.  </p>

<p>Supporters of Section 1307 would be well-advised to learn this lesson.  The accused terrorists should be the targets of their investigations and prosecutions, not the lawyers. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.kentlaw.edu/faculty/wbirdthistle/">William A. Birdthistle</a> of the Chicago-Kent School of Law says that the Supreme Court's modest decision in <u>Jones v. Harris Associates</u> continues the Court's trend of neglecting to take strong positions on important issues in corporate law... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/wbirdthistle_web.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>W</b></font>ith the announcement of several important business decisions at the close of its latest Term, the Supreme Court of the United States appears to have made clear that the leading arbiter of corporate law in this country remains the Supreme Court of Delaware.  This year's docket at the nation's highest court promised the possibility of great federal ascendancy in this field: the Court had granted <em>certiorari</em> in a remarkably high number of business cases, this Term was the first occasion on which the judiciary could address the financial crisis of 2008 that has so occupied the executive and legislative branches, and such juridical interpretations might have influenced impending and compendious new financial legislation.  Instead, the Court abdicated its corporate authority by repeatedly minimizing the judicial role in such cases, most prominently in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-861.ZS.html">Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-1191.ZS.html">Morrison v. National Australia Bank</a>.  Another exemplar of the Court's anticlimactic tendency in business disputes is <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-586.ZS.html">Jones v. Harris</a>.</p>

<p>In Jones, the Court handed down a remarkably short, unanimous, and inscrutable opinion in a case critical to the way 90 million Americans save more than $10 trillion for retirement.  Each year - even in the bad ones - investors pay approximately $100 billion to investment advisers for managing these investments in mutual funds.  Notably, though, individual investors in these funds pay, on average, double the price that institutional clients pay for similar investments.  In the wake of the nation's greatest financial crisis in seventy-five years, the Court found itself with an ideal opportunity to decide what an investor must prove in order to show that an adviser has charged excessive fees in violation of its fiduciary duty under Section 36(b) of the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/about/laws/ica40.pdf">Investment Company Act of 1940</a> [PDF].</p>

<p>But depending on whose reporting you believe, the Court's ruling either made it impossible for investors to prove such a claim (Reuters), made it woefully easy for investors to bring such a claim (Forbes), or failed to decide the matter at all (New York Times).  On an issue with such enormous potential impact upon the future fiscal health of this nation and its growing population of retirees, clarity on this question would have greatly helped the planning and policing of retirement savings.  </p>

<p>Observers who believe the ruling was a victory for the industry point to the Court's endorsement of the <u>Gartenberg</u> decision, a standard that no plaintiff has ever satisfied in more than twenty-five years of trials.  Those who argue that the plaintiffs won point out that the Court liberalized the <u>Gartenberg</u> standard with a new emphasis on disparate institutional and retail fees.  And those who believe the ruling was essentially an abdication of the judicial role maintain that the Court punted on the central issue of competition within the mutual fund industry. </p>

<p>Perhaps the lone source of agreement was in deciding who lost: Chief Judge Easterbrook and the Seventh Circuit's imaginative economic reinterpretation of Section 36(b) was rejected 9-0 by the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Because the Court's ruling was so modest, one must use careful metrics to determine whether either side prevailed.  And there are two ways of measuring success - in mutual fund litigation and in life: how far one has come and where one now stands.</p>

<p>On the first scale, the Court's opinion appears clearly to have improved the lot of investors and made life less comfortable for the industry.  Immediately prior to the ruling, the law throughout the United States had been a <u>Gartenberg</u> standard under which no plaintiff had ever won a verdict - except in the Seventh Circuit, where the law had been Easterbrook's new standard, under which no plaintiff could ever win a verdict.  The Supreme Court's ruling eliminated the Seventh Circuit's standard and applied everywhere a new rule whose principal deviation from <u>Gartenberg</u> is its emphasis on a central fact that favors plaintiffs, to the extent it favors either side.  Interestingly, Easterbrook's dramatically pro-defendant opinion appears in retrospect to have served only to unsettle, to the industry's detriment, what had been an uninterrupted quarter-century of trial victories.</p>

<p>But a second scale addresses the more important issue of where the parties stand today.  On this point, the industry's claims of victory appear more persuasive.  Even if the Supreme Court has marginally improved the circumstances of future plaintiffs, these cases will still be very difficult to win.  Courts may have one more factor to balance in an already-crowded juggling contest, but defendants will undoubtedly adduce plenty of data and experts to support their rates.  </p>

<p>What is most notable about this decision, however, is its collection of unwritten pages.  The Court declined to address a sumptuous buffet of topics that would have greatly informed U.S. corporate law, extending far beyond the idiosyncrasies of mutual fund investors.  First, on this particular topic, the justices abstained completely and explicitly from the robust academic debate regarding the competitiveness of the mutual fund industry, stating that "The debate between the Seventh Circuit panel [Easterbrook, C.J.] and the dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc [Posner, J.] regarding today's mutual fund market is a matter for Congress, not the courts."  </p>

<p>The Court also refrained from advancing its discussion of the conception of the corporation (or, in this case, the business trust) that made <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-205.ZS.html">Citizens United</a> so fascinating to corporate scholars.  In addition, the Court gave little hint of its disposition on the broader executive compensation debate, which it might easily have done given the ready analogy of adviser fees to CEO salaries.  In sum, the justices revealed little about their general reaction to the massive financial crisis.</p>

<p>After having granted <em>certiorari</em> in so many prominent corporate cases, it seems the Court has delivered little new illumination on the most important economic issues.  Indeed, for true new insight into the Court's thinking on those topics, one must read a primarily constitutional law case, <u>Citizens United</u>.  One might reasonably assume that if the United States Supreme Court is unwilling to delve deeper into corporate topics during this era of such economic consequence, the judges of Delaware may long retain their judicial supremacy in this field.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ingrid Burke, Pitt Law '11, writes on the detention of Peter Erlinder, law professor and defense counsel at the ICTR, in light of her recent visit to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda...<br />
<hr height="1"><br />
<font size="3"><b>I</b></font>n a recent <a href="http://jurist.org/dateline/2010/06/tanzania-transferring-cases-from-the-ictr-to-rwanda-courts.php">piece</a> for JURIST Dateline, I wrote about a visit that I had made to the <a href="http://69.94.11.53/">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) in Arusha, Tanzania, as part of <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/faculty/profiles/jallohc">Professor Charles Jalloh's</a> International Criminal Law Seminar. At that time, I argued in favor of the transfer of lower to mid-level ICTR cases to Rwanda's national jurisdiction largely on the basis of Rwanda's improved fair-trial standards and due process guarantees. In light of the recent arrest and detention of renowned international criminal defense attorney, American law professor, and JURIST Forum contributor <a href="http://www.wmitchell.edu/academics/faculty/erlinder.asp">Peter Erlinder</a>, I feel compelled to revisit my previous argument in an attempt to reconcile my earlier findings with these recent developments.</p>

<p><b>Background</b></p>

<p>For a more detailed history of the ICTR, please see my most recent <a href="http://jurist.org/dateline/2010/06/tanzania-transferring-cases-from-the-ictr-to-rwanda-courts.php">article</a> on case transfers to Rwanda. To summarize, the ICTR has primary jurisdiction over the cases of individuals accused of having committed acts of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity in the territorial and temporal context of the Rwandan genocide.</p>

<p>However, the tribunal's days are numbered. While the <a href="http://liveunictr.altmansolutions.com/Portals/0/English%5CFactSheets%5CCompletion_St%5CS-2010-259e.pdf">closure</a> [PDF] dates of the trial and appeals chambers were recently postponed until the end of 2011 and 2013, respectively, these extensions are insufficient to accommodate the number of cases in progress and those that are yet to begin. Rule 11 <i>bis</i> was introduced to the ICTR <a href="http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/rules/index.htm">Rules of Evidence and Procedure</a> (REP) in order to ease concerns respecting such time constraints. According to Rule 11 <i>bis</i>, the Prosecutor is entitled to apply for the transfer of cases of lower to mid-level indictees to Rwanda's national jurisdiction, which ICTR Prosecutor Hassan Bubacar Jallow has attempted five times to date.</p>

<p>Each of these applications was denied for various reasons, including the appropriateness and applicability of punishments for genocide, the adequacy of protection for defense witnesses, witnesses' ability to enter Rwanda in order to testify, and ethnic biases that could affect the trials' impartiality. The ICTR has sponsored numerous funding and training initiatives in order to effectively reform the Rwandan judiciary, and until very recently, these initiatives appeared to have been paying off. The relevant laws were more narrowly tailored; modern witness protection programs replaced their problematic predecessors; greater assurances were granted to defense witnesses residing outside of Rwanda; and greater independence was bestowed upon the judiciary in order to curb tribunal fears of ethnically prejudicial sentencing. </p>

<p>The arrest and detention of Peter Erlinder, however, sheds new light on these examples of juridical progress and begs the question: would it be irresponsible - despite all of the safeguards guaranteed to transfer cases by way of the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/476644652.pdf">Law Concerning Cases of Transfer to the Republic of Rwanda</a> (Transfer Law) for the ICTR to begin transferring cases to Rwanda when clear evidence suggests that such safeguards are denied to individuals whose cases were never initially claimed by way of the ICTR's jurisdictional grant? In other words, can one good law render unimportant the instability of an entire judiciary?</p>

<p><b>Peter Erlinder</b></p>

<p>Over the course of his career, Peter Erlinder has defended numerous high-profile - and often highly unpopular - clients, served as lead council on various defense teams at the ICTR, and taught various courses at William Mitchell College of Law. </p>

<p>However, Erlinder was <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/05/us-lawyer-arrested-in-rwanda-for-genocide-denial.php">arrested</a> last month, one day after his arrival in Kigali, Rwanda, on charges of espousing genocide ideology. In an official <a href="http://www.minaffet.gov.rw/images/stories/press%20release%20-%20erlinder%5C%27s%20bail%20final.pdf">press release</a> [PDF], the Rwandan government stated: <blockquote>Perhaps Mr. Erlinder thought that his citizenship, academic standing or media profile would protect him - why else would a law professor so knowingly and deliberately break the law by entering Rwanda? But he failed to understand that genocide defenders and deniers - however rich, powerful or well-connected - are regarded by Rwandans as serious criminals hell-bent on destabilizing our nation.</blockquote>While Erlinder has since been released on bail and has returned to the United States, the Rwandan government continues to plan to <a href="http://www.minaffet.gov.rw/images/stories/press%20release.pdf">file charges</a> [PDF] against him. These charges are based on the highly controversial <a href="http://www.eurac-network.org/web/uploads/documents/20090924_11845.pdf">Law Relating to the Punishment of the Crime of Genocide Ideology</a> (Genocide Ideology Law). Since its passage in 2008, this law has been criticized by numerous international organizations, foreign governments, and NGOs for its far reaching implications. For example, <a href=" http://www.article19.org ">Article 19</a> - an organization aimed at promoting freedom of expression and freedom of information - recently filed a <a href="http://www.article19.org/pdfs/analysis/rwanda-comment-on-the-law-relating-to-the-punishment-of-the-crime-of-genocid.pdf">report</a> [PDF] with the United Nations criticizing the Genocide Ideology law: <blockquote>ARTICLE 19 is alarmed by the Genocide Ideology Law principally because the central concept of "genocide ideology" is extraordinarily broad and would catch a whole range of forms of expressions concerning genocide.... Furthermore, the system of penalties also breaches international human rights law, particularly with respect to children.</blockquote></p>

<p><b>Problems with the Genocide Ideology Law</b></p>

<p>Article 3 establishes the criteria for charges of supporting genocide ideology. One subsection of the article includes the following list of prohibited behaviors: "marginalizing, laughing at one's misfortune, defaming, mocking, boasting, despising, degrading, creating confusion aiming at negating the genocide which occurred, stirring up ill feelings, taking revenge, altering testimony or evidence for the genocide which occurred."</p>

<p>The penalties imposed by the articles of the Genocide Ideology Law are strict, and the text of the law is replete with negative implications for free speech. For instance, the subsection of Article 3 quoted above implies that history cannot be questioned. I see no major problem with this as far as acknowledging the deaths of between 800,000 and 1,000,000 victims is concerned. However, a key element of justice is transparency, and impunity can only be detrimental. As such, a law which effectively prohibits questions related to the liability of former rebel leaders does a disservice to the goals of justice and reconciliation. </p>

<p>Furthermore, Article 9 of the Genocide Ideology Law allows Rwandan authorities to send children under the age of 12 accused of having espoused genocide ideology - be it for "mocking, boasting, or despising" the wrong child on the playground - to rehabilitation camps for up to 12 months. This article establishes a punishment too close in nature and purpose to the First Nations reservations schools in Canada (<a href="http://www.afn.ca/residentialschools/history.html">Assembly of First Nations</a>) to be reconcilable with international human rights law, such as <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Relations</a> and <a href="http://www.un-documents.net/cppcg.htm"> Article II of the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide</a>. </p>

<p><b>Implications for the Stability of Rwanda's Judiciary and for Rule 11 <i>bis</i> transfers</b></p>

<p>While fair trial and due process concerns have traditionally blocked Prosecutor Jallow's efforts to transfer cases to Rwanda's national jurisdiction, the introduction of the Transfer Law seemed to alleviate such concerns. Under the Transfer Law, transfer-case defendants are guaranteed fair trial and due process rights that are in line with international standards. Furthermore, the ICTR is able to implement monitoring mechanisms in order to ensure that transfer cases are adjudicated properly. In effect, the Transfer Law creates a safe haven within Rwanda's judiciary for the cases of lower to mid-level ICTR defendants. </p>

<p>Outside of that safe haven, however, juridical conditions are shakier. Among other issues, most high-level genocide cases are tried in Rwanda's <a href="http://www.inkiko-gacaca.gov.rw/En/EnIntroduction.htm">Gacaca</a> court system. Among other points of concern, the Gacaca courts have been harshly criticized by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/node/79182">Human Rights Watch</a> and <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/region/rwanda/report-2008">Amnesty International </a> reports for a lack of public access to trials, the dangerously low educational and professional standards required of judges, and extremely lax witness protection rights. Rwandan prisons are sorely lacking in terms of due process concerns - such as indefinite pre-trial detention - and basic sanitation and living standards, according to a <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/depsta/law/research/icps/worldbrief/wpb_country_print.php?country=39">report</a> from World Prisons Brief at King's College London. Finally, the Erlinder case reflects poorly on Rwandan judicial independence in light of Erlinder's well-publicized conflict with President Kagame in his role as opposition candidate <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/04/rwanda-opposition-leader-arrested-on.php">Victoire Ingabire's</a> counsel in the midst of the upcoming presidential elections.</p>

<p>It is arguable that the aforementioned problems are irrelevant to the question of Rwanda's readiness for ICTR Rule 11 <i>bis</i> transfers. After all, the Transfer Law guarantees international fair trial and due process norms to transfer defendants, and the Tribunal is entitled to keep tabs on these cases in order to verify their fairness. Furthermore, since cases transferred from the ICTR are limited to the Tribunal's subject matter jurisdiction, which excludes "genocide ideology", the ICTR could choose to overlook the problems posed by Erlinder's arrest.</p>

<p>However, in a recent <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/rwanda-urged-ensure-opposition-leader-receives-fair-trial-2010-04-28">press release</a>, Amnesty International's Erwin van der Borght summarized the troublesome issue of Rwanda's persevering susceptibility to juridical instability well in saying: <blockquote>We have documented a number of incidents of intimidation and harassment of opposition groups in Rwanda in recent months....[n]ow with the arrest of a potential presidential candidate a few months ahead of the election, we call on the government to demonstrate that this is not another such case.</blockquote></p>

<p>Ultimately, considering the ICTR's <a href="http://www.unictr.org/Portals/0/English/Legal/Resolutions/English/955e.pdf">stated goals</a> of contributing to the "process of national reconciliation and to the restoration and maintenance of peace," I think it is imperative for the ICTR to question the appropriateness of transferring cases - even if such cases will be protected by defense rights and international monitoring - to a judiciary that, despite progress over the past several years, has shown itself to suffer from a dangerous amount of political influence in the lead-up to this year's presidential elections. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Katie Belanger</strong> [<a href="http://www.fairwisconsin.com">Fair Wisconsin</a>]: "On Wednesday, June 30, 2010, the Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld the 2006 state constitutional amendment banning marriage equality and civil unions in the <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/06/wisconsin-supreme-court-unanimously-upholds-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">McConkey v. J.B. Van Hollen et al. decision</a>.  In this case, William McConkey challenged the validity of the amendment, stating that it violates the single subject requirement for all constitutional amendments by addressing both marriage and civil unions.  This decision was not about public policy, but rather about legal procedure.</p>

                <p>In the unanimous decision, liberal and conservative alike agreed that the amendment did not violate the single subject rule. Our highly politicized Supreme Court had the opportunity to use this case to make a statement, to undermine our 2009 domestic partnership victory and do irreparable harm to the fight for equality, but they did not.</p>

                <p>Conservative Justice Michael Gableman was tasked with writing the opinion.  While many of us disagree with the court about whether or not civil unions are the equivalent of marriage, Gableman's words were clear: "...the question before us is not whether the marriage amendment is good public policy or bad public policy, nor its interpretation or application..."</p>

                <p>These statements signal that the court was not weighing in on the merits of the amendment. They did not interpret the amendment.  They did not discuss or include commentary on whether the amendment was the right step for our state or not.  The justices took care to not legislate from the bench.  The outcome was not what we at Fair Wisconsin had hoped for.  When we joined with the ACLU and Lambda Legal to file an amicus brief in the case, it was for the express purpose of preventing the court from doing irreparable harm to our current legislative victories and our future priorities.  </p>

                <p>So, where do we go now?</p>

                <p>This decision is not a step backwards; it rather confirms the status quo.  It does not change the amendment or domestic partnerships.  Couples who have registered as domestic partnerships are not affected and couples can continue to register at their county clerk's office.  Some have said that this decision may bolster the confidence of the anti-fairness conservatives who see an opportunity to challenge the domestic partnership registry.  To those people I say, "Been there, done that."  The Supreme Court threw out the first challenge before they even decided the McConkey case.  And if our opposition brings the case to a lower court, we are ready to once again swiftly and effectively defend the critical protections that so many couples are enjoying around the state.</p>

                <p>What this decision does is clarify the path to full equality. </p>

                <p>We're going to have to push up our sleeves and do it the old-fashioned way.  Putting boots on the ground, continuing to elect leaders who will stand with us in the fight for equality, educating people about the harms the amendment inflicts on caring, committed same-sex couples across the state every day.  Repealing a constitutional amendment is no easy process.  Two consecutive sessions of the legislature need to pass the repeal measure and then we go back to the ballot with another statewide referendum.  I have no doubt that we will accomplish these goals and more.  This is a marathon, not a sprint.  It will take time to get the right elected leaders in office.  It will take time to change the hearts and minds of our friends and neighbors, to gain their support for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender equality.  </p>

                <p>So, we'd better get a move on."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.wmitchell.edu/academics/faculty/erlinder.asp">Peter Erlinder</a>, defense counsel at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and Professor of Law at William Mitchell College of Law, and his colleagues Beth Lyons and John Philpot of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) Association des Avocats de la Defense (ADAD) say that in the wake of the recent murder ICTR defense lawyer Jwani Mwaikusaof the United Nations Security Council must take measures to ensure the safety of ICTR defense attorneys and protect the legacy of the ICTR.... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/petererlinder.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>T</b></font>he Bureau of the ICTR ADAD notes with sadness and alarm the murder of our ICTR colleague University of Dar es Salaam Law Professor Jwani Mwaikusa, who was shot to death at his home on July 14.  Professor Mwaikusa had recently prevented the transfer of  ICTR defendants to Rwanda on "lack of fair trial" grounds, and recently announced the appeal of his client's July 3 conviction.</p>

<p>Our colleague's murder is not an isolated incident. Within the past month, a prominent Rwandan opposition journalist was also shot to death in front of his home; a former Rwandan general survived an apparent assassination attempt in South Africa, where he is seeking asylum; the  decapitated body of  the Rwandan Green Party Vice-president was found near his car two days ago; and the Green Party's President has been publicly threatened with assassination.</p>

<p>Hundreds of potential opposition candidates and supporters have been arrested or disappeared. Presidential candidate Victoire Ingabire was arrested on "genocide denial" charges for suggesting the view that both Tutsi and Hutu were victims during the 1990-94 civil war and genocide, as were her Dutch, U.S., and Rwandan lawyers.</p>

<p>The murder of Dr. Mwaikusa also follows the illegal arrest of other lawyers representing alleged opponents of the Rwandan government. U.S. Law Professor Peter Erlinder was arrested and detained on "genocide denial" criminal charges arising from his work in the ICTR Military 1 Trial, which acquitted four senior military officers on "genocide conspiracy" charges in February 2009, and from his representation of Madame Ingabire.   After Erlinder's arrest, ICTR defense lawyers refused to participate in proceedings and he was released  in June after an international campaign.</p>

<p>But, the Rwandan government continues to refuse to recognize UN-granted immunity for Erlinder or other ICTR defense counsel.  ICTR defense lawyer Peter Robinson (a former Assistant U.S. Attorney) has notified the court that meaningful defense of ICTR clients is not possible and he has asked to withdraw.  Other ICTR defense attorneys are considering similar measures.</p>

<p>Rwandan government threats to ICTR defense counsel are also not isolated incidents.  In 2006 ICTR defense lawyer Callixte Gakwaya was arrested on a Rwandan "genocide" warrant when he arrived at the ICTR and he was forced to end his ICTR work. Many other defense team members have also been forced to give up ICTR work, because of threats or arrests by the Rwanda government. The charges against Erlinder, the Mwaikusa murder, and continuing threats against ICTR defense teams make it clear that ICTR defense team members cannot take their safety for granted anywhere in Africa.</p>

<p>In addition, during the past two months credible media reports have documented the systematic withholding of evidence helpful to the defense by the ICTR Prosecutor, which further deepens our concern because only the losing side in the Rwanda civil war has been prosecuted at the ICTR. The ADAD Bureau is deeply concerned that the impossibility of meaningful defense at the ICTR has now made the legitimacy of the ICTR, itself,  an open question.</p>

<p>The ADAD Bureau calls on the UN Security Council to ensure the safety of ICTR defense teams, to undertake an independent investigation of the Mwaikuza murder, and to re-establish the integrity of the Tribunal by fully disclosing evidence of crimes committed in Rwanda in 1994 by both the former and the current government of Rwanda.</p>

		<title>More constitutional amendments by Turkish High Court are unwarranted</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Serkan Yolcu</strong> [<a href="http://uludag.academia.edu/">Uludag University Faculty of Law</a>]: "On Wednesday July 7, 2010, the Turkish media was unexpectedly informed by the press office of Constitutional Court that the Court made its eagerly anticipated <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/07/turkish-court-annuls-parts-of-constitutional-reforms.php">judgment</a> on the constitutional amendment package that has been on the agenda for months.  After 9.5 hours of debate in only one day, the eleven members of the Court decided to annul a few clauses of some articles of the package. The partially annulled articles rearrange the process of electing members to the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK). </p>

                <p>The Court annulled the provisions that would have prevented members of the high judiciary from voting for more than one candidate in their selection to HSYK and the Constitutional Court. The provision that would have allowed the president to assign political science and economics academics or senior executives to the HSYK was also annulled. Apart from these very minor changes the package still preserves its content. The decision is very interesting in terms of the votes. While discussing the motion, 39 claims were rejected with different votes of which only 7 decisions were taken unanimously and the rest was decided by majority of votes. However, 7 annulment decisions were decided unanimously. </p>

                <p>The decision was immediately and heavily criticized.  The main argument is that the Court exceeded his authority (again!) by reviewing the amendments in respect to substance even though it is not empowered to do so according to the 1982 Constitution. (Article 148 of the Constitution stipulates that "Constitutional amendments shall be examined and verified only with regard to their form ... the verification of constitutional amendments shall be restricted to consideration of whether the requisite majorities were obtained for the proposal and in the ballot, and whether the prohibition on debates under urgent procedure was complied with".) The reasoned judgment of the Court has not been published yet but as far as it's learned from the media, the Court annulled those clauses by finding them contrary to the principle of "democratic... [S]tate governed by the rule of law" provided in the Article 2 of the Constitution. Therefore it's not possible to decide the constitutionality of the amendments without a substantial review in this respect.</p>

                <p>This is not the first time the Court reviewed the compatibility of constitutional amendments with respect to the Constitution. Under the 1982 Constitution, there have been four times (1987, 2007, 2007, 2008) in which the Court made the judicial review of the constitutional amendments. The most controversial one was the decision on June 5, 2008 which annulled the amendments to the Article 10 and 42 of the Constitution relating to removing the ban on  headscarves at universities. This was the only time the Court annulled a constitutional amendment under the 1982 Constitution until the decision of July 7, 2010. Since that decision, the Court is said to be in violation of the Constitution because it does not have a competence for judicial review of constitutional amendments in respect to substance. Today in 2010, the Court is said to be in violation of the Constitution again by deciding partial annulment of the current constitutional amendment package.</p>

                <p>Under Turkish constitutional system, the Constitutional Court does not have the power to review laws that have not completed its enactment process. Likewise, these constitutional amendments are not valid and unenforceable because their enactment process is not yet completed. The package will be subject to a referendum on September 12, 2010 because it did not receive enough votes in the Assembly to enter into force immediately. Therefore, this referendum will be both on the validity and the enforcement of the amendments. Consequently this law amending the Constitution has not become a "law" yet. The Constitutional Court has no power to make a preventive review of legislation. The 1982 Constitution allows the Court only to make <em>a</em> <em>posteriori</em> review of laws. In other words, the Court cannot review a law even amending the Constitution which has not finished its procedure to become valid. However, the Court invalidated constitutional amendments by reviewing them while they are on their way to referendum.</p>

                <p>Nowadays both the opposition party and the current heads of high judicial bodies are not satisfied with the decision because they believe that the rest of partly annulled articles are contrary to the separation of powers and judicial independence. The opposition parties in the Parliament started campaigns for saying "no" in referendum while the government is trying to persuade people to say "yes".  On the other hand, although the supporters of the constitutional change censure the decision because the Court exceeded its powers by reviewing the substance of the amendments they are pleased with the decision and seem to ignore it because the decision did not affect the main idea of the constitutional change and abolish the whole package."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www1.law.wnec.edu/faculty/index.cfm?selection=doc.1187">Bruce Miller</a> of Western New England College School of Law says that the decision of a moderately liberal federal judge that the application of the Defense of Marriage Act in Massachusetts is unconstitutional on federalism grounds is unsurprising...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forumy/brucemiller.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>O</b></font>n July 8, Judge Joseph Tauro of the U. S. District Court in Boston held the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defines marriage for purposes of federal law as the union of one man and one woman, to be beyond Congress' constitutional authority. If it stands, his ruling will make Massachusetts same sex couples eligible for many federal programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and veterans' benefits. In invalidating DOMA, Judge Tauro did no more than follow a constitutional rule established by the Supreme Court under the direction of the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist. A decade ago, Rehnquist confidently posited that the "Constitution requires a distinction between what is truly national and what is truly local."  To Rehnquist, a conservative Republican, this strict, categorical division of constitutional authority was a necessary consequence of the framers' novel decision to permit two sovereigns, state and federal, simultaneously to exercise governmental power in the same geographical space.  Under Rehnquist's stewardship, the Supreme Court famously relied on this presumed inherent separation of the national from the local to retake responsibility, long ceded to Congress, for determining the present meaning of the framers' ingenious invention.   For the first time in two generations, federalism was to be enforced from the bench.	</p>

<p>Thus, in <u>U.S. v. Morrison</u>, the case which prompted Rehnquist's declaration, a five to four majority of the Court held that the provision of judicial remedies to victims of gender based violence was an exclusively local responsibility, and therefore beyond Congress' power, notwithstanding the roots of such violence in the historical subordination of women, a core concern of the Fourteenth Amendment. Five years earlier, the Rehnquist Court had similarly stricken a federal ban on gun possession in schools on the ground that firearm regulation, too, was inherently a matter for state control and thus beyond Congress' authority to regulate matters affecting interstate commerce.  The same five to four majority was unmoved by the impact of gun based violence on teaching and learning, and thus on the economic prospects of our nation's students. Their aim of promoting a strong, unified national economy is, of course, the central reason why the framers gave Congress the Interstate Commerce power.</p>

<p>But three years after <u>Morrison</u>, the Court switched sides, finding that Congress' criminalization of the private medical use of marijuana with a physician's authorization properly addressed a truly national problem (eradicating the national drug trade), notwithstanding California's decision to authorize such use by state residents.  The line between the national and the local, however obligatory, seemed hard to draw in principle, and quite hazy in practice.  Moreover, a closely divided Supreme Court's allocation of federal legislative measures to either side of the line seemed to reflect little more than the preferences of conservative culture war partisans. While controlling firearms and providing remedies for gender based violence, important causes for Congressional liberals and Democrats, were deemed not matters of national concern, stopping private marijuana use, a policy favored much more by Republicans and conservatives, plainly was.</p>

<p>Against this background, the decision of a moderately liberal federal judge that the application of DOMA in Massachusetts is unconstitutional on federalism grounds is unsurprising.  As Judge Tauro observed, relying on Rehnquist's <u>Morrison</u> opinion, "family law, including declarations of status, e.g. marriage, annulment, divorce, custody and paternity is often held out as the archetypal area of local concern" (emphasis by Judge Tauro).  And until the 1996 enactment of DOMA, which had no purpose save for thwarting the effectiveness of (then foreseeable) state recognition of same sex marriage, Congress had never adopted a definition of marriage as a matter of federal law. The unprecedented DOMA foray into family law required Massachusetts either to foreswear its recognition of same marriages or surrender its own and its citizens' eligibility for those federal Medicare, Medicaid and veterans' benefits made available by DOMA only to separate sex married couples.  Judge Tauro found this choice to be an unconstitutional Catch 22, encroaching on the core sovereign right of Massachusetts to adopt and enforce its own definition of marriage.</p>

<p>To be sure, Judge Tauro's rejection of a key argument offered by the Obama Administration in defense of DOMA - that Congress may properly condition a state's eligibility for federal financial support on its willingness to surrender the right to define marriage as it sees fit - raises important and even novel Constitutional questions.  But in recognizing that right as an attribute of state sovereignty, Judge Tauro was doing no more than following Chief Justice Rehnquist's admonition to distinguish the truly national from the truly local.  And in light of Rehnquist's Court's conclusion that gender based violence, frequently, perhaps paradigmatically, a family based injustice, falls on the local side of the divide, it is hard to imagine any judge, save for one highly predisposed to reach politically conservative results, failing to place a state's recognition of same sex marriage there, too, even if it means reaching a result that supports a liberal cause. </p>

<hr height="1"><br />
<img alt="Marlin Mine" title="Marlin Mine, Guatemala" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/MarlinMine.jpg" width="320" height="219" class="mt-image-left" style="float: right; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" /><font size="3"><b>I</b></font>n May I began working for the Social Justice Committee (SJC) of Montreal as a corporate accountability intern. The SJC is an independent human rights organization promoting education and advocacy in the areas of global poverty and inequality. In terms of corporate accountability, the SJC is currently advocating for passage of <a href="http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=3658424&Language=e&Mode=1">Bill C-300</a>, also known the Corporate Accountability of Mining, Oil, and Gas Corporations in Developing Countries Act. This private member's bill currently before the Canadian parliament seeks to create a mechanism that would allow for the filing of complaints against Canadian extractive companies operating in developing countries if they are believed to be in non-compliance with agreed upon international environmental and human rights standards.</p>

<p>As July 22 marks the second annual Global Day of Action Against Open Pit Mining, and <a href="http://faomontreal.wordpress.com/">FAO Montreal</a> has organized a <a href="http://faomontreal.wordpress.com/2010/07/16/159/#more-159">march</a> to commemorate the day, it seems appropriate to take a closer look at the Canadian mining industry and its actions abroad. Canada is home to over 75 percent of the world's largest mining and extraction companies. However, the existing mechanisms to ensure that these corporations, which receive support from the Government of Canada, act in compliance with international environmental best practices and with Canada's commitments to human rights, are toothless at best and non-existent at worse. </p>

<p><img alt="MiningCrane.JPG" title="Mining Crane" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/MiningCrane.JPG" width="211" height="282" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" />Starting in 2006, the Canadian government held a series of <a href="http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/ds/csr.aspx#">National Roundtables on Corporate Social Responsibility</a> (CSR). The roundtables concluded with the release of a <a href=http://www.mining.ca/www/media_lib/MAC_Documents/Publications/CSRENG.pdf">final report</a> [PDF] authored by a multi-stakeholder Advisory Group, which included members from industry, civil society, academia, labor, and the responsible investment sector. In essence the report called for the development of a Canadian CSR framework. The Advisory Group urged the Government of Canada to work with key stakeholders to adopt a set of CSR standards that Canadian extractive companies operating abroad would be expected to abide by, and that would be reinforced by appropriate reporting, compliance, and other mechanisms. </p>

<p>In March of 2009, the government released its <a href="http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/assets/pdfs/CSR-March2009.pdf">official response</a> [PDF] to the roundtable report, and it included no effective complaints mechanism and no mechanism to sanction companies in non-compliance with agreed upon guidelines. Rather, the government's CSR strategy called for the creation of a CSR Counsellor, a position that suffers from serious limitations. Namely, it lacks enforcement powers and may only investigate complaints with the express consent of corporations. In short, the government failed to effectively take into account the key recommendations of the roundtable report, and did little more than endorse current CSR standards. The government's CSR strategy would do little more than create a toothless administrative mechanism to generate a façade of accountability. </p>

<p>Following the government's failure to seriously respond to the roundtable report, legislation in the form of a private member's bill became the only viable means by which to regulate Canadian corporations engaged in mining, oil or gas activities abroad. </p>

<p>Liberal MP <a href="http://www.johnmckaymp.on.ca/">John McKay</a> introduced private member's Bill C-300 to Parliament in February of 2009. C-300 seeks to implement a number of the key recommendations from the roundtable report. Although the bill pre-dates the government's official response to the roundtables, it largely picks up the slack where the government's response fell short. </p>

<p>In summary, if Bill C-300 is passed it would:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Regulate the relationship between Canadian government agencies such as, Export Development Canada, the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, and the Canadian Pension Plan, and Canadian extractive companies operating in developing countries.</li><br />
<li>Develop guidelines that articulate corporate accountability standards for political and financial support provided to Canadian extractive companies by the aforementioned government agencies. These guidelines are to include standards consistent with international human rights and environmental standards.</li><br />
<li>Create a complaints mechanism by which complaints are filed with the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. The complaint, if entertained, would lead to an investigation of the company and its compliance with the guidelines set forth by C-300. The investigation would culminate with the release of a public report within eight months of the complaint.</li><br />
<li>Provide a mechanism for removing a company's government support as long as it is in non-compliance with the guidelines.</li><br />
</ul><br />
<img alt="MinePit.jpg" title="Mining Pit" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/MinePit.jpg" width="198" height="275" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" />Private member's bills cannot require the support of a budget. As such, C-300 faces some limitations of its own. Namely, the bill may not include a provision for an ombudsperson or independent investigations. However, C-300 would directly forward complaints to the Minister of International Trade and Foreign Affairs, which would be followed by an investigation of the alleged violations. If evidence of a CSR violation is found, then the company would be required to submit annual reports to the House of Commons and Senate, where the reports would be reviewed to determine whether the company is in non-compliance with the guidelines. If a company is held to be in non-compliance, <a href="http://www.edc.ca/">Export Development Canada</a> funding, <a href="http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/isp/cpp/cpptoc.shtml">Canada Pension Plan</a> funding, and consular and embassy support could be withdrawn. </p>

<p>The bill has passed its first reading in the House of Commons. In the second reading, the House referred the bill to the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development, which studied the bill and heard testimony from public witnesses during the spring and early summer. When the House of Commons resumes sitting on 20 September, one of the first items on the agenda will be to debate and consider the bill as amended, and it is anticipated that the third reading vote will take place sometime in October. If the bill passes through the third reading, it will be sent to the Senate for consideration, and, if passed by the Senate, it will require Royal Assent (presentment to the Governor General who may assent to the bill in the Queen's name, withhold assent, or reserve assent) to become law.</p>

<p><img alt="SALocals.jpg" title="Local women" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/SALocals.jpg" width="256" height="173" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" />Although this legislation proposes only a modest mechanism by which corporations receiving support from the Government of Canada can be held accountable for their practices overseas, it has stirred up a great deal of controversy. The mining sector, Canada Pension Plan, Export Development Canada (both heavy investors in the extractive industry), and the <a href="http://www.conservative.ca/">Conservative Party</a> oppose the bill. On the other hand, the bill has received support from a wide range of civil society groups, the opposition <a href="http://www.liberal.ca/">Liberal Party</a>, the <a href="http://www.ndp.ca/">NDP</a>, and the <a href="http://www.blocquebecois.org/accueil.aspx">Bloc Quebecois</a> [French]. While the attention that C-300 has received probably far outweighs its potential impact, I believe that Canadians would like to see their politicians choose to hold government-supported corporations to the international environmental and human rights standards Canada claims to support. And, as a Canadian permanent resident, I would like to see Parliament take a step, if only a modest one, toward greater oversight of corporate actions abroad.</p>

<hr height="1"><br />
<img alt="Israel1.jpg" src="/dateline/Israel1.jpg" title="Israeli settlement outside of Jerusalem" width="216" height="162" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" /><font size="3"><b>T</b></font>his June, I took courses at the Agron Guest House in the heart of Jerusalem while on a study abroad program hosted by Touro College Law Center. I feel fortunate that I had a group of professors who clung tightly to the idea that "if you don't learn anything outside of the classroom, there is no reason to be in another country." Our professors took this seriously, and took us on many excursions that justified studying abroad in Israel. We toured the Supreme Court of Israel and the Knesset, which is Israel's parliament. I also saw first-hand the separation fence, settlements in the West Bank, such as Ma'ale Adumim, and tours focusing on the region's contentious geopolitics, especially at the Temple Mount. While we learned much about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, we also spent a lot of time comparing the Israeli legal system with the American legal system, and I found this to be one of the most interesting parts of the program. In discussions with a current judge, a former Supreme Court Justice, and during a tour of the Supreme Court, we found that Israel's process of selecting judges by nomination panel, rather than by executive appointment or judicial election as in the United States, would be a recurring theme of the course. The differences between the Supreme Court of Israel and the Supreme Court of the United States formed another frequent topic of discussion.</p>

<p>In the United States, federal judges are appointed by the President, and many state and county judges gain their seats in competitive elections. However, Israel follows the example of many other countries and selects its judges by nomination. While Israel does not yet have a formal constitution, the principle of a strong independent judiciary is enshrined in the <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1980_1989/Basic Law- The Judiciary">Basic Law: The Judiciary</a>, which will most likely be included in a formal constitution. The Basic Law sets up a Judges' Election Committee (JEC) with nine members. The committee includes the President of the Supreme Court, two other Supreme Court Justices, the Minister of Justice, two members of the Knesset, and two members of the Israel Bar Association. Once a candidate has been nominated by the JEC, the candidate must then be approved by the Prime Minister. Like federal judges appointed under Article III of the US Constitution, Israeli judges have a lifetime appointment, subject to removal in limited circumstances. However, Israeli judges are subject to mandatory retirement at the age of 70.</p>

<p><img alt="Israel2.jpg" src="/dateline/Israel2.jpg" title="Separation barrier outside of Jerusalem" width="216" height="162" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" />While federal judges in the United States are generally given lifetime appointments after a nomination and confirmation process, the election of some judges at the county and state levels has been, and continues to be, controversial. This controversy has led to a long-standing debate in the United States about judicial selection procedures. Late last year, I <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/oconnor-urges-states-to-move-towards.php">reported</a> [JURIST Report] for JURIST's Paper Chase service on how former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and the Institute for the Advancement of the American Legal System (IAALS) encouraged states to move from direct judicial elections to a merit-based selection process. The switch to merit-based nominations is also backed by US Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who lent her support to O'Connor's movement while delivering a <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/ginsburg-backs-end-to-judicial.php">speech</a> [JURIST Report] to the National Association of Women Judges. The O'Connor Judicial Selection Initiative (OJSI) is concerned that "politics don't belong in the courtroom and justice should not be for sale."</p>

<p>There is not only a difference in the judicial selection process between Israel and the United States, but also in the operation of the highest courts. To bring a case before a court in the United States, a person must have standing, which is met by a showing of injury and causation. One must also appeal their case through a series of lower courts before even petitioning the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>In stark contrast to the American requirement of standing, Israeli law permits anyone to bring a challenge against almost any law. This was not always the case. Israel formerly required claimants to have standing in order to bring a case before the court, but then-Chief Justice Barak liberalized the requirement of standing in Israel in <u><a href="http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files_eng/86/100/009/Z01/86009100.z01.pdf">Ressler v. Minister of Defence</a></u> [PDF], a landmark case which ruled that the "legal standing of a petitioner before the High Court will be recognised if he can show that there is a reasonable prospect that an interest of his (not necessarily amounting to a right) which may be shared by a great number of others, has been prejudiced." Former Chief Justice Aharon Barak clarified the Israeli view of standing in <u><a href="https://www.unodc.org/tldb/pdf/Israel_HCJ_3239-02.pdf">Iad Ashak Mahmud Marab et al. v. IDF Commander in the West Bank</a></u> [PDF], which discussed detention policies in the occupied territories: "[U]nder our approach to the issue of standing, any person or organization interested in the fate of the detainee" has a right to file suit. "Indeed, the petition before us was submitted by, among others, seven associations or organizations that deal with human rights." The court also acts as the High Court of Justice, a court of first and last instance in suits against the government, allowing some claimants to file directly with the court.</p>

<p><img alt="Israel4.jpg" title="Temple Mount" src="/dateline/Israel4.jpg" width="216" height="162" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" />Justice Barak also expanded the idea of which cases are justiciable in Israel. This doctrine of justiciability is more narrowly interpreted in the United States than in Israel. If a court, American or Israeli, decides that an issue is non-justiciable, it may refuse to hear a case on the basis that it cannot grant relief for the claim. One of the most common effects of this doctrine, especially in wartime, is to allow a court to evade an issue by declaring it to be a political question. When an American court invokes the political question doctrine, it refuses to hear a case because it believes that the Constitution has given decision-making power to another branch of government, that it does not have proper standards in place to decide the case, or that interference would otherwise be unwise.</p>

<p>However, under Justice Barak's expanded view of justiciability, the Supreme Court of Israel, sitting as the High Court of Justice, heard cases that would most likely not be heard under similar circumstances in the United States. One such example is the High Court of Justice's opinion in <u><a href="http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files_eng/02/690/007/a34/02007690.a34.pdf">The Public Committee Against Torture In Israel v. The Government Of Israel</a></u> [PDF], a case where the court had to decide on the legality of Israel's policy of targeted killings. After gathering intelligence on who was behind terrorist attacks, the Israeli military would use preventive strikes to eliminate those found responsible. Much to my surprise, the High Court actually heard and decided this case, something I couldn't imagine the Supreme Court of the United States doing. The US Supreme Court would likely hold that the non-governmental organizations bringing suit in <u>Public Committee Against Torture in Israel</u> lacked standing, not to mention that they would likely avoid addressing issues of specific military tactics. In this case, the High Court's decision constituted a severe limitation of what the military could do or how it could do it. Because Barak liberalized the doctrines of standing and justiciability in Israel, he has been criticized for his "judicial activism" by University of Chicago Law School Lecturer and Seventh Circuit Judge Richard Posner in an <a href="http://www.tnr.com/article/enlightened-despot">article</a> in the New Republic.</p>

<p>While Justice Barak and his views are not commonly known in the United States, they have been the center of some controversy in the country. Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan has called Barak her "judicial hero," a move that has led critics to label her as a judicial activist. While opponents of judicial elections in the United States often worry about judicial activism, Barak's example seems to show that judges with lifetime appointments can be activists as well.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://doebbler.net/default.aspx">Curtis Doebbler</a>, professor of law at An-Najah National University in Nablus, Palestine, says that while the recent opinion of the International Court of Justice on Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence is likely to be an important point of reference for the representatives of other groups seeking self-determination, it is unlikely to be remembered as one of the Court's better attempts to articulate and clarify the law...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forumy/curtisdoebbler.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>O</b></font>n 22 July the International Court of Justice handed down a decision that is likely to have significant consequences for the unilateral declarations of independence for people seeking to form an independent State. </p>

<p>The main legal finding of the Court is that the unilateral declaration of independence by the Kosovo Assembly was legal because international law does not prohibit declarations of independence.</p>

<p>In providing this Advisory Opinion the Court rejects the suggestion that Kosovo's declaration of independence was <em>sui generis</em> (a special case) and thereby established that as a general rule of international law declarations of independence are valid under international law. </p>

<p>This finding by the Court would seem to legitimize declarations of independence such as the 15 November 1988 declaration of independence of Palestine by the Palestinian Liberation Organization, an entity recognized as the legitimate representatives of the Palestinian people by the UN General Assembly. The vagueness of the Court's criteria and reasoning, however, leaves much up to the creativity of those seeking to use to Advisory Opinion to further their cause or to apply common standards to future cases.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">* * *</div>

<p>To arrive at its decision the Court had to first confront several jurisdictional obstacles that States had raised.</p>

<p>While it was difficult for any State to challenge the request for an Advisory Opinion from the UN General Assembly as being outside its competence due to the broad manner in which this competence is defined in the Charter of the UN, the nature of the request was challenged. </p>

<p>It was alleged that the request by the General Assembly was outside its powers under the Charter because the Security Council was seized of the matter. The Court, however, dismissed this claim stating that while the Security Council being seized of the matter might limit the ability of the General Assembly to act upon an Advisory Opinion, it did not limit its ability to ask for an Advisory Opinion. (para. 24). </p>

<p>The Court also considered whether the request was for a legal or a political opinion. According to article 96 of the Charter, only legal opinions may be requested. This is consistent with the judicial nature of the Court as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. The question that had been asked to the Court was: "Is the unilateral declaration of independence by the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government of Kosovo in accordance with international law?" The Court first notes that this appears to be a legal question by its clear words. It then goes on to hold that its longstanding jurisprudence has confirmed "that the fact that a question has political aspects does not suffice to deprive it of its character as a legal question." (para. 27). The question is thus found to be legal.</p>

<p>After finding that the General Assembly had authority to ask the Advisory Opinion, the Court finds it necessary to enquire into whether this authority has been properly exercised in the present case. This relative lengthy enquiry (17 paragraphs: 29-48) under the section entitled "Discretion" was described by the Court as the consideration of its "discretion whether or not to respond to a request for an advisory opinion ... so as to protect the integrity of the Court's judicial function and its nature as the principal judicial organ of the  United Nations." (para. 29). It might be wondered if after finding that the request was for a legal question, it was appropriate for the Court to consider its discretion. </p>

<p>The failure of the Court to respond to a legitimate legal question would appear to be abrogation of its responsibilities or even indicate a degree of politicization. These consequences, however, were not considered by the Court in its Advisory Opinion. Nevertheless, the Court was on solid ground in pointing out that article 65, para. 1 of its own Statute indicates this discretion exists by using the word 'may' instead of 'shall' to describe its power to give Advisory Opinions.</p>

<p>In its lengthy discussion of its exercise of discretion, the Court emphasized, as it has often held, that requests for Advisory Opinions should not "in principle" be refused. (para. 30). The Court then considers whether there are compelling reason for refusal. It dismisses as not compelling enough the claim that the request was made to serve the political self-interests of individual States holding that "the motives of individual States which sponsor, or vote in favour of, a resolution requesting an advisory opinion are not relevant to the Court's exercise of its discretion whether or not to respond." (para. 33). It also dismisses the arguments that lack of a clear reason for requesting an Advisory Opinion (para. 33) or that there might be possible "adverse political consequences" of its Opinion (para. 35), should move the Court to deny the request. </p>

<p>Revisiting the relationship between the Security Council and the General Assembly, the Court considers whether it would be interfering with the division of powers between these two bodies. The Court essentially deals with the this problem as it did in its Advisory Opinion on Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see para. 26 of the 1996 Opinion quoted by the Court at para. 40), where it emphasized that the Security Council's competence in the area of peace and security may be primary, but is not exclusive. The Court even stresses the compatibility of General Assembly action on matters that are being dealt with by the Security Council because they concern international pace and security. The Court states</p>

<p>that the fact that a matter falls within the primary responsibility of the Security Council for situations which may affect the maintenance of international peace and security and that the Council has been exercising its powers in that respect does not preclude the General Assembly from discussing that situation or, within the limits set by Article 12, making recommendations with regard thereto.</p>

<p>The Court also draws attention to the Uniting for Peace Resolution (UNGA Res. 377A (V)) which recognizes the General Assembly's power to make recommendations in such situations. The Court's only hesitance to recognize these broad reaching powers of the General Assembly is its reiteration of the Assembly's ability to merely 'recommend' steps, while the Security Council has the ability to make legally binding decisions.</p>

<p>Finally, as concerns it jurisdiction the Court finds there is no obstacle to its discretion to respond to the request of the General Assembly that can be found in the fact that "it will necessary have to interpret and apply the provisions of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)." (para. 46).</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">* * *</div>

<p>The Court then considers whether the question asked by the General Assembly was appropriate, but quickly determines it to be "clearly formulated," "narrow and specific." (para. 51). </p>

<p>In reviewing the language of the question, the Court also considers whether the General Assembly's determination that the declaration was made by the "Provisional Institutions of Self-Government of Kosovo" was binding on the Court in the determination of the facts. (paras. 51-56). The Court notes that some States had contested "[w]hether it was indeed the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government of Kosovo which promulgated the declaration of independence." (para. 52). Responding to this concern the Court holds that its ability to review what entity had actually made the declaration of independence remained unfettered. In this section, the Court also considers the relevance of a well-known domestic decision by the Canadian Supreme Court (para. 55 citing Reference by the Governor-General concerning Certain Questions relating to the Secession of Quebec from Canada ([1998] 2  S.C.R. 217; 161 D.L.R. (4th) 385;  115 Int. Law Reps. 536)). The Court finds that the question in the Canadian case deals with secession, and thus is "markedly different" from that in the present case.</p>

<p>The Court describes the facts almost exclusively on the basis of UN action. This is done in three sections dealing with, respectively, (i) UN Security Council Resolution 1244; (ii) the relevant events in the final status process prior to 17 February 2008; and (iii) the events of 17 February 2008 and thereafter. (paras. 57 to 77). Only scant attention is given to the actions of the representatives of the Kosovo people, except in the last of the three sections and almost no attention is given to the situation that the Kosovo people suffered at the hands of the Serbian authorities. </p>

<p>The Court then begins its legal analysis, which is divided into three parts, (paras. 78-121) commencing with an historical review of declarations of independence based on State practice during "the eighteenth, nineteenth and early twentieth centuries." (para. 79). This practice, the Court concludes, "points clearly to the conclusion that international law contained no prohibition of declarations of independence." (para. 78). With this determination the Court has essentially decided the question it was asked. </p>

<p>This is particularly evident in paragraphs in this section in which the Court considers the importance of self-determination, but dismisses it as it is "not necessary to resolve these questions in the present case." (para. 83). The failure to grapple with the issue of self-determination not only explains the Court's limited description of facts, but also indicates a tendency to shy away from controversial legal issues.</p>

<p>Moreover, the failure of the Court to consider the practice of States in the General Assembly, the body asking for the Advisory Opinion, in relation to this issue and similar issues concerning the independence of States would appear to be a significant omission. The practice and opinions of States in the General Assembly should likely have been relevant to determining the existence and interpretation of customary international law, which the Court was seeking to ascertain. </p>

<p>Having disposed of the central question, the Court then turns to the compatibility of Kosovo's declaration of independence with Security Council Resolution 1244 and the Constitutional Framework that had been promulgated by the UN Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). More space--thirty-six paragraphs (paras. 85-121)--is devoted to this consideration than to any other issue, in the Advisory Opinion.</p>

<p>The Court starts its discussion by recognizing the legally binding nature of Security Council resolutions. (para. 85). The consideration of Security Council resolutions as separate forms of international law--i.e. based on the Charter--although necessary, is a reminder of the limited nature of the Security Council's membership that makes its views and actions of less relevance to the formation of customary international law than those of the General Assembly.</p>

<p>The Court also considers the Constitutional Framework as part of "a specific legal order, created pursuant to resolution 1244 (1999)." (para. 89). As such the Court considers the compatibility of the declaration of independence with both with Resolution 1244 and the Constitutional Framework.</p>

<p>Considering Resolution 1244, the Court acknowledges that while the rules of interpretation of treaties (articles 31 and 32 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties) "may provide guidance, differences between Security Council resolutions and treaties mean that the interpretation of Security Council resolutions also require that other factors be taken into account." (para. 94). The Court also emphasizes that "Security Council resolutions can be binding on all Member States ... irrespective of whether they played any part in their formulation." (para. 94). </p>

<p>Consequently (subsection 1), the Court determines that "three distinct features of that resolution are relevant for discerning its object and purpose." (para. 96). First, the Court finds the UNMIK to be an "exceptional measure" because its authority superseded that of the "legal order in force at that time in the territory of Kosovo." (para. 97). Second, because UNMIK was established for humanitarian purposes "to bring about stabilization and reconstruction," it follows, according to the Court, that "[t]he purpose of the legal régime established under resolution 1244 (1999) was to establish, organize and oversee the development of local institutions of self-government in Kosovo under the aegis of the interim international presence." And third, the resolution "clearly establishes an interim régime" therefore "it cannot be understood as putting in place a permanent institutional framework in the territory of Kosovo." (para. 99).  In paragraph 100, the Court thus concludes that "the object and purpose of resolution 1244 (1999) was to establish a temporary, exceptional legal régime which, save to the extent that it expressly preserved it, superseded the Serbian legal order and which aimed at the stabilization of Kosovo, and that it was designed to do so on an interim basis." The logic of the Court appears somewhat circular: because an exceptional legal regime has been established, it is exceptional.</p>

<p>The Court also seems to rely excessively on the preference of the concerned actors, who will of course characterize their acts as legitimate. Perhaps the Court could have undertaken a more detailed review of the manifested actions and intentions of the concerned actors to determine in what capacity, and with what motivation, they were acting.</p>

<p>In a section entitled "[t]he question whether the declaration of independence is in accordance with Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) and the measures adopted thereunder," the Court considers whether the declaration of independence violated the Constitutional Framework. To make this determination the Court first has to decide whether the declaration of independence was promulgated by a body subject to the legal order of the Constitutional Framework, and consequently Resolution 1244. Again the Court seems to resort to the somewhat circular logic that those who adopted the declaration of independence, despite being virtually the same persons that sit in the Assembly of Kosovo, one of the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government, were not acting in that capacity. The Court arrives at this conclusion based on its interpretation of the views expressed by the drafters of the declaration of independence; evidence of their intention being found in the words and processes. </p>

<p>For example, the drafters of the declaration of independence referred to themselves as "[w]e, the democratically-elected leaders of our people . . ." instead of using the third person singular as they do in acts of the Assembly. (para. 107). Additionally, the Court draws attention to the fact that the declaration was signed by the President of Kosovo, who is not a member of the Assembly of Kosovo. (para. 107). Moreover, the Court finds significance in the fact that the Special Representative of the Secretary-General who had the power to annul acts of the Assembly remained silent on this act. The Court, however, appears to ignore the fact that the Special Representative has usually accepted without challenge acts promulgated by the Kosovo Assembly. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, "taking all factors together" the Court finds that "the authors of the declaration of independence ... did not act as one of the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government within the Constitutional Framework, but rather as persons who acted together in their capacity as representatives of the people of Kosovo outside the framework of the interim administration." (para. 109).</p>

<p>This finding would appear to provide national liberation movements around the world a basis for declaring the independence of territory and the persons who they represent as long as they are not acting--as will most often be the case--within the established legal order. Perhaps it is essential--although the Court declined to indicate this--that the persons declaring independence must be able to sustain the legitimacy of their representation of the people on whose behalf they claim to act. In the present case, however, the Court did not appear to require this.</p>

<p>After identifying the authors of the declaration of independence to have been acting outside the existing legal order created by Resolution 1244, the Court then considers whether their actions nevertheless violated Resolution 1244 and/or the Constitutional Framework. </p>

<p>As concerns Resolution 1244 the Court finds that it does not prohibit the declaration of independence principally because such a prohibition should have been made explicit. (paras. 113-119). Applied to Security Council resolutions concerning countries like Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, it would seem that the Court has strengthened the basis of these countries' arguments that vague language in Security Council resolutions does not create duties. The Court, however, appears to be attempting to avoid this issue of consistency, by claming that it must interpret Security Council resolutions on a "case-by-case basis." This failure to clarify general rules of interpretation does not contribute to developing a coherent set of rules of international law.</p>

<p>As concerns the Constitutional Framework, the Court finds that "the authors of the declaration of independence were not bound by the framework of powers and responsibilities established to govern the conduct of the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government." (para. 121). Again the basis of this finding is not clear in the two short paragraphs in which it is articulated, but it appears to rest on the self-reference of the drafters to being outside any legal order that would restrict them.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">* * *</div>

<p>Finally, a one paragraph conclusion reiterates that the Court finds that "the declaration of independence of 17 February 2008 did not violate general international law, Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) or the Constitutional Framework." </p>

<p>The operative paragraphs of the Advisory Opinion indicate that the Court voted unanimously to find it had jurisdiction, by nine to five that it should comply with the request, and by ten to four that "that the declaration of independence of Kosovo adopted on 17 February 2008 did not violate international law."</p>

<p>While the Court's Advisory Opinion will likely be an important point of reference for the representatives of groups of individuals seeking independence, it is unlikely to be remembered as one of the Court's better attempts to articulate and clarify the law. Instead, the Court seems to base a general principle of recognizing declarations of independence upon a shaky foundation of "case-by-case" determination without clearly articulating clear standards for future cases. </p>

<p>If law can contribute a degree of certainty to decision making processes, it appears that it has failed to do so in this case. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Nick Nyhart</strong> [President and CEO, <a href="http://www.publiccampaign.org">Public Campaign</a>]: "With just four Republican Senators in play on the DISCLOSE Act its <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/us-senate-fails-to-advance-campaign-finance-reform-bill.php">failure to reach closure</a> Wednesday was no surprise. The original intent of the legislation was to blunt the impact of the disastrous Supreme Court decision in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-205.pdf">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</a>. Unfortunately, it became a political football for Republicans and Democrats alike. <br />
                <br />
                While the transparency and disclosure provisions included in the bill would let the American people know who is trying to buy our elections, Congress should have been bolder. The American electorate is not angry about a few bad apples--they want to throw out the whole moldy barrel.<br />
                <br />
                Congress should pass some form of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:S3628:">DISCLOSE Act</a>, but it should also move forward with more comprehensive legislation too--the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:HR01826:">Fair Elections Now Act</a> (H.R. 1826, S. 752). This bipartisan legislation would allow candidates to run competitive campaigns for office on a blend of Fair Elections funds and small donations. With Fair Elections, candidates would be accountable to their voters, instead of the big money donors funding their campaigns. <br />
                <br />
                The legislation has the broad, bipartisan, and cross-caucus support of 157 U.S. House members and 23 U.S. Senators. Fearing the new forms of special interest political retaliation allowed under <u>Citizens United</u>, candidates for Congress will now have to spend even more time raising big donations and less time working for working Americans. <br />
                <br />
                It's important to know what big lobbying interests are funding elections, but wouldn't it be great if we never had to question the motives of our elected officials to begin with? It's time to make our government of, by, and for the people by passing the Fair Elections Now Act."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Eric Sterling</strong> [President, <a href="http://www.cjpf.org">The Criminal Justice Policy Foundation</a>]: "Thursday's <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/us-house-approves-bill-to-reduce-cocaine-sentencing-disparity.php">passage</a> of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:S1789:">Fair Sentencing Act</a> proved that I have been very wrong about this legislation.  I was wrong in not believing that fairness in sentencing, fairness for convicted African-American crack dealers, fairness for any criminal defendant, had any political traction.  I was wrong in believing that the intrepid coalition of sentencing reform advocates, civil liberties, civil rights and human rights supporters, and criminal justice reformers had failed to adequately sell the legislation to conservatives as a necessary refocus of the Department of Justice on high-level cocaine traffickers.</p>

                <p>I was sure that most House Republicans would fight this legislation. I doubted that the participation of Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL) and Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) in crafting the Senate bill -- carefully developed and brilliantly shepherded by Senator Richard Durbin (D-IL) -- would stifle the temptation for House Republicans to attack what was fundamentally a civil rights, civil liberties, criminal defense, drug policy reform bill, as a soft-on-drugs, soft-on-crime bill, as Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX) did so characteristically in his floor speeches. I was dumbfounded when former Judiciary Committee Chairman James Sensenbrenner (R-WI) spoke for of the bill, and realized when Rep. Dan Lungren (R-CA), former California Attorney General, spoke for the bill, that I had been completely wrong.<br />
                    <br />
                    I had been wrong about the House Democratic leadership. I would have bet money that they would never risk a potential GOP attack, along the lines made by Rep. Smith, upon Democrats who would vote for the bill, and therefore would not bring the bill to the floor. But with a voice vote and no roll call, Democrats are free from such attacks.  I would love for a good journalist or investigative political scientist to dig out the story of what really happened among the key players. Who actually spoke to whom? Was the letter from the 11 Senators (including 6 conservative Republicans) enough to defuse House Republicans? Did Senators call House Members? Did the Democratic leadership, in essence, do a whip check of the GOP? Where were Rep. Boehner, Rep. Cantor and other GOP conference leaders?  At what point did Lungren and Sensenbrenner get on board the compromise and why and for whom? </p>

                <p>For this long-awaited Act to be meaningful, we must see something in the U.S. Attorneys Manual or a memorandum from the Attorney General to the U.S. Attorneys that will change the practices of federal agents and prosecutors in choosing defendants and cases to investigate. My fear is that there will be no change. I believe informants -- those cutting deals and the paid professionals -- will simply change their stories about the quantities that were involved. Or perhaps agents will simply direct that there be another controlled buy or two. The egregious racial disparity among defendants will not change unless Justice changes its policies. We will not know if this law has any positive effect until the U.S. Sentencing Commission issues its FY 2011 report federal sentences.</p>

                <p>In addition, we need both retroactivity and resentencing to relieve thousands of Federal prisoners -- clearly minor offenders -- of the injustice they are enduring, and the immediate and complete reorganization of the Pardon Attorney's Office so that the President can quickly begin making the many grants of commutation of sentences that justice demands, and that reflect the political cover the GOP has extended to him.  The ball has been tossed to the President and the Attorney General. Will they change the practices of the Justice Department or will they content themselves with speeches? The record of the Drug Enforcement Administration and U.S. Attorneys in flouting the Attorney General regarding the October 19, 2009 memorandum on medical marijuana prosecutions in states with medical marijuana laws is very discouraging."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Fair Sentencing Act positive model for bipartisan reform</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Julie Stewart</strong> [President, <a href="www.famm.org">Families Against Mandatory Minimums</a>]: "Thursday, the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously approved a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:S1789:">bill</a> to reduce the infamous 100:1 sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine offenses. The Senate approved the bill in March. Today, President Obama finished the job by <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/obama-signs-bill-to-reduce-cocaine-sentencing-disparity.php">signing the bill</a>, ending a nearly 20-year campaign by sentencing reform advocates to undo this outrageous inequity in federal sentencing law.</p>

                <p>The word "historic" gets bandied around quite a bit in Washington, but it fits here. After all, the bill repeals a mandatory minimum sentence - for simple crack possession - for the first time since the Nixon Administration. Put another way, half of the staff at FAMM had not yet been born when Congress last reversed a mandatory minimum. And for those of us who have been engaged in the sentencing reform fight for a couple decades, bipartisan reform has been rare.  This is the first overwhelming, bipartisan victory on an issue like this in the past 15 years, especially so close to a contentious election.</p>

                <p>Members of Congress from both political parties deserve enormous credit for casting aside the politics of fear that mark so many debates over criminal justice reform. Some of us hope that this victory signals the beginning of a new spirit of bipartisanship that will lead to even more success for commonsense sentencing reforms. The first test, in my view, is whether Congress will finish the job on crack reform by applying the provisions of the new law retroactively.</p>

                <p>The reason why the crack reform bill sailed unanimously through both chambers of Congress was that there was no legitimate basis - public safety or otherwise - to maintain the disparity. Congress was not saying that times and circumstances change and thus so should the crack law. Rather, the members, including those members serving in 1986 when the disparity was created,  were quite candid in saying the law was a mistake, a blunder forced by the fear of a crack epidemic, following on the heels of the cocaine overdose of a nationally-recognized basketball star, Len Bias.</p>

                <p>Congress should be commended for fixing its 1986 mistake, but its correction will be incomplete if it is not applied to those whose lives were most directly impacted by the error. When an auto company discovers a dangerous defect in its cars, it corrects the flaw in future models and recalls the defective cars. Our government rightly expects corporations to fix their mistakes so that no one is unnecessarily harmed.</p>

                <p>The government should hold itself to the same standard, at least in situations where the harm to individuals and families is so great, and the government error is so clear. There will be those who say that applying the new law retroactively will consume significant law enforcement and judicial resources. Of course this is true - especially if done right, i.e. requiring a separate judicial review for every offender to ensure that only those who are not violent or otherwise do not represent a threat to society are let go.</p>

                <p>We know this is possible because it's happening right now. Beginning in March 2008, roughly 20,000 crack cocaine offenders became eligible to receive a reduction in their sentence because of changes made in the sentencing guidelines.  Their cases are now being reviewed and MANY offenders are being released. You might not have noticed because the sky is not falling.</p>

                <p>The amount of time that will be needed for U.S. Attorneys and federal courts judges to review all of these cases is not de minimis. District court caseloads are already high, and U.S. Attorneys have new threats to address.  But when these costs are compared with those borne by the individuals, families, and communities affected by 24 years of a ruinous and indefensible sentencing policy enforced and administered by these same U.S. Attorneys and judges, the costs seem relatively small.</p>

                <p>Congress was right to ditch the 100:1 crack-powder disparity. It now must finish the job by applying this overdue reform retroactively."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/faculty/profiles/jallohc">Charles Jalloh</a> of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law says that unless the AU and the ICC establish a proper dialogue, the logic of mutual gain for the ICC and Africa is at a risk of being undermined if not entirely lost....<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/jalloh.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>O</b></font>n July 27, 2010, the Assembly of Heads of States--the primary decision-making organ of the African Union (AU)--met in Kampala, Uganda for its 15th Annual Summit. As usual, the African leadership adopted some <a href="http://www.africa-union.org/root/UA/Conferences/2010/juillet/Summit_2010_b/doc/DECISIONS/Assembly%20AU%20Dec%20289-330%20%28XV%29%20_E.pdf">important decisions</a> and declarations on a range of political, economic, and social issues affecting the continent. The Assembly also adopted decisions regarding three justice-related questions that have been on its agenda for the past few years, namely: the International Criminal Court (ICC or the Court), the abuse of the principle of universal jurisdiction, and the pending trial in Senegal of former Chadian President Hiss&#0232;ne Habr&#0233; on allegations of torture.</p>

<p>Ironically--considering that the meeting took place in the same venue where barely over a month ago the ICC had held its first-ever Review Conference since the Rome Statute entered into force on July 1, 2002--the AU's latest decision regarding the ICC shows its growing discontent with the current trajectory of the Court's work in Africa; in particular, the sequencing of justice and peace in the Sudan. </p>

<p>Since July 2008, when the ICC Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo applied for an arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar Hassan Al Bashir, the AU has taken a progressively tougher stance against the Court. The latest Assembly decision continues that trend. It also begs the question when the current impasse between the Africa region and the Hague-based permanent international criminal tribunal would end. </p>

<p>Like a number of summit decisions adopted after July 2008, the AU Assembly's Kampala Decision underscored African governments' concerns about the negative impact of the ICC's arrest warrant for President Al Bashir on the peace processes in the Sudan; reiterated its previous decision that all 53 AU member states "shall not cooperate" with the Court in respect to the arrest and surrender of the Sudanese leader; expressed disappointment that the United Nations Security Council has failed to act on the AU's request to defer for one-year--in the interest of peace pursuant to <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Article 16</a> of the Rome Statute--the ICC proceedings against President Al Bashir; and, finally, urged African states to speak with one voice on the AU's November 2009 proposal to amend Article 16 of the Rome Statute. </p>

<p>The latter proposal, which will be considered in the meeting of all ICC States Parties that will be held in November 2010, stems from the AU's frustration with the Security Council over the repeated requests for a Sudan deferral which was first presented by African states in July 2008. Under the AU's amendment to Article 16, the UN General Assembly would be empowered to act on a deferral request should the Security Council fail to do so within six months. </p>

<p>The AU's Article 16 proposal is controversial because, among other things, it implicates not only the question of how to sequence justice and peace in ongoing conflict situations where international crimes are being committed, but it also reopens old debates about the nature, role, and legitimacy of Security Council (in)actions over issues of international peace and security under the Rome Statute as well as the foundational UN Charter. The proposal should therefore be expected to lead to a showdown when the issue comes up for consideration by the 111 ICC States Parties.</p>

<p>Unlike its earlier summit decisions relating to the Court, in the Kampala Decision, the AU Assembly also mentioned two issues worth highlighting. First, the AU requested that, in implementing the latest resolution, its member states "balance, where applicable, their obligations to the AU and their obligations to the ICC" (Decision, para. 6). Here, by effectively conceding a margin of appreciation in the implementation of its decision to the 30 AU States that also happen to be States Parties to the Rome Statute, the AU is probably responding to the widespread NGO criticism of its Decision on the Meeting of African States Parties to the Rome Statute taken at Sirte, Libya in July 2009 in which it first directed its members to ignore the ICC's arrest warrant for President Al Bashir. </p>

<p>Pro-ICC human rights activists, along with a few African states like Botswana and Ghana, subsequently suggested that the AU's Sirte decision was inconsistent with the obligation of African ICC States Parties to arrest and surrender suspects and accused persons requested by the Court, as per the cooperation regime contained in <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Part 9</a> of the Rome Statute. Unfortunately, such arguments were often made without meaningful analysis of the legal basis for the AU decision which was predicated on Article 98 of the Rome Statute.</p>

<p>Yet, it is far from clear whether, under Article 98, the ICC is even permitted to request its (African) States Parties to render President Al Bashir when his home state (Sudan) is not a party to the Court and he is ordinarily entitled to customary international law immunities before the national authorities of third states. Of course, the exception to this would be if there is a waiver of immunity or prior Sudanese consent for his arrest. That said, some scholars have suggested that the fact that the Security Council referred the Sudan situation to the ICC is sufficient to displace the applicable immunities. This is deemed to flow from the binding nature of <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter7.shtml">Chapter VII</a> of the UN Charter which is the legal basis for the referral. However, this position remains contested sitting, as it does, uncomfortably alongside the inherently consent-based character of the ICC and international law.</p>

<p>Second, though it has previously expressed dissatisfaction with the ICC Prosecutor's handling of the Sudan situation (especially the timing of the Al Bashir arrest warrant), the AU Assembly, for the first time, criticized Prosecutor Moreno-Ocampo personally. It accused him of "making egregiously unacceptable, rude and condescending statements" in relation to the Al Bashir case and in respect to "other situations in Africa" (Decision, para. 9). </p>

<p>While certain AU states are obviously upset with the ICC Prosecutor, the use of such language against Moreno-Ocampo is rather unfortunate. It advances neither the discourse in respect to the Sudan situation, nor the cause of justice demanded by the victims of the atrocities in Darfur that the African leadership has spent the past few years worrying about. On the other hand, in fairness to the AU leaders, the Prosecutor is known to have made more than a few simplistic and misleading political statements about complex legal and factual situations on the continent. These are bound to offend the African officials who already perceive him as playing a destructive political, rather than constructive prosecutorial, role to aid their peace-making efforts. Recognizing the potential damage to the Court's reputation, some respected scholars have condemned some of those statements. Worse, Sudanese NGOs have gone so far as to file pleadings before the Pre-Trial Chamber of the ICC asking it to review their propriety. </p>

<p>In any case, one might wonder whether, and if so why, such language was introduced in the Kampala Decision.  Could this step be at the behest of the majority of African states instead of only a few well-known pro-Sudan and anti-ICC hard liners such as Libya? Given the AU's preference for decisions based on consensus, if the language was supported by everyone, then the implication is that the AU's discontent with the Court has reached an entirely new fever pitch level. On the other hand, if the language was included because it was promoted by (or adopted in the presence of) only a few vocal African states, then it suggests a potential problem with internal AU procedures that must urgently be corrected for the AU Assembly to continue to be taken seriously outside the continent.     </p>

<p>But the most important signal of the AU's growing dissatisfaction with the ICC in the Kampala Decision was the Assembly's decision to reject, albeit for now, the Court's request to open a liaison office in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia - where the AU headquarters are located. The idea of such an office had been championed by civil society groups mainly over the course of the past year. Advocates hoped that the ICC, by opening up such an office in Addis Ababa, would help restore smooth relations with African governments and help bridge the obvious distance between it and the AU. The proposal was formally endorsed by a resolution of ICC States Parties in the period leading up to the First ICC Review Conference in Kampala.</p>

<p>Though the AU has some important and legitimate concerns with regard to the ICC (Prosecutor) which it should continue to try to address constructively, this decision suggests a new low in the relationship between the two sides. Recent meetings between high Court and AU officials suggest that the former is committed to engaging in a dialogue over the African concerns. But, by its decision to reject a liaison office, the African leadership suggests that it holds the opposite view. If this is correct, it is difficult to discern how and when the two sides might break the current deadlock over the Sudan.  The Darfur hot potato, which the Security Council essentially handed to the ICC through its Chapter VII referral in March 2005, has proven to be nothing more than a continual source of unwelcome and distracting heat for the fledgling judicial institution. </p>

<p>On a more positive note, the language of the Kampala Decision to the effect that the AU "[d]ecides to reject <em>for now</em>" (Decision, para. 8; emphasis added) does clearly leave some room for a change of heart on the part of African governments. Of course, a change of heart will probably only occur when relations improve between the ICC and the AU. While diplomatic and civil society initiatives are definitely underway to help speed up that process, both in Africa and elsewhere, short of pure speculation, it is hard to predict with any degree of certainty when this might happen.  </p>

<p>That said, as I have argued more fully <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1431130">elsewhere</a>, both Africa and the ICC have a mutual interest in engaging constructively with each other. From the perspective of the budding ICC, which today remains weighed down by the burden of hyper expectations of what it can realistically accomplish in a harsh sovereignty-conscious State-centric world, the reality is that Africa has been one of its most ardent supporters and the source of its current caseload. The continent is therefore an important partner, both for its immediate goal of achieving short term justice for victims in the five African situations currently under prosecutorial scrutiny and its long-term aspiration of helping "put an end to impunity" loftily stated in the preamble to the Rome Statute. </p>

<p>From the perspective of the AU, which is more than ever before preoccupied with the question of how to provide human security for war-weary Africans, the Court offers one mechanism through which it could address the scourge of impunity. But, due largely to its growing discontent with the actions of the ICC Prosecutor, the AU is currently actively considering the creation of a regional court to prosecute crimes committed in Africa. If done well, this is an obvious way of assuaging African government concerns about the selectivity and biased trajectory of international criminal justice. These include the potential prosecutions of important crimes, such as corruption and illegal takeovers of government, which are not prosecuted by the Court but are of particular interest to Africa. At the same time, given the extent of the political will and resources required for such an undertaking, an Africa-responsive ICC offers the promise of a more viable internationally supported mechanism through which to prosecute those deemed most responsible for planning and carrying out mass atrocities on the continent.  </p>

<p>Sadly, reading the AU Assembly's latest decision from Kampala--the same place where just weeks ago African States reiterated their commitment to the Rome Statute at the close of the Review Conference--suggests that the logic of mutual gain for the ICC and Africa is at a risk of being undermined if not entirely lost. It is to be hoped that the relevant parties, both on the Court and the AU side, will do what is necessary to engage in a good faith dialogue to resolve the current impasse. And resolve it soon. The victims of atrocities in Darfur and elsewhere in Africa deserve no less. </p>

<font size="3"><b>W</b></font>hile there have been major advancements in the prosecution of gender crimes internationally, the <a href="http://69.94.11.53/">ICTR</a> has been lax in adjudicating sex crimes, such as rape and sexual enslavement for the majority of its existence. <a href="http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/factsheets/Jallow.htm">Hassan Bubacar Jallow</a>, who filled the Office of the Prosecutor in 2003, sought to reinvigorate attention to gender crimes. While the Prosecutor's efforts were laudable, the Tribunal's impending closure, together with its dismal record of prosecuting gender crimes, makes it likely that Rwandan women will feel only a small sense of justice as a result of the Tribunal's work.</p>

<p>While the Tribunal failed to address the pervasive use of rape as a weapon of the Rwandan genocide during its first four years of existence, the indictment of a former <i>bougmestre</i>, or mayor, in <u> <a href="http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/cases/Akayesu/judgement/akay001.htm">Prosecutor v. Akayesu</a></u> for inciting sexual violence drew praise from the international community. <u>Akayesu</u> was a groundbreaking decision that defined rape under international law and declared sexual violence and rape to be crimes against humanity. Additionally, <u>Akayesu</u> was the first decision to include rape and sexual violence in the definition of genocide. Despite being a major victory for women, the subsequent paucity of indictments for gendered crimes weakened <u>Akeyasu</u>'s impact on the ICTR's prosecutions of sexual violence. </p>

<p>After <u>Akayesu</u>, the ICTR missed opportunities to obtain indictments for rape. In <u><a href="http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher,ICTR,,,404466007,0.html">Prosecutor v. Kajelijeli</a></u> the defendant was a <i>bougmestre</i> who allegedly conspired with subordinates to commit genocide, including the rape and assault of Tutsi women. Kajelijeli was convicted of genocide, but acquitted of the rape charges. Despite the likelihood that the rape charges would have been reinstated, the Prosecutor's Office missed the deadline for appeal.</p>

<p>A number of problems hindered the ICTR's prosecution of gender crimes. The Tribunal's location in Arusha, Tanzania, as well as the absence of widespread community outreach and education in Rwanda, meant that many Rwandan women were unaware of its existence and their right to redress. Further, stigmatization of rape in Rwanda meant that most women stated that they would report an incidence of sexual violence to a female investigator, but not to a male. However, until 1998, the ICTR employed only male investigators. Cultural nuances also hindered investigators, who had not been trained to recognize euphemisms and specific phrases used by Rwandan women to express sexual violence. For example, "he sat down with me" or "he married me," were used as euphemisms for rape. In some instances, words did not even exist in Kinyarwanda, one of Rwanda's official languages, to explain the sexual acts that had occurred. </p>

<p>Recent efforts by the Prosecutor's Office have led to an increase in the number of indictments that include rape allegations.  As a result of Prosecutor Jallow's efforts, including motions to amend indictments to add rape charges, there have been 17 cases that include allegations of sexual violence. It remains to be seen how many of these indictments will prove successful, as they are currently in progress. However, a recent success came in the <u><a href="http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/cases/Muhimana/judgement/annex3.pdf">Muhimana</a></u> [PDF] case, where the defendant was convicted of rape as an act of genocide and as a crime against humanity. The accused was found guilty of raping Tutsi women with the intent of degrading the entire Tutsi population. Most significantly, in charging Muhimana with rape as a crime against humanity, the court expanded the definition of rape as "non-consensual sexual intercourse," paying particular attention to the element of consent.</p>

<p>The court recognized that coercion was implicit when rape was prosecuted under theories of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. It held that the mechanical definition of rape, in which coercion was an element, did not reflect the realities of rape during times of conflict. The <u>Muhimana</u> court determined that the prosecution did not have to prove coercion, and that coercion would henceforth be presumed in cases of rape under international law. Although <u>Muhimana</u> is a victory for women's rights and enhances the ICTR's legacy, the repeated failure to prosecute rape and sexual assault limits the positive effects that these cases may have otherwise had. Further, the ICTR's impending closure limits opportunities to provide the actual victims with justice and redress.</p>

<p>To ensure that the recent changes in the ICTR positively impact victims, it is necessary to conduct community outreach and educate citizens about the ICTR's activities. By providing victims and witnesses with information about the outcomes of ICTR trials, citizens can share in the accomplishment of convicting perpetrators of genocide. Emphasizing the victim's role in achieving convictions would help to achieve redress for the wrongs committed.</p>

<p>Additionally, culturally-sensitive community education about rape, sexual violence, and associated stigma should be conducted. Such programs would inform communities that rape is not the victim's fault and could help change societal attitudes towards sexual violence. While it is likely that the success of community education programs will be limited due to the Tribunal's impending closure, at a minimum, these programs would provide victims of sexual violence with a source of comfort and reinforce that they were not at fault for the atrocities that they experienced. </p>

<p>It would be a tragedy if the ICTR were to fail to conduct community outreach and education about sexual violence in the final stages of its existence. While Prosecutor Jallow's measures to reinvigorate attention to gender crimes are laudable, the actual effect of such efforts will likely be limited due to the Tribunal's bleak track record in prosecuting sexual crimes. In addition, the ICTR's imminent closure may limit the effect of the Tribunal's renewed focus on crimes of sexual violence. While <u>Muhimana</u> is important for recognizing gendered crimes as violating international law, it will be of little meaning to Rwandan women unless community outreach is conducted. Despite the ICTR's poor track record in prosecuting gender crimes, it still has time to refocus its efforts and make a difference for victims of sexual violence in Rwanda. By educating Rwandans about sexual violence and informing communities about the ICTR's successes, the Tribunal will have reached its ultimate goal - providing justice and redress to the victims of the Rwandan genocide.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<hr height="1"><br />
<strong><font size="3">I</font></strong>n Appalachia, Coal is King. Coal-fired power plants provide the majority of the region's electricity, and it's difficult to find someone from the major coal states of West Virginia and Kentucky who doesn't have a close friend or relative involved in the coal industry. Coal provides power and jobs to the region, and politicians who attack the coal industry do so at their own risk. Nevertheless, there are significant challenges to the coal industry from regulatory agencies, such as the EPA, and in the form of legal challenges by environmental organizations. For instance, the Obama Administration has <a href="http://www.osmre.gov/resources/newsroom/news/archive/2009/113009.pdf">announced plans</a> [PDF] to undo changes to the Stream Buffer Zone rule that were made during the George W. Bush Administration, and the US Army Corps of Engineers has <a href="http://www.usace.army.mil/CECW/Documents/cecwo/reg/nwp/75_FR_34711_Suspension_of_NWP_21.pdf">suspended</a> [PDF] Nationwide Permit 21 grants - permitting discharge of dredged or fill material into waterways for surface mining activities - in the Appalachian Region. In the courts, the Sierra Club won a <a href="http://www.leagle.com/unsecure/page.htm?shortname=infdco20100203997">judgment</a> in the US District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia in February 2010 against Powellton Coal Company, and there is pending litigation related to the April 5, 2010, Upper Big Branch mining disaster.</p>

<p><img alt="CIMG1422.JPG" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/CIMG1422.JPG" title="Beckley, WV, demonstration mine" width="365" height="274" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" />The Coal Law Short Course covered all of these issues and more, and while the speakers uniformly represented coal companies and their interests, the emphasis was on diligent representation of the client. This often takes the form of strict adherence to legal and regulatory requirements, since the coal industry, as J. Thomas Lane (Bowles, Rice, McDavid, Graff &#38; Love) pointed out, is the most regulated industry in America. Compliance with safety, employment, and environmental regulations can be costly, but it's good business, particularly when repeated violations can lead to the loss of crucial permits. For the coal industry, however, the most basic legal issue is securing the property right to mine the coal.</p>

<p>Almost universally, first year law students learn in property law that <em>cuius est solum, eius est usque caelum et ad inferos</em> (for whoever owns the soil, it is theirs up to Heaven and down to Hell). This Latin phrase describes the principle of complete ownership in fee simple, but in reality, property rights are often severed between two or more owners. In the context of coal, a single piece of property might be split between the owner of the surface rights and the owner of the mineral rights. In more complex cases, one party might own the surface rights, another the oil and gas rights, and yet another the coal rights. Property law in the coal industry can be labyrinthine. Mining operations extend across hundreds of properties, property owners might have severed property rights decades prior, and deeds can be wrong or go missing.</p>

<p>Consequently, a company that wants to develop a coal seam must ensure that it owns the mineral rights for the property it wishes to mine. Where the property is owned in fee simple, ascertaining ownership is easy, but it becomes more difficult where property rights are severed. Researching deeds can be such an extensive undertaking that lawyers often prioritize, ensuring property rights in the area where mining will begin before turning to those sections to be mined later.</p>

<p>Once a coal company has confirmed ownership of mineral rights, it must ensure the right of access to the coal. Generally, mineral rights include the right of access, whether explicitly defined in the lease or deed or implied. The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals held in <u>Squires v. Lafferty</u>, 95 W.Va. 307, 121 S.E. 90 (W. Va. 1924), that the mineral owner may act in a way that places a "reasonable burden" on the surface owner and is "fairly necessary" for the extraction of the mineral. In practice, this means that the mineral owner may take reasonable measures necessary for extracting the mineral, such as the construction of mine shafts. There are limits on these rights, however. If a mine operator constructs a coal cleaning facility on the property, its right to use the facility is implied only for coal mined from that property, not for coal transported from other mines. Also, surface mining rights are almost never implied. As Lane pointed out, absent explicit provisions for surface mining in the lease, surface mining will almost never pass the "reasonable burden" test, even where it is "fairly necessary" to access the minerals. As with every aspect of the law, though, there are exceptions. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7334347710123898938&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Large v. Clinchfield Coal Co.</a>, the court implied surface mining rights where the land was rough and undeveloped, and reclamation processes would leave the land virtually undistinguishable from its prior condition. Courts have also been more willing to imply surface mining rights to leases signed when the parties could have "reasonably contemplated" the use of surface mining to extract the minerals.</p>

<p><img alt="CIMG1424.JPG" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/CIMG1424.JPG" title="Mingo County, WV, surface mine" width="365" height="274" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" />While Surface Mining often receives the most attention from regulators, the press, and environmental groups, emerging technologies in carbon capture and storage (alternatively, carbon capture and sequestration) promise to keep property lawyers busy for years to come. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is the injection of carbon dioxide, captured from coal-burning power plants, among other sources, into geological formations. This is analogous to the storage of oil and gas reserves, but is particularly attractive because of its environmental benefits (reduction in CO2 emissions) and potential for facilitating additional oil and gas extraction. On the property side, however, there are important questions as to who owns underground geological formations. Coal, oil, and gas companies would like to use empty mineral beds to sequester carbon, but there is an argument that mineral rights end when mining has ceased. Therefore, once mineral owners have extracted the coal, oil, or gas, they no longer have a right to the porous spaces for purposes of CCS.</p>

<p>CCS is still an emerging technology, and it is possible for the law to go either way on this issue. Previous cases involving the use of empty spaces have generally held that the mineral owner has a reasonable right of use. For instance, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2304517741344731764&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Ross Coal Co. v. Cole</a>, the US District Court held that a mine owner had the right to bring coal from one underground tract to another through underground passageways. However, it further held that the mine owner did not have the right to bring that coal to the surface through a mine shaft on property owned by the defendant Cole. With respect to CCS, the courts could either find use of porous spaces as attendant to the mineral owner's rights or as an interest which reverts back to the surface owner upon removal of mineral deposits.</p>

<p>Environmental groups and the coal industry have a mutual interest in resolving this uncertainty. The simple fact is that coal is still King in Appalachia, and it will continue to play a major role in America's energy future. CCS not only reduces the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere, but it can assist in extracting oil and gas reserves. When one considers that only 20% of all available oil is removed using current drilling technologies, this could be an environmentally sound method of increasing energy production in America. Environmentalists might argue that CCS technologies continue to rely on "dirty" rather than "clean" energy, and that money should be spent on renewable energy technologies. There's also the argument that sequestered carbon will be stored for hundreds or thousands of years, outlasting any company or regulatory scheme. These are all valid concerns, but they miss the forest for the trees. The shift to clean technology will not take place overnight, and even then, coal will remain an energy source so long as it's commercially viable. Until America has completely transitioned to renewable energy sources, it simply makes sense to mitigate the environmental impact of coal-fired power plants. Carbon sequestration does this, and it can provide good jobs to Americans at a cost that's spread across consumers (estimates place the cost of carbon sequestration at 17 cents per kW/h). However, companies won't invest in CCS facilities if the legal right to carbon sequestration is unknown. Congress and state governments need to take action and provide for a clear property right to porous spaces before decisions in the federal and state courts result in inconsistent laws across jurisdictions. While the coal industry would prefer to retain the right to porous spaces for purposes of carbon sequestration, nothing kills innovation like uncertainty, and any consistent standard would be an improvement.</p>

<p>It's important to act quickly. According to recent estimates, China is building two power stations every week, including one "clean" coal-fired plant each month. In contrast, the United States has only one integrated plant (power plant and CCS plant on same site), and it just opened in 2009. This is progress, but the United States needs to make a commitment to CCS technology. The knowledgebase is here, and American research centers, like the Natural Resource Analysis Center at WVU (full disclosure: former employer), have worked closely with Chinese companies on CCS technologies.</p>

<p>Coal is still a major part of America's energy supply and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. It is good sense, both for business and the environment, to invest in coal capture technologies that mitigate environmental damage, create new jobs, and potentially aid in extraction of current oil and gas reserves. However, this won't happen until Congress and state legislatures resolve property law issues so as to resolve uncertainty and encourage investment. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Zana Berisha and Kutjesa Nezaj, both 2010 graduates of the <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/academics/cile/llmprogram">Pitt Law LL.M.</a> program, are Kosovar citizens and write about the International Court of Justice's recent decision on their country's Declaration of Independence...<br />
<hr height="1"><br />
<strong><font size="3">W</font></strong>hen the International Court of Justice (ICJ) rendered its decision on the legality of Kosovo's Declaration of Independence on July 22, 2010, we had already returned to our home country of Kosovo after a wonderful year spent obtaining our LL.M. degrees at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law. Despite being happy to be home after a long time away, we felt anxious because the ICJ was deciding on the Declaration of Independence undertaken by us, the people of Kosovo.</p>

<p>To give context to the ICJ's July 22 opinion, we must discuss the events that led up to it. On February 17, 2008, the Kosovo Assembly approved the <a href="http://www.assembly-kosova.org/common/docs/Dek_Pav_e.pdf">Declaration of Independence</a> [PDF], which declared Kosovo an independent and sovereign state. The Declaration of Independence reflects the will of Kosovo's people for an independent, sovereign, democratic, secular, and multi-ethnic republic, guided by the principles of non-discrimination and equal protection under the law. Notably, it is also in full accord with the recommendations of UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari and his <a href="http://www.diplo.de/diplo/de/Europa/Suedosteuropa/Downloads-und-Dokumente/Ahtisaari-Plan.pdf">Comprehensive Proposal for the Kosovo Status Settlement</a> [PDF]. </p>

<p>In response to Kosovo's Declaration of Independence, Serbia filed a <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/141/15022.pdf">request</a> [PDF] for an ICJ advisory opinion at the United Nations on August 15, 2008 on the question: "Is the unilateral declaration of independence by the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government of Kosovo in accordance with international law?" On September 30, 2008, the United Nations General Assembly granted the Serbian request. All UN member states then had the right to submit written statements to the ICJ in which they provided their position on the legality of the approval of the Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) by the Kosovo Assembly. By the submission deadline of April 17, 2009, 35 UN member states had submitted written statements. Public hearings in the ICJ began on December 1, 2009, and those states that had submitted written statements were permitted to orally present their positions. Kosovo and Serbia also submitted their statements and presented their oral arguments.</p>

<p>Oral proceedings ended on December 11, 2009, and until the issuance of the ICJ advisory opinion on July 22, 2010, no one was sure of what the court's opinion would be. Naturally, each involved party, particularly Kosovo and Serbia, hoped that the ICJ opinion would be in its favor. Based on previous ICJ rulings, however, most observers believed that this particular question would be decided neutrally, with the ICJ trying to satisfy the interests of both parties. </p>

<p>As a result, when ICJ President, Justice Hisashi Owada, read the Court's <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/141/16010.pdf">opinion</a> [PDF] holding that the UDI does not violate international law, the involved parties were surprised that the Court ruled firmly in favor of Kosovo. For Kosovo, the ICJ opinion acknowledges that its declaration of independence is in accord with international norms. It is also symbolic of what Kosovo's people believe is a just and proper world opinion regarding their long struggle for freedom and independence. States that had already recognized Kosovo's independence welcomed the decision and called on other states to recognize her, as well. States that have withheld recognition now have legal justification to recognize Kosovo as an independent and sovereign state. After achieving the necessary number of recognitions, Kosovo will become a UN member state, and be eligible to join the European Union. To Kosovars, it was particularly important that the Justices upheld the UDI with 10 votes in favor and 4 against, representing more than a simple majority of the justices. The 10-4 decision represents a strong endorsement of Kosovo's legal right to independence from the highest international court.</p>

<p>Not all reactions to the ICJ's opinion were positive. States that had opposed Kosovo's independence maintained their <a href="http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=118453">position</a> on non-recognition, arguing that the opinion is narrowly drawn and speaks only to the legality of the UDI rather than to its legal consequences, such as the creation of the new state. Serbian representatives at the ICJ appeared to be disappointed with the opinion's support of Kosovo's position, particularly given its specificity, and declared that Serbia will continue its current policy of treating Kosovo as Serbian territory.</p>

<p>For states that have not yet recognized Kosovo's independence, the ICJ's decision raises the troubling question of whether the case of Kosovo can be used as precedent for other regions seeking independence. However, the drafters of Kosovo's Declaration of Independence foresaw this concern, and the preamble of the UDI contains a provision stating that, due to the circumstances in which it found itself during the dissolution of Yugoslavia, Kosovo is a special case and should not serve as precedent for other peoples. Furthermore, Kosovo has been treated differently by the rest of the international community since the beginning of Yugoslavia's collapse and especially during the Kosovo conflict in 1998-1999. </p>

<p>As part of the former Yugoslav Federation (until 1989), Kosovo was a constituent part of Yugoslavia and had the right to self-determination and declaration of independence. In 1990, Serbia adopted a new constitution that fully abolished the autonomy of two Yugoslav provinces, Kosovo and Vojvodina, and as early as 1992, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) verification mission in Kosovo voiced deep concern about escalating violence and human rights violations in that province. After the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) declined to give its consent to an extension of the OSCE mission's mandate, the United Nations Security Council expressed deep concern in <a href="http://www.un.org/peace/kosovo/93sc855.htm">Resolution 855</a> (1993) about the SFRY's position and called upon it to reconsider. Finally in March 1999, NATO became actively involved in attacking Serbian military targets in order to end the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Kosovo. We believe that these actions by the international community, and particularly NATO's involvement, give Kosovo the status of a special case. Moreover, it is our opinion that the ICJ will decide the legality of future declarations of indepence by taking into consideration the entire body of facts particular to each case. </p>

<p>We are of a similar opinion to Marko Attila Hoare, the Section Director for the European Neighborhood of the Henry Jackson Society, who <a href="http://www.henryjacksonsociety.org/stories.asp?pageid=49&id=1667">argued</a> that democratic societies should not fear "separatism," and that only those states aware of their non-democratic nature should fear that people living under their rule may wish to separate. For now we can only wait to observe how the world will react to future declarations of independence elsewhere. It is simply unpredictable. </p>

<p>As for Kosovo and its citizens, the day of the ICJ ruling will remain the day when Kosovo's people made a mark on international history. On July 22, 2010, the right of Kosovo's people to independence became internationally validated. Next to the Declaration of Independence on February 17, 2008, Kosovars will celebrate the day of the ICJ's ruling as the second most important day in Kosovo's history.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Government of Kosovo and its allies have stated that the creation of the State of Kosovo did not violate international law and, as such, it constitutes a unique case which cannot be seen as a precedent for other frozen conflicts in the world. However, a great opposition from Serbia, Russia, and other countries alleged that creation of the State of Kosovo was contrary to international law.</p>

<p>In response to a request made by Serbia, the ICJ on 22 July 2010 <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/141/15987.pdf?PHPSESSID=bff0e1d5b4f09c3d9e75afaa19917af4">concluded</a> that the declaration of independence of Kosovo adopted on 17 February 2008, did not violate general international law, <a href="http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N99/172/89/PDF/N9917289.pdf?OpenElement">Security Council resolution 1244</a> or the <a href="http://www.unmikonline.org/constframework.htm">Constitutional Framework</a>. Consequently, the adoption of that declaration did not violate any applicable rule in international law (p.43, para.122 of the opinion).</p>

<p>Since the (il)legality of Kosovo's independence and its (non)recognition had been widely debated, the ICJ clarified the concerns of Serbia and other states regarding the compatibility of Kosovo's declaration of independence with international law. Even though the Advisory Opinion of the ICJ is not a legally binding decision, it is general understanding and practice that findings of the World Court are to be respected. In this regard, most democratic countries expected that Serbia would take into consideration the answer of the Court to the question that Serbia had formulated, and would recognize the new reality for the benefit of its people and neighborhood policy.</p>

<p>However, Serbia--mainly by criticizing the narrow approach taken by the Court in answering the question on the legality of Kosovo's declaration of independence--continues to be destructive to the overall development of the Balkan countries and their integration into the European Union and NATO.</p>

<p>Another critical approach concerning the ICJ opinion in the case of Kosovo has recently been expressed by Dr. Curtis Doebler in his article <a href="/forum/2010/07/the-icj-kosovo-independence-ruling-an-uncertain-precedent.php">"The ICJ Kosovo Independent Opinion: Uncertain Precedent"</a>.  According to Dr. Doebler "the failure of the International Court of Justice to grapple with the issue of self-determination not only explains the Court's limited description of facts, but also indicates a tendency to shy away from controversial legal issues". Further, Dr. Doebler stated that the opinion of the Court in the case of Kosovo is "unlikely to be remembered as one of the Court's better attempts to articulate and clarify the law".</p>

<p>The author, however, believes that before making concrete conclusions as to narrow and concise interpretation adopted by the Court in the Advisory Opinion it is essential to assess the scope of the question put before the Court and to consider the reasons why the authors of the question (Serbia) chose such a formulation. Based on these considerations one can draw conclusions as to whether indeed the ICJ neglected to produce an accurate answer, and whether there is any deficiency in this regard.</p>

<p>Apart from the substantial arguments presented at the ICJ, one of the main debates during the oral hearings was focused on the formulation of Serbia's question. The question of whether the Unilateral Declaration of Independence by the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government of Kosovo is in accordance with international law was highly criticized by the "authors of Kosovo's declaration of independence" and other states that supported Kosovo at the ICJ.</p>

<p>The question as formulated by Serbia asked the Court to assess only the rules in international law regarding declarations of independence and whether Kosovo's declaration of independence complies with those rules, whether this act was adopted by the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government of Kosovo, and whether there was any prohibition pursuant to the UN Resolution 1244, and the Constitutional Framework, that would make that declaration contrary to these documents.</p>

<p>It was argued that such a narrow question would create a deficient understanding of the events which led to the declaration of independence of Kosovo. However, Kosovo--more than Serbia--was interested in assessing the statehood criteria because the state of Kosovo was not created in the isolated act of the declaration of independence. The creation of the State of Kosovo has been indispensably linked to a continual oppression of its people, which created the necessity, and the legal basis for its later secession. Even though the discussion on the legal basis of Kosovo's self-determination is outside the scope of this essay, there are sufficient legal arguments in doctrine, case law, and state practice to justify the secession of Kosovo.</p>

<p>Serbia--irrespective of existing general knowledge of the atrocities and continual oppression committed against Kosovar Albanians since 1989, the violent abolishment of Kosovo's autonomy in 1989, and the ethnic cleansing and acts of genocide committed during the 1998-1999 conflict--tried to direct the ICJ to answer only with regard to the legality of the declaration of independence of Kosovo. In other words, Serbia asked the ICJ Judges to read only those documents after 1999, without taking into account the events which led to that declaration of independence. In its oral presentation, Crawford, in explaining the scope of the question, stated that "with this question Serbia wants to assess the legality of Kosovo's independence as at 17 February 2008; in short, Serbia wants this Court to condemn the Declaration of<br />
Independence in isolation, and to condemn as such" (see CR 2009/32, p.46, para.1, Oral Hearings held on 10 December 2009).</p>

<p>Due to the formulation of the question, the states--either in support of Serbia or Kosovo--presented their arguments outside the scope of the question. Most states argued about the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the principle of "remedial self-determination" and territorial integrity, the Constitution of Serbia, and the recent political and social developments such as the successful implementation of the <a href="http://www.unosek.org/unosek/en/statusproposal.html">Ahtisaari Plan</a> in Kosovo's favor or the criticism of a weak and unstable territory in defense of Serbia. The debate during the oral hearings therefore created even more hope between scholars and practitioners that the Court would in terms of assessing the statehood of Kosovo by going beyond the scope of the question.</p>

<p>However--even though all interested parties presented their arguments for and against the principle of territorial integrity, self-determination, and the dissolution of Yugoslavia--since the question did not require assessing the legality of Kosovo's statehood, the ICJ Judges stated that "the Court considers that is not necessary to resolve the above questions in the present case" (p.31, para.83). The Court further clarified the scope of the question:<br />
<blockquote>In the present case, the question posed by the General Assembly is clearly formulated. The question is narrow and specific; it asks for the Court's opinion on whether or not the declaration of independence is in accordance with international law. It does not ask about the legal consequences of that declaration. In particular, it does not ask whether or not Kosovo has achieved statehood. Nor does it ask about the validity or legal effects of the recognition of Kosovo by those States which have recognized it as an independent State. The Court notes that, in past requests for advisory opinions, the General Assembly and the Security Council, when they have wanted the Court's opinion on the legal consequences of an action, have framed the question in such a way that this aspect is expressly stated (see, for example, Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1971, p. 16 and Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 2004 (I), p. 136). (p.20, para.50).</blockquote><br />
If one may argue that the Court could have asked Serbia to reformulate the question, as it has previously done in cases of inadequately formulated questions (see for example Interpretation of the Greco-Turkish Agreement of 1 December 1926 (Final Protocol, Article IV), Advisory Opinion, 1928, P.C.I.J., Series B, No. 16), the Court clarified that even though the question is narrow and specific, it was however acceptable and it was a legal question (p.12, para.25).</p>

<p>The very fact that Serbia requested the ICJ to clarify the compatibility of Kosovo's declaration of independence with international law sets certain reservations as to criticism towards the ICJ for not providing the criteria and guidance for other isolated conflicts in the world. The Court answered the question that was asked. It was not for the Court to elaborate on the current developments of secession, self-determination, and its possible consequences. The examination of the Advisory Opinion shows that the case of Kosovo has been considered a unique and special case, which has to be seen from the perspective of an international peace agreement of the UN resolution, rather than from the perspective of an ordinary secessionist case.</p>

<p>It is debatable why Serbia formulated such a question, and what their initial intention was. Nevertheless, when Serbia asked for the Advisory Opinion of the ICJ, the Foreign Minister of Serbia Vuk Jeremic <a href="http:// www.euroasiareview.com">stated</a> that "whatever the ICJ decides, Serbia will not recognize Kosovo." Certainly, this position remained unchanged after the ICJ concluded that the adoption of the Kosovo declaration of independence did not violate any applicable rule of international law. It is important to note the political statement of the Foreign Minister of Serbia, given that it was made even before the ICJ had handled its Advisory Opinion. </p>

<p>The foregoing observations illustrate that the intention of Serbia--by asking the ICJ for its opinion--was probably not to assess the statehood criteria, but rather to slow down the recognition of Kosovo and to create as many doubts as possible vis a vis the legality of Kosovo's independence, as far as international law is concerned.</p>

<p>The question of whether Kosovo constitutes a precedent for other isolated conflicts in the world was raised even before Kosovo declared its independence. Furthermore, it is a misuse of the Advisory Opinion of the ICJ by claiming that ICJ has given a "green light" for other secessionist movements. Indeed, the very fact that ICJ was not asked and did not answer the issue of the statehood of Kosovo, shows that it cannot be used as a legal argument for any other secessionist movements.</p>

<p>While it is impossible to assess here all the differences between Kosovo and other groups of people seeking secession and independence, Marko Attila Hoare proposes what can be the consequences of the Kosovo case in his article <a href=" http://greatersurbiton.wordpress.com ">"The ICJ's ruling on Kosovo sets a precedent that is dangerous only for tyrants and ethnic cleansers."</a> It should be added that even before the case of Kosovo, there existed enough references which could be invoked by groups of people struggling for their independence. An example of this could be seen in the creation of the state of Bangladesh without the consent of the state of Pakistan, and even with the intervention and support from India in 1971. There are a considerable amount of cases where the continual oppression of a group of people by the state has led to secession and the creation of a new state, and there is enough support in doctrine and case law to do so. With regard to the principle of territorial integrity the ICJ found that Kosovo did not violate the principle of territorial integrity, from the perspective of current existent international law. The Court further stated that "the scope of the principle of territorial integrity is confined to the sphere of relations between states" (see p.30, para.80), but not as general prohibition of internal developments.</p>

<p>Thus, the case of Kosovo certainly contributes to the raising of awareness of human rights and their implications on the concept of territorial integrity and the sovereignty of states. Hence, for all those states that continually oppress their people, Kosovo--when grouped with other cases--can be used as a legal argument for secession. At the same time, it would be poor reasoning to generalize that the creation of the State of Kosovo and the ICJ Advisory Opinion on Kosovo can be used as an argument to justify any secession without further analysis of the circumstances of each concrete case.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist Andrea Prasow, senior counter-terrorism counsel at Human Rights Watch, says that the players constituting the military commission that tried Ibrahim al Qosi in Guantanamo last week created their own "mini-justice system" to replace the broken system they had originally been handed....<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forumy/andreaprasownew.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>L</b></font>ast week at Guantanamo, while much of the media's attention was focused on the trial of Canadian Omar Khadr, two other less-noticed trials were also underway, both of them for Ibrahim al Qosi, a Sudanese man who once worked as a cook and driver for Osama bin Laden. One of al Qosi's trials was public and that trial looked like a victory for the Obama administration, which is hoping to legitimize the use of military commissions. But al Qosi's other trial - the one that really mattered - was secret, and it was a demonstration of how broken the military commission system is.</p>

<p>Al Qosi pled guilty to the crime of providing material support for terrorism, making him the first person that the Obama administration has successfully prosecuted in a military commission. Al Qosi's public trial was, quite literally, a show trial. It had the trappings of a trial, but its verdict had no meaning. Al Qosi pled guilty to the crimes of providing material support for terrorism and conspiracy to provide material support for terrorism, and signed a statement detailing the logistical support he had provided bin Laden and al Qaeda.  The military jury was carefully questioned for bias by the judge, prosecution, and defense; challenges were raised; and the jury was presented with evidence and advised of the law. In the end, after deliberating for an hour and 20 minutes, the jury issued its sentence, sentencing al Qosi to 14 years in prison, on top of the eight and half years he had already spent in US custody.</p>

<p>But the jury's sentence was irrelevant. Al Qosi's real trial was secret.  The judge, counsel, defendant, and the Convening Authority (the Department of Defense official in charge of military commissions) had already agreed on what sentence al Qosi would serve. They had also agreed that the sentence would be kept secret, not only from the jury but also from the public.  The news outlet Al Arabiya has reported that al Qosi will only serve two more years before he is repatriated back to his native Sudan.  If true, the sentence is a stunning victory - for the defense.</p>

<p>It is difficult to convey the bewilderment that even I - a seasoned observer and former military commissions defense lawyer - experienced watching these events unfold in Guantanamo last week.  I was amazed as defense counsel vigorously urged the jury to sentence al Qosi to the minimum sentence the judge said they could issue - 12 years - instead of the maximum sentence allowed by the judge - 15 years.  The prosecution in turn argued that al Qosi deserved the maximum 15-year sentence, although it put on virtually no evidence other than testimony by a special agent with the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) about the structure of al Qaeda.  Even the jury members must have wondered why they had been called down to the island to make such narrow decision.  The observers frantically flipped through the rulebook for military commissions - the one that had been issued only a few months ago - and confirmed that the charges have no minimum sentence, and the maximum sentence is life imprisonment. </p>

<p>Why the range of 12-15 years then?  The cynical observer would think it was to ensure the prosecution was able to celebrate a harsh sentence.  I'm not sure what other kind of observer there could have been at these proceedings.</p>

<p>Of course, the jury members, unlike the media and observers, had no idea that al Qosi had a prearranged sentence agreement. They also did not know that the prosecution's expert on al Qaeda - NCIS Special Agent Robert McFadden - was actually one of al Qosi's key interrogators. Only once they left the island would they have discovered that their service was moot, and was intended to be all along. </p>

<p>The proceedings had begun on an even stranger note.  At the start of the hearing that was supposed to lead to sentencing, the parties jointly requested an order from the judge, Air Force Lt. Colonel Nancy Paul.  It seems an integral term of al Qosi's plea bargain is that he not be kept in isolation following sentencing, and instead be permitted to stay in the communal-living camp at Guantanamo called Camp 4, where he has resided for several years.  According to the prosecution, as of the day prior to the hearing, the authorities in Guantanamo had declared that they intended to move al Qosi to isolation as soon as he was sentenced. </p>

<p>The prosecution and the defense both implored the judge to order the authorities to keep al Qosi in Camp 4, claiming that the (secret) written plea agreement virtually required it.  The prosecutor stated that it was the US government's "promise" to keep him in Camp 4 and that there was no regulation or law that prohibited it.  Judge Paul accordingly did issue an order, holding that the term was "crucial" and "a substantial factor" in the defendant's agreement to plead guilty.  She said that failure to place al Qosi in Camp 4 or comparable conditions (which do not currently exist) would nullify the plea agreement.</p>

<p>Several hours later, as the case was well into jury selection, the prosecution requested a private meeting with the defense and judge, and the trial was suddenly recessed, not to start again for another two days.  Rumor had it that the Department of Defense did not appreciate the judge's order.  So when proceedings resumed, the prosecutor began by repeatedly apologizing for having misspoken; defense counsel agreed that al Qosi had all along known that he might not end up in Camp 4; and Judge Paul revised her order to say that she "highly recommend[ed]" that al Qosi be placed in Camp 4, but that failure to do so would not nullify the plea agreement.  She noted that the Convening Authority had agreed to defer imposition of al Qosi's sentence for 60 days to give him (yes, al Qosi himself) time to negotiate with the Guantanamo authorities, as well as for US Southern Command to create a policy that would permit him to serve his time in Camp 4.  The deferral, the prosecutor asserted, was "an act of grace" by the Convening Authority but in no way represented any obligation.  What was the lynchpin of the plea agreement two days earlier had been converted into a footnote.</p>

<p>Where al Qosi will serve his sentence remains unclear. Perhaps he will be free so soon that it hardly matters.  It is difficult to assess what really happened without knowing the terms of the plea bargain but it appears that all parties - prosecution, defense and judge - wanted so badly for the agreement to be accepted that they were comfortable setting aside anything that got in the way, including rumored refusal by the Defense Department to comply with the court order.</p>

<p>After sentencing, I found myself having dinner a few feet away from a curious gathering.  Judge Paul was scheduled to retire the following day (technically, to begin "terminal leave" on her way to military retirement).  The judge, defense counsel, prosecution counsel, members of the clerk's office, court reporters, and others all enjoyed dinner, replete with wine and gifts for the judge.  They had a lot to celebrate.  Together, they had created their own mini-justice system. The one they were given was so broken that they simply couldn't operate within its parameters.  The prosecution walked away with a political success - a 14-year sentence for a man who cooked for al Qaeda; the defense likely negotiated a dream deal for their client; and the judge walked into retirement knowing that she had closed the chapter on another military commission case. </p>

<p>As Judge Paul said before closing the proceedings, "We have made law, and we have made history."</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brett Stark, Harvard Law School '12, interned with the <a href="http://www.acri.org.il/eng/">Association for Civil Rights in Israel</a> (ACRI). He writes about the virtues of organizations that promote the rights of all rather than the interests of any particular group...<br />
<hr height="1"><br />
<font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>srael, the West Bank and Gaza remain at the center of one of the world's most intense and divisive international political conflicts. Amidst this maelstrom Israel attempts to live up to its values as a Jewish democracy, the first and only one of its kind in the history of the world. Israel's partner in this seemingly quixotic task is a glut of NGOs; Israel has one of the highest concentrations of NGOs anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>This summer, I performed comparative legal research at the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI), Israel's oldest and largest human rights organization. Unlike virtually every other non-governmental organization (NGO) in Israel and the Palestinian territories, ACRI does not advocate on behalf of a particular party. Instead, ACRI is committed to Israeli democracy per se, and thus strives to uphold the democratic rights of all people under Israel's jurisdiction. ACRI's mandate makes it a sorely needed, and unfortunately rare, institution within Israeli civil society.</p>

<p>I experienced the need for a balanced approach to civil liberties during a trip to Hebron, in the West Bank. Hebron encapsulates many of the most intractable issues fueling the Arab-Israeli conflict, a place where religious Jews live behind Israeli-army guarded fences in an area otherwise entirely inhabited by Palestinians. As an American Jew, I was permitted into the Jewish area and soon found myself eating tea biscuits in the kitchen of an elderly British-Jewish man who spoke of the international community's fundamental misunderstanding of Israel. Only a few minutes later, on what was literally the "other side of the fence," I sat in the living room of a Palestinian man, drinking coffee and listening to him tell me about the time his son was hit by a Molotov cocktail.</p>

<p>On each side of the fence, murals painted on the walls told drastically different stories about the history of Hebron and the condition of those who live there. On the Jewish side, paintings of Talmudic-era Jews describe a Jewish return to Hebron and modern Arab attacks on Jews. On the Palestinian side, the graffiti on the buildings accuses Jews of stealing Palestinian land. In the middle, separating those on one side of the fence from those on the other, are the Israeli soldiers, mostly young men in their twenties.</p>

<p>In talking with both Jewish and Arab residents of Hebron, I became more convinced than ever of the importance of an organization that brings all three of these disparate factions of Israeli society - Palestinians, Jews, and soldiers - under one democratic umbrella.  In fact, in 2010 alone, ACRI spoke out on behalf of all three: religious Jews, Palestinian Arabs and the Israeli army.</p>

<p>ACRI's defense of the right to counsel, essential to any democracy, is illustrative. In May of this year, ACRI appealed to Israel's Attorney-General in the case of Amir Makhoul, an Arab activist in Israel accused of meeting with Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group. Makhoul, the director of an Arab charity, was detained for over ten days without being permitted to meet with his lawyer. ACRI's response was unequivocal, <a href="http://www.acri.org.il/eng/story.aspx?id=723">writing</a> in its appeal to the Attorney-General that "A suspect's right to meet with a lawyer is a basic constitutional right, serving as a critical guarantee that his or her investigation is fair and that due process rights are protected."</p>

<p>Compare Makhoul's case with that of Chaim Pearlman, a Jewish activist. In July, Mr. Pearlman was arrested on suspicion of murdering four Palestinians. Like Makhoul, Mr. Pearlman was arrested and denied the right to meet with his lawyer. ACRI, again appealing to the Attorney-General, did not waver in its commitment to constitutional principles. Advocating on Pearlman's behalf, ACRI <a href="http://www.acri.org.il/eng/Story.aspx?id=754">asserted</a>,  "The right of a suspect to meet with a lawyer is a basic constitutional right, one that guarantees a fair investigation and that [promotes] the safeguarding of the detainees' rights...Furthermore, preventing a meeting with a lawyer...creates a substantial risk for eliciting false confessions and as a result, distorted justice."</p>

<p>Finally, in June ACRI came to the defense of a film supporting the Israeli army, at a time when the army was perhaps at the nadir of its popularity. In the aftermath of the "Freedom Flotilla" incident, an American-Israeli commentator made a parody entitled "We Con the World," insinuating that the motivations of the members of the flotilla were dishonest and therefore that the Israeli army's actions were justified. YouTube quickly pulled the video on alleged copyright grounds, to which ACRI <a href="http://www.acri.org.il/eng/story.aspx?id=734">responded</a> that the video was within the legal parameters of "fair use," and that "freedom of expression also applies to satire and parody, and these formats must be protected both online and offline."</p>

<p>It is the presence of fundamental differences that make a balanced position on basic civil rights issues a prerequisite to both a functioning Israeli democracy and a resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The Makhoul and Pearlman cases, as well as the YouTube controversy, reflect ACRI's much-needed insistence on democratic equality within a complex environment of extreme conflict and difficult political choices. ACRI's equality-centric approach is modeled directly from the American Civil Liberties Union, which has in turn <a href="http://www.acri.org.il/eng/story.aspx?id=702">called</a> ACRI "our sister organization." Those truly interested in forging a viable, democratic Israel should recognize that democratic principles are fundamentally impartial. The same rights must protect both Arabs and Jews. It is the only option for the Middle East's strongest yet most beleaguered democracy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Electronic Signatures: Ballot Access Meets the Internet</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Mark Brown, holder of the Newton D. Baker/Baker and Hostetler Chair at Capital University School of Law, says that more states should follow Utah's lead in allowing electronic signatures to be used when petitioning to include candidates on election ballots...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/forumy/mbrown.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>T</b></font>he Utah Supreme Court ruled earlier this summer (<a href="http://www.utcourts.gov/opinions/supopin/Anderson7062210.pdf">Anderson v. Bell</a> [PDF], No. 20100237 (June 22, 2010)), that the <a href="http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/archives/ulc/fnact99/1990s/ueta99.htm">Uniform Electronic Transactions Act</a> (UETA), a law enacted by forty-seven states, applies to elections.  Utah thus became the first state to specifically recognize that candidates can gather "signatures" from voters electronically.</p>

<p>	Like Utah, many states condition ballot access on candidates collecting voters' signatures.  Numbers vary, but these signature collection requirements are generally arduous and beyond the means of most citizens.  </p>

<p>	Of course, that is the whole point.  Incumbents write ballot access requirements to protect their jobs.  They want to make it as difficult as constitutionally possible for challengers to qualify.  Forcing circulators to stand in the snow and rain to manually gather thousands of signatures is a pretty good deterrent.  On top of that, election officials commonly disqualify scores of illegible, hand-written signatures.<br />
 <br />
	The UETA solves these problems.  In place of traditional hand-written signatures, the UETA allows consumers to create accounts using unique personal information.  This bundle of information - for example, a credit card number and mailing address - qualifies as an acceptable, enforceable "signature" under the UETA.  Consequently, people can now pay bills, register cars, and pay taxes without ever putting pen to paper.</p>

<p>Application of the UETA to ballot access makes perfect sense.  Electronic signatures are gathered on candidates' web pages.  Supporters enter unique identifying information, including their names and addresses.  In the Utah case, the candidate also required the last four numbers from supporters' driver licenses.  This unique information, all electronically stored, acts as a signature.  So long as the "security procedure" requirements of the UETA are satisfied - something businesses do every day - one can be confident that signatures are genuine and unique.  All elections officials need to do is certify that signers are registered.</p>

<p>	But won't electronic signatures facilitate fraud?  Supporters, after all, could simply open multiple accounts and "sign" repeatedly.   The Utah Supreme Court noted that the same risk exists with hand-written signatures.  People can always sign false names and addresses. If anything, electronic signatures minimize this risk because, as pointed out by the Utah Supreme Court, "an electronic signature incorporates readily verifiable personal, but not-public, information." <br />
 <br />
The Utah Supreme Court's logic makes sense.  The drafters of the UETA recognized that there are always risks.  Still, they felt that the benefits of electronic signatures outweighed them.  The UETA thus broadly replaces all laws requiring hand-written signatures:  "If a law requires a record to be in writing, an electronic record satisfies the law."  It makes no exception for transactions with government and no exception for ballot access.  </p>

<p>	There is no good reason to not follow Utah's lead.  Electronic signatures naturally guard against fraud, encourage communication, are readily verifiable, and leave an indelible record.   Nothing is served by rejecting them - other than making ballot access more difficult. </p>

<p>	Some states, Ohio for example, condition ballot access on circulators "witnessing" signatures.  These circulators, moreover, commonly must be state residents who are registered to vote.  Can the UETA be used under these circumstances?</p>

<p>	The simple answer is yes.  The US Supreme Court has thrown out the requirement that circulators must be registered to vote.  Lower courts generally agree that states cannot require that circulators be local residents.  Both requirements violate the First Amendment.  The end result is that any adult can circulate petitions.  </p>

<p>As for "witnessing" signatures, the UETA specifically overrides notarization, verification and acknowledgement requirements.  Notaries are nothing more than bonded witnesses.  If the UETA dispenses with their services, it should also dispense with any requirement that circulators personally "witness" signatures.  </p>

<p>Must states accept electronic signatures for ballot access?  They are certainly not constitutionally compelled to accept them.  However, as made clear by the Utah Supreme Court, there is no good reason not to.  Nothing inherent in the ballot access process or the UETA counsels against their use.  Common sense - tried and proved in the commercial marketplace - makes it clear that electronic signatures work.</p>

<p>What about local referenda and initiatives?  Many states allow citizens to collect signatures in order to place issues on ballots.  Can sponsors of referenda solicit electronic signatures, too?  Although the Utah Supreme Court did not address this problem, the same logic would seem to apply.  </p>

<p>State elections officials would do voters across the country a huge favor by following Utah's lead.  Electronic signatures should be accepted when submitted by candidates whose signature-collection procedures comply with the UETA.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Ester</strong> [<a href="http://islamineurope.blogspot.com/">Islam in Europe</a>]: "Recently Amnesty International <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/08/uk-control-orders-violate-suspects-rights-ai.php">repeated its call</a> to the British government to stop its "regime" of control orders.  These orders, which allow the Home Secretary to restrict a person's freedom of movement, were introduced by the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/2/contents">Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005</a>.  Control orders are supervised by the courts, but they allow admitting secret evidence against the suspects and this supervision is, as Amnesty puts it, 'limited'.</p>

                <p>Amnesty's critique is simple.  The state has an obligation to protect its citizens, but this should be done without violating their human rights.  Amnesty feels that despite Britain's efforts to protect their citizens' liberties, they are violating the European Human Right Convention.</p>

                <p>Amnesty's suggestion is that terrorism should be handled by the ordinary criminal justice system. </p>

                <p>It's worth noting that their suggestion is just as flawed, if not worse.  In their report they state that over 200 people (now over 280) have been convicted of terrorism related offenses in the UK.  They don't mention that in that time, there have been over 1,700 terrorism arrests: a conviction rate of about 6%.  This means that over 90% of those arrested for terrorism by the criminal justice system, were arrested for no reason.  Either that, or the criminal justice system is not capable of handling terrorism.</p>

                <p>Meanwhile, there are currently about a dozen control orders in force.   The Muslim community has been affected much more by the normal measures taken by the ordinary criminal justice system, such as stop-and-searches, surveillance cameras and anti-terrorism community initiatives.</p>

                <p>Every citizen should be concerned when a government allows itself special powers which infringe on his liberty.  At the same time, citizens should be just as concerned when a government does not take the necessary steps to protect their most basic human right to life.  Amnesty's take on this is expected, though simplistic.  The terrorist suspect can sue for his human rights.  The terrorism victim can't.</p>

                <p>Amnesty points out that one of the flaws of this system is the legal costs of the frequent court challenges.  This is not a flaw.  It shows that Britain's legal system is functioning as it should, trying to deal with the very complex challenge of terrorism.  Such challenges should be encouraged, in order to allow the courts to do their job: supervise the executive."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.wmitchell.edu/academics/faculty/erlinder.asp">Peter Erlinder</a>, defense counsel at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and Professor of Law at William Mitchell College of Law says that even though the White House is now more openly critical of Rwandan President Paul Kagame's regime, the US and international community at large must take a much closer look at those in power before true reconciliation will come to Rwanda...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/forumy/petererlinder.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>R</b></font>wandan President Paul Kagame was re-elected on August 9 to a second  seven-year term with 93% of the vote, about the same percentage he received in August  2003 with the same arrests of opponents;  the same outlawing of political parties; the same closing of newspapers; the same mysterious murders and disappearances,  just like the election this August. Despite EU reports that the 2003 elections were fatally flawed, the White House had congratulated Kagame. On August 13 of <em>this</em> year, however, the White House reaction was quite different:  </p>

<p> "...[in light of] a series of disturbing events prior to the election including the suspension of two newspapers, the expulsion of a human rights activists, the barring of two opposition parties from taking part in the election, and the arrest of journalists... [S]tability and prosperity will be difficult to sustain without broad political debate and open political participation... <em>Democracy is about more than holding elections</em>..." [emphasis added]</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><strong>Stability, Prosperity and Democracy:  Kagame-style</strong></div>

<p>The White House statement was welcome and long overdue, but it left out other "disturbing events" like the murder of a leading journalist investigating the attempted assassination of a former Kagame supporter and General seeking asylum in South Africa; the beheading of the vice-chair of an opposition party; the arrest of would-be Presidential candidate Victoire Ingabire for "genocide denial;" and my own arrest for "genocide denial," (I was arrested on May 28 when I went to Rwanda to advise Ms. Ingabire and released for medical reasons on June 17) despite a Rwanda-United Nations (UN) treaty promising immunity from prosecution to UN lawyers like me (I am Lead Defense Counsel).  </p>

<p>In light of my arrest, the White House statement's reference to "stability" <em>did</em> have a ring of irony, given the ubiquity of AK-47's in RPF ruling-party hands, from about age 16 on up;  CIA reports that Rwanda's 6,000 troops, pre-Kagame, are at least 65,000 now (plus uncounted para-militaries and militias); and, personal observation that Rwanda's RPF-imposed stability rivals that imposed on Iraq by the ethnic-minority Baath Party while Saddam Hussein was a U.S. ally like Kagame is now, until he wasn't.  </p>

<p>Rwandan "prosperity" is another matter.  Both the State Department  (NYT, Herman Cohen, Dec. 16, 2008) and the UN (UNSC Experts Reports 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2008) report that much of Rwanda's GDP flows from natural resources that were stolen from the Congo, (est. $250 mil. per year) at the cost of more than 5 million lives and counting.  This resource theft is enhanced by $1 billion in U.S. aid since 2000, $250 million for 2010-11, <em>plus</em> Pentagon and off-the-books aid, NATO aid, payments for troops on UN and AU "peacekeeping missions" in Darfur, etc.  The Rwandan army is a serious profit center.</p>

<p>The White House statement also sheds some welcome light on why I was jailed as a "genocide denier," and it was <em>not</em> for anything I said or did in Rwanda.  The White House statement about the real political conditions in Rwanda provides a good opportunity to help set the record straight!  </p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Victors Always Tell the Story of the War....at Least Initially</strong></div>

<p>The Award-winning documentary <em>The Fog of War</em> opens with newsreel footage of Tokyo ablaze from U.S. gasoline bombs that incinerated some 250,000 civilians before Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as the somber voice-over of former Secretary of State Robert McNamara's admits: </p>

<p>"<em>if the Japanese had won the war, those of us who planned the fire-bombing of Tokyo  would have been the war criminals</em>...." </p>

<p>The <em>mea culpa</em> is dramatic but not surprising. Everyone knows the victors have <em>always</em> told the story of the war.....don't they?  While this may appear to be an historical truism, it appears to be generally understood as <em>not</em> being the case when the war at issue is the last 3 months of the Oct. 1990 to July 1994 Rwanda War, which the victors have called the "Rwandan genocide."</p>

<p>I learned this when I returned from 3 weeks in prisons run by the victors of the Rwanda War, after having been accused of "genocide denial" <em>by</em> the victors of the Rwanda War, and found that the well-publicized slander seemed to have been taken seriously simply because the victors in the Rwanda War had said it!  I was astonished to find out that the slander had been repeated, over and over again by apparently curious and analytical minds, without any serious attempt by anyone to explain what I had done to allegedly deserve the accusation!  </p>

<p>Just for the record, I am <em>not</em> a "genocide denier." But I am also not willing to accept the "victors' version" of any war wholesale, any more than any respectable historian would ignore the fact that crimes were committed by the Allies in World War II;  crimes were committed by Union forces during American Civil War; and crimes were committed by the by U.S. in the planned genocide conspiracy against Native Americans, <em>even if it could not be admitted by the victors at the time</em>. </p>

<p>But, the confusion does have some foundation because even when the UN Appeals Chamber, and my lawyers, asked the Rwanda government to spell out my supposed crime, they refused.  Instead, they provided a list of articles I had written, and articles others had written, as well as documents I had filed in court. (ICTR Appeals Chamber, Registrar's Submission, July 14, 2010, Case No. 98-41-A).  They never actually explained how my writings and court documents added up to "genocide denial." </p>

<p><strong><div style="text-align: center;">The "Genocide Denial:" A Rwandan Political Ink-blot Test</div></strong></p>

<p>As Lead Defense Counsel for the UN Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), it is my job to get the best evidence possible to show what <em>actually happened</em> in Rwanda in 1994 to the benefit my client,  which is exactly what I have done.  Because the UN Tribunal permits defense attorneys access to UN documents that would otherwise be confidential for 50 years, I was able to get UN and de-classified U.S. government documents which show what actually <em>did</em> happened in Rwanda in 1994, not what the victors <em>say</em> happened.  </p>

<p>On December 18, 2008, after 7 years of receiving the best evidence the RPF could muster, three judges of the UN tribunal for Rwanda unanimously concluded that the story of the Rwanda genocide told by the victors....of a "long-planned conspiracy to commit a genocide of Tutsi civilians" by top military officers was <em>not supported by the evidence</em>.  The three judges agreed that the documents and evidence I put into evidence were more credible and the UN prosecutor did not appeal.  It was this legal victory, based on previously suppressed UN documents that got me prosecuted for "genocide denial" by the RPF victors in the Rwanda War.  </p>

<p>But, in addition to the documents, former U.S. Ambassador to Rwanda Robert Flaten, recently of St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota, testified  that the former government was so porous that a conspiracy to  commit mass killings would have been found out by the CIA or State Department, and it wasn't. He also testified that mass violence now called the "Rwandan genocide" was not a surprise.  In fact, <em>he</em> had actually <em>predicted</em> it, in light of similar violence that swept Burundi, the country next door, after military allies of RPF had assassinated the Burundian president at the end of 1993. </p>

<p>But, having hard evidence that the "victors' myth" of the Rwanda War is not true is not the only way to be a "genocide denier" in Rwanda.  Victoire Ingabire, was charged for <em>agreeing</em> that there was "a genocide of Tutsi and <em>moderate Hutus</em>"  but her crime was asking why there were no memorials to "moderate Hutu" victims anywhere in the country.  </p>

<p>In Rwanda, "genocide denial," like an ink-blot test, can be whatever the RPF government perceives it to be. According to the RPF government, Hutus are "the perpetrators" in all cases, despite recently published findings by Dr. Alan Stam of the University of Michigan and Dr. Christian Davenport of Notre Dame that nearly <em>twice</em> as many Hutus were killed as Tutsis, not to mention, former U.S. Ambassador to Burundi (1994-96) Robert Krueger's eye-witness descriptions of RPF massacres of Hutus in the summer of 1994.  </p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><strong>If Not a Long-Planned Conspiracy to Commit Genocide, What <em>Did</em> Happen in Rwanda?</strong></div>

<p>Rwanda and Burundi are neighboring countries with interwoven histories (like New Hampshire and Vermont, they are similar ethnically and topographically, yet they differ politically).  Rwanda had been a relatively peaceful Hutu-majority republic from independence until the RPF war of invastion between 1990-94 while Burundi was a Tutsi-dominated military dictatorship that carried out several mass killings of hundreds of thousands of Hutus after independence in the early 1960's, until October 1993.  </p>

<p>Burundi's first presidential election saw Hutu President Ndadaye elected by the 85% Hutu majority in August 1993.  Within 90 days, Burundi's Tutsi-dominated  military assassinated Ndadaye in October 1993, which was followed by an unplanned explosion of violence in which 100-200,000 were killed as Hutu peasants rose-up with hand-weapons before the Tutsi military took charge and massacred Hutus.  A half-million refugees poured into Rwanda.</p>

<p>By the time the Burundian refugees arrived in Rwanda, some 1.2 million Hutu and Tutsi refugees already had been displaced by  a war that began in 1990 when part of the Ugandan army invaded Rwanda.  Led by a Ugandan officer and Rwandan ex-pat, Paul Kagame, who returned from training at Ft. Leavenworth to lead the invasion, the re-named RPF grew from about 3,000 to 25,000 well-armed and well-trained troops with U.S. and U.K. military support, and became the militarily dominant force in Rwanda by 1993 in a little over two-years! </p>

<p>At the same time, some 1.5 to 2 million brutalized war-displaced refugees were everywhere in refugee camps and wandering the country.  Social chaos and the threat of war hung in the air. The situation was so unstable that Ambassador Flaten testified that he personally warned then-General Kagame to his face, after the Burundi blood-bath: "if [<em>Kagame</em>] resumed the war....Rwanda would explode just like Burundi...<em>and [Kagame] would be responsible for massive killings like those that just happened in Burundi...</em>"  </p>

<p>The UN documents,  sworn testimony at the UN tribunal, French and Spanish criminal indictments show that despite Flaten's warning, Kagame not only resumed the war but did so by assassinating the Presidents of <em>both</em> Rwanda and Burundi, which by any reckoning makes him <em>primarily</em> responsible for the mass violence Flaten told him would sweep Rwanda. </p>

<p>On the night the assassinations, a State Department cable warned that "<em>both</em> countries could explode..."because of the Burundi experience....<em>not</em> because of a long-planned conspiracy to commit genocide in Rwanda,  as the RPF victors have long maintained. </p>

<p>The UN documents also show that once the predicted violence began the militarily weaker Rwandan army could not defend against the RPF invasion, and put down the massacres triggered by the presidential assassinations.  The defeated army repeatedly asked for a ceasefire, or to <em>combine</em> forces with Kagame's troops to stop the violence.  But, as UN Gen. Dallaire wrote to his superiors,  "Why should Kagame agree to a ceasefire, he's winning the war?...the civilian casualties are collateral damage for his (Kagame's) war plan...."  </p>

<p>In short, the UN documents show that Kagame knowingly triggered the mass violence in Rwanda by assassinating the two Presidents, then refused to use his military superiority to help stop the mass violence he had knowingly triggered.  Then, as the "victor," he was in a position to lay the responsibility for the "Rwandan genocide" at the feet of the "vanquished."  As Robert McNamara reminded us in the <em>Fog of War</em>...this  is <em>not</em> a new story, only the details differ.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><strong>The UN Rwanda Tribunal: Impunity for the Victors, Again</strong></div>

<p>Despite my having been able to use UN Tribunal due process principles to get access to documents that would otherwise have been kept confidential for many decades, the performance of the Tribunal, itself, has been much less than fair or even-handed. In fact, the UN Rwanda Tribunal is the <em>only</em> international tribunal in history set-up to prosecute <em>all</em> crimes in a war, that has prosecuted only the losing side. </p>

<p>This means that <em>either</em> the four-year Rwanda War is the <em>only</em> war in history in which <em>only the losing side committed crimes</em> or, like the Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals, the Rwanda Tribunal is actually a "victor's tribunal" in which the crimes of the victors  are off-the-table for political reasons.  This is a mystery that was solved in February 2009, thanks to the publication of the memoirs of former Chief UN Prosecutor Carla Del Ponte.  </p>

<p>Del Ponte's 2009 memoirs explain she was fired from her ICTR job in 2003 by the US because she had the evidence to prosecute Kagame and his RPF army and refused US orders to drop the prosecutions.  She writes she was informed that the US had a "deal" to protect Kagame and the RPF.  The UN documents I put into evidence in the Rwanda tribunal back her up.  They are also on my website: <a href="http://www.rwandadocumentsproject.net">www.rwandadocumentsproject.net</a>. </p>

<p>As early as September 1994, RPF mass crimes were reported to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Kofi Annan by USAID human rights investigator Robert Gersony.  By 1997 prosecution investigative team led by former FBI agent James Lyons recommended that Kagame be prosecuted for the assassinations of the two Presidents.  Former Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour shut down the investigation and disbanded the Kagame investigation unit. To date, not one RPF-related crime has been charged at the UN Tribunal for Rwanda.  </p>

<p>Until the White House statement on August 13, the U.S. policy of unwavering support for Kagame has meant a U.S.-sponsored cover-up of RPF crimes at the ICTR, and a complete absence of U.S. criticism for Kagame's massive crimes in a neighboring country, Congo, which far exceed anything committed by Sudan's President Bashir in an unruly province within his own nation.   And, Rwanda is a member of the International Criminal Court, while Sudan is not.  From an African perspective, the Sudan/Rwanda-Uganda-Congo contradiction is making a mockery of jurisprudential concepts of international jurisdiction and revealing the tribunals as exercises in super-power influence. Mahmood Mamdani made the point quite clearly in the <em>Nation</em> (The New Humanitarian Order, Sept 29, 2008):</p>

<p>"Its name notwithstanding, the ICC is rapidly turning into a Western court to try African crimes against humanity. It has targeted governments that are U.S. adversaries and ignored actions the United States does not oppose, like those of Uganda and Rwanda, effectively conferring impunity on them."</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Consequences of the Continuing the "Long-Planned Genocide Conspiracy" Myth: The Impossibility of Reconciliation and More Explosive Violence?</strong></div>

<p>The cover-up of RPF crimes, and U.S. complicity in continuing the "long-term genocide conspiracy" myth has real-world consequences for the people of Africa's Great Lakes Region, and is preventing any realistic possibility of reconciliation between peoples who must live together, as the White House statement recognizes.  It is an open secret that the millions of deaths and resource rape in the eastern Congo by Rwandan and Ugandan troops is continuing today, with U.S. acquiescence, if not support.  It is a policy that must change if there is to be anything like "stability, prosperity and democracy" in Rwanda and Central Africa.</p>

<p>In RPF prisons, I learned that the a "long-planned genocide conspiracy" myth cannot be questioned in Kagame's Rwanda, and is an article of faith so deeply engrained that RPF supporters really believe their <em>only</em> hope for survival is a tight grip on an AK-47, <em>and</em> holding state power any way they can.  The RPF "long-planned genocide" myth  makes it easy to instill the fear to bludgeon all but the most resolute Tutsi into acquiescence with RPF strong-arm tactics, if not support.  When 85% of Rwandans are Hutu-genocide conspirators, <em>any</em> movement toward real democracy makes reliance on RPF police-state repression justifiable...all in the name of self-defense! </p>

<p>Putting to rest the "victor's myth" of the long-planned conspiracy to commit genocide by the former Hutu government and military has the potential to open up avenues for dialogue between people who must learn to live together. In the long run, a South African-style <em>Truth</em> and Reconciliation process, in which <em>both</em> the Hutu majority and the RPF/Tutsi ruling-minority acknowledge past abuses in exchange for both forgiveness and accountability seems the <em>only</em> model likely to encourage reconciliation, and certainly much more likely to achieve a peaceful, positive outcome than the "victors" falsely assigning all blame to the vanquished, with the help of the U.S.  </p>

<p>The U.S. has a very big role to play in resolving this seemingly intractable conflict.  But by prosecuting only the vanquished at the ICTR, while giving the victors impunity for their role in the Rwandan genocide, which has been US policy since at least the fall of 1994 according to the contemporaneous documents in the ICTR record, the U.S. has been any possibility of reconciliation more distant, and a violent reaction to "stability imposed by force" more likely, and real prosperity and democracy impossible. </p>

<p>The Obama administration has taken an important first step by not granting legitimacy to the illegitimate Kagame election ....a next step should be ending U.S. protection for Kagame and his RPF forces at the UN Tribunal for the they crimes are known to have committed before, during and after the Rwandan genocide.  And, once there is <em>truth</em>...reconciliation at least has a <em>chance</em>.</p>

<p>If <em>that</em> makes me a "genocide denier,"  I guess I have to accept the label. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/faculty/profiles/jallohc">Charles Jalloh</a> of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law responds to Peter Erlinder's article <a href="/forum/2010/08/rwanda-flawed-elections-and-the-politics-of-genocide-denial.php">Rwanda: Flawed Elections and the Politics of 'Genocide Denial'</a>, saying that certain of Erlinder's criticisms of the ICTR are political or unfounded...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/jalloh.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>I</b></font> have just read the interesting op-ed by Professor Peter Erlinder regarding the 2010 presidential elections in Rwanda. I will not comment on the largely political arguments that he makes about the current health or illness of democracy in Rwanda. Neither will I comment on the merits of his views about the current status of ethnic Hutu-Tutsi politics in Rwanda, or for that matter, his long-standing allegation of "a U.S.-sponsored cover-up of RPF crimes" at the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda ("ICTR"). </p>

<p>But, as someone who has had the good fortune to work in the ICTR, I feel compelled to respond to his article for two main reasons. First, in order to help correct the misapprehension that might arise for those JURIST readers less familiar with the ICTR and Rwanda. Second, though I am no longer associated with the ICTR and obviously speak only for myself, as a lawyer and an academic, I find it hard to understand why Professor Erlinder would make such grave allegations without in any way attempting to adhere to the most basic principles of fairness and natural justice. </p>

<p>In his article, written ostensibly to publicly rebut Rwandan Government charges that he is a "genocide denier," Professor Erlinder unfortunately makes many sweeping claims about the 1994 Rwandan genocide, the politics of the Great Lakes region of Africa, alleged victors justice dispensed by the ICTR, alleged assassinations ordered by President Paul Kagame as leader of the Rwandan Patriotic Front and even Rwanda's member status to the International Criminal Court (the country is not even a <em>signatory</em> to the Rome Statute which established the ICC, let alone a <em>party</em>). </p>

<p>Much of what he presents as fact remains highly contested, or contestable, even among world-renowned historians of Rwanda. Without so much as acknowledging this reality, he claims that it is because of his "legal victory" as an ICTR defense counsel exposing ugly truths (in the course of defending his client) that Rwandan authorities recently sought to silence him with bogus charges of "genocide denial." One cannot but be struck at the overall narrative that emerges: that of a Western lawyer soldiering bravely on to ensure justice for his (native) client in the savage backwoods of a forgotten part of Africa - if not the world. </p>

<p>Even more strikingly, especially for an experienced defense counsel who is also an officer of the court, Professor Erlinder mischaracterizes Trial Chamber I's factual and legal findings in the December 18, 2008 Judgment in the case of <a href="http://www.unictr.org/Portals/0/Case/English/Bagosora/Judgement/081218.pdf">Prosecutor v. Th&#233;oneste Bagosora et al.</a> [PDF], ICTR-98-41-T ("Military I") to which he alluded. He states as follows: <br />
<blockquote>On December 18, 2008, after 7 years of receiving the best evidence the RPF could muster, three judges of the UN tribunal for Rwanda unanimously concluded that the story of the Rwanda genocide told by the victors....of a "long-planned conspiracy to commit a genocide of Tutsi civilians" by top military officers was not <em>supported by the evidence</em>. The three judges agreed that the documents and evidence I put into evidence were more credible and the UN prosecutor did not appeal. It was this legal victory, based on previously suppressed UN documents that got me prosecuted for "genocide denial" by the RPF victors in the Rwanda War.</blockquote>Among other things, it is important for readers to note the following in relation to the preceding assertion. First, the reference to the "best evidence the RPF could muster" is simply misleading. The RPF - by which he means the Rwandan Patriotic Front - is not the organization that presented evidence in the Military I trial. The case was brought by the Prosecutor of the ICTR (currently Hassan Bubacar Jallow). It is the ICTR Prosecutor, who is appointed by the UN Security Council upon nomination by the Secretary-General, who investigates and initiates prosecutions of persons responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes committed in Rwanda as well as the serious international humanitarian law violations perpetrated by Rwandan citizens in neighboring states between January 1 and December 31, 1994. (<em>See</em> <a href="http://www.un.org/ictr/statute.html">ICTR Statute</a>, Art. 7). It is the ICTR Prosecutor, who is not legally permitted to <em>seek</em> or <em>receive</em> instructions from any government (whether Rwanda, the U.S., etc.), or for that matter <em>any other source</em>, that has the responsibility to decide whether there is sufficient basis to seek judicial approval of an indictment against a particular suspect. (<em>See</em> ICTR Statute, Art. 15). Consequently, though the ICTR Prosecutor, like all prosecutors in other international criminal courts, would obviously seek cooperation from relevant national authorities in order to carry out his mandate, it is simply inaccurate and unfair to make this broad assertion about the "best evidence the RPF could muster." </p>

<p>One would hope that Rwanda, like all other law-abiding UN Member States, would turn over every piece of relevant information it has relating to the heinous international crimes committed within its territory in 1994 to the ICTR Prosecutor. This flows from the duty it owes to cooperate with the ICTR pursuant to Article 28 of the ICTR Statute and by fiat of operation of the Chapter VII legal nature of the ICTR. To imply, without providing any evidence, that Kigali has done more than that and effectively usurped the functions of the ICTR Prosecutor amounts to a political argument. It is one that seems designed to impugn the credibility of a legal process that enjoys independent judicial oversight and principled commitment to the strict fair trial requirements of international human rights law. (<em>See</em> ICTR Statute, Art. 20).   </p>

<p>Secondly, though Professor Erlinder suggests otherwise, the three Trial Chamber I judges (Judges Erik M&#248;se, presiding; Jai Ram Reddy, and Sergei Alekseevich Egorov) did not in the Military I Judgment rule, as he put it, that a "'long-planned conspiracy to commit a genocide of Tutsi civilians' by top military officers in Rwanda was <em>not supported by the evidence</em>" (emphasis in original). In fact, Trial Chamber I reached exactly the opposite conclusion. For our purposes, two lines of judicial reasoning are particularly revealing.</p>

<p>To begin with, at the outset of its deliberations on the Prosecution's allegation that the four accused - one of whom was Professor Erlinder's client - had conspired amongst themselves and with others to exterminate the Tutsi population of Rwanda, the Trial Chamber took pains to underscore that the question under consideration was "not <em>whether</em> there was <em>a</em> plan or conspiracy to commit <em>genocide in Rwanda</em>" (my emphasis). Rather, according to the judges, the narrow and ultimately controlling question before the Chamber was "whether the Prosecution has proven beyond reasonable doubt based on the evidence in this case that the four Accused committed the crime of conspiracy" to commit genocide. (<em>See</em> Military I Judgment, para. 2092).</p>

<p>Ultimately, it is true that after carefully weighing the evidence presented during the trial, the Trial Chamber found that the Prosecution failed to discharge its burden of proving the various accused guilty on the conspiracy to commit genocide charge. In a nutshell, in the absence of smoking gun evidence - as is often the case in conspiracy cases - the judges noted that the mostly circumstantial evidence that the Prosecution had tendered was insufficient to establish that the <em>only reasonable inference</em> from the totality of the circumstances was that the accused military officers conspired to perpetrate the genocide before it started in Rwanda on April 7, 1994. </p>

<p>Importantly, clearly having in mind the weightiness of its finding in the specific case before it but also for Rwanda's contested history, the Trial Chamber went further and sought to lay the matter to rest once and for all. In this regard, the judges clarified that, given the evidence presented to support the conspiracy charge and the rest of the case against the accused, "the Chamber <em>cannot exclude that there were in fact plans</em> prior to 6 April [1994] <em>to commit genocide in Rwanda</em>" (my emphasis). In fact, the Prosecution had argued and the judges accepted that "there are certain indications in the evidence of a prior plan or conspiracy to perpetrate a genocide as well as other politically motivated killings in Rwanda, which could have been triggered upon the resumption of hostilities between the government and the RPF or following some other significant event." (<em>See</em> Military I Judgment, para. 2107).</p>

<p>Moreover, since the evidence in the case only implicated the accused in the prior planning of genocidal acts to "varying degrees," the Prosecution had simply failed to convince them that the only reasonable inference to be drawn was that the accused conspired amongst themselves or with others to commit genocide. Nevertheless, and even more detrimental for Professor Erlinder's argument, the judges reasoned that "it is even possible that some military or civilian authorities did intend these preparations as part of a plan to commit genocide." (<em>See</em> Military I Judgment, paras. 2107; 2111).</p>

<p>Thirdly, again unlike Professor Erlinder's claim in his article, the Trial Chamber specifically examined the alternate explanations that Defense counsel advanced to counter the conspiracy charges but also the Rwandan genocide more generally. While it found some of the defense theories useful in providing limited context for certain events, the Chamber ultimately concluded that the bulk of the "alternative explanations had little relevance to the Prosecution's specific allegations that there was a conspiracy" to commit genocide. More fatally, noting that its finding of insufficiency of evidence is inevitable given "exacting standards of proof and procedure" and the "specific evidence on the record before it," the Chamber specifically noted the possibility remained that "[o]ther or newly discovered information, subsequent [ICTR] trials or history may demonstrate a conspiracy involving the Accused prior to 6 April to commit genocide." (<em>See</em> Military I Judgment, paras. 1995; 2112). </p>

<p>Furthermore, far from agreeing that the evidence that he proffered in the Military I case was more credible, as Professor Erlinder suggested in the above extract, Trial Chamber I forcefully rejected his theory that genocide did not in fact occur in Rwanda. It found the contention devoid of any merit. The judges observed that a review of the evidence amply showed that the perpetrators acted with genocidal intent. In addition, for those who might still harbor doubts, the Chamber noted the high number of individuals convicted by the ICTR for genocidal acts carried out throughout Rwanda as well the Appeals Chamber position that the Rwandan genocide in 1994 constitutes "a fact of common knowledge." To the judges, all these factors taken together put the question of whether genocide occurred in Rwanda in 1994 beyond reasonable dispute. (<em>See</em> Military I Judgment, para. 1998). </p>

<p>Similarly, Trial Chamber I forcefully rejected many of the same assertions made in Professor Erlinder's article about alleged RPF killings of Hutus or the alleged improper imbalance in ICTR prosecutorial strategy in respect to alleged Tutsi crimes. In any event, as the judges rightly observed, international humanitarian law does not accept the <em>tu quoque</em> (they did it too) argument as a valid defense to individual criminal liability - as the ICTR Appeals Chamber has affirmed. Consequently, it was hard for the Chamber to discern how the defense submissions would exculpate these specific accused of responsibility for their own alleged crimes. (<em>See</em> Military I Judgment, para. 1999).</p>

<p>While it is perhaps understandable that Professor Erlinder feels aggrieved by his recent arrest and incarceration in Rwanda, it is unfortunate that despite being an officer of the court in his capacity as defense counsel, he has taken it upon himself to seek to discredit the ICTR in the world of public opinion. To be sure, in the ICTR as well as other international criminal courts, defense lawyers are entitled to zealously and skillfully mount the best defense possible for their clients. Equally importantly, in the ICTR and in mature adversarial criminal justice systems like that of the United States, defense counsel - because of their role in a larger judicial process - must always strive to ensure that their actions and public statements do not give the appearance of bringing the administration of justice into serious disrepute. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, despite numerous judicial rulings to the contrary, Professor Erlinder has continued to make largely political arguments about ICTR cases and obviously tense domestic politics in Rwanda. Yet, on numerous occasions, his views have been forcefully repudiated in reasoned decisions by the ICTR judges. Interestingly, as if to magically transform them into truths, the arguments lost in courtroom battles with prosecutors are recycled precisely in the public spaces where his views are most likely to go unchallenged.<br />
 <br />
In the final analysis, as the Trial Chamber observed when it rendered oral judgment in the Military I case on December 18, 2008, it is clear that immense human slaughter and suffering took place during the Rwandan genocide in 1994. Whether Professor Erlinder is right or wrong on how history should judge those events, despite the best intentions of well meaning lawyers and academics, we must always be mindful that "the process of a criminal trial cannot depict the entire picture of what happened in Rwanda." (<em>See</em> Military I, <a href="http://www.unictr.org/Portals/0/Case/English/Bagosora/Judgement/081218_summary.pdf">Oral Summary</a>, December 18, 2008, para. 7).</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Romana St. Matthew-Daniel</strong> [Press Secretary, <a href="http://www.ibanet.org/IBAHRI.aspx">International Bar Association Human Rights Institute</a>]:  "In its 2003 report on the administration of justice in Equatorial Guinea (<a href="http://www.ibanet.org/Document/Default.aspx?DocumentUid=306edba8-203b-4bcd-9637-dd355a52d650">Equatorial Guinea: At the Crossroads</a> [PDF]) the International Bar Association's Human Rights Institute (IBAHRI) uncovered little respect for the rule of law and separation of powers, torture, failure of proper trial processes and lack of an independent judiciary. It is disheartening to see that in the ensuing seven years little appears to have changed.</p>

                <p>Thus, the IBAHRI is gravely concerned about the news from Equatorial Guinea of the <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/08/equatorial-guinea-defends-executions-over-2009-coup-plot.php">execution</a> of four alleged coup plotters just an hour after they were sentenced. By denying them leave to appeal, the military tribunal violated a human right enshrined in Article 14(5) of the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a>: 'Everyone convicted of a crime shall have the right to his conviction and sentence being reviewed by a higher tribunal according to law.' As a party to the ICCPR, Equatorial Guinea has therefore put itself in breach of its obligations under international law. </p>

                <p>The IBAHRI is also concerned by reports that the executed people were subjected to torture whilst held at Black Beach prison after their abduction. Torture is universally regarded as a violation of international law. It is condemned by the <a href="untreaty.un.org/cod/avl/pdf/ha/catcidtp/catcidtp_e.pdf">Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</a> [PDF], a treaty to which Equatorial Guinea acceded on 8 Oct 2002. This practice must stop and those responsible for ordering these crimes punished for Equatorial Guinea to achieve concord with international law.</p>

                <p>The IBAHRI notes that the abduction of the four from Benin in January 2010 violates the sovereignty of Benin. The forerunner of the International Criminal Court,<a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/pcij/index.php?p1=9"> the Permanent Court of International Justice</a>, set forth a basic rule: 'the first and foremost restriction imposed by international law upon a State is that - failing the existence of a permissive rule to the contrary - it may not exercise its power in any form in the territory of another State.' (Case of the S.S. "Lotus" (France v. Turkey), P.C.I.J. Series A, No. 10, at p. 18) Agents of one State who abduct someone in another State are exercising State power. There is no general rule of international law permitting that kind of State power in the territory of another State. Benin did not consent to the exercise of such power. </p>

                <p>In the view of the IBAHRI, confessions or evidence obtained under torture, denial of right to appeal a conviction, and abduction without extradition all constitute serious violations of the human rights of persons subjected to criminal proceedings, which are if anything more exacting when applied in capital cases.</p>

                <p>The executions put Equatorial Guinea at odds with current legal standards and guidelines on the death penalty, including but not limited to the right to life guaranteed by <a href="http://www.claiminghumanrights.org/udhr_article_3.html">Article 3 Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> (UDHR), <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">Article 6 of the ICCPR</a>, and <a href="www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsUpload/N0747271.pdf">UN General Assembly Resolutions 62/149</a> (2007) [PDF] and <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/63/resolutions.shtml">63/168</a> (2008) that call for a moratorium on the death penalty. On 15 May 2008, the Council of the IBAHRI passed a Resolution calling for an end to the death penalty worldwide. The Resolution commits the IBAHRI to actively promote the abolition of the death penalty and to recommend that all states take immediate steps towards imposing a moratorium on capital punishment in the interim. The IBAHRI urges Equatorial Guinea to address its responsibilities to uphold the right to life, and in so doing, readdress its use of the death penalty."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.schr.org/about/who">Sara Totonchi</a> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.schr.org/">Law Offices of the Southern Center for Human Rights</a>]: "Wednesday, a federal judge <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/08/federal-court-denies-habeas-petition-in-davis-death-penalty-case.php">upheld</a> the murder conviction of Georgia death row inmate Troy Davis. This ruling followed an unusual evidentiary hearing that was ordered by the US Supreme Court to examine evidence of Davis' innocence.  Despite the ruling from Judge William T. Moore, Jr., questions and doubts about the Davis case remain.  Given these uncertainties it would be a travesty of justice to execute Troy Davis.</p>

                <p>At the June hearing in District Court, testimony was provided from witnesses that their original testimony implicating Davis was built on lies.  Four witnesses admitted in court that they lied at trial and that they did not know who shot Officer Mark MacPhail.   Another four witnesses implicated another man as the one who killed the officer - including one who says he saw the shooting and is related to the alternate suspect by marriage.  Three original state witnesses described police coercion during questioning. </p>

                <p>In his August 24th ruling, Judge Moore himself noted problems with the evidence proffered by the State of Georgia in their efforts to implicate Davis, stating that "[W]hile the State's case may not be ironclad, most reasonable jurors would again vote to convict Mr. Davis of Officer MacPhail's murder. A federal court simply cannot interpose itself and set aside the jury verdict in this case absent a truly persuasive showing of innocence." If a state's case against Troy Davis is not "ironclad," shouldn't that trouble those seeking his execution?</p>

                <p>Troy Davis' case illustrates that U.S. courts simply cannot provide the certainty necessary to impose an irreversible punishment; therefore the death penalty must be abolished.  Far too many cases, as in Davis' case, rely solely on eyewitness testimony, which is the number one source of wrongful convictions.  This, along with other prevalent factors such as racial bias and inadequate representation, has created a system that cannot be entrusted with human life.<br />
                    <br />
                    Across the nation states are moving away from the death penalty because of growing concerns about innocence, unfairness, discriminatory application, lack of efficacy, and other reasons.  The death penalty was intended to be reserved for the worst offenders, but in practice, it is arbitrary and unfair.  The system is fraught with error, plagued by poor legal representation, and discriminates on the basis of income, race and geography - with the majority carried out in the South - among many problems that leave it too broken to be fixed.</p>

                <p>By choosing to deny Mr. Davis' claims, Georgia state courts have ostensibly declared that it is permissible to execute a convicted person who is likely innocent. It will be a travesty of justice for Georgia and our nation if an innocent person is executed. Proceeding with the execution of Troy Davis is callous, careless and irreversible."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist Cdr. Tom Emerick (USCG), former counsel to National Incident Commander (NIC) for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, retired Admiral Thad Allen, explains how existing regulatory rules and agency practices affected the response to the spill and says they need to be changed to better address large oil spills in the future...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/Emerick.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>T</b></font>he unprecedented impacts of the DWH oil spill have and will continue to lead to changes in our nation's energy policy, how we regulate outer continental shelf activity and how we respond to big oil spills.  As the former legal adviser to the National Incident Commander (NIC), retired Admiral Thad Allen, the below is my perspective on how existing legal authorities and policies effected this response, and how we might be able to do better.</p>

<p>The extraordinary complexity of the Deepwater Horizon disaster, combined with a lack of familiarity of the American people and leaders with how this nation responds to oil spills led to political and social frustration.  This led some to blame existing legal authorities and polices as response inhibitors. The reality was that existing legal authorities and policies enabled the largest and most sustained disaster response in our nation's history.  The underlying problem with this response was the lack of adequate capability to quickly stop the massive amount of oil discharging from 5000 feet below the Gulf's surface.  Neither the private nor public sector was prepared for an event that was not supposed to be able to happen.</p>

<p>Regarding legal authorities and policies, this response was conducted under the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/oem/content/frps/09_94_fulltext.htm">National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan</a> (NCP) 40 CFR Part 300, which recognizes the need for a unified and interagency response to large oil spills.  For spills in the coastal zone this unified response will be led by a Coast Guard Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC), 40 CFR &#167;300.120, and in cases of Spills of National Significance (SONS), a NIC can also be named to assist the FOSC with strategic coordination and communication, 40 CFR &#167;300.323. During the spill the first FOSC, Rear Admiral Mary Landry, ordinarily the Commander of the Eighth Coast Guard District whose area of responsibility includes most of the Gulf of Mexico, was designated on April 21, 2010.  The spill was designated a SONS on April 29, 2010 and Admiral Allen was designated the NIC on May 1, 2010.  </p>

<p>The FOSC leads the Unified Area Command to ensure a well-coordinated response to the spill.  This Unified Area Command brings all stakeholders (public and private sector) together in order to provide a coordinated response.  As a stakeholder, BP was part of the unified command. This understandably did not sit well with most people.  How could a company apparently responsible for the largest spill in our nation's history have a major role in the response organization?  This relationship led to the perception that BP was directing the response.  This could not be further from the truth.</p>

<p>The underlying principle of the NCP, and the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/usc.cgi?ACTION=BROWSE&TITLE=33USCC40">Oil Pollution Act of 1990</a> (OPA 90), which amended among other things &#167;311 of the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/usc.cgi?ACTION=BROWSE&TITLE=33USCC26">Clean Water Act</a>, is that the polluter party pays and cleans up. This critical concept was a conscious public policy decision to put the onus on the responsible party during oil spill response.  As a result, most spill response capability and capacity reside in the private sector.  It would make no sense to exclude BP from the response, when they have access to most of the response capabilities and were writing most of the checks. As Admiral Allen, the NIC, aptly put it during a Whitehouse press briefing on May 24, 2010, when asked if BP should be replaced, "To push BP out of the way would raise the question, replace them with what?"  In addition, the National Incident Management System anticipates participation of private parties in the unified command and this disaster required technical skills and capabilities only found in the offshore oil industry.</p>

<p>This public policy decision of relying on the private sector for critical response capability will be reevaluated post response.  A decision must be made on what is the proper role of the public and private sectors.  Should the public sector maintain response capabilities to respond to these low probability high consequence events, and shoulder a significant financial burden to acquire and maintain those capabilities, or should the private sector continue to bear this burden?</p>

<p>Although BP was a critical partner in this response, the federal government always remained in charge.  Both the FOSC and the NIC had &#167;311(c) authority under the Clean Water Act, which provides very broad authority to direct the responsible party to conduct appropriate removal actions.  Both the FOSC and the NIC frequently used this authority to direct BP throughout the response.  For example, the FOSC and NIC directed BP to fund a very large berm project off the Louisiana Coast, to build redundant containment systems to keep oil offshore, and to conduct seismic testing on the Gulf floor to ensure there were no additional leaks.  </p>

<p>This response also highlighted how the NCP should work in coordination with <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xabout/laws/gc_1214592333605.shtm#1">Homeland Security Presidential Directive-5</a> (HSPD-5), Management of Domestic Incidents; the <a href="http://www.fema.gov/pdf/emergency/nrf/nrf-core.pdf">National Response Framework</a> [PDF] (NRF); and the <a href="http://www.fema.gov/pdf/about/stafford_act.pdf">Stafford Act</a> [PDF], 42 USC &#167;&#167; 5121-5207.  </p>

<p>In many disaster responses, such as a hurricane, federal assistance is generally only provided only upon request from the impacted state.  This is the paradigm created by the NRF and the Stafford Act. In this paradigm, state governors have control over how and when federal assistance is delivered within their state. Under the NCP, the states have less control over the federal response.  Although they certainly have the ability to influence decisions as part of the Unified Area Command, the federal government, through the FOSC and the NIC have primary decision making authority.  </p>

<p>Since most of the major stakeholders (states, locals, and other federal agencies) were only versed in the NRF/Stafford Act where the states were in charge, many were not fully comfortable with the NCP paradigm where federal assistance is pushed vice pulled. This led to some friction. One example was in in the Louisiana Parishes, where autonomous home rule seemed to some to be at odds with the federally controlled response. Future SONS exercises must have full participation of stakeholders to ensure an understanding of oil spill response under the NCP.</p>

<p>The complexity of attempting to secure a wellhead 5000 feet under the Gulf surface, a palpable distrust of BP, and using a governance structure with which many stakeholders were unfamiliar led to resistance by some to work inside the NCP.</p>

<p>Despite the above, existing legal authorities and policies enabled the largest and most sustained disaster response in our nation's history.  However, there is significant room for improvement.  Suggested improvements include:</p>

<ul>
<li>In the NCP and in statute the roles and the responsibilities of the NIC need to be better defined.  </li>

<p><li>The NIC should always have &#167;311(c) federal removal authority under the Clean Water Act.  In this response the NIC's &#167;311(c) authority was delegated during the response to the NIC. </li></p>

<p><li>In the NCP and statute, provide additional emergency authorities and structures when a SONS is declared.  For example:</li></p>

<ul>
<li>Expand Secretary of Homeland Security authority to recall Coast Guard Reserve</li>

<p><li>Identify the composition of the interagency team supporting the NIC</li></p>

<p><li>Establish a government led Flow Rate Technical Group to estimate the flow of oil</li><br />
</ul><br />
<li>Reconcile the differences between the NRF/HSPD-5 and the NCP through the issuance of a new HSPD or a modification of HSPD-5.</li></p>

<p><li>Require review and amendment of Area Contingency Plans to account for uncontrolled deepwater wellhead oil discharges.</li><br />
</ul></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.eui.eu/DepartmentsAndCentres/RobertSchumanCentre/People/AcademicAssistants/Perrin.aspx">Delphine Perrin</a> [Research Fellow, <a href="http://www.carim.org/">Migration Policy Centre/CARIM Project at the European University Institute</a>]: "In July 2010, the death of a young man killed by gendarmes when he was trying to break a roadblock was followed by two days of riots by members of the gypsy community to which he belonged.  After the riots, French President Sarkozy <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/08/eu-socialists-claim-france-roma-deportations-violate-eu-law.php">announced a series of repressive measures</a> against travelers and individuals in Roma communities. Whereas the events had their source in the actions of French citizens, they have then been instrumentalized by the French President and government to launch declarations and measures stigmatizing communities of French travelers, Roma migrants, and 'French people with foreign origin.' </p>

                <p>Recent declarations and announced efforts not only violate fundamental human values, but also international law (the UN Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination expressed its concern), European law (<a href="http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm">European Committee for Human Rights</a> (ECHR) prohibition of all kinds of discrimination, particularly its Protocol No. 4, which prohibits collective deportation), and French national law (French law prohibits any discrimination and call for racial hatred).  The announced deportation of thousands of Roma migrants, among other actions, calls into question the compatibility of such a policy with EU Law.</p>

                <p>The Roma migrants who are the subject of Sarkozy's measures are citizens of Romania and Bulgaria, EU Member states since January 1, 2007. For this reason, arguments against deportation include the violation of the right of circulation and residence within the EU, as well as the breach of the prohibition of discrimination.</p>

                <p>The <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:L:2005:157:SOM:EN:HTML">accession treaty</a> concerning Romania and Bulgaria, signed on 25 April 2005, provided the opportunity for EU members to adopt national measures preventing these countries' nationals from full access to the EU labor market during a transitional period, which could not exceed seven years. France has taken this opportunity, requiring Romanian and Bulgarian employees to obtain special work permits. </p>

                <p>These transitional measures with respect to labor, however, cannot interfere with the right of Roma migrants to move and reside freely within the EU, as prescribed by <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:158:0077:0123:EN:PDF">Directive 2004/38/EC</a> [PDF] of April 29, 2004. The right of residence for EU citizens and members of their family for a period up to three months shall not be submitted to any formalities or requirements (Art. 6) and shall be retained 'as long as they do not become an unreasonable burden on the social assistance system of the host member state' (Art. 14). </p>

                <p>It is difficult to imagine how Roma people could be such an unreasonable burden, given that French social and even medical aid is only delivered after at least a three-month stay in the country. For a period longer than three months, EU citizens have to work, have sufficient resources, or at least have comprehensive health insurance coverage to assure the host country that they will not become a burden on the social assistance system during their stay (Art. 7). </p>

                <p>Nevertheless, if an EU citizen has not met these requirements, the host country cannot restrict that individual's right of entry and residence, grounds for which are limited to 'public policy, public security and public health' (Art. 27-1). France claims to proceed to deportations on this basis. Yet, measures taken on the first two grounds shall comply with the principle of proportionality, and be exclusively based on the personal conduct of the individual concerned, which must 'represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society' (Art. 27-2). The decision respecting the previous requirements shall be notified and explained to the persons concerned (Art. 30).</p>

                <p>With a deportation policy based on collective criteria, France obviously violates EU law and does not respect EU citizens' 'primary and individual right' provided by Directive 2004/38/EC. The country infringes on substantive as well as procedural rules, and even implements what is expressly forbidden when pointing at Roma migrants as a whole - or even at Romanian and Bulgarian citizens after the Ministry of Interior recently tried to correct the line - since 'justifications that are isolated from the particulars of the case or that rely on considerations of general prevention shall not be accepted' (Art. 27-2); when invoking supposed delinquency since 'previous criminal convictions shall not in themselves constitute grounds for taking such measures' (Art. 27-2); and above all since 'member states should implement the directive without discrimination on grounds of race, ethnic origin, membership of an ethnic minority' (Preamble para. 31).</p>

                <p>Despite the current attention attracted by such populist measures, this collective deportation policy is not new and has been practiced by France for years. Since the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the EU, France has proceeded with so-called 'voluntary repatriations' of thousands of Roma people on the basis of their national/ethnic membership, providing 'humanitarian aid' of 300 euros for each adult and 100 euros for each child returned to his country. A French association filed a complaint with the European Commission on July 31, 2008 to denounce France's violation of EU law, without any result or reaction. </p>

                <p>Eventually, as France's recently proclaimed policy drew international media attention, on July 25, 2010 EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding expressed her concern and ordered an investigation with respect to EU law. The EU Parliament will discuss the issue with the Commission during its first plenary session, while an interim report of the Commission already regrets that French policy has not put enough emphasis on the individual circumstances of Roma individuals facing deportation.</p>

                <p>Formally, the European Commission might send France a letter of formal notice and even launch an action with the Court of Justice for failure to fulfill an obligation. More likely, it will re-launch the debate on the integration of Roma communities in Europe, which is not likely to prevent the current French government from continuing a xenophobic policy less than two years before the next presidential election ."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Richard Judelsohn</strong> [Medical Director, <a href="http://www2.erie.gov/health/">Erie County Department of Health</a>]:  "The most common question I get from parents and patients regarding vaccine safety is 'I heard on TV and read on the Internet that vaccines can damage the body. Is that true?'</p>

                <p>The first part of my response is to explain the science, and state that studies have not established a causative link between vaccines, thimerosal and neurologic damage. So as a pediatrician and public health official, I welcome the Appeals Court <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/08/federal-appeals-court-upholds-decision-finding-no-link-between-vaccines-and-autism.php">upholding</a> the lower court and Special Master's decisions that vaccines and thimerosal don't cause autism. The ruling is an important tool I can use to encourage my patients to do their utmost to prevent disease.</p>

                <p>Secondly, I explain the risks of not vaccinating. I have found it most effective to accomplish this by showing photos of patients suffering from vaccine-preventable disease, sets of which I keep on my computer and in each examining room. A glance at the withered leg of a polio victim, or the gangrene of an arm as a result of meningococcal infection, that leads to amputation of that arm and hand, can be very persuasive.</p>

                <p>Vaccines for children and adults - considered one of the great triumphs of 20th century public health - will continue to be a hot topic in health care for the foreseeable future. Those of us who passionately believe in vaccines and their benefits, and are on the front lines with our patients, are fortified when the legal system endorses our cause."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Guiora</a> of the University of Utah College of Law say that by continuing its deference to the executive in terrorism cases nine years after 9/11, the judiciary is abdicating its role in enforcing US domestic and international obligations...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 align=left> <tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/blank.jpg" width=126 align=left hspace=0 vspace=2></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height=1 width=5></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height=1 width=1></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/guiora.jpg" width=126 align=left hspace=0 vspace=2></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height=1 width=5></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height=1 width=1></td></tr></table><font size="3"><b>N</b></font>ine years after 9/11, we still do not have a clear legal framework in place for responding to the threat of terrorism and to al Qaeda in particular.  Fingers must be pointed across the board: the Executive Branch, Congress, and the courts all have failed the American people. </p>

<p>The inability of two Administrations to develop a cohesive counterterrorism strategy is problematic enough.  However, the failure of our nation's judiciary to step in and play their critical role - one that <em>only</em> they can play - goes far beyond that.</p>

<p>Last week, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/201008/09-5051-1263353.pdf">rejected</a> [PDF] Ghaleb Nassar al-Bihani's petition for rehearing, <em>en banc</em>, its <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/201001/09-5051-1223587.pdf">January decision</a> [PDF] upholding his detention. The specific facts and justification for his detention aside, the decision is but the <em>latest</em> manifestation of a deeply troubling tradition of judicial deference to the executive when America is under direct or perceived attack.</p>

<p>Judge Brown's previous uncompromising rejection of the need to apply traditional law of war principles in today's conflict with terrorist groups and other non-state actors is not reflected in the recent decision.  It is replaced, <em>however</em>, by an equally - if not more - damaging framework: the complete abdication of any role for the judiciary during conflict, whether traditional war or the complex counterterrorism operations the U.S. is engaged in today and, tragically, tomorrow.</p>

<p>"The Constitution entrusts the President - not the Judiciary - with the conduct of war," states Judge Brown in her concurring opinion in denying rehearing.  While surely judges are not expected to conduct military operations, this statement is problematic if not dangerous. </p>

<p>First, it detracts from our fundamental constitutional framework.  In one fell swoop, constitutional principles of checks and balances and separation of powers are discarded. Precisely because the U.S. Congress is but the most obvious and public example of the absence of either rational debate or reasoned discourse in contemporary American political culture, one could only hope that the judiciary would step into this enormous vacuum.</p>

<p>After all, Abu Ghraib, waterboarding, indefinite detention and extraordinary rendition are but the clearest examples of the price paid when Congress and the judiciary look the other way.</p>

<p>In a society based on the Rule of Law, the judiciary has a crucial - perhaps <em>the</em> crucial - role in ensuring the protection and implementation of that Rule of Law.  Without it, the executive and the legislature go unchecked.  In times of crisis, especially when America is responding to threats to its national security, an unchecked executive is a recipe for disaster, a tale we have seen all too often before.  We must avoid a rerun at all costs. Just ask the 120,000 Japanese-Americans interned in the aftermath of Pearl Harbor or the aliens unjustifiably and unconscionably deported in the aftermath of the Palmer Raids.</p>

<p>Second, this judicial abdication leaves the battlefield - however that is defined in today's conflicts - in the Executive Branch's exclusive domain given the absence of judicial review.  In particular, the law of war, the very body of law that Judge Brown so willingly rejects, governs how we conduct military operations, from targeting to detention to occupation. </p>

<p>Courts apply our constitution and domestic law during peacetime; they must equally apply the law of war to conduct during wartime.  </p>

<p>Just as Justice Jackson warned at home that an unfettered executive is a threat to the Rule of Law and our system of checks and balances, so he emphasized at Nuremberg the importance of making statesmen accountable to the law during times of war.  Without such accountability - available only through independent judicial review - the rule of law can easily be overtaken by the rule of force.</p>

<p>Indeed, the law of war is not one of rights and privileges alone.  With rights come duties; with privileges come obligations.  Thus, the use of force must bring with it the obligation to use force in accordance with the fundamental principles of the law of war, including distinction, proportionality, military necessity and humanity.</p>

<p>Our judiciary's unfortunate and consistent deference leaves the executive free to exercise its rights and privileges with no concern about the obligations - precisely because our system of separation of powers falters at the first sign of conflict or other national security threats.</p>

<p>Executive action in the absence of any independent checks and balances opens the door to violations of individual rights and the dangers of unregulated warfare.  Rejecting a role for the judiciary in wartime matters means - in a nutshell - that the court is abdicating its role in enforcing our domestic and international obligations.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Amy Pisani</strong> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.ecbt.org">Every Child By Two - Carter/Bumpers Champions for Immunization</a>]: "In February of 2009 a special vaccine court exonerated vaccines in the debate over the causes of autism. The three Special Masters ruled that the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR), given in combination with thimerosal-containing vaccines, does not cause, or contribute to, autism. The ruling was consistent with 18 major scientific studies which have failed to show a link between vaccines and the widely-diagnosed neurodevelopmental disorder. The decision was the result of an extensive deliberation by the Special Masters, judges responsible for claims filed in the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. </p>

                <p>In his opinion on general causation, and the specific case of Michelle Cedillo, Special Master George Hastings wrote, "The petitioners have failed to persuade me that there is validity to any of their general causation arguments, and have also failed to persuade me that there is any substantial likelihood that Michelle's MMR vaccination contributed in any way to the causation of any of Michelle's own disorders." A subsequent ruling in 2010 declared that there was not sufficient scientific evidence to suggest that thimerosal-containing vaccines alone can cause autism. In one opinion, Special Master George Hastings wrote, "This case, however, is not a close case. The overall weight of the evidence is overwhelmingly contrary to the petitioners' causation theories... In short, this is a case in which the evidence is so one-sided that any nuances in the interpretation of the causation case law would make no difference to the outcome of the case."</p>

                <p>The <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/08/federal-appeals-court-upholds-decision-finding-no-link-between-vaccines-and-autism.php">recent decision</a> by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upholding the 2009 case caused many in the vaccine-advocacy community to exhale a sigh of relief. Time and again the scientists have studied the safety of vaccines and specifically any role they might play in the causation of autism. Time and again these studies have declared vaccines to be safe. Unfortunately the public, and on some occasions our legal system, does not respect the weight of evidence supporting the safety and very necessity of life-saving vaccines. Fortunately, the Special Masters and Federal Circuit have based their judgments on the expert opinions of the scientific community.</p>

                <p>As we battle epidemic levels of pertussis and have seen the rise in the spread of once controlled measles, we are reminded of the precarious nature of the public health system. Families who once had faith in our public health experts are now lending credence to the unsupported theories of a very small but highly vocal community of anti-vaccine crusaders. Sadly, children are becoming the ultimate victims of the battle between science, the legal system and celebrities. We are hopeful that parents will find solace in the federal courts' decisions, heed the advice of their physicians, and have confidence in their decision to protect children against deadly diseases by vaccinating them on time."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Saleh Al Amer, Pitt Law '11, recently interned with the <a href="http://www.adc.org">American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee</a> (ADC) in Washington, DC. Saleh is the President of the Muslim Law Students Association at the University of Pittsburgh and writes on discrimination against Muslims in Europe and the United States...<br />
<hr height="1"><br />
<font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n September 14th, 2010, the French Senate <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/09/france-senate-approves-burqa-ban.php">voted 246 to 1</a> to ban wearing the Islamic burqa (<em>niqab</em>, as it's called in most of the Islamic World), or any other full-face veils in public, including schools, streets, government buildings and hospitals. The legislation will enable the police to require the women wearing the face veil to show their faces; if they refuse, they will be either required to attend a citizenship class or fined USD $185. Additionally, whomever is found guilty of forcing a woman to wear the veil will be subject to a fine of USD $18,555 and a year in jail. The legislation has to be confirmed by the Constitutional Council, Frances highest court, within a month in order to take effect. The legislation has been challenged as being in violation of the right to religious freedom in the <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/english/8ab.asp">French Constitution</a> and Article 8 (the right to respect of ones private life and personal identity) and Article 9 (freedom of religious expression) of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [PDF]. However, the legislation was carefully worded in an effort to overcome any constitutional scrutiny. The legislation is called "Forbidding the Dissimulation of the Face in the Public Space," and does not mention "woman", "veil," or "Islam."</p>

<p><a href="http://jurist.org/dateline/2010/08/france-constitutional-and-cultural-issues-surrounding-the-burqa-ban.php">Three major justifications</a> were provided for this legislation. First, legislators claimed that the veil violates the French values of dignity and equality between the sexes and reaffirms womens inferiority. Second, the veil challenges the French model of integration and hinders the assimilation of certain groups within the society, namely the Muslim community. Finally, the measure was taken in order to ensure democracy and maintain the public order.</p>

<p>A close assessment of the legislations consequences would show that it is best described as paternalistic and counterproductive. First, <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/09/2010914184958118128.html">news reports</a> after the passage of the legislation indicate that French women who wear the burqa, or niqab, might choose to stay at home and avoid going to hospitals and government offices in order not  to violate their strong religious convictions. Therefore, the negative impact on women who wear the niqab in France will be immediate. Second, one of the main justifications for the legislation is to promote the assimilation of certain groups into French society. The legislation is doing quite the opposite. Muslims in France and the rest of the world consider this act as hostile legislation targeting Muslims. The fact that a woman who wears the niqab is either fined or forced to take a citizenship class gives clear indication that wearing the niqab is seen as un-French. This can only deepen the isolation of the Muslim community within France. Finally, the one positive aspect of the legislation is that it penalizes any person who forces a woman to cover her face. This indicates that womens freedom of choice is considered to be one of the major pillars of this legislation. However, the legislation instead assumes a paternal role by forcing women not to cover their faces even if they choose to do so, stripping them of their freedom of choice. </p>

<p>Muslim practices have been the subject of many European legislators focus lately. The attempts to ban the Islamic face veil have been spreading throughout Europe and were preceded by the infamous <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/12/switzerland-minaret-ban-challenged-in.php">Minarets ban</a> in Switzerland in November of 2009. The West's official policy after the terrorist attacks of September 11th, and the subsequent terrorist attacks in Europe, was to try to build bridges between the West and Muslim communities all over the world. In the United States, this was clearly established by President Obama's so-called <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/NewBeginning/">Cairo Speech</a> and the different outreach programs adopted by his administration right after his inauguration. However, measures like the niqab ban in France or others being considered around Europe are achieving the opposite result. </p>

<p>In the United States, the current hateful and Islamophobic rhetoric regarding the proposed Islamic center in lower Manhattan is creating an even bigger gap between Muslims and the West in general. During the course of the debate, the entire Islamic faith came under attack instead of just the proposed Islamic center. As the face veil is being called un-French, over time, Muslims in the United States are being called un-American. </p>

<p>I was in Saudi Arabia when the issue of the proposed Islamic center was starting to become a major news item in the US. The issue received very close coverage by the local Saudi media and was the subject of public attention. The re-established relationship between the Obama administration and the Muslim public in Saudi Arabia was undergoing a tough test, and the Saudi public was paying close attention to the outcome of the debate. Unfortunately, the debate degraded towards Islamophobic rhetoric, causing the positive effects of the Cairo Speech to erode over a very short period of time. This was only compounded by the plans to burn the Quran on the anniversary of 9/11 by a pastor in Florida. </p>

<p>Before visiting Saudi Arabia, I worked with the legal department at the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) over the summer. The main task of the legal department is to deal with discrimination cases based on national origin and religion, as well as hate crimes. Over the period of two moths, I dealt with numerous cases related to employment discrimination where the religious practices of the employee were at issue. Recently, the office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) stated that the number of claims of bias against Muslims in the workplace in 2009 was even higher than the in the year after the 9/11 attacks. The claims of bias against Muslims this year will very likely increase as a result of the American publics attitude towards the proposed Islamic Center and the attempt to burn the Quran by the Florida pastor. Indeed, the EEOC has reported a sharp spike in the number of claims since the two incidents occurred. In the same fashion, there has been an alarming increase in the number of hate crimes targeting the Arab and Muslim communities. <a href="http://www.adc.org/media/press-releases/2010/august-2010/special-advisory-be-cautious-report-hate-crimes-immediately">Within a period of few days</a>, "a taxicab driver in New York City (NYC) [was] viciously slashed with a knife after being asked if he was a Muslim; a drunken man [walked] into a mosque in NYC and [urinated] on the prayer rugs after screaming at worshippers gathered for evening prayers; and a mosque in California [was] vandalized twice." The atmosphere now is quite similar to that felt by Muslims in the United States right after the 9/11 attacks. </p>

<p>Groups like the ADC and the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) have issued Special Advisories to the Arab and Muslim communities in the United States to be cautious and report any incidents or hate crimes. However, the situation now is different as opposed to that which immediately followed the 9/11 attacks. Hostility towards Islam in the US, as well as the legislation in France, is backed by public opinion. There is an alarming increase in the number of political candidates in the United States who echo Islamphobic rhetoric in order to acquire more votes and enhance their political visibility. If these politicians are successful, legislation similar to the French niqab ban might be proposed in the US after the mid-term elections. This would lead to greater alienation of the Muslim community in the United States, particularly where they become the target of hate crimes. This type of legislation would further affirm the Muslim worlds recent conviction that the differences between the West and the Islamic world is irreconcilable.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Ratification of New START treaty needed</title>
		<link>https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2010/09/ratification-of-new-start-treaty-needed/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>David Krieger</strong> [President, <a href="www.wagingpeace.org">Nuclear Age Peace Foundation</a>]: "In April 2009, President Obama went to Prague and spoke out for a world free of nuclear weapons.  "I state clearly and with conviction," he said, "America's commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons."  He indicated that he was prepared to take necessary steps to advance this cause.  In order "to reduce our warheads and stockpiles," he promised to negotiate a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with the Russians during the year.  This treaty, known as New START, took longer than anticipated to negotiate and was signed by Presidents Obama and Medvedev on April 8, 2010.  The next month, the treaty was submitted to the Senate for ratification.</p>

                <p>While the agreement was being negotiated, the first START agreement expired, ending the provisions for verification between the US and Russia.  Since December 2009, there have been no verification procedures in place for conducting inspections of the other side's nuclear arsenal.  This is a gap that many analysts have noted badly needs filling.  It is one of the principal arguments in favor of ratification.  Beyond this, though, failure to ratify would be a serious setback in US-Russian relations, and would indicate that further progress on nuclear disarmament is stalled and unlikely to proceed.</p>

                <p>The principal provisions of the new treaty would lower the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads on each side to 1,550 (down about a third from current requirements under the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty) and the number of deployed delivery vehicles to 700.  There are some nuances to the counting that affect the final numbers, such as counting each bomber as one nuclear warhead despite the fact that each bomber could carry up to 24 warheads.  The Russians also expressed concerns over US plans to continue to deploy missile defenses in Europe, which the Russians believe affect the strategic balance between the two countries in a manner unfavorable to them.  They indicated that, at some point, US deployment of missile defenses could cause them to withdraw from the treaty.  </p>

                <p>A number of conservatives in the US, including Senator Jim DeMint, have expressed the view that the Russian position opposing deployment of US missile defenses should not constrain the US missile defense program.  Others, including Senator Jon Kyl, have taken the position that the US should devote more resources over the next ten years to modernizing the nuclear arsenal and infrastructure and the means for delivery of nuclear weapons.  President Obama has sought to head off these concerns preemptively by committing to $80 billion for modernizing nuclear weapons over the next ten years and $100 billion for improving nuclear weapons delivery systems.  These funds will be added to the more than $50 billion annually already committed to supporting the US nuclear arsenal, a larger amount than during the Cold War.  </p>

                <p>The US nuclear modernization program will increase our capacity to produce new nuclear weapons and will send a message to the world that the US continues to rely upon its nuclear arsenal for security. Even with this extra $180 billion commitment, some conservatives are unlikely to ever be satisfied with the treaty.  John Bolton, a former US Ambassador to the United Nations in the George W. Bush administration, has called New START "unilateral disarmament."  He has worried publicly that the agreement "will severely limit our small-war capabilities." </p>

                <p>Against this background, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on September 16, 2010 <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/09/us-senate-committee-approves-russia-nuclear-arms-reduction-treaty.php">voted</a> 14 to 4 in favor of sending the <a href="http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/140035.pdf">New START agreement</a> [PDF] to the full Senate for debate.  The majority included three Republicans, more than was expected.  Does this bode well for Senate ratification of the treaty?  This remains unclear.  It suggests, though, that all Republicans will not vote as a block against ratification, which would sink the treaty.  Senator Richard Lugar showed leadership, along with Senator John Kerry, in pushing the treaty to the Senate floor.  Their joint leadership, along with that of President Obama, will remain important in seeking the 67 votes needed for the treaty's ratification.  </p>

                <p>Failure to ratify would be a major setback not only for the Obama administration, but also for the prospects of achieving President Obama's vision, and that of many other committed leaders, of a world without nuclear weapons.  Failure to ratify the New START agreement would diminish the prospects for a future free of nuclear catastrophe and even of a human future.  The promise of continuing to modernize the US nuclear arsenal has already been pledged as a price extracted for Senate ratification.  If this price is paid and there is no Senate ratification, it would signal the worst of all possible outcomes for those who seek an end to the nuclear weapons threat to humanity."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Jeppesen Dataplan</em> that the time is right for Congress to codify a state secrets privilege that insures both accountability and the protection of legitimate national security interests....<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/vhansen.jpg" width="126" align="left" hspace="0" vspace="2" /></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5" /></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1" /></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/lfriedman.jpg" width="126" align="left" hspace="0" vspace="2" /></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5" /></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1" /></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>E</b></font>arlier this month, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit decided the case of <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/09/08/08-15693.pdf"><em>Bynyam v. Jeppesen Dataplan</em></a>. This case represents the first time a federal circuit court has weighed in on the Obama administration's use of the state secrets privilege to seek dismissal of civil claims arising from allegations of physical and other abuse that occurred as part of the government's extraordinary renditions program. When the Obama administration came into office, there was hope that the government would either stop or limit its reliance on the state secrets privilege to prevent such litigation, and that the government would be more forthcoming about its extraordinary renditions program.</p>

<p>The Obama administration made some early moves that hinted at a greater degree of openness, giving the Attorney General the sole authority to assert the state secrets privilege. By both raising the approval level and centralizing it in the office of the Attorney General, the administration rasied the expectation that the privilege would be asserted less often - indeed, only when absolutely necessary. Nonetheless, the Obama administration's assertion of the privilege in <em>Jeppesen</em> looks much like the former Bush administration's assertion of the privilege in numerous cases.</p>

<p>A sharply divided court of appeals in <em>Jeppesen</em> upheld the Obama administration's invocation of the privilege. The administration asserted that any litigation of the issues raised in the claim at issue would lead to disclosures harmful to U.S. national security. The court's conclusions are not surprising and are consistent with how courts generally treated this issue when the Bush administration made similar assertions.</p>

<p>The decision confirms that there exists an expansive state secrets privilege available to the executive, which can prevail over legitimate claims without any judicial oversight other than a review of the basis for the privilege itself. Though the <em>Jeppesen</em> court repeatedly emphasized the narrowness of the privilege, for the parties to the case the effect of the privilege's asertion is vast, and, given the deference shown the President, it could affect the disposition of a wide array of cases. Of course, the court recognized that, while all privileges are contrary to basic rules of fairness and justice, still they can be justified if the good they serve is sufficiently important--and few would doubt the importance of national security.</p>

<p>The problem with the privilege is that we, the public, have no way of knowing what is really at stake. When a court accepts that the privilege applies, in whole or in part, it prevents cases from going forward and allows the conduct of government officials who were engaging in extraordinary rendition to remain clouded in mystery. The state secrets privilege can be invoked <em>ex parte</em> and in some cases without even disclosing the information at issue to the court. Because the privilege can be asserted by the executive at his discretion, we must place our trust in the courts to police its use. This trust of the courts may have no parallel; here, judges are truly our proxies in a way they are not in other instances.</p>

<p>But is a judge a reasonable proxy - will courts keep the executive appropriately accountable? History, experience and our constitutional structure tells us that our best proxies for checking and unjustified assertion of executive power are not judges but our elected representatives in Congress. The <em>Jeppesen</em> decision is blunt in its suggestions about how Congress can effectively check the President in respect to state secrets and provide a remedy to these plaintiffs. Indeed, the court suggested that the state secrets doctrine is judge-made law, which means Congress can act to amend and modify it to better ensure accountability and transparency while respecting the need to keep some matters secret.</p>

<p>Such Congressional action is appropriate. This is another area in which the Constitution contemplates a national security power shared between Congress and the President, and we must hope that Congress will act to keep the President in check. Members of Congress should recognize that, when the President prevails on a state secrets claim, Congress also is being denied an opportunity to understand and weigh in on important policy matters, some of which may be illegal, and the consequences of which Congress inevitably will have to address. Congress accordingly ought to have have an institutional interest in seeing that the President not use state secrets claims effectively to withhold information - and, indirectly, legitimate policymaking power - from Congress itself.</p>

<p>As <em>Jeppesen</em> demonstrates, the courts have essentially acknowledged that they, as an institution, are not ideally suited to work out the parameters of the state secrets privilege. They lack competence in the area of national security - or at least perceive that they lack competence. Yet the privilege concerns matters too central and too important to leave to executive discretion alone. The time is right for Congress to act - to codify a state secrets privilege that insures both accountability and the protection of legitimate national security interests.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Gonzales, University College London M.A. Human Rights '10, is a current intern with <a href="http://www.survivalinternational.org/">Survival International</a>. He writes on the Bushmen of the Central Kalahari Game Reserve's struggle to secure water rights from the Botswanan government...<br />
<hr height="1"><br />
<strong><font size="3">O</font></strong>n July 21 the High Court of Botswana (the High Court) <a href="http://assets.survivalinternational.org/documents/371/CKGR_judgment.pdf">dismissed</a> [PDF] a case concerning the Bushmen of the Central Kalahari Game Reserve's (CKGR) legal entitlement to access their local waterhole.  More specifically, the High Court ruled that the government was not obliged to allow the Bushmen to reopen an existing borehole that the government had itself sealed eight years previously. The court likewise ruled that Botswana's Water Act did not confer rights on the Bushmen to sink new boreholes within the reserve. </p>

<p>In Botswana, Survival International provides administrative, research, and legal assistance to the Bushmen and their lawyers.  Internationally, Survival acts as an advocacy organization for the Bushmen that keeps the international community and media informed of the situation's present state both in the CKGR and in the High Courtroom.  As a master's student in the field of human rights, I assist Survival in keeping the international community updated on the legal battles of the Bushmen of the CKGR.</p>

<p><img alt="Botswana2006celebration.png" title="Members of the Bushmen tribe celebrate the 2006 court victory." src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Botswana2006celebration.png" width="270" height="180" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" />The July 21st decision is the most recent manifestation of a legal problem that has been plaguing the Bushmen for years. The Bushmen's legal trouble began when Botswana's government first capped the borehole (the Bushmen's only reliable source of drinking water) in 2002 and simultaneously forcibly evicted the Bushmen from their ancestral homeland within the CKGR.  The High Court eventually <a href="http://www.saflii.org/bw/cases/BWHC/2006/1.html">ruled</a> in 2006 that these evictions were illegal and that the Bushmen had a right to return to their traditional lands.  </p>

<p>While the court did deem the evictions illegal, the government has yet to remove the borehole cap that had initially been implemented concurrent to forcible eviction. The government continues to disallow the Bushmen from uncapping the borehole and the purpose of this refusal appears to be to deter as many Bushmen as possible from exercising their constitutional right to return to the homes from which they were illegally evicted. As such, hundreds of Bushmen remain stranded outside of the CKGR in government relocation camps that often foster high levels of alcoholism, HIV/AIDS, abuse, and other problems previously unknown to the Bushmen. For those that have managed to return to their lands, the journey to transport water into the reserve via donkey is over 250 miles roundtrip. </p>

<p>The Bushmen and Survival are currently in the process of taking this case to the Botswana Court of Appeal, and Survivor is currently working with the Bushmen and their attorneys to structure the argument for this appeal.  The judgement of the High Court in July dismissed the case based on a perceived discrepancy between Sections 6 and 9 of the <a href="http://www1.eis.gov.bw/EIS/Policies/Environmental%20Policies/CAP%2034-01%20Water%20Act.pdf">Botswana Water Act</a>. [PDF] The court ruled that the provisions of Section 6, defining which peoples possess an inherent right to water, must yield to those of Section 9, specifying the requirements for obtaining water rights and permits for those without an "inherent right."  The appeal will likely argue that the High Court was wrong to hold that sections 6 and 9 are mutually inconsistent, and that section 9 takes precedence over section 6.  The result of the High Court's decision was to deprive section 6 of any effect at all, which cannot have been the intention of the Botswana National Assembly in enacting the Botswana Water Act.  The more specific details of the Bushmen's new argument, however, are still being formulated, and at this time it is premature to predict the appeal's potential for success. </p>

<p>If this appeal fails, all domestic remedies will have been exhausted, and it will become necessary to then proceed to the use of international legal instruments. The plight of the Bushmen of the CKGR exists at the intersection of two increasingly accepted rights under international law: indigenous rights and the right to water. Both indigenous rights and the right to water make available a variety of human rights instruments and principles of potential utility to the Bushmen of Botswana in the forms of treaty law and customary law, respectively. </p>

<p><img alt="BotswanaDuxee.png" title="Xoroxloo Duxee died of dehydration after the Bushmen's water hole was disabled. Her relatives were arrested trying to take food and water to her" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/BotswanaDuxee.png" width="233" height="172" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" />A substantial body of evidence has emerged supporting the notion of indigenous rights as <em>jus cogens</em> norms of customary international law. The two foundations necessary for the formation of a norm of customary international law, state practice and <em>opinio juris</em>, are both present.  Numerous prior cases such as <a href="http://csc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1973/1973scr0-313/1973scr0-313.html">Calder et al v. the Attorney General of British Columbia </a> in Canada, <a href="http://www.austlii.org/au/cases/cath/high_ct/175clr1.html">Mabo v. Queensland (No. 2)</a> in Australia, and <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/iachr/AwasTingnicase.html">Awas Tingni v. Nicaragua</a> and <a href="http://www.malaysianbar.org.my/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=1835">Sagong bin Tasi & Ors v State of Selangor</a> in Malaysia recognize indigenous land rights.  As such, all are testament to state practice in a variety of cultural and legal traditions. <a href="http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2003/18.html">Richtersveld Community and Ors v. Alexkor Ltd and Anorin</a> in South Africa and <a href="http://www.elaw.org/node/5317">Comunidad Indigena Aymara Chusmiza v. Usmagama</a> [Spanish] in Chile are particularly relevant given that they are evidence of indigenous rights in an African setting and of indigenous peoples' right to water, respectively. And, perhaps most significantly, the aforementioned 2006 High Court ruling in Botswana is itself evidence of state practice of recognizing indigenous peoples' rights.  </p>

<p>Tellingly, in all but the Chile case, the courts deemed that the indigenous rights claims in dispute were legally valid, despite the fact that the states themselves were not actually legally bound to recognize such rights (the Chilean Supreme Court ruled unanimously that Region I Aymara communities had a right to water owing to Chile's commitments under <a href="http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/convde.pl?C169">ILO Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention 169</a>). The fact that these states recognized indigenous rights absent legal obligations to do so is indicative of <em>opinio juris</em>.  The notion of <em>opinio juris</em> concerning indigenous rights is further supported by the near-universal acceptance (Botswana included) of the <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/en/drip.html">UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</a> (UNDRIP).  While not legally binding, UNDRIP plainly represents the written confirmation of state support for the principle of indigenous rights.  Only the United States and Canada remain opposed to UNDRIP, and both are currently reviewing their stances regarding the document.  Thus, a significant number of states have confirmed indigenous rights through voluntary treaty obligations and domestic court decisions, and equally important to the recognition of customary international law, very few states have rejected these rights.</p>

<p>Whether collective indigenous rights have become customary international law is currently the topic of much debate, but state practice and <em>opinio juris</em> on the matter do seem to indicate the emergence of such a norm.  It is a notion that has received the support of James Anaya, the current UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people.  Anaya even claims that <em>opinio juris</em> is evident in the behaviour of the four states that initially voted against the Declaration: the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand (the latter two later have since reversed their opposition to the Declaration).  If it were decided that indigenous rights are a part of customary international law, the legal position of the CKGR Bushmen would be greatly strengthened.</p>

<p>If the case for the customary nature of indigenous rights proves unsuccessful, or an inefficient allocation of legal resources, it would be most prudent to then seek legal remedy for the Bushmen through Botswana's international human rights treaty obligations. The right to water is explicitly mentioned in both the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm">Convention on the Rights of the Child</a> (CRC) and the <a href="http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm"> Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women</a> (CEDAW).  Botswana is party to both treaties. In this instance, it is most likely CEDAW that has the greatest potential utility, owing to the individual complaint mechanism present in its optional protocol, which Botswana has also ratified.  While the CRC is the most widely accepted human rights treaty in existence, and thus a very significant piece of human rights legislation, it lacks such a mechanism.</p>

<p>The individual complaint procedure guaranteed in CEDAW's optional protocol permits individuals within ratifying states to personally submit complaints to the convention's monitoring body. Article 14(2)(h) of CEDAW explicitly states that rural women have a right to a water supply.  The Bushmen of the CKGR therefore have the option of submitting an individual complaint to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women. The Committee could then pass judgment on the legality of Botswana's continued refusal to allow Bushmen women to uncap the borehole and access their water source. </p>

<p><img alt="BotswanaBushmenChildren.png" title="Bushmen Children" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/BotswanaBushmenChildren.png" width="234" height="156" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" />There are several other possible legal arguments in international human rights law that are potentially applicable to the Bushmen's case, but less useful upon further inspection. A strong case can be made that the government of Botswana is violating the Bushmen's right to self-determination. This right, as guaranteed in Article 1 of the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR), by definition includes the ability of peoples to "freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development."  The article further states that peoples may "freely dispose of their natural wealth and resources," and "in no case may a people be deprived of its own means of subsistence." The relationship of these clauses to the denial of access to water is self-evident. Botswana, however, has not ratified the treaty's optional protocol providing for an individual complaint mechanism. As such, while Botswana is legally bound to uphold its obligations under the ICCPR, the only manner in which it can be held accountable for violating ICCPR-protected rights is if the Human Rights Committee were to investigate the plight of the Bushmen on its own volition.  Needless to say, despite the validity of the CKGR Bushmen's legal claims, an attempt to rectify the situation via the right to self-determination may prove ineffective to the point of uselessness.</p>

<p>Regardless, discussion of the relationship between indigenous rights, the right to water, Botswana, and the Bushmen of the CKGR is only worthwhile if it can be practically applied.  Thus, we return to the future of the Bushmen and their possible courses of legal action.  </p>

<p>The aforementioned appeal at the national level in Botswana is certainly the most potentially effective method for the Bushmen to regain access to water.  It goes without saying that working within the domestic court system avoids the delays, hazards, and obstacles to enforceability that often accompany even the most landmark of international human rights mandates.  If the appeal fails, however, the next step would be to attempt to utilize whichever international human rights legal instrument would prove most efficient, as the Bushmen's inability to access water is a problem in need of the most prompt solution available.</p>

<p>Attempting to prove the customary nature of indigenous rights, as helpful as it would be, is a process that will likely take years or even decades to complete.  Furthermore, successful use of such a principle in a legal argument is likely even further down the road.  As such, in the immediate future it will prove more advantageous to the Bushmen to work within the framework of Botswana's obligations under international human rights law than to attempt to prove the customary nature of indigenous rights.</p>

<p>CEDAW may be the most effective and rapid means for realizing the rights of the Bushmen in an international context, as the Bushmen's argument falls within CEDAW's purview and Botswana is a party to the optional individual complaint mechanism. The power of the CEDAW's treaty monitoring body is limited in the same manner as all quasi-judicial bodies, but its judgements have proven successful in implementing change in the past.  Additionally, the Committee would be able to operate independently of Botswanan laws, like the Water Act, that have been used to prevent the Bushmen from accessing water in the CKGR.  The ability of treaty law to supersede domestic legislation is guaranteed by the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/1_1_1969.pdf">Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties</a> [PDF], which is itself a part of customary international law. Article 27 of the Convention states that parties to the treaty may not invoke internal law as a justification for failure to perform the duties specified in a treaty.  </p>

<p>Regardless of which method is chosen, be it domestic law, international law, or some combination of the two, it is paramount that the Bushmen of the Central Kalahari Game Reserve are allowed to access their water if there is any chance for them to fully realize the rights to which they are entitled.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robyn Monaco, Rutgers Newark School of Law '11 and Political Science Masters Candidate '12, writes about her experience with Maritime Writs of Attachment in the New York banking industry and the veritable blizzard of filings brought on by a single court decision...<br />
<hr height="1"><br />
<font size="3"><strong>F</strong></font>requently with international overseas transactions, banks that are not in the same consortium must use an intermediary bank to move funds. Many of the intermediary or clearing house banks are located in New York, but the actual electronic funds transfer (EFT) is simply an intangible digital adjustment. Upon instruction from the originating bank, the intermediary bank debits one bank and credits another. When I started law school as a part-time student in 2007, my employer, a New York intermediary bank, asked me to handle the maritime Rule B attachments. These attachments can arise from any number of maritime disputes - from damage to a ship, cargo or dock, to delays in port, to myriad maritime contract claims.</p>

<p>Maritime Writs of Attachment under Federal Admiralty Rule B rose to prominence in New York as a result of <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1113904.html"><span class="casename">Winter Storm Shipping Ltd v. TPI</span></a>. The decision in <span class="casename">Winter Storm</span> allowed money to be seized as it passed through New York intermediary banks in the form of an EFT. <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/RuleB.htm">Rule B</a> allows a claimant to file an <em>ex parte</em> verified complaint against a defendant who cannot be found within the jurisdiction. A writ is issued to attach the defendant's tangible or intangible property held with a garnishee in the district. <span class="casename">Winter Storm</span> interpreted "tangible or intangible property" to include EFTs moving through intermediary banks within the Southern District of New York. Pursuant to <span class="casename">Winter Storm</span>, after the initial personal service, supplemental service could be faxed or e-mailed daily per the garnishee bank's permission.</p>

<p>By 2007 over two hundred writs were being faxed to New York intermediary banks every day, each one seeking an average of two to three million dollars in damages. Each EFT wire passing through an intermediary bank was scanned for the defendant's name and if found, a maritime attorney would review the matter. If the defendant was either the originating party or beneficiary, the funds were suspended pending judgment. The attachment of the funds in New York then served as property for the purposes of jurisdiction over the foreign defendant. Only then could a judgment be entered to turn over the funds.</p>

<p>Due to the effect of <span class="casename">Winter Storm</span> in the Second Circuit, the Rule B attachment business in New York grew exponentially. By early 2009, my bank was receiving over six hundred writs by fax daily, representing over a billion dollars in damages. The judges were faced with a constant stream of Rule B matters in the courtroom. Plaintiffs had filed over nine hundred lawsuits - one third of new matters in the Southern District. Each day, I processed up to twenty EFTs stopped by the scan. The bank's attorney would notify the plaintiff's attorney, and no funds could be released without the plaintiff's consent. </p>

<p>To deal with the substantial increase in volume, my bank purchased four more double fax machines to handle the ten reams of paper printed every day. The bank did not recoup any costs for increased operating expenditures. Three full-time employees were devoted to the maritime attachments. It was my responsibility to process the wires when they were stopped and notify the attorney.  I kept spreadsheets of the money that was being stopped and released or held. The delay caused great distress for the banks and their customers. As these were <em>ex parte</em> orders, a wire stop was the first time a defendant was even aware that there was any legal action pending. In addition, the other party to the wire transfer had nothing to do with the dispute, and did not know or understand why funds could not go through. The banks were subject to the court order, and were powerless to release the funds. I was intrigued by this area of the law, and discussed these new developments with the attorneys. It was also a prominent topic of discussion in the Southern District courts.</p>

<p>Industry-wide meetings were held to discuss the phenomenon of the Rule B attachment. Solutions ranged from model forms for the court to bank charges for serving the writs. In addition to the burden on the courts and the banks, if Rule B attachments on EFTs continued, the use of the U.S. dollar in international transactions could have been compromised. Companies began using another currency to conduct maritime transactions, trying to avoid the uncertainty of an intercepted wire transfer thwarting international commerce. The possibility that New York would eventually cease to be the center of international finance was also a concern of the banks.<br />
 <br />
The flurry of Rule B activity came to an abrupt halt in October of 2009 with the sweeping decision in <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1498495.html"><span class="casename">The Shipping Corp. of India Ltd v. Jaldhi Overseas PTE Ltd</span></a>. <span class="casename">Jaldhi</span> held that electronic funds transfers are not subject to Rule B attachments while in the temporary "possession" of intermediary banks, overruling <span class="casename">Winter Storm</span>. The court looked to New York law, which does not allow attachment of EFTs, stating that funds are neither the originator's nor the beneficiary's when passing through intermediary banks (<a href="http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/nycode/BNK">N.Y.U.C.C. Law &#167; &#167; 4-A-502-04</a>).</p>

<p>In furtherance of <span class="casename">Jaldhi</span>, <span class="casename"><a href="ttp://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1498841.html">Hawknet, Ltd. v. Overseas Shipping Agencies</a></span> concluded that <span class="casename">Jaldhi</span> applied retroactively to any outstanding Rule B attachment. The holding severely affected some law firms. There were cottage industries that had relied primarily on Rule B attachments during an already crippling economy. In addition, Rule B attachments were no longer available to those who had suffered damages in shipping transactions. </p>

<p>When the Shipping Corp. of India (SCI) petitioned the United States Supreme Court for <em>certiorari</em>, I checked almost daily for an update. The Clearing House Association L.L.C. submitted an <em>amicus curiae</em> brief in opposition to the petition. Then the <a href="http://www.mlaus.org/">Maritime Law Association</a> motioned for leave to file an <em>amicus curiae</em> brief in support of the petitioner. I discussed the issue from every angle with co-workers and attorneys. Which party did the funds belong to during an electronic funds transfer? Was this a federal admiralty issue under the United States Code or did New York state law apply? In an age of technological advances like the World Wide Web, is personal jurisdiction an outdated concept? We were hoping the Supreme Court would answer some of these questions. Unfortunately, <em>certiorari</em> was denied on March 22, 2010. The decision in <span class="casename">Jaldhi</span> would stand, which pleased the banks and courts. By not hearing the case, the Supreme Court left the door open for future adjustments within the Southern District of New York. </p>

<p>Ambitious maritime lawyers saw no reason to let the matter rest, seeking to re-attach those funds still being held at intermediary banks. However, the Second Circuit found that wrongly attached funds will not establish a presence in the jurisdiction and the retroactive application in Hawknet will not be mitigated by equitable concerns. See, e.g., <span class="casename">Cosco Bulk Carrier Co. v. Stratus Shipping Pty. Ltd</span>. Further, retroactivity will not be reviewed on a case-by-case rebuttable presumption. See, e.g., <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1534762.html"><span class="casename">Scanscot Shipping Servs. GmbH v. Metales Tracomex Ltd.</span></a>.</p>

<p>Thankfully I still have my job with the bank, and have moved on to other things. Occasionally I will process a release of funds when a court order is issued. My goal is to continue learning about international transactions and global compliance. Technological advances in global finance have created a world virtually free of borders for international commerce. When disputes arise, savvy attorneys will be in demand to unravel the conflicts between international, federal, and state law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Case for Judicial Minimalism in Pakistan</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist Saroop Ijaz, an advocate before the Lahore High Court in Pakistan, says that the country's courts should more often limit themselves to issues brought before them, so that the other branches of government and the people of the Pakistan may first have the opportunity to grapple with particularly contentious issues...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/Saroop.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>T</b></font>he Supreme Court and the High Court of Pakistan have been judicially active in their endeavor to institute effective checks and balances on the government. The courts, although driven by noble motives, are infringing upon the spheres of the other two branches of the government. The rulings of the courts upon matters belonging to the legislative and public sphere are undermining the credibility of the Parliament and denying the possibility of evolution to a nascent democracy in Pakistan.</p>

<p>Judicial minimalism, made popular by the American jurist Cass Sunstein, simply put is the philosophy that argues that judges should adjudicate the particular dispute at hand and not engage in broad theorizing that effects people who are not party to the dispute. In doing so, the judges promote deliberative democracy, encouraging the political branches and society as a whole to debate the core issues and arrive at a more sustainable consensus. I believe that the Supreme Court of Pakistan should act with minimalism. In an embryonic democracy, plagued with a state of ethical and political uncertainty, such as Pakistan, the courts may not always have the best or the ultimate answers to all the questions.</p>

<p>The Lahore High Court recently decided to impose a ban on Facebook, YouTube, and Google, amongst other websites through an interim order, alleging these websites contained blasphemous content. The ban was subsequently lifted, but the case remains pending before the Lahore High Court. The ostensibly blasphemous content on these websites generated a public discourse regarding the scope and boundaries of "freedom of speech." But before the debate could engage the public and reach a social consensus, the High Court intervened.  Any debate now carries the possibility of contempt proceedings, since it would be commenting on a <em>sub judice</em> matter (i.e. pending before the court).</p>

<p>Similarly, the Supreme Court is hearing the petition challenging the constitutionality of the <a href="http://www.pak.gov.pk/Constitution/Full%20text%20of%2018th%20Amendment%20Bill.pdf">18th Amendment to the Constitution</a> [PDF], which curbed the powers of the President to unilaterally dissolve Parliament. The 18th Amendment was passed by the Parliament unanimously after more than one year of debate inside and outside of the Parliament.  The first legal issue to be decided in the petition was regarding maintainability (i.e. whether the Supreme Court had the power to review an amendment made to the Constitution).  The argument underlying this issue is that the Supreme Court is empowered to review constitutional amendments if they violate the "Basic Structure" of the Constitution. However, the Supreme Court in a long list of cases, with the most recent being Pakistan Lawyers Forum v. Federation of Pakistan, (PLD 2005 SC 719) has held that "...Limitations on the power of Parliament to make amendments to such basic structure, such limitations are to be exercised and enforced not by the judiciary (as in the case of conflict between a statute and Article 8), but by the body politic, i.e., the people of Pakistan." The Supreme Court admitted the petition in the 18th Amendment case, implying it is maintainable without overruling three decades of jurisprudence and precedents to the contrary.</p>

<p>The core question is not regarding the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, but rather what is the effect of extending the sphere of the Court's influence to matters that belong to the public sphere or other branches of the government. The 18th amendment case is an example of the Supreme Court ruling on (and possibly against) the unanimous consensus of the elected representatives of the people.</p>

<p>Another example is the <em>suo moto</em> (of its own motion) notice taken by Lahore High Court's Divisional Bench on the high price of sugar in the country. The superior courts in Pakistan are empowered to take <em>suo moto</em> cognizance of any matter the court feels is in public interest. In general terms, this power means the court can take up a matter and rule on it without anyone approaching the court. The court fixed the price of sugar at 40 Pakistani Rupees per kilogram, ignoring the market forces influencing the price. The court's credentials in economic management are open to debate. Although driven by the best of motives, the outcome was that neither the price nor the supply stabilized. This was question for the economists and Parliament, not for the courts. Similar examples can be found in the Supreme Court declaring the levy of the Carbon Tax as invalid and the <a href="http://jurist.org/forum/Pakistan%20Steel%20Mill%20Judgment.pdf">annulment of the privatization</a> [PDF] of the Pakistan Steel Mill. </p>

<p>Rather than the courts providing broad, sweeping judgments on controversial issues, judicial minimalism enhances democratic self-government by allowing public debates to stay in the political realm. For instance, the allegations of corruption on President Zardari and the existence of the <a href="http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/legislation/2007/NationalReconciliationOrdinance.html">National Reconciliation Ordinance</a> (NRO) were in full public view before the February 2008 elections. The Honorable Supreme Court had the constitutional power to strike down the NRO (which it did) and has the same power regarding the 18th Amendment. However, the court needs to be mindful of the unintended, adverse consequences of its decisions especially when the area involves a highly contentious question now receiving attention by the people.  In such areas, courts should be cognizant that, even relying on their own deepest convictions, they may err, especially when the decisions entails overturning the consensus of the people.</p>

<p>Judicial minimalism can promote democratic goals, given Pakistan's constitutional history of leaving certain things undecided, allowing opinion to form over time and stimulating the processes of democratic deliberation and public discourse. In certain cases, courts should wait for an actual dispute to come up before them. The independent Honorable Supreme Court has to resist the urge of setting everything right in one or a few cases. Sometimes people will put up with much hardship if they are permitted the freedom to draw their own conclusions, even though the conclusions may be wrong.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.tjsl.edu/faculty_m_cohn">Marjorie Cohn</a> of Thomas Jefferson School of Law says despite United Nations Human Rights Council findings that Israel clearly broke international law in its raid of the Gaza Strip Flotilla, the US has yet to condemn the action...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org//forumy/cohncolor.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>O</b></font>n May 31, the Israeli military attacked a flotilla of ships in International waters. The vessels were carrying humanitarian supplies to the people in the Gaza Strip, who suffer under a punishing blockade by Israel. The stated aims of the flotilla were to draw international attention to the situation in Gaza and the effect of the blockade; to break the blockade; and to deliver humanitarian assistance and supplies to Gaza.</p>

<p>During the attack, Israeli soldiers killed 9 people, seriously wounded more than 50, and detained 750. They also confiscated or destroyed equipment worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>The United Nations Human Rights Council sent an independent fact finding mission to investigate violations of international law resulting from the Israeli attacks on the flotilla. The Mission, with Judge Karl T. Hudson-Philips, Q.C., retired Judge of the International Criminal Court presiding, interviewed 112 witnesses and examined forensic and other evidence, assisted by experts in forensic pathology, military issues, and firearms. Israel refused to cooperate with the independent investigation.</p>

<p>In a <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/15session/A.HRC.15.21_en.pdf">56-page draft report</a> [PDF], released on September 21, the Mission concluded that the Israeli military "demonstrated levels of totally unnecessary and incredible violence. It betrayed an unacceptable level of brutality. Such conduct," the report added, "cannot be justified or condoned on security or any others grounds. It constituted grave violations of human rights law and international humanitarian law."</p>

<p>The Mission made the following findings:</p>

<p>Passengers on the vessels and their luggage were subjected to "security checks similar to those found in airports before boarding, including body searches," to ensure that they were not carrying weapons. "At no stage was a request made by the Israeli Navy for the cargo to be inspected."</p>

<p>The Israelis fired live ammunition from an Israeli helicopter onto the top deck of the Turkish ship, Mavi Marmara, before soldiers boarded the vessel  by descending from the aircraft. Although some of the passengers used chairs, sticks, a box of plates and other objects to<br />
resist the soldiers, there was "no evidence to suggest that any of the passengers used firearms or that any firearms were taken on board the ship."</p>

<p>During the operation to secure control of the top deck, the Israeli forces landed soldiers from three helicopters in a 15-minute period. The use of live ammunition resulted in fatal injuries to four passengers and injuries to at least 19 others, 14 with gunshot wounds.</p>

<p>Israeli soldiers continued shooting at passengers who were already wounded, with live ammunition, soft baton charges and plastic bullets. "There was considerable live fire from Israeli soldiers on the top deck and a number of passengers were injured or killed whilst trying to take refuge inside the door or assisting others to do so."</p>

<p>Furkan Dogan, a 19-year old with dual Turkish and U.S. citizenship, was one of the people killed by the Israeli forces. He was hit with live fire while filming with a small video camera on the top deck. He received five bullet wounds. "All of the entry wounds were on the back of his body, except for the face wound, which was delivered at point blank range while he was lying on the ground on his back."</p>

<p>Many people were forced to kneel on the outer deck in harsh conditions for many hours and people were subjected to physical mistreatment and verbal abuse, unnecessarily tight handcuffing, and the denial of access to toilets and food.</p>

<p>Israeli authorities confiscated, withheld, and in some cases destroyed the private property of many hundreds of passengers on board the vessels.</p>

<p>There is a "severe humanitarian situation in Gaza, the destruction of the economy and the prevention of reconstruction." Israel's blockade was "inflicting disproportionate damage upon the civilian population" in Gaza, and is therefore illegal. Article 33 of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebList?ReadForm&id=380&t=art">Fourth Geneva Convention</a> prohibits collective punishment of civilians under occupation. One of the principal motives behind Israel's imposition of the blockade was "a desire to punish the people of the Gaza Strip for having elected Hamas" in the 2005 election. There is "no doubt that Israel's actions and policies amount to collective punishment." In this conclusion, the Mission explicitly supported the findings of Richard Falk, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, as well as those of the International Committee of the Red Cross.</p>

<p>The firing of rockets and other munitions of war into Israeli territory from Gaza "constitutes serious violations of international and international humanitarian law. But action in response which constitutes collective punishment of the civilian population of Gaza is not lawful in the present or in any circumstances."</p>

<p>Israel has continuously occupied Gaza despite its unilateral withdrawal of military forces in 2005. Since then, "abject poverty" among refugees has tripled. Israel determines the conditions of life within Gaza. Israel controls the border crossings and the territorial sea adjacent to Gaza, and it has declared a virtual blockade and limits to the fishing zone, thereby regulating economic activity in that zone. Israel maintains complete control of the airspace above Gaza through continuous surveillance, and it makes military incursions and from time to time hits targets within the Gaza Strip. Moreover, Israel regulates the local monetary market of Gaza based on the Israeli currency and controls taxes and customs duties.</p>

<p>The flotilla presented "no imminent threat but the interception was motivated by concerns about the possible propaganda victory that might be claimed by the organizers of the flotilla." There was no reasonable suspicion that the flotilla posed any military risk, and as a result "no case could be made to intercept the vessels in the exercise of belligerent rights or [UN Charter] Article 51 self-defence."</p>

<p>Not only was the Israeli interception of the flotilla unlawful, "the use of force by the Israeli forces in seizing control of the Mavi Marmara and other vessels was also prima facie unlawful since there was no legal basis for the Israeli forces to conduct an assault and interception in international waters."</p>

<p>Much of the force used by the Israeli soldiers onboard the Mavi Marmara and from the helicopters was "unnecessary, disproportionate, excessive and inappropriate and resulted in the wholly avoidable killing and maiming of a large number of civilian passengers." At least six of the killings, including that of Dogan, can be characterized as "extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions," which amounted to violations of the right to life and to physical integrity under articles 6 and 7 of the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR).</p>

<p>During the period of detention on board the Mavi Marmara, the passengers were subjected to cruel and inhuman treatment, which "did not respect the inherent dignity of persons who have been deprived of their liberty."</p>

<p>The Israeli military's treatment of the passengers on board the Mavi Marmara and in certain instances on board the Challenger 1 amounted to torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment, in violation of articles 7 and 10 of the ICCPR. The willful killing, torture or inhuman treatment and willfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health violated article 147 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.</p>

<p>Other violations included the arbitrary or illegal arrests or detentions, in violation of article 9 of the ICCPR and the parading of detainees at the quayside carrying "the hallmarks of a 'triumph'" which amounted to a "humiliating spectacle" in violation of article 13 of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/7c4d08d9b287a42141256739003e63bb/6fef854a3517b75ac125641e004a9e68">Third Geneva Convention</a>.</p>

<p>Serious incidents of physical violence perpetrated by the Israeli military and/or police officers at the Ben Gurion International Airport "clearly constituted grave violations" of the right to security of the person and to human dignity, in violation of article 9 of the ICCPR. In some instances, the treatment amounted to torture.</p>

<p>The confiscation of a large amount of video and photographic footage recorded on electronic and other media by passengers "represents a deliberate attempt by the Israeli authorities to suppress or destroy evidence and other information."</p>

<p>The ICCPR guarantees the victims judicial remedies and reparations proportionate to the gravity of the violations. Torture victims should be afforded medical and psychological care, and article 9 provides for a specific right to compensation.</p>

<p>"The perpetrators of the more serious crimes being masked cannot be identified without the assistance of the Israeli authorities," the Mission concluded, and urged the Israeli government to assist in their identification.</p>

<p><br />
Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the UN Human Rights Council a biased commission because it issued the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/12session/A-HRC-12-48.pdf">Goldstone Report</a> [PDF] , a 575-page document under the direction of noted Zionist Richard Goldstone, which found Israel guilty of international law violations in its December 2008 - January 2009 war on Gaza. During that war, 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis were killed.</p>

<p>Israel conducted its own investigation of the flotilla attack, known as the Turkel Commission. It refused to take testimony from any of the victims on the vessels.</p>

<p>UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon also commissioned an investigation, which undertook no primary witness investigation, largely relying on evidence from Israeli officers.</p>

<p>There is no evidence that the United States played any direct role in the attack on the flotilla.  However, U.S.-made and U.S.-financed Apache and Blackhawk helicopters, which Israel often employs, were likely used in the assault.  Any use of those weapons would violate the Arms Export Control Act, which prohibits any recipient of U.S. arms exports from using U.S. weapons except for security within its own borders or for self-defense.</p>

<p>Israel could not maintain its illegal occupation of the Palestinian territories without the support of the United States. Three weeks after Israel's deadly attack on the flotilla, 329 out of 435 members of the House of Representatives and 87 out of 100 senators wrote letters to President Barack Obama supporting what they called Israel's right to "self-defense."</p>

<p>Obama has failed to condemn Israel's actions on May 31, notwithstanding overwhelming evidence of its illegality. If Iran had attacked a humanitarian flotilla in international waters and killed 9 people, there would be certain retaliation from Washington.</p>

<p>Until our government stands up to the powerful Israel lobby in the United States, the Palestinian people, and our own humanity, will continue to be held hostage.</p>

United States of America</a>. Judge Virginia A. Phillips ruled that the 1993 policy "infringes the fundamental rights of United States servicemembers and prospective servicemembers and violates (a) the substantive due process rights guaranteed under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and (b) the rights to freedom of speech and to petition the Government for redress of grievances guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution." Weeks prior, on September 24th, U.S. District Judge Robert Leighton in Washington state ruled in <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/38097947/Maj-Margaret-Witt-v-US-Air-Force">Witt v. Department of the Air Force</a> that former Air Force Major Margaret Witt's discharge under DADT "did not significantly further the government's interests in promoting military readiness, unit morale, and cohesion," and that her discharge for a relationship with another woman violated both her procedural and substantive due process rights under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. Days before that decision, a <a href="http://coloradoindependent.com/62395/mccain-leads-dadt-filibuster-protests-too-much-after-success">filibuster</a> blocked the planned September 20th Senate vote on amending DADT, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/654.html">Title 10 United States Code (U.S.C.) Section 654</a>, "Policy concerning homosexuality in the armed forces."</p>

<p>Stripping away the <em>cause celebre</em> opposition by Lady Gaga and Log Cabin Republicans litigants amongst others against this particular law, the District Court's decision leaves untouched the military laws which criminalize some homosexual (and heterosexual) acts, and keeps intact military leaders' responsibility to model and to promote "exemplary conduct."</p>

<p>Effective, confident military forces depend upon the cohesive nature of good order and discipline. <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/Jul1998/x07301998_x729goad.html">The Department of Defense generally considers</a> conduct as "prejudicial to good order and discipline" if it calls into question a service member's objectivity, results in actual or an appearance of preferential treatment, undermines authority and compromises the chain of command. Congress determined, after much debate and consultation with the heads of each of the Armed Forces and with expert witnesses, that homosexual conduct was incompatible with military service. The DADT policy became law via <a href="http://dont.stanford.edu/regulations/pl103-60.pdf">Section 571 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994</a>, (Subtitle G - Other Matters), Pub.L. 103-160, 107 Stat. 1547 (codified at <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/654.html">10 U.S.C. &#167; 654</a> (1993)). That law created a policy for separation, where servicemembers had "engaged in, attempted to engage in, or solicited another to engage in a homosexual act or acts." Few DADT opponents focus on the five criteria that allowed homosexuals to continue to serve in uniform where: such conduct is a departure from the member's usual and customary behavior; such conduct, under all the circumstances, is unlikely to recur; such conduct was not accomplished by use of force, coercion, or intimidation; under the particular circumstances of the case, the member's continued presence in the armed forces is consistent with the interests of the armed forces in proper discipline, good order, and morale; and the member does not have a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts. The DADT law also changed military entrance standards and documents, and also created an obligation for entry-level and other periodic briefings that would include a detailed explanation of the applicable laws and regulations governing sexual conduct by members of the armed forces, including those prohibited under the DADT law. </p>

<p>The challenge of conforming military conduct to law did not commence with the 1993 DADT law; it has existed throughout the course of military history. Where conduct, be it acts or attitudes, threatens good order and discipline, that conduct threatens the Nation's defense. Regardless of race, color, religion, creed, sex, national origin or sexual orientation, the Department of Defense's official policy has remained consistent that all individuals must be treated with dignity and respect, free of threats and harassment. Under DADT, homosexual conduct became a bar to military service, but harassment or threats have remained unacceptable responses to such conduct.</p>

<p>The author <a href="http://www.militaryethics.com/">S.E. Bromberg has observed</a> that the military represents a "self-contained, secular moral system that is defined by rank, discipline, and obedience to the rules." Nevertheless, service members come from the society they protect, and they carry along with them moral norms from the society at large. That military system is charged by our laws and customs not only to support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, but also to advance and preserve an internal norm of "exemplary conduct." </p>

<p>John Adams understood the concept of "exemplary conduct," when in 1775 he drafted such standards for Continental Navy and Army forces. In its efforts to create <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/10C551.txt">modern "exemplary conduct" statutes</a>, now Title 10, U.S.C. sections 3583 (for the Army), 8583.58 (for the Air Force), and 5947 (for the Navy and Marine Corps), the <a href="http://www.dodig.mil/IGInformation/Speeches/AirForceAcademy.pdf">Senate Armed Services Committee said</a>, "... the nation deserves complete integrity, moral courage, and the highest moral and ethical conduct."  But who is the arbiter of what is moral or ethical conduct under those sweeping and significant laws?</p>

<p>Under the existing "exemplary conduct" statutes, our military leaders, both commanding officers and others in authority are required-- "(1) to show in themselves a good example of virtue, honor, patriotism, and subordination; (2) to be vigilant in inspecting the conduct of all persons who are placed under their command; (3) to guard against and suppress all dissolute and immoral practices, and to correct, according to the laws and regulations of the Army, all persons who are guilty of them; and (4) to take all necessary and proper measures, under the laws, regulations, and customs of the Army, to promote and safeguard the morale, the physical well-being, and the general welfare of the officers and enlisted persons under their command or charge."</p>

<p>What was never litigated in the <em>Log Cabin Republicans</em> decision, but nonetheless examined in great detail by military and civilian legal experts alike, happens to be the remaining military laws that criminalize aberrant, immoral, and violent homosexual and heterosexual acts against the person. Those laws exist under the <a href="http://www.army.mil/references/UCMJ/ucmj2.html#SUBCHAPTER%20X.%20PUNITIVE%20ARTICLES">Uniform Code of Military Justice</a> (UCMJ) and the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/CM-manuals.html">Manual for Courts-Martial</a> (MCM), the two major authorities governing the U.S. military justice system. The <em>Log Cabin Republicans</em> decision does not and can not change either of those major authorities; Congress must approve any changes to the UCMJ, which are then signed into law by <a href="http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2010/pdf/2010-22279.pdf">executive order</a> and included in the MCM.</p>

<p>In commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the UCMJ, the National Institute of Military Justice (NIMJ) sponsored the 2001 <a href="http://www.wcl.american.edu/nimj/documents/cox_comm_report2.pdf?rd=1">Cox Commission</a> study. Chaired by the Honorable Walter T. Cox III, the commission included experts in military law, civilian lawyers, judges and law professors who reviewed the UCMJ, and accepted testimony and documentary evidence from interested parties. At the conclusion of its investigation, the Commission produced a report recommending that a number of changes be made to the UCMJ and MCM. The Commission recommended repealing the rape and sodomy provisions of the UCMJ, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode10/usc_sec_10_00000920----000-.html">10 U.S.C. sections 920</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode10/usc_sec_10_00000925----000-.html">925</a>, and offenses specified under the general article, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode10/usc_sec_10_00000934----000-.html">10 U.S.C. sec. 134</a>, that concern criminal sexual misconduct, not on moral grounds, but on a pragmatic basis such that those UCMJ articles ought to be replaced with a comprehensive Criminal Sexual Conduct Article, such as is found in the <a href="http://www1.law.umkc.edu/suni/CrimLaw/MPC_Provisions/model_penal_code_default_rules.htm">Model Penal Code</a> or <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sup_01_18.html">Title 18</a> of the United States Code.</p>

<p>Since October 1, 2007 amendments to the UCMJ, various <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode10/usc_sec_10_00000920----000-.html">Article 120 UCMJ</a> sections have criminalized, amongst other offenses: homosexual and heterosexual acts of rape, aggravated sexual assault, aggravated sexual contact, abusive sexual contact, indecent liberties with a child, indecent acts, forcible pandering, wrongful sexual contact, and indecent exposure. </p>

<p>The reconstituted October 2009 Cox Commission claimed that "[b]ecause of these statutory changes, and in light of the changes in sexual behavior that have occurred since the creation of the UCMJ, there is no need for a separate provision making sodomy a military crime." Regardless of whatever "changes in sexual behavior" may - or may not - have occurred in the past 50-plus years, and despite the 2003 U.S. Supreme Court decision in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/539/558/case.html">Lawrence v. Texas</a>, Congress has not chosen to decriminalize or change legal prohibitions against homosexual and heterosexual acts of sodomy ("unnatural carnal copulation") under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/usc_sec_10_00000925----000-.html">Article 125 UCMJ</a>. (<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode10/usc_sec_10_00000925----000-.html">10 U.S.C. sec. 925</a>). Furthermore, Article 120 UCMJ clearly continues to invoke moral judgment, as it defines "'indecent conduct' [as] that form of immorality relating to sexual impurity which is grossly vulgar, obscene, and repugnant to common propriety, and tends to excite sexual desire or deprave morals with respect to sexual relations." </p>

<p>Our military should remain a bastion of good order and discipline. The laws that empower the military, and subordinate it to civilian authority, also mandate the maintenance of a moral and virtuous society. The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384-322 BC) developed a catalogue of both positive and negative exemplary types of conduct, or virtues and vices. Centuries later, our system of military justice, like other systems, continues to catalogue virtues and vices. Aristotle also likened the acquiring of virtues to playing an instrument. It requires both practice and a teacher. Regardless of any DADT court decisions or any present or future legislation, our military must continue to practice, and teach, virtuous service to the Nation, as the Nation defines virtue, integrally not incidentally as it calls upon the military to fight and win the Nation's wars.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.syr.edu/faculty/facultymember.aspx?fac=202">Keith J. Bybee</a> of Syracuse University says in order for both state and federal judges to retain legitimacy, it is not enough for them to merely avoid actual improprieties; they must also visibly appear to play the role of impartial arbiter to sustain public support... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/KeithBybee125x150.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>J</b></font>udges around the country have been struggling with their appearances lately.</p>

<p>In Washington, D.C., Federal District Court Judge G. Thomas Porteous is urging everyone to get beyond looks.  Porteous is mired in an impeachment hearing in the United States Senate.  He landed in this dire position because he amassed large gambling debts, accepted unseemly gifts from lawyers (including envelopes stuffed with cash), and filed for bankruptcy under an assumed name.  Although these actions hardly cast Porteous in a favorable light, the judge's defense team has argued that Porteous should not be thrown off the bench simply because of how things might seem.  "This is about an appearance of impropriety," Porteous' lawyer said, "and we think it is a mistake to remove judges based on that standard."</p>

<p>In West Virginia, Supreme Court Justice Menis Ketchum is also finding image management to be a bit tricky.  When running for a spot on the bench in 2008, Ketchum assured voters that he would not invalidate or modify the state statute placing caps on punitive damages in medical malpractice suits.  Now, with a case challenging the constitutionality of the caps before his court, Ketchum is insisting that he is impartial.  True, his campaign promises make it look like he made up his mind about limits on damages years ago.  The trouble is, according to Ketchum, the appearance of pre‐judgment doesn't accurately reflect new realities.  As a sitting judge, Ketchum stated, "I am required to look at all issues from a different perspective than I enjoyed as Lawyer Ketchum."  When this position elicited criticism, Ketchum reversed field and decided to recuse himself from the case after all, arguing that the problem wasn't the appearance of his pre‐judgment, but the reality of the media's bias.  "I could care less if the blogs or press crucify me personally," Ketchum wrote.  "However, I believe the lawyers are pulling the press's strings to place our Court in an unfavorable light."</p>

<p>The specific situations in which Porteous and Ketchum find themselves are in some ways unusual.  Yet their problems with appearances are hardly unique.</p>

<p>Public opinion polls stretching back to the late 1980s demonstrate that large majorities of Americans believe the decision making of state judges is influenced by political considerations.  Other surveys indicate that a significant majority believe federal judges hand down decisions mirroring the judges' own political leanings.  And when it comes to the nation's highest bench, polls show that a large portion of the public believes the Supreme Court operates with too little regard for either legal principles or impartiality, with near majorities believing that the justices are too mixed up in politics.</p>

<p>Of course, the poll results do not prove that any given judge is actually making decisions on the basis of political preference rather than on the basis of legal arguments and facts.  The perception of political decision making nonetheless matters.</p>

<p>Judicial legitimacy depends on the ability of judges to convey the impression that their actions are driven by the impersonal requirements of law.  It is not enough merely to avoid actual improprieties; judges must also visibly appear to play the role of impartial arbiter to sustain public support.  The widespread political assessment of the courts suggests that many Americans are skeptical about judicial decisions and suspect that all the judicial talk about legal principle is a fig leaf designed to obscure partisan purposes.</p>

<p>Judicial appearances are indeed fleeting and they may surely mislead. But the question of how the judicial process may endure when it seems to be infected with politics deserves serious attention - no matter how strenuously some judges may argue that we shouldn't care about how things look.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://smpa.gwu.edu/faculty/people/6">Silvio Waisbord</a> of George Washington University says the "anti-racism" law recently passed in Bolivia is a result of deep divisions in the country, but that it won't help, and may actually hamper, civil discourse about those issues...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/Waisbord.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/image/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>O</b></font>n October 10th, Bolivian President Evo Morales signed a new <a href="http://www.lostiempos.com/media_pdf/2010/10/07/179617_pdf.pdf">"anti-racism" law</a>. Expectedly, the decision, as well as the preceding debates in Congress, generated much controversy. Amidst growing political polarization since Morales took office in 2006, dissimilar reactions to the law reflect the profound divisions in Bolivia's politics and society. The presidential tenure of Morales, the country's first indigenous president in a country with an indigenous majority, has been a flashpoint for old ethnic and racial conflicts. In a society with a history of institutional and everyday racism, this law comes in the footsteps of public comments and events revealing entrenched racist attitudes and behaviors.</p>

<p>Two articles of the law have been the subject of heated debate in the press and the country. Article 16 stipulates that news companies that publish racist and discriminatory ideas will be punished financially and that their licenses will be suspended. Article 23 states that neither journalists nor media owners who make racist comments can claim immunity.</p>

<p>Hostile reactions from large media as well as opposition from major business groups were not surprising. On October 7th, leading newspapers, except for those sympathetic to the Morales administration, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11497489">featured the headline</a> "There is no democracy without freedom of expression" against blank front pages. Journalists' unions and publishers' organizations supported street mobilizations and strikes against the law throughout the country. They hold that the law unmistakably shows the administration' s intention to muzzle the press. They have urged the President to eliminate the articles that specifically make reference to the press. Some organizations suggested that individuals who make racist comments in the press, not journalists or news companies, should be punishable.</p>

<p>In contrast, other journalists' organizations (including international organizations like <a href="http://en.rsf.org/">Reporters sans Fronti&#233;res</a> and the <a href="http://www.amarc.org/">World Association of Community Radio Broadcasters</a>), human rights groups, and social groups defended the law. While supporting the goal of the legislation, some of these groups have suggested modifications to eliminate ambiguity, punish media companies that openly champion racism (rather than just reporting hateful speech), and ensure that the law meets international standards about free speech (like the <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/oasinstr/zoas3con.htm">American Convention on Human Rights</a>). In their view, the law is necessary to address racist declarations and calls to violence in the media. They have often made reference to recent examples of hateful speech. In 2008, when President Morales was scheduled to visit the Province of Beni, a local <a href="http://www.derechoshumanosbolivia.org/noticia.php?cod_noticia=NO20100922111630">radio anchor declared</a> "The damned indian can' t put a foot in this area." When the police detained him, he appealed to his freedom of expression rights. Radio journalists have also been accused of inciting violence against indigenous peasants in recent years and creating a climate ripe for hate crimes.</p>

<p>What is at stake are competing approaches to how societies should deal with hateful speech. One position, espoused by media publishers and journalists' organizations, argues that codes of ethics, not laws, should regulate speech. Any form of legislation, especially in a country with a long tradition of discretional enforcement of press laws, inevitably leads to censorship. Even if the law is aimed at curbing racist speech, it will have chilling effects. The instrument is, in their view, the wrong one to discourage bigotry and racism. The other position endorses an "activist" conception of press legislation according to which laws are valuable instruments to promote a socially responsible press. It subscribes to the notion that regulating speech is necessary to avoid the excesses of free expression and to promote civic values. Members of the ruling party in Congress tried to assuage concerns by stating that the real target of the law is the call to hateful speech and violence rather than racist comments made by individuals.</p>

<p>The law, as well as the reactions, must be understood in the context of the tense and acrimonious relationship between President Morales and the most powerful media. News organizations based in the Eastern regions of the country have offered non-stop critical news of the President since he took office. The press has been at the helm of a defiant, and at times ferocious, opposition based in the so-called "Media Luna," the resource- rich area that comprises the states of Beni, Pando, Santa Cruz and Tarija. Frustrated with the situation, President Morales and members of his cabinet have accused journalists and media owners of racism, and called for actions to "educate" the media (whom he has called his "<a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/wha/119149.htm">main enemy</a>"). Yet the conflict is grounded not only on political differences. It is inseparable from perceptions and prejudices in the painful history of class and ethnic relations. The spat over the law reflects a long tradition of distrust and violence.</p>

<p>Moreover, in a country where governments historically tried to control the press through legal means (or naked violence during frequent authoritarian regimes), the conflict puts in evidence that the most sensitive and difficult aspect is not the content of the legislation. Aside from whether press laws are adequate instruments to redress century-old racism, the crucial issue is the uncertainty about the application of any press law. Concerns about arbitrariness run high. In a politically polarized country, impartiality and fairness are under question. In such a climate, regulation can quickly become censorship, as critics warn. Press laws can be easily mobilized for political goals rather than to right a presumed wrong.</p>

<p>Yet to simply argue that free expression will take care of hateful speech, or that the latter is naturally expected in a democratic society, is insufficient. It avoids a complex problem in contemporary media-saturated societies. It does not address abysmal inequalities in access to public expression as they exist in Bolivia. Nor does it account for how to promote civic discourse amidst hateful talk and a toxic political atmosphere.</p>

<p>The law demonstrates deep-seated problems and suspicions in a country with mile-long fissures and toxic politics. The case reflects the consuetudinary problems for regulating speech in countries with a weak tradition of democratic accountability. A divided society, where consensus is seemingly impossible, makes that challenge all the more difficult.</p>

<p>Despite these challenges and the important goal of addressing a long tradition of racism and oppression, journalist organizations rightfully express legitimate concerns about how the government may use this power for other purposes. Amidst a volatile political situation, the law alone will not successfully address this complex social problem.</p>

In a 5-4 decision, the majority in <em>R. v. Sinclair</em>, held that the essential purpose of the right to counsel is informational rather than protective.</p>

<p>Sinclair had been arrested for murder. After being advised of his right to counsel, he had two, three-minute telephone conversations with his lawyer prior to a police interrogation that lasted 5 hours. He was denied repeated requests for further consultation with counsel.  </p>

<p>In our opinion, the majority decision erodes constitutional protections of detainees and expands police powers at the cost of fewer safeguards for suspects. The ruling in <em>Sinclair</em> cannot be fully appreciated without reference to <a href="http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2007/2007scc48/2007scc48.html">R. v. Singh</a>. In <em>Singh</em>, again by a 5-4 majority, the Supreme Court sanctioned the use by the police of persistent questioning, notwithstanding the suspect's objection that he did not wish to speak. The court noted that although the suspect can seek refuge in silence, there is no right, "not to be spoken to by state authorities."  The distinction is significant and renders the right to silence relatively meaningless.  Typically, a suspect will have been instructed by counsel to remain silent.  Upon the assertion of this right, it is routinely ignored and subverted by the police.  The suspect's resolve may crumble in the face of evidence (real or fabricated) and his possible confusion regarding legal advice to remain silent is juxtaposed with the police's unremitting questions.  Should it surprise us that the suspect might seek further assistance from counsel?  Following <em>Sinclair</em>, he will not get it.  In light of the growing concerns and awareness of the risks of false confessions, this state of affairs is especially worrisome.   <br />
 <br />
It is indisputable that false confessions are a problem. The <a href="http://www.reid.com/">Reid Technique</a> is the most influential and widely used police interrogation procedure in North America. Comprehensive critiques have identified a number of fundamental assumptions of that protocol, the dubious validity of which imperils the reliability of the entire exercise.  The procedure is unabashedly guilt presumptive, confrontational, and accusatory. From the suspect's perspective, isolation, fatigue, and fear may produce a compliant (but false) confession from a person who merely wants to extricate himself from an aversive situation or succumbs to implied threats of dire consequences or implicit promises of clemency.  The suspect may make a regrettable, but understandable, decision about the perceived costs and benefits of confessing.  Are they confessing to something they did, or are they signing on to the spin that the interrogator has persuaded them is in their best interests to endorse?  Advocates of the Reid Technique assert that innocent suspects are impervious to these tactics. The <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/08/06/f-wrongfully-convicted.html">numerous DNA-exonerated defendants</a> who had confessed belie this claim.  </p>

<p>At trial, <a href="http://truth.boisestate.edu/jcaawp/9901/9901.pdf">confessions are compelling</a> [PDF]. In actual cases in which it was later shown that a false confession was in fact made during a custodial interrogation, <a href="http://www.nacdl.org/public.nsf/698c98dd101a846085256eb400500c01/4a6e9aa597092057052573ed0056ffa3?OpenDocument">jury conviction rates</a> were at least 75 percent. Erroneous confessions appear no less powerful to jurors than truthful ones. Numerous <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=jz-CmXRuTjAC&pg=PA180&lpg=PA180&dq=juror+simulation+confessions&source=bl&ots=3jPQT-idUr&sig=QKrjc0EuQUw4EEd7YKWg3LdyK5g&hl=en&ei=mJHITJ3iBML6lweq_pX7Ag&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false">juror simulations attest</a> to the persuasive impact that a confession can have on the jury. A confession is one of the most important forms of evidence influencing determinations of guilt. Along with mistaken identification evidence, confessions are the predominant causes of factually wrongful convictions. People trust confessions and have difficulty disregarding them, even when there are good reasons to do so.</p>

<p>The Reid Technique tactics are often successful in extracting 'true' confessions from guilty suspects, but the same tactics are at risk for producing false confessions from innocent suspects. A substantial body of <a href="http://www.reid.com/educational_info/criticresearch.html">social science research</a> has consistently demonstrated that there is no scientific basis from which to conclude that the Reid approach is reliable and diagnostic. Despite the counterevidence, frontline officers are encouraged to depend on unreliable indicators of deception to make inferences about deception. Interrogators are trained to believe that their intuitions about deception are trustworthy when, in fact, they are not. Interrogators are told that innocent suspects will not succumb to the confrontational pressures of the interrogation when, in fact, they often do. Innocent suspects are told that their fingerprints or DNA were found at the crime scene. Innocent suspects may be psychologically manipulated into believing that providing a false confession is in their best interests. In light of these concerns there can be little doubt that detainees are in need of protection against interrogation tactics that are inherently unreliable. The right to counsel and the right to silence are supposed to provide such protection. Together, the <em>Sinclair</em> and <em>Singh</em> decisions substantially impair those badly needed protections.   </p>

<p>The purpose of the right to counsel found in Section 10(b) of the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/1.html#anchorbo-ga:l_I">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> was described by the Court 16 years ago in <a href="http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1994/1994scr3-173/1994scr3-173.html">R. v. Bartle</a> as guaranteeing a detainee an opportunity to be advised of their right and, "most importantly, to obtain advice on how to exercise those rights." This was said to be necessary because the detainee was "in a position of disadvantage relative to the state." In <em>Singh</em>, the Court held that where a detainee asserts his right to silence, the police are entitled to resort to "legitimate means of persuasion" to get the detainee to change his mind and speak to the authorities. The effect of the judgment in <em>Sinclair</em> is that while the police can try to persuade a detainee to give up his right to silence, a detainee who is considering acceding to those attempts at persuasion must make this decision entirely on his own. Surely, a detainee who is being subjected to "legitimate means of persuasion" has the right to know the advantages and disadvantages of each possible course of conduct. While the police can outline the "advantages" of giving up the right to silence, the detainee has no corresponding source of information about the disadvantages.  </p>

<p>The Court's decision is based on a sadly impoverished view of the role of defense counsel. In most cases, the initial contact a detainee has with counsel is immediately after arrest. At that stage, all the detainee and counsel will usually be aware of is very basic information respecting the nature of the allegations. In practice, most lawyers being called upon to give advice based on such limited knowledge will simply advise a detainee to remain silent. That advice may well change once more information becomes known, but there is no further opportunity for the detainee to update his lawyer as the interrogation progresses. The result is that defense counsel's role in almost all cases will be limited to perfunctory advice to remain silent. As Justice Binnie pointed out in his dissent, this could be accomplished with a recorded message.    </p>

<p>The impetus behind the decision in <em>Sinclair</em> is the same as in <em>Singh</em>, namely, a concern about impeding effective law enforcement. The Court appears to be motivated by a concern that if detainees are allowed to contact counsel more than once, the police will obtain fewer confessions. This reasoning is troubling for a number of reasons. First, as pointed out in the dissent, the concern was entirely speculative and the experience in other jurisdictions suggests that such concerns are unfounded. Second, while the right to counsel is constitutionally protected, the right to effective law enforcement is not. In other contexts, the Court has declined to give restrictive interpretations to constitutional protections in order to promote state interests. Third, and perhaps most troubling, confessions obtained from detainees who are denied the advice of counsel do not necessarily advance an investigation. The Court's reasoning appears to be based on the premise that only the guilty confess and that all confessions are true. As outlined above, this is not always the case. Effective law enforcement does not include obtaining false confessions.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Martin Gutmann, Pitt Law '11, is a student in the University of Pittsburgh School of Law's new <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/course/5881">Immigration Law Clinic</a>. He writes on the importance of cultural competency when working with clients...<br />
<hr height="1"><br />
<font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he University of Pittsburgh recently took stock of its changing surroundings and started an Immigration Law Clinic. Pittsburgh, like much of the country, has been unaccustomed to significant non-European migration. For the past few decades, the vast majority of immigrants set up their new lives in established centers in California, New York and Texas. Recently, that trend has changed dramatically. Suburbs and cities with smaller minority populations are now seeing a considerable influx of new residents. Pittsburgh is no exception. However, many of our new neighbors stay in insular communities, so their presence can easily go unnoticed.</p>

<p>Slowly, this trend is changing as non-citizens realize there are places of assistance available. Some of this assistance concerns legal help, including interaction with US immigration laws. Assistance varies from petitioning the US Citizenship and Immigration Service for relatives' entry into the country to working with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and the Department of Justice for the right to remain within these borders.  These interactions with United States policy are far-ranging and carry significant implications, including separation from one's family or deportation to a land that one may never have known.</p>

<p>Despite the severity of such implications, the United States extends limited due process protections to immigrants in so-called "removal" proceedings. Immigration matters are treated as civil rather than criminal, although many non-citizens are initially placed in removal proceedings on relatively minor criminal grounds. Over the past few decades, Congress has broadened the criminal grounds for removal extensively from a few very narrow reasons to a dozen, which now initiate the vast majority of proceedings. For example, one may be removed from the country for an isolated non-violent crime committed 30 years ago as a minor. A formal conviction would not even be necessary. </p>

<p>The limits of due process protection also affect non-citizens by throwing them into highly adversarial proceedings without a lawyer or knowledge of their rights. Bond and representation can easily run into the thousands of dollars. Here is where the Immigration Law Clinic plays such a vital role: clinical students can help such people vindicate the limited rights they do possess. </p>

<p>The six students in the inaugural clinic class have been able to dive right into such representation. To be sure, representation is not limited to removal proceedings. In the short time since the clinic began, we have started "affirmative" asylum applications - that is, requests for asylum before one is placed in removal proceedings - as well as family-based petitions, waivers of inadmissibility due to hardship to American relatives, visas for those who have helped police investigations, and a myriad of other forms of relief, benefits, and immigration status changes.  The procedures and processes change, but one thing remains constant: the need for cultural competency and sensitivity. </p>

<p>Cultural competency means being able to understand your client's worldview and the resulting values and goals, which often may be different from your own. As representatives, we must always work toward achieving our clients' ends, absent concerns of crime or fraud. Working for non-citizen clients in the immigration process adds additional dimensions to those aspirations. We must be aware of how the client views his situation and respect that he may choose to proceed differently than we would in similar circumstances. Because we each bring our background and experiences to bear in a given situation, each circumstance is different.</p>

<p>As an example of a cultural competency issue encountered by the clinic, we currently have clients from African countries with long histories of internal conflict and gender-based violence. Clinical students must be aware of that history when interviewing the client so as to not cause that client to relive potentially troubling memories. At the same time, one must know when that history could play a major role in allowing that person to remain in the country. For instance, a client's history may present the basis for a valid asylum claim. If so, the representative should know how to broach the subject and  let the client tell the story. This can be difficult, as many clients are understandably reluctant to share such personal and painful stories with someone they may have just met. It may help to be familiar with the actors and issues involved. Cultural competency is often about self-education, and in some ways, it can be understood as an extension of the ethical duty to perform necessary study when undertaking representation. </p>

<p>Cultural competency issues often arise in the domestic violence context. US immigration law protects abused or battered individuals, either by regularizing their status or preventing their forced removal from the country. The clinic focuses on this area by providing female clients currently in abusive relationships with immigration help. Domestic abuse interviews are difficult in the best of circumstances, but are especially demanding in the context of interviewing married abused women who come from very male-dominated cultures. Often, such clients will view the abusive behavior as normal or even deserved. They will refuse to leave the husband, let alone involve an unfamiliar legal system.</p>

<p>Many of the above and similar questions are resolved by recognizing cultural relativism, i.e. understanding beliefs and activities from another person's cultural background. For the purpose of clinic students, this means reserving judgment, not dealing in absolutes, and explaining options in terms that the client can understand. It does not mean, however, that one cannot address harms that may befall a client who would prefer a particular course of action, such as staying with a spouse whose abuse has repeatedly put her in the hospital. Human rights should not be mechanically ignored in the name of cultural sensitivity. Unfortunately, lawyers can find little guidance in the statutory or decisional law to resolve these moral questions. Ultimately, as with all legal representation, the ends chosen must be the client's. Nevertheless, lawyers and law students can and should use their available tools to educate clients about all their options and repercussions. </p>

<p>That, to me, is what makes practicing immigration law so interesting and rewarding. It does not operate in a vacuum. The best immigration lawyers are educated both about the world around them and other areas of law. Moreover, they cannot be limited to legal recourses alone, but must be able to guide their clients to other social services if necessary. They need to be prepared for all possibilities, and thus need to be complete lawyers. At the University of Pittsburgh, the new immigration law clinic makes that happen.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This is a welcome step towards the creation of a much needed, crisis-management mechanism because of the recent financial and currency crisis and the necessity to support the budgets of South European Member States, especially Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ireland. In 2013, the permanent, crisis-management mechanism will replace the emergency, rescue package to bail out EU Member States threatened by the "Greek crisis," which was adopted in May 2010, for the period of three years.</p>

<p>The rescue package or <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/10/173">European Stabilization Mechanism</a> is based on Art. 122 of the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0047:0199:EN:PDF">Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union</a> (TFEU). The purpose of the Stabilization Mechanism is to preserve the stability, unity, and integrity of the European Union by providing assistance to any Member State that experiences or is seriously threatened by a severe economic or financial disturbance caused by exceptional occurrences beyond its control. That way, the EU is aiming at preventing further speculations on the financial markets regarding the bankruptcy of EU Member States, which had endangered the Euro. </p>

<p>The Stabilization Mechanism is based on four pillars. First, the EU budget allocated up to 60 billion euros of loans or credit lines. Second, the Stabilization Mechanism included bilateral credit guarantees of Member States of the Euro-group of up to 440 billion euros if the amount of 60 billion euros turns out to be insufficient. According to Art. 125 TFEU, a Member State shall not be liable for or assume the commitments of another Member State (the "no bailout" principle). This provision has been used as an argument for a general prohibition of any kind of financial support within the eurozone. However, Art.125 TFEU only states that there cannot be an obligation of a Member State to assume financial responsibility for another Member State, but cannot be seen as a prohibition of taking over such responsibility on a voluntary basis. A general prohibition would mean that an EU Member State would be in a position to grant financial support to any country in the world except its partners in the eurozone, which cannot be the aim of the provision. Third, the <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/index.htm">International Monetary Fund</a> guaranteed additional credit lines of up to 250 billion euros. </p>

<p>Last but not least, the <a href="http://www.ecb.int/home/html/index.en.html">European Central Bank</a> backed up the aid package with the purchase of government bonds of Member States of the eurozone. However, Art. 123 (1) TFEU prohibits the direct purchase of debt instruments by the European Central Bank and, therefore, sets out a ban on financing the budgets of Member States through the European Central Bank. Because of this provision, the European Central Bank did not buy government bonds directly from the issuers on the capital market. Critical voices have raised concerns regarding the question whether a country heavily in debt and incapable of paying back its current obligations can be tackled by granting additional credits and hereby increasing this debt. Instead critics have suggested the option of cutting the debts by partial waivers by the debtees.</p>

<p>The rescue package was followed by a variety of legislative proposals by the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> to improve the shortcomings of the current, economic governance system of the EU and its instruments. Improvements include proposals for regulations on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedures, direct enforcement of budgetary surveillance in the eurozone, and on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances.</p>

<p>It is important for Member States of the eurozone to show solidarity in times of crisis. However, it is also of crucial importance to revise the existing, legal framework and adapt it to the latest developments in order to prevent similar crises in the future. A major step in this regard is the treaty change proposed by the last <a href="http://www.european-council.europa.eu/home-page.aspx?lang=en">European Council</a>, the highest political institution of the EU. The key aspect regarding this change is the simplified treaty revision procedure set out in Art. 48 (6) of the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/11992M/htm/11992M.html#0001000001">Treaty of the European Union</a>, which would allow changes through unanimous decision of the Member States and a mere consultation of the European Parliament, without the need to call in a constitutional convention. However, the treaty revision would need to be ratified by Member States to enter into force. The <a href="http://www.european-council.europa.eu/the-president.aspx">President of the European Council</a>, a post newly created by the Treaty of Lisbon, together with the European Commission is tasked with the preparation of these treaty changes by December 2010. However, the envisaged treaty change triggered negative comments and concerns, especially in view of the almost ten years needed to finally adopt the Treaty of Lisbon. </p>

<p>Finally, there is a heated debate on potential sanction mechanisms, including automatic sanctions or the suspension of voting rights of Member States in breach of the Stability Mechanism. This measure will also be on the agenda of the task force of the President of the European Council. While the December deadline does not apply to the question of sanctions, nonetheless, a system of effective sanctions is crucial to the enforcement of the Stability Mechanism. These sanctions should not be dependent upon political decisions and should be capable of preventing Member States from seriously violating the basic principles of the Economic and Monetary Union. However, getting all 27 Member States to agree on future steps and then making a legal commitment to them is another matter.</p>

		<title>Federal preemption not an issue in Arizona immigration law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.cis.org/Feere"><strong>Jon Feere</strong></a> [Legal Policy Analyst, <a href="http://www.cis.org/">Center for Immigration Studies</a>]: "States regularly assist the federal government in making sure federal laws and regulations in a whole host of areas are followed. The feds generally welcome the support. But when it comes to immigration, the Obama administration has signaled opposition to states that wish to provide assistance. The administration argues that states are preempted from getting involved in immigration policy, but this argument is overbroad and ultimately incorrect.<br />
                <br />
                Under the U.S. Constitution, states are preempted from unilaterally admitting an alien into the country and from unilaterally deporting an alien from the country, as Congress has the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#section8">power to establish</a> a "uniform Rule of Naturalization." States also cannot act to frustrate the goals of Congress. Of course, no state is attempting to independently admit or deport anyone, and Arizona is not attempting to alter or undermine federal law. Instead, Arizona is attempting to assist the federal government in carrying out its duties under the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.f6da51a2342135be7e9d7a10e0dc91a0/?vgnextoid=fa7e539dc4bed010VgnVCM1000000ecd190aRCRD&vgnextchannel=fa7e539dc4bed010VgnVCM1000000ecd190aRCRD&CH=act">Immigration and Naturalization Act</a>. Considering the limited law enforcement man power and the significant number of immigration violators in our country, one would think that the White House would welcome the help.<br />
                <br />
                But that assumes the White House actually wants the nation's immigration laws enforced. When it comes to immigration policy, the Obama administration has made amnesty, rather than enforcement of existing immigration laws, its goal. The same can be said of the preceding administration under President Bush. It appears that those rallying against Arizona are less concerned about preemption issues than they are about the possibility that the feds will end up having to do their jobs of removing illegal aliens and fining businesses that violate the law. Interestingly, sanctuary cities - jurisdictions that actually do frustrate the enforcement of federal immigration law -are embraced by the White House and are not the target of Department of Justice lawsuits. This seems to indicate the Arizona <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-denies-motion-to-dismiss-suit-challenging-arizona-immigration-law.php">lawsuit</a> is more political than anything else. It is also evidence that the White House wants to make non-enforcement of immigration laws the norm.<br />
                <br />
                Like many states, Arizona is experiencing the fallout of the federal government's failure to sufficiently enforce immigration laws. At least 25 states may follow Arizona's lead. This is in addition to the many other states that have already passed legislation to make their jurisdictions less welcoming to those who violate immigration laws, both illegal aliens and their employers. It will be up to the Supreme Court to clarify the scope of preemption in immigration matters, but Arizona has a greater likelihood of success than most media outlets are predicting."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist Andrea Prasow, senior counter-terrorism counsel at Human Rights Watch, says that despite purported safeguards, evidence from Omar Khadr's guilty plea and sentencing hearing shows that detainees can still be harmed by statements they have made involuntarily... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forumy/andreaprasownew.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>T</b></font>he <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/2009%20MCA%20Pub%20%20Law%20111-84.pdf">Military Commissions Act of 2009</a>, though an improvement over the Bush-era law governing military commission proceedings at Guantanamo, has a number of problematic provisions. A particularly important area is the rules it establishes regarding evidence obtained via torture and other abuse. While in principle it bars the prosecution from relying on statements that the defendant made involuntarily, except in a narrow set of circumstances, developments in the Omar Khadr trial suggest that this protection is not entirely effective.</p>

<p>While in US custody at Bagram Air Base in 2002, Khadr apparently confessed to constructing and planting Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and throwing a grenade that killed US Army Sgt. 1st Class Christopher Speer. One of the key questions at pre-trial proceedings in his military commission trial was whether this confession was obtained by abusive treatment.  Several months ago at a pre-trial hearing in the case, a former interrogator testified that he told Khadr a story, which was unbeknownst to Khadr fictional, of another young man who had been gang-raped in prison in order to induce Khadr to cooperate.  He also testified on the routine way in which prisoners were abused, including the military's reliance on sleep deprivation, barking dogs and stress positions, although he claimed he could not remember ever using those techniques on Khadr. The military judge ruled that whatever abuse Khadr had suffered, if any, had not prompted him to make his confession, and therefore his confession could be admitted at trial.</p>

<p>In the end, although he previously adamantly denied the charges against him, Khadr pled guilty and entered into a lengthy factual stipulation in which he detailed his crimes, including the killing of Sergeant Speer.  Because his guilt is no longer legally in question, the original confession will never be used. Yet, in a strange quirk of military procedures, the military panel issued a sentence, even though the defendant had entered into a plea bargain. The jurors did not know that Khadr had already pled guilty in exchange for an eight-year sentence, with a likely transfer to a Canadian prison after one year. If the jury had delivered a lighter sentence, Khadr would have gotten the benefit of it, so the sentencing hearing was still quite important. </p>

<p>Despite this, the prosecutors put on a full, aggressive sentencing case, arguing that Khadr posed a high risk of dangerousness and recommending that the jury sentence him to 25 years in prison (current commission rules do not allow reductions for time served). The defense argued mitigating factors, including his young age at time of capture, 15, his father's negative role in encouraging Khadr's involvement in al Qaeda, and the abusive conditions of his detention.  Or, more accurately, the defense <em>attempted</em> to present to the jury the conditions of Khadr's detention, particularly conditions at Bagram during the first few months after his capture. However, the military judge refused to permit it.</p>

<p>Citing his earlier ruling that Khadr's statements were not the product of abusive interrogation - a ruling that did not directly challenge the interrogator's testimony about the rape threat - the judge held that portions of the transcript relating to that interrogator's testimony could not be submitted to the jury for consideration.  The judge also ordered that a letter from another former interrogator detailing Khadr's abuse be redacted.  The portions of the letter that did not refer explicitly to Khadr, but instead described routine practice of guards at Bagram while Khadr was detained there, were removed.</p>

<p>The defense intended to call as witnesses two mental health experts who had spent hundreds of hours working on the case.  It's not clear why they did not testify, but there is one compelling possibility.  Shortly after Khadr pleded guilty, one of his Canadian lawyers, Dennis Edney, declared that in the view of Canadian counsel, "Mr. Khadr is innocent."  Although Khadr signed a sworn statement admitting that he was guilty, it is quite possible the mental health experts believe in his innocence as well. If they testified to that, Khadr's guilty plea could have been declared "improvident" and Khadr could have been forced to go on trial. (Khadr's plea agreement specifically states if the stipulation of fact - his detailed admission of guilt - is contradicted, his plea agreement can be withdrawn). </p>

<p>Whatever the reason, absent the defense mental health experts, who would also have tried to testify about the abuse Khadr suffered, the defense case for mitigation was incredibly weak.  The harsh sentence chosen by the military jury may reflect this. Having heard next to nothing about Khadr's abuse, and a lot about what a dangerous person he was, they imposed a sentence of 40 years, one that seemed excessive to those privy to much of the evidence the sentencing jury did not get to see.</p>

<p>The plea agreement leaves many questions unanswered. Indeed, we will never even know for sure if Khadr was responsible for killing a US soldier. Prior to the trial, there were compelling indications that another al Qaeda militant actually threw the grenade that killed Sergeant Speer.  Even if scientific developments would make greater certainty possible in the future, Khadr's plea agreement includes a promise never to pursue forensic testing of the evidence, and allows the US government to destroy all the evidence following sentencing. Khadr has also waived all appeals and promised not to pursue litigation against the US government in any forum for any matter relating to his detention and trial.  No jury will ever hear Khadr's allegations of abuse or the admissions of abuse by a US interrogator. No juror will have to consider how he or she might have felt at 15 years of age, gravely wounded, in enemy hands, when threatened with gang rape.</p>

<p>When Navy Captain John Murphy, the Chief Prosecutor, was asked why he agreed to an eight year sentence for a murderer he said the prosecution had taken into account Khadr's age, family background, and "other factors."  One wonders whether those "other factors" are the abuse and possible torture of a 15 year old boy by US personnel.</p>

<p>But no appellate court will ever review the record, and the Supreme Court will never consider the case.  In the prosecution's view, those may be compelling reasons indeed to avoid a public trial.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.transequality.org/About/staff.html"><strong>Justin Tanis</strong></a> [Community Education and Outreach Manager, <a href="http://www.transequality.org/index.html">National Center for Transgender Equality</a>]: "The military's discriminatory <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/11/rights-group-asks-supreme-court-to-suspend-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy</a> applies only to the sexual orientation of servicemembers and has no direct application to transgender people. However, transgender people have been impacted by the regulations and discharged under the policy when investigators assume that gender non-conforming clothing or behavior signifies a lesbian or gay sexual orientation. </p>

                <p>The US Military continues to discriminate against transgender people, barring them from enlisting and discharging them if they are serving. In a 2009 study of 6,450 transgender people ("National Transgender Discrimination Survey," conducted by The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and the National Center for Transgender Equality; published results pending), 20% of the sample reporting having served in the military, at a rate <a href="http://www.census.gov/acs/www/Downloads/library/2009/Final_report_8_10_09.pdf">twice</a> [PDF] that of the general population, with an additional 2% reporting having been denied entry into military service. Of those in our sample who did serve, 9% were discharged because of their gender identity or expression. </p>

                <p>Transgender people can be discharged under military policy as medically unfit if they have been diagnosed with Gender Identity Disorder or if they have had <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/613003p.pdf">genital surgery</a> [PDF]. There are also <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/10C47.txt">military regulations</a> that consider gender non-conformity as "conduct unbecoming" or "conduct prejudicial to good order or discipline." Wardrobe considered "cross-dressing" can also be considered a violation of uniform policies; this has been applied to servicemembers' dress on or off base. </p>

                <p>The military's medical services exclude transition-related care and require that servicemembers report treatment by civilian doctors; if a transgender person accesses transition-related medical care, they must either report that treatment - thus outing themselves as transgender to military authorities - or risk discharge or discipline for failing to report the treatment. Either way, the policy prevents transgender people from getting needed medical care appropriate to their gender identity. </p>

                <p>Many transgender people wish to openly serve their country through military service, as do many gay, lesbian and bisexual people. Being able to serve in the military is one of the ways in which Americans choose to serve and protect their country; banning people from doing so simply because of prejudice based on gender identity or sexual orientation is just plain wrong." </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://themaydan.org/bios.html"><strong>Haroon Moghul</strong></a> Executive Director, <a href="http://themaydan.org/index.html">The Maydan Institute</a>: "Last week, Oklahomans <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/oklahoma-voters-ban-use-of-islamic-international-law-in-state-court-decisions.php">voted overwhelmingly</a> in favor of <a href="https://www.sos.ok.gov/gov/proposed_questions.aspx#sq755">State Question 755</a>, which forbids state courts from considering "international law," defined as a discourse "formed by the general assent of civilized nations," and "Sharia," or "Islamic law," in their decisions. Perhaps Oklahomans, in their eagerness to rid their state of alleged foreign influences, did not realize that the amendment could forbid their courts from citing the Ten Commandments, which were after all passed to us through a Middle Eastern people. </p>

                <p>But what of Sharia? Literally, it means "the path to the water," and refers to God's revelation in the form of the Muslim holy book, the Qur'an, and the words and actions of the Prophet Muhammad. However, I should immediately note that Sharia is, after Muhammad, an inconclusive discourse: Muslims recognize no Prophet after Muhammad, no Pope and no Church. No final and conclusive arbiter of disputes exists. Further, when people say "Sharia," they are usually referring to specific <em>interpretations</em> of Sharia: What the Taliban enforced in Afghanistan was not Sharia <em>per se</em>, which is not a fixed and static body of law, but rather the Taliban's interpretation of the Sharia. State Question 755 reflects this conflation.</p>

                <p>Islamic law is an ongoing and contentious conversation over the interpretation and application of key texts. Given that, and keeping in mind that Muslims have historically quite often produced interpretations of Sharia consistent with their circumstances and realities, it is no surprise that American Muslims overwhelmingly understand Islam as a voluntary ethical and social practice. American Muslims - who, as I am disappointed to be forced to clarify, are Americans - want the state to protect our right to worship, and want - and expect - the state to protect others' rights to worship, or not worship, as their conscience leads them.</p>

                <p>Is a statistically significant number of American Muslims actually agitating for the introduction of Sharia law? Of course not. But State Question 755 was not the product of reasonable concern, but rather the predictable result of a larger environment that fears anything Islamic; it is the same flawed logic that leads to the assumption that our President is a Muslim. So, what is the point of having Sharia law? This was a "<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1325986/Sharia-law-banned-Oklahoma-US-state-veto-Islamic-code.html">preemptive strike</a>": one day American Muslims will try to take over our country. No matter what we do, say, insist upon or work towards, our motives and our very presence in the nation is suspect enough to compel the amendment of a state constitution.</p>

                <p>Such sentiments make it that much harder for American Muslims to confidently pursue interpretations of Sharia relevant to our existence, celebratory of democracy and supportive of positive civil society. What are the larger ramifications of these sentiments which not only reject Islam, but which also reject anything deemed non-American and ipso facto un-American? Even international law, as we have seen, is a threat; Islam is easily and ignorantly conflated with something from outside our borders (not to mention the assumption that there is no wisdom to be gained from looking beyond America).</p>

                <p>This "preemptive strike" against Sharia advances another agenda, which actually wants - and has the means - to introduce religious law into the American public sphere. Nobody flinched when Newt Gingrich <a href="http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/newt-gingrich-america-should-be-more-like-saudia-arabia/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+OTB+%28Outside+The+Beltway+%7C+OTB%29">rejected</a> a mosque in lower Manhattan until and unless a church was built in Mecca. Nobody pointed out that American Muslims are not Saudis; we are Americans, with no more power over Saudi domestic policy than any other private American citizen. Nobody noted the elision of America and Christianity, for Gingrich defined and demanded reciprocity - dealing with American Muslims as if we are the representatives of a foreign regime - through the establishment not of any civic institution that reflects America, but rather a house of worship.</p>

                <p>Is America a Christian nation? Is America exempt from international law? What is our responsibility to the world? How is the idea of democracy, and of the separation of powers, received by the world in the face of our increasing sectarian politics? And how do these fears, anxieties, and prejudices reverberate through our politics, beginning at anti-mosque protests across America, and ending, one fears, with the power to influence our government for years to come? For the interpretation of our Constitution is, of course, determined by elected officials and the sentiments they pander to, reflect, and irresponsibly amplify." </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Nebraska high court correct in declining to rule on immigration ordinance</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.neequaljustice.org"><strong>David Pantos</strong></a> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.neequaljustice.org">Legal Aid of Nebraska</a>]: "The Supreme Court of Nebraska (SCONE) made the correct decision in <a href=http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/11/nebraska-high-court-declines-to-rule-on-local-immigration-ordinance.php>declining to rule</a> on the Fremont, NE <a href=http://www.fremontne.gov/DocumentView.aspx?DID=714>immigration ordinance</a>, against the request of the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska. This was the right decision for basic reasons.  </p>

                <p>First, no party to the litigation raised any state law claims. The lawsuit triggering the Federal Court's request, <a href=http://www.supremecourt.ne.gov/opinions/2010/november/nov5/s33-100018.pdf><span class="casename">Keller v. City of Fremont</span></a> [PDF], involves a challenge to a local ordinance which city voters approved through an initiative. The ordinance mandates that any renter obtain a permit from the City in order to acquire housing. Additionally, it prohibits landlords from renting a dwelling unit in Fremont to a person who is in the United States illegally. The ordinance also requires all business entities in the City to register with the <a href=http://www.dhs.gov/files/programs/gc_1185221678150.shtm>E-Verify system</a>, and to ascertain that each employee hired after registration be authorized for employment in the United States.</p>

                <p>The Federal District Court judge's inquiry, or "certified question," asks generally "whether a Nebraska city of the first class, that is not a 'home rule' city under Article XI of the Nebraska Constitution and has not passed a home rule charter, promulgate an ordinance placing conditions on persons' eligibility to occupy dwellings, landlords' ability to rent dwellings, or business owners' authority to hire and employ workers, is consistent with...the revised Statutes of Nebraska?" </p>

                <p>But the SCONE rightly notes that the certified question does not indicate specific state law or state constitution claims. Furthermore, the SCONE reasons: "We have interpreted the Nebraska Constitution's due process and equal protection clauses to afford protections coextensive to those of the federal Constitution. Because we have not afforded greater state constitutional protections, no state constitutional questions are determinative of the pending federal claims."</p>

                <p>Second, the SCONE correctly identifies the heart of the lawsuit "If the plaintiffs have instead claimed that the ordinance is preempted by federal immigration laws, preemption of a state law under the Supremacy Clause presents a federal question." Indeed, the SCONE knows quite well that the Fremont Ordinance is essentially identical to immigration ordinances passed in Hazleton, PA and other communities where preemption claims have been successfully raised by plaintiffs challenging those ordinances.</p>

                <p>The federal court quixotically attempted to cloak its authority with a general question. But the SCONE, facing budgetary and time constraints, correctly penetrated the cloak and sent <span class="casename">Keller</span> back to the federal level for determination. Since the City of Fremont has <em>sua sponte</em> placed the enforcement of the ordinance on hold, the Federal Court has plenty of time to deliberate."</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.stoptorture.org.il/en"><strong>Ishai Menuchin</strong></a> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.stoptorture.org.il/en">Public Committee Against Torture in Israel</a>]: "The Public Committee Against Torture in Israel welcomes B'Tselem and Hamoked's recent report, <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/israel-forces-unlawfully-abusing-palestinian-detainees-rights-group.php">"Kept in the Dark"</a> which is an important study of one particular Shin Bet interrogation center over a limited period of time.</p>

                <p>PCATI's ongoing and daily work in the field on the issue of treatment of detainees at arrest and during interrogation, which has been made available to the public and to policy maker over the years, has made it clear that torture and ill treatment continues to be used by Israel's Security Agency (ISA, also known as the GSS) and this in direct violation of a variety of international legal instruments, including the UN Convention Against Torture.   PCATI's work has pointed to specific practices that include many mentioned in the organization's report.  PCATI continues to assert that in these cases, in which the intentional infliction of pain, including the use of prolonged and painful shackling, abusive incommunicado detention, threats against family members, sleep deprivation and sensory manipulation, and other means of physical and psychological violence all demonstrate not only that ill treatment is a matter of practice, but so too is torture, which has been described in many sources as an aggravated form of ill treatment.  <br />
                    <br />
                    PCATI's work and publications (for example, <a href="http://www.stoptorture.org.il/en/node/1520">"Accountability Denied"</a> 2009) have consistently pointed out that torture and torturers remain protected by the systematic application of impunity which is seen in the manner in which complaints to the authorities are regularly disregarded after an official inquiry which is conducted by an active Shin Bet agent. While we continue to see the regular use of ill treatment and torture against adult males, PCATI is now working with DCI-Palestine in order to fight the torture, ill treatment and humiliation of Palestinian youths, which too is becoming all too systemic.</p>

                <p>PCATI, of course welcomes the input of B'tselem and HaMoked and hopes that this report when coupled with PCATI's long line of reporting, visits with victims of torture and ill treatment throughout the prison system, and legal advocacy and litigation will assist in the struggle against torture and ill treatment in and by Israel."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Mutual recognition key to overcoming Yugoslav Wars</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href=http://www.transconflict.com/about/advisory-board/ian-bancroft/>Ian Bancroft</a></strong> [Co-founder &#38; Executive Director, <a href=http://www.transconflict.com>TransConflict</a>]: "What was truly significant about the recent events in the eastern Croatian town of Vukovar was the willingness of both presidents - Serbia's Boris Tadi&#263; and Croatia's Ivo Josipovi&#263; - to <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/serbia-president-apologizes-for-croatia-war-crimes.php">apologize for crimes committed by the military forces of their respective countries</a>; Tadi&#263; for the massacre of 260 Croats in 1991, Josipovi&#263; for the killing of 18 Serbs in the village of Paulin Dvor later that same year. Mutual recognition is a key, yet contentious element of the process of reconciliation. It does not imply the equalisation of the severity of the crimes committed, nor does it in any way serve to diminish culpability for those very crimes. Instead, it reaffirms the sanctity of each and every individual victim of the war, irrespective of their ethnicity. </p>

                <p>There exists, however, a fine line between recognising and relativising war crimes. One party to the conflict - which is invariably defined in terms of ethno-national identity - refuses to acknowledge crimes committed against another party because of a sense that, in doing so, they will somehow justify the very crimes perpetuated against them by that same party. The problem is compounded by the overly simplistic dichotomies employed in an effort to explain the civil war in the former Yugoslavia - for instance, the notion of "defenders" versus "aggressors" - which tend to reinforce the collectivisation of guilt and prevent an ethnicity-blind pursuit of justice for individual victims. </p>

                <p>The continued instrumentalisation of war crimes for political purposes - particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo - further impairs the prospects for reconciliation, at least in the foreseeable future. With unresolved status issues - namely, Bosnia's internal governing structure and Kosovo's secession from Serbia - ever present in the political life of each territory, leaders on all sides are reluctant to take the first step towards apology and forgiveness for fear of giving credence to their opponent's stance. Narratives of victimhood also distract attention from the real reasons for the lack of progress and serve to erroneously  attribute blame to others. </p>

                <p>The domestic criticisms that both presidents have encountered for their apologies - particularly following the Serbian parliament's resolution in March this year condemning the 1995 Srebrenica massacre and Josipovi&#263;'s address to members of both houses of Bosnia's parliament where he expressed his deep regret about Croatia's own role - raises another important question; namely, can acts of forgiveness or apology be made on behalf of entire ethno-national groups when many members of a "group" or "community" do not seek forgiveness nor to apologize, or when members of another do not wish to forgive? To ensure that the apologies made reverberate throughout both Serbian and Croatian society, there is a need to continue to support efforts at public education and debate. A failure to do will mean that the courageous acts of Tadi&#263; and Josipovi&#263; remain largely in the domain of high symbolism.  </p>

                <p>With respect to Serbian-Croatian relations, a number of outstanding issues left over from the war remain to be solved, particularly the fate of missing persons. In addition, both countries are striving to reach an amicable out of court settlement to their respective genocide cases against one another (Croatia's back in 1999 and Serbia's counter-suit earlier this year). Serbia's genuine commitment to dealing with the legacies of the past will, however, only be confirmed by determined steps to apprehend and extradite Ratko Mladi&#263;.  </p>

                <p>Only through the mutual recognition of each and every victim of the wars of the former Yugoslavia, regardless of their identity, can the foundations be laid to help transcend hardening inter-ethnic divisions. The transformation of conflict in the region requires both an end to the collectivisation of guilt and the instrumentalisation of crimes for political ends. Overcoming these conundrums, however, requires a sustained public debate - founded upon mutual recognition and acknowledgement - that involves those often neglected and maligned voices. Whether the political will exists for such a process, however, especially in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo, remains to be seen."  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/files/BioPicRCD2.pdf"><strong>Richard C. Dieter</strong></a> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/home/">Death Penalty Information Center</a>]: "A high delegation of U.S. officials recently traveled to Geneva, Switzerland, to report to the recently-formed United Nations Human Rights Council concerning our observance of human rights standards.  Other countries were entitled to comment on the <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/un-makes-recommendations-for-us-to-improve-human-rights-record.php">U.S.'s compliance with these standards</a>, and many nations pointed to our continued use of the death penalty as a human rights violation.  In response, the U.S. rightly stated that the death penalty is not forbidden under international law, and is an internal matter for each state to choose or reject.</p>

                <p>While that position technically protects us from being an outlaw nation, it fails to adequately respond to the growing isolation of the U.S. on this fundamental issue.  Human rights norms are in large part the product of international consensus.  Practices like slavery, apartheid, and child labor were once held to be lawful, but are now universally condemned.  The development of human rights in the international community progresses over time, just as our own recognition of civil rights has matured greatly since our country was founded.  Our acknowledgment that certain punishments have become cruel and unusual is also an evolutionary process.  When a punishment is rarely practiced, is endorsed by only a minority of states, and is subject to growing condemnation, our courts have barred its use in the remaining states where it exists.  We do not wait until every state and every citizen agrees that the punishment must go.</p>

                <p>In the international community, the use of the death penalty is increasingly considered a cruel and unusual punishment.  There are almost 200 countries in the world and 139 have abolished the death penalty in law or abandoned it in practice.  Only 29% of the countries in the world retain the use of the death penalty, and even fewer carried out any executions last year.  The U.S. is part of that dwindling minority, having executed 52 inmates in 2009, putting us in the top five of that unenviable category.  </p>

                <p>What should be our reaction when other countries raise such criticism?  If we think we are being shamed, we will respond defensively.  But many of our allies have a high respect for the great, multi-cultural democratic society we have created.  They want our help in ensuring human rights around the world.  The death penalty does not make us barbaric, but it is a blind spot.  The river of human rights flows irresistibly through history, even though its course is not always straight.  At this juncture, we are standing outside of the flow, and it is hard to see that other countries may be moving ahead of us.  Recognizing a right to life even within the condemned convict, would not be a concession - it would be an affirmation of much that we already believe."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://ccrjustice.org/about-us/staff-board/quigley%2C-bill"><strong>Bill Quigley</strong></a> [Legal Director, <a href="http://ccrjustice.org">Center for Constitutional Rights</a>]: "The Department of Justice decision to <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/no-charges-to-be-filed-in-cia-videotape-destruction-case.php">refuse to prosecute</a> anyone for the intentional destruction of evidence of over 90 tapes documenting crimes of torture is an outrageous betrayal of respect for human rights and the rule of law.</p>

                <p>The DOJ continues to try to construct a cocoon of impunity for all the government officials and private contractors involved in torture - a clear crime under both US and international law. Remember that in February the DOJ said there would be no legal or disciplinary consequences for John Yoo and the other torture-authorizing lawyers. Now ex-president Bush admits in his memoir that he authorized torture but he blames it on the lawyers.</p>

                <p>Despite these continued attempts to deflect responsibility, by both the DOJ and the Bush apologizers in the current administration, accountability will be forthcoming.</p>

                <p>Since US officials have decided they will not hold anyone accountable, now is the time for the international community to step up. Recall that although Chile originally allowed General Pinochet impunity, the world community rose up and demanded justice. Pinochet was charged in Spain and arrested in London.   <br />
                    <br />
                    The Center for Constitutional Rights and the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights have <a href="http://www.ccrjustice.org/spain-us-torture-case">intervened</a> in an ongoing criminal investigation in Spain, looking into the actions of Bush and other torture authorizers. We will wait no longer for the Obama administration and the DOJ. As counsel in the ongoing criminal investigation in Spain, we will continue to seek justice and accountability for torture under the principle of universal jurisdiction."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/facultystaff/faculty/BDavis/BDavis.htm">Benjamin Davis</a> of the University of Toledo College of Law says that while pundits on either side of the political spectrum may criticize the trial of or verdict against Ahmed Ghailani, the case shows that US civilian courts can provide justice even in cases of terrorism... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forumy/benjamindavisnew.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>A</b></font>n American jury has convicted Ahmed Ghailani of conspiracy and acquitted him of other charges for the 1998 Embassy bombings in an ordinary civilian court in New York.  Ghailani faces 20 years to life as punishment for the crime for which he stands convicted. The press is stating that this decision is a disaster. Why? Because the judge excluded evidence tainted by torture and the jury heard the evidence deemed proper and acquitted the defendant on all but one of the charges.<br />
 <br />
This case is only a disaster for those who wanted to create ersatz justice in a kangaroo military commission system that was and is (as I have explained many times in many places) a third class process hermetically sealing foreigners in a conviction machine.<br />
 <br />
A jury deliberative process occurred in New York civilian court not a plea deal in a military commission system in which the charges are shaped inconsistent with international law, the evidence is shaped to permit introduction of tortured statements, and the procedure is shaped to create a tilted playing field in favor of the state and against the defendant.<br />
 <br />
The New York jury deliberated and it struggled.  It was terribly difficult for them from published reports. But it is the best that we have.<br />
 <br />
We can expect from the right scathing criticisms from those who supported the use of torture all these years trying to intimidate the Obama Administration into not holding anymore civilian trials for detainees. Already, we have seen the Obama Administration begin to signal it's unwillingness to try Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in New York because of bipartisan objections to a civilian trial and begin to imagine indefinite detention for him. We can expect from the left a minimum of support for the terrific judge who heard the case and the jury that did its job for fear of being seen as "soft on terror".<br />
 <br />
To hell with those critiques on the left or the right! Hooray for American Justice!<br />
 <br />
A great leader of an international criminal tribunal once told me that the test of his tribunal had been not in its convictions of horrendous perpetrators but in its acquittals. Justice Robert Jackson emphasized in 1945 that for judicial norms and judicial forms to be present, a defendant has to be able to prove his innocence in the procedure. That is precisely what happened in this case for Mr. Ghailani for many of the charges against him.<br />
That is the rule of law - not the lynchmob law of military commissions under the current system, not the kind of  "law" practices from the old segregated South that Judge James Robertson warned about in his obiter dicta while allowing Hamdan's military commission to go forward about which I wrote about in my "<a href="http://www.law.northwestern.edu/lawreview/colloquy/2008/32/">No Third Class Processes for Foreigners</a>" (No Third Class Processes for Foreigners, 103 Nw. U. L. Rev. Colloquy 88 (2008)).</p>

<p>This New York jury and that judge showed that a trial can be had and a verdict rendered on the basis of evidence in a procedure that is consistent with the best of the American system. <br />
 <br />
That New York jury and that judge has sent a tremendous message to the terrorists of the world that we will not be further stampeded into giving up what is best about our system in fear of all they can throw at us.<br />
 <br />
That New York jury and that judge have shown the world that - at least these New Yorkers - are not wimps but are willing to stand up and do their civic duty in the highest tradition of our legal system. Would that the rest of the New Yorkers would pipe down and let KSM be tried in New York - scene of the crime. Trauma from crimes is part and parcel of criminal justice - and we always prefer to try the defendant in the jurisdiction where the crime was committed.<br />
 <br />
That New York jury and that judge showed that secret evidence can be successfully dealt with in an open civilian court or in camera proceedings as needed. Not in some hideaway process with only select few permitted to go there on some obscure island in the Caribbean.<br />
 <br />
That New York jury and that judge showed once again that the civilian courts are capable of providing swift and sure justice if given a chance after all the fumbling around that has been done with these defendants held at Gitmo.<br />
 <br />
That New York jury and judge have shown that those in the current or past state who seek to demean the United States through torture can be sanctioned in precisely the way that hurts them the most by having the fruits of their torture revealed, discarded, and by ensuring that the tortured evidence not besmirch the quality of justice that we render. We will not let justice descend to their animalistic level. <br />
 <br />
We will rather have the accused face the light of day in as open a regularly constituted judicial forum as we have in which we provide our strictest norms built in the bedrock of our Constitution and consistent with our international obligations.<br />
 <br />
This is a wonderful day for the United States - beginning to come out of a dark night of repression led by those who sought to repress all that is good in us by playing on our fears and who do not trust what is the heart of our system.<br />
 <br />
Today the beating heart of what America is about overcame the fear, overcame the spinelessness of so many, and overcame the worst in us and made a reasoned decision in accordance with well-founded law. That is something we all should be celebrating.<br />
 <br />
Let the naysayers hold their hearings!  Let the punditry fill the conflictonator with all the vile words they want!<br />
 <br />
But while that goes on, let us salute Judge Lewis Kaplan and the men and women of that jury who gave Mr. Ghailani a fair day in court. That is what we ask of judicial forms - and we got that here. Wow! What a wonderful day!</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist Michael Serota of Georgetown Law School's Street Law Clinic says that engaging Americans on the topic of constitutional interpretation is central to the development of our country. His own experiences with students suggest that it is worth devoting resources to improving the public discourse over constitutional interpretation....  <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/serota.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>H</b></font>ere is a hard truth that many know, but few outside of the legal profession truly appreciate: personal preferences do not dictate constitutional meaning. Of course, there are substantial disagreements among judges over how best to interpret the Constitution, but these disagreements are primarily about process. Instead of arguing about which outcomes are more or less politically desirable, judges debate the analytical methods and types of evidence that should be used to derive meaning from the Constitution's provisions. And although some believe that the debate over methodology is merely a proxy for the debate over judicial outcomes, the decisions of our federal judiciary, viewed as a whole, suggest otherwise.</p>

<p>However, notwithstanding the legitimate methodological disagreements that exist in the judiciary, many of our politicians and talk show hosts often eschew analytical nuance for the "I believe it, so therefore it must be true" approach, treating constitutional interpretation as purely a matter of personal opinion. Trading discussion of interpretive methodology for platitudes such as "judicial activism" or "undemocratic," prominent commentators frequently seek justification for their own preferences rather than providing any substantive constitutional commentary. Not only is it dishonest, but it further entrenches the ideological divide in America and impedes an important discussion about how our Constitution should be interpreted.</p>

<p>This type of superficial approach is so deeply embedded in the media and in political rhetoric that the only way to overcome it is through the meaningful education of the American public on the topic of constitutional interpretation.</p>

<p>Now, some might argue that trumpeting a widespread constitutional theory revival movement sounds nice from the ivory tower, but lacks any realistic possibility of success. However, not only does this pessimism seem to guarantee the perpetuation of the status quo, but my own experience working with young people proves that it is perhaps misplaced.</p>

<p>Last spring, I worked with Berkeley Law's youth justice program, and had the opportunity to teach a one-hour seminar at a local public high school on the role of the judiciary. I delivered a short lecture to a diverse group of students ages 14-18 on the basic challenges and complexities of constitutional interpretation. Thirty minutes later, the students had taken over the discussion, and they began debating some of the foundational disagreements as to how judges should interpret our founding document.</p>

<p>The students intuitively picked up on issues such as the difficulties of discerning meaning from conflicting historical documents or from the actions of large groups, the costs and benefits of affording discretion to unelected judges in a democratic society, and the extent to which the Supreme Court should give effect to its own past interpretations of the Constitution. They struggled with developing a coherent approach to giving meaning to the Constitution's abstract phrases, such as "due process" and "equal protection." </p>

<p>Indeed, as the discussion gradually deepened, the students let go of their own preconceived notions of what they viewed as "totally unconstitutional," and began to wrestle with the legal concepts themselves. Not only was it exciting to watch, but it left me feeling that if this much could be accomplished in one hour with high school students, it is worth devoting resources to improving the public discourse over constitutional interpretation. With a little non-partisan educational outreach from our nation's lawyers, judges, and academics, there is substantial room for public engagement on this essential topic.</p>

<p>Similar experiences I have had recently working with young people through Georgetown Law School's Street Law Clinic have reaffirmed that one need not attend law school, or even college, to appreciate the challenges of constitutional interpretation in a diverse society filled with competing viewpoints and belief systems. But to do so, the public must be willing to set aside personal preferences and join the debate on its own terms; that is, we must be willing to engage in a discussion about the process of interpretation rather than solely focusing on the results themselves.</p>

<p>In order for this initiative to succeed, the focus must be on teaching the public how to think about these problems, rather than what to think about them. A seismic shift in our culture of constitutional debate will not happen overnight, but we must start somewhere, and with time, our public discussion will hopefully evolve into a thoughtful, informative, and useful dialogue that moves America forward.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.creighton.edu/law/faculty/kelly/index.php">Michael Kelly</a> of Creighton University School of Law says that US President Barack Obama made the right move in recommending India for a permanent position on the UN Security Council, but that the Council also needs to undergo more extensive changes in order to reflect current geo-political realities...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forumy/kellyupdated.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>P</b></font>resident Obama threw American support behind India's candidacy to join the United Nations Security Council in a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/09/world/asia/09prexy.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=obama%20india%20security%20council&st=cse">speech</a> before the Indian Parliament in New Delhi earlier this month. Clearly, India deserves a permanent seat on the Council as the world's largest democracy and a nuclear power to boot. And clearly, no state can hope to ascend to the Council without U.S. support. But it is also true that tossing a stone into this pond creates ever-wider geo-political ripples.</p>

<p>Created in 1945, the organization of the United Nations [<a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/index.shtml">UN Charter</a>] still reflects the broad post-World War II peace settlement. Each state would have a voice in the General Assembly - the resolutions of which are non-binding. And the victorious Allies would ensure international peace and security through their permanent presence on the Security Council - the resolutions of which are binding. Over time, it came to be recognized that the membership of the Security Council was not particularly representative, causing that body to suffer a legitimacy deficit. Non-permanent membership was expanded to ten seats elected for two-year terms on alternating cycles to provide better geographic representation. However, this supplement to the permanent seats occupied by Britain, France, China, Russia and the U.S. proved only a stop-gap measure.</p>

<p>Over time, justifications for permanent membership seemed to fade as the political and economic influence of Britain and France waned while that of Germany, Japan, and India steadily rose. Military justifications also faded as the Soviet Union collapsed, the nuclear club expanded beyond the original five, and defense spending plummeted across Europe after the Cold War. Indeed, Britain is now <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/11/world/europe/11britain.html?scp=1&sq=britain%20aircraft%20carrier&st=cse">set to decommission</a> its last aircraft carrier, the Ark Royal.</p>

<p>If permanent seats on the Security Council are supposed to be filled by those states with the greatest capacity to ensure international peace and security (and the legitimacy of that body's resolutions are hinged to representativeness), adjustments have been in order for quite awhile. The problem that has forestalled all discussion on this point is the veto. Each of the five permanent members has the ability kill any action the Security Council seeks to undertake by withholding its assent. During the Cold War, the threat of either an American or Soviet veto kept the Council in a deep freeze. Altering the Council in any way could trigger a veto from either France or Britain, which present the weakest cases for continuing permanent membership, to protect their seats.</p>

<p>A secondary stumbling block has erupted amongst potential candidates to fill new seats. National and regional jealousies pervade an atmosphere of antagonism. Pakistan and Indonesia argue that India cannot possibly represent the Muslims of South Asia. Mexico and Argentina level the same argument against Brazil's potential ascension with respect to the Spanish-speaking population of Latin America. And how could one choose between a largely black versus a largely Arab state to represent Africa? These tensions hold back logical candidates like India, Brazil and South Africa and, without that geographical/political cover, Germany and Japan can never hope to join. Adding the former Axis powers to the Security Council by themselves adds no diversity to the Council, although it makes eminent sense to do so based solely upon their economic power and historical contributions to the United Nations.</p>

<p>And yet a comprehensive reform of the Security Council's permanent membership could be had if candidates and current members are willing to barter. The non-permanent seats should be left in place at ten. And the permanent seats should increase by two for a total of seven. Russia, China, and the U.S., by virtue of their economic, political, and nuclear strength should also be left in place. But the remaining four seats should be dedicated to regional representation for Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Each regional permanent seat should be filled on a rotating basis among three states in that region for a two-year term.</p>

<p>The European seat would be shared among France, Britain, and Germany. The Asian seat would be shared among Japan, India, and Pakistan (or Indonesia). The African seat would be shared among Egypt, South Africa, and Nigeria (or Kenya). The Latin American seat would be shared by Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina (or Chile). This would ensure the most diverse representation while also ensuring a relatively small, and thus more efficient and manageable, Security Council.</p>

<p>But the specter of veto-proliferation hovers over any talk of Security Council expansion. Thus, only current veto holders should continue to wield the "substantive veto" that can kill anything. That means the European seat would continue to hold such power along with Russia, China, and the U.S. For new permanent seats, a "procedural veto" may be devised. That power would entail a referral mechanism such that when a new permanent Security Council casts a veto, instead of killing the measure outright, the question is referred to a standing committee of the General Assembly.</p>

<p>The benefits of creating a procedural veto are two-fold. New permanent members ascend to the Security Council with a veto power, although not one of the same order that currently exists. And the General Assembly potentially gains a long-sought role in matters of international peace and security. An ancillary benefit is that the threat substantive veto usage is reduced from five to four at any single meeting of the Council. </p>

<p>India should join the Security Council. Even President Obama's fiercest conservative critics <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/253121/why-obama-right-about-india-charles-krauthammer#">agree</a> with him on that. Germany and Japan should join, as well as Brazil. But this cannot happen in a vacuum. It can only happen in the context of more significant systemic reform. My prediction is that America won't, or can't, get truly serious about that until after the next presidential election. Once safely within his second term, Mr. Obama could then move squarely toward tackling this major project. But it certainly does not hurt to begin setting up the dominoes now.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Jordan Paust of the University of Houston says recent evidence shows that the US has enabled certain Nazi war criminals to avoid prosecution, but that it is incumbent upon the government to end such impunity by actively prosecuting and/or extraditing suspects to stand trial... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/JPaust.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>I</b></font>n the past, the United States has rightly decried the intentional provision of safe havens for international criminals and has even claimed - improperly under international law - that it had a right to use armed force against the Taliban government in Afghanistan for its provision of safe haven to bin Laden while otherwise rightly engaging in self-defense against (non-state) armed attacks by al Qaeda on 9/11, thus starting the longest war in U.S. history.  Now, with the release of a redacted December 2006 <a href="http://documents.nytimes.com/confidential-report-provides-new-evidence-of-notorious-nazi-cases?ref=us#p=1">DOJ report</a> that had been allegedly six years in the making, we more clearly understand that for decades the United States has been in "collaboration" with and has provided "a safe haven for [certain Nazi] persecutors" or international criminals who had participated in what were among the most evil crimes against humanity and war crimes known to humankind. While prosecuting many of the perpetrators and aiders and abettors of the Holocaust in tribunals abroad, the U.S. Executive secretly engaged in a serious and unforgivable violation of its constitutionally-based duty under international law to either extradite or initiate prosecution of Nazis who were known to have committed or who were reasonably accused of having committed clearly reprehensible crimes against humanity and war crimes. That duty under customary international law, captured in the Latin phrase <em>aut dedere aut judicare</em>, still pertains and there is universal jurisdiction over such crimes committed in violation of customary international law.</p>

<p>Planned impunity for Nazi accused began soon after Word War II, and the United States was not alone in instigating a secret cover-up and immunity for perpetrators of and contributors to the Holocaust. A seventeen-nation United Nations War Crimes Commission (UNWCC) compiled secret files on alleged international criminals from the Nazi regime, including Kurt Waldheim who would later become the U.N. Secretary-General. By 1986, Waldheim's file became publicly known. The CIA acknowledged soon thereafter that it had knowledge of an Office of Strategic Services (OSS) report on Waldheim, who had turned himself in to U.S. forces in Yugoslavia.  Also released by the UNWCC were secret files on Adolf Eichmann, Joseph Mengele, and Klaus Barbie, each of whom had been among the most infamous perpetrators of international crimes. By 1987, France, Poland, and India, who had been members of the UNWCC, were still refusing to agree to public disclosure of the contents of the U.N. war crime files.</p>

<p>By the late 1970s, the U.S. Executive had made some effort to denaturalize and deport (but not to extradite for prosecution as required by international law) certain alleged Nazi war criminals. A few, like John Demjanjuk, were extradited. None were to be prosecuted in the courts of the United States and it is now evident that a secret and illegal marriage had occurred between the Office of Strategic Services (OSS; now the Central Intelligence Agency or CIA) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) to cover up a program of impunity for certain Nazi accused. This was illegal because under the United States Constitution all members of the Executive branch are bound by the law - including international law - and the Attorney General in particular has an independent constitutionally-based duty faithfully to execute the laws. The redacted classified report of an outcome of that marriage has just been released, and we learn that there had been a refusal to release the report during by Bush Administration at least since 2006.  The marriage, we must never forget, culminated in the serial criminality engaged in by highest level members of the Bush Administration during George Bush's and Dick Cheney's admitted "program" of secret detention (a crime against humanity and war crime in the context of war) and "tough" interrogation which clearly involved criminal acts of torture and cruel and inhumane treatment of human beings. Still today, the Executive refuses to initiate prosecution of all persons who are reasonably accused of having committed crimes against humanity and war crimes, although it is the continual duty of the United States to either initiate prosecution or extradite.</p>

<p>As some of my present and former students know, I used to send letters to the U.S. Attorney General asking why there had been a refusal to comply with our international legal obligations in connection with Nazi accused. Usually, I would not receive a reply, although sometimes I would receive a thank-you-for-your-letter response and nothing else would occur. On May 2nd, 2001, I wrote to then Attorney General John Ashcroft "to point out that the United States has the capability of prosecuting persons for alleged war crimes committed abroad, whether the accused are foreign or U.S. nationals," and I provided an insert addressing such a competence under two forms of U.S. legislation that are noted below. My letter also noted that the "propriety of use of such legislation" had been explained in our casebook, <em>Paust, Bassiouni, et al. International Criminal Law 243-44, 253-67 (2 ed. 2000)</em>. The letter ended with a recognition that, "[o]f course, the United States has an obligation to either initiate prosecution of or to extradite all persons reasonably accused of war crimes in violation of customary international law."  </p>

<p>This time, I received a two-page reply. It came from the Chief of DOJ's Terrorism and Violent Crime Section and was dated August 10, 2010, just one month before 9/11. Within the letter was a statement that "[t]he Department of Justice does not view the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00002441----000-.html">1996 War Crimes Act</a>, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2441, cited in your memorandum, as applicable to offenses committed overseas by foreign nationals against non-U.S. nationals.... Further, ... the Department has concluded that <em>ex post facto</em> principles preclude the application of the Section to offenses that occurred before the October 11, 1996, date of its enactment."  </p>

<p>Nonetheless, it is widely known that a U.S. federal statute can incorporate international criminal law by reference or set forth elements of international crimes and operate retrospectively without violating <em>ex post facto</em> principles as long as what is covered in the new legislation was a crime under international law at the time of the alleged infraction. An 1866 Digest of Opinions of the Judge Advocate General of the Army had recognized that retroactive application of the <a href="http://www.civilwarhome.com/liebercode.htm">1863 Lieber Code</a>, which had codified customary international laws of war, was appropriate and allowed prosecution of war crimes committed during the Civil War even though there was no relevant federal statute defining such crimes or incorporating them by reference.  Widely known also was the fact that although Israel, its courts, and its legislation did not exist during the Holocaust, it could lawfully prosecute someone like Eichmann for prior conduct in violation of international law. Moreover, the <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/imtconst.asp">Charters of the International Military Tribunals at Nuremberg</a> and for the Far East had not existed prior to criminal conduct addressed by the tribunals, nor had <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/imt10.asp">Control Council Law No. 10</a> existed prior to the international criminal activity addressed in numerous military commissions that had prosecuted tens of thousands of accused within Europe. There was, admittedly, no <em>ex post facto</em> problem encountered with respect to the creation of new charters or enactments and new tribunals as long as what was covered had been crimes under international law.</p>

<p>In fact, the United States had prosecuted war crimes, however sparingly, from the founding until 1916 without any federal legislation that had incorporated the laws of war. During 1916, new federal legislation was adopted that incorporated all of the customary laws of war by reference as offenses against the laws of the United States and that had also allowed jurisdiction in courts-martial and other military tribunals. This fact was affirmed by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Ex parte Quirin</em> (1942) and in other U.S. cases. Clearly, under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00003231----000-.html">18 U.S.C. &#167; 3231</a>, federal district courts have jurisdiction over all offenses against the laws of the United States and Nazi accused could have been prosecuted in federal district courts by use of the 1916 legislation and &#167; 3231.  Relevant parts of the 1916 legislation have been duplicated since the 1950s in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode10/usc_sec_10_00000818----000-.html">10 U.S.C. &#167; 818</a>. Again, as recognized by the Supreme Court in Quirin and in other U.S. courts, that legislation "incorporated by reference... all offenses which are defined as such by the law of war" as offenses against the laws of the United States, and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3231 necessarily provides concurrent jurisdiction in the federal district courts that can be utilized if the U.S. Attorney General ever wants to comply with his or her constitutionally-based duty to faithfully execute the laws.</p>

		<title>Roma students face lasting repercussions from discrimination</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.errc.org/en-about-us-members.php"><strong>Lydia Gall</strong></a> [Staff Attorney, <a href="http://www.errc.org/index.php">The European Roma Rights Centre</a>]: "In a Romani settlement in Slovakia, a boy attending a mainstream school was awarded a small scholarship for being a gifted student. He dreamed of growing up and being an auto mechanic. Later, following a dispute with a teacher, he was placed in a special class for pupils with mental disabilities attended only by Romani children, as a punitive measure. No psychological assessment preceded the decision and neither he nor his parents were informed of or consented to his placement in the special class. This decision affected the remainder of his academic career, his educational prospects and his opportunities to access meaningful employment. Graduating from the special school made him ineligible to attend the technical school to train as a mechanic. In the boy's own words: "They [the school] took my dream away from me. They made me stupid."</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, his story is commonplace in Europe. Europe's highest human rights court has ruled on this issue three times; each judgment expressly condemns discriminatory practices targeting Romani children in education. The nature and justification for the segregation differs in each case. In 2007 the European Court of Human Rights (the Court) issued a landmark judgment in <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&documentId=825443&portal=hbkm&source=externalbydocnumber&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649">D.H. and Others v. The Czech Republic</a>, finding the placement of Romani children in special schools for pupils with mild mental disabilities to be illegal discrimination. The following year, in <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=1&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=32526 <br />
/05%20%7C%2032526/05&sessionid=9006431&skin=hudoc-en">Sampanis and Others v. Greece</a>, the Court held unanimously that there had been a violation of Article 14, in conjunction with Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf"> European Convention on Human Rights</a> [PDF] (the Convention), on the basis of State failure to provide schooling for the applicants' children and of their subsequent placement in separate classes because of their Romani origin. Most recently, in <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&documentId=864619&portal=hbkm&source=externalbydocnumber&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649">Or&#353;u&#353; and Others v. Croatia</a>, the Grand Chamber of the Court went further and overruled a decision by the Chamber, stating that alleged language difficulties may not be used as a pretext for segregating Romani children. </p>

                <p>Despite this progress, problems of segregation, inequality and inferior curricula remain the norm for many Romani children in Europe as implementation of these judgments in the respective countries has been virtually non-existent. In the Czech Republic, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/human-rights-groups-file-complaint-with-eu-condemning-czech-republics-treatment-of-roma-children.php">fast tracking of Romani children</a> into special schools for pupils with mild mental disabilities continues. For example, in some regions Romani students are today 27 times more likely to be placed in a special school than non-Roma. New cases have also been filed against Greece before the Court. Research by the European Roma Rights Centre and Greek Helsinki Monitor in 2010 revealed that in 21 out of 50 communities visited, Romani children are not in school at all. Where they do attend schools, they are often placed in segregated facilities. In Croatia, Roma are still segregated based on language concerns.</p>

                <p>But segregation and inferior education are issues beyond the Czech Republic, Greece and Croatia. The widespread problem spans the continent. For example, according to a 2009 survey in Slovakia, at least three out of four pupils attending special schools for children with learning disabilities were Romani; across the country, 85 percent of children in special classes were Roma (Roma Education Fund, "School as Ghetto," Budapest 2009, p. 23). In Hungary, the ERRC joins the Chance For Children Foundation in filing cases in domestic courts concerning Romani children placed in special schools based on flawed evaluation tests. In February 2010, the Macedonian Ombudsman's Office <a href="http://www.ombudsman.mk/default.aspx?Lan=EN">published a report</a> confirming the overrepresentation of Romani children in special schools for children with mental disabilities in several locations. Similar problems of segregation and overrepresentation in special schools or classes exist in <a href="http://www.soros.org/initiatives/roma/articles_publications/publications/roma-children-serbia-20101019">Serbia</a> and Romania. </p>

                <p>In the European Union and in several EU candidate countries, persistent practices separate Romani children from non-Romani children. Whether they are simply not enrolled, are placed in special schools or classes for pupils with mental disabilities or are segregated due to alleged language difficulties, Romani children are segregated because they are Roma. Such policies and/or practices continue to condemn generations of Europeans to a life of poverty, bereft of the right to equal and inclusive education, leaving them with little or no chance of securing meaningful employment. Above all, the failure of governments to change their policy and practice denies generations of Roma the opportunity to pursue their dreams."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnists <a href="http://www.nesl.edu/faculty/Friedman.cfm">Lawrence Friedman</a> and <a href="http://www.nesl.edu/faculty/hansen.cfm">Victor Hansen</a> of New England Law Boston say that the Ghailani trial demonstrated that, even without evidence obtained from  questionable interrogation techniques used on terrorism suspects, the government can make and prove its case.... <br /><hr size=1> <br /><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 align=left> <tr><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forumy/victorhansennew.jpg" align=left hspace=0 vspace=2></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height=1 width=5></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height=1 width=1></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forumy/lawrencefriedmannew.jpg" align=left hspace=0 vspace=2></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height=1 width=5></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height=1 width=1></td></tr></table><font size=3><b>L</b></font>ast week, a federal jury in New York acquitted Ahmed Ghailani of 279 terrorism-related charges. The jury also convicted him of one charge of conspiracy to destroy US Government buildings and property, for which he will serve a sentence of no less than 20 years. That verdict has reignited the debate over whether terrorism suspects should be tried in military commissions or in federal district courts. </p>

<p>Since September 11, the vast majority of terrorism trials have been held in federal court and the government has enjoyed an overwhelming conviction rate. But at least one aspect of Ghailani's trial was unique and raises issues not present in the other trials to date: he is the first suspect to be tried in federal court after being taken into custody in Pakistan and transported to a number of CIA "Black Sites" before ending up at Guantanamo. While in the custody and control of the CIA and the US military, Ghailani was subjected to harsh interrogation techniques. Because his confessions came as a result of these interrogations, the government did not offer those statements into evidence at his trial. In addition, the judge in the case excluded the testimony of a key witness because the government only came to know about that witness as a result of the coercive interrogations of Ghailani.</p>

<p>Those critics who oppose trying terrorism suspects in federal court will seek to bolster their argument by pointing to the suppression of this evidence as reason for Ghailani's acquittal on all but one charge. The core of this argument is that we cannot try terrorism cases in federal court because we cannot afford the risk of acquittal, even when the government's case is built upon evidence obtained through legally questionable methods. All of this is in support of the contention that these cases are inherently different than typical criminal cases because we are at war with these terrorists and we should be using a war-fighting paradigm, including military commissions, to combat this threat. But, as the government's overwhelming conviction rate in other post-September 11 terrorism trials demonstrates, there is nothing about these cases that makes them inherently unsuitable for trial in federal court. </p>

<p>In fact, the government has already tried many of Ghailani's co-conspirators in federal court and they are now all serving life sentences in maximum-security prisons. What made Ghailani's case particularly challenging was not the crimes with which the government charged him, but how the government chose to treat Ghailani after he was apprehended in Pakistan.  Because the CIA and military interrogators subjected him to years of mistreatment, the government tainted its own evidence. If we had not used questionable interrogation techniques on Ghailani, his confessions would not have been suppressed and a key witness would have been permitted to testify in his trial. Accordingly, critics of federal court trials are reduced to arguing that we need to try Ghailani and others like him in military commissions because, due to our own mistreatment of these suspects, it has become more difficult to obtain convictions in federal court.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, we need to ask ourselves what it is the United States stands for. If we simply want trials to confirm what we already believe to be true - to guarantee convictions - then we are headed down a road unfamiliar to the way justice traditionally has been administered in the United States. Here, the purpose of a trial has always been to put the government to its proof and to demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt that a particular defendant deserves our worst punishments. American leaders after World War II knew this and the trials in Nuremberg proved that, in the midst of the worst atrocities, justice could prevail. Pre-ordained judgments are not justice, as both our enemies and our allies in the war on terror know. </p>

<p>So it is important to note that, in the Ghailani trial, justice was done. The jury found the defendant guilty of conspiracy and he will serve a long sentence of at least a generation in prison and possibly life. In no sense could the trial or verdict be considered a failure. To the contrary, it demonstrates that, even without the results of questionable interrogation techniques on terrorism suspects, the government can make and prove its case. We can only wonder how much easier proving the case would have been had those interrogation techniques not be used.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist Saroop Ijaz, an advocate before the Lahore High Court in Pakistan, says that if Pakistan is to function as a democracy and - equally significantly - to address the threat of extremism both at home and abroad, its blasphemy laws should be repealed...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/Saroop.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>I</b></font>n June 2009 in the District Nankana in Punjab, Pakistan, Asia Bibi, a mother of five and farm hand, was asked to fetch water. She complied, but some of her fellow Muslim workers refused to drink the water as she - being a Christian - was considered "unclean." Apparently arguments ensued resulting in some coworkers complaining to a cleric that Bibi made derogatory comments about Prophet Muhammad. A mob came to her house, beating her and members of her family before she was rescued by the police. However, the police initiated an investigation about her remarks resulting in her arrest and prosecution under <a href="http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/legislation/1860/actXLVof1860.html">Section 295 C of the Pakistan Penal Code</a>. She spent more than a year in jail. In November 2010, she was sentenced to death by hanging. The sentence is yet to be carried out, and Bibi is filing an appeal.</p>

<p>The particular Blasphemy Law in question was introduced to the Pakistan Penal Code as Section 295 C in 1986. Under this Section, any person guilty of defiling the name of Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was made liable to suffer life imprisonment or death. In October 1990, the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) ruled that "the penalty for contempt of the Holy Prophet ... is death and nothing else" and directed the Government of Pakistan to effect the necessary legal changes.</p>

<p>The blasphemy laws can be found in the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), Section XV, Articles 295-298. They address a number of offenses, including: defiling a place of worship, damaging the Qur'an, and apostasy. Those convicted face possible fines, life imprisonment, and even the death penalty. While several individuals have been sentenced to death for blasphemy, no one has yet been executed for the crime. A significant number, however, have been murdered after the accusation or during imprisonment after the conviction. On August 1, 2009 forty houses and a Church were set ablaze by a mob in the town of Gojra, Punjab. Nine Christians were burnt alive. The attacks were triggered by reports of desecration of the Qur'an. The local police had already registered a case under section 295 of the Pakistan Penal Code against three Christians for blasphemy. Hence a conviction or even an accusation under a blasphemy law provision is often a death sentence in itself.</p>

<p>The text of the blasphemy law is highly discriminatory and is <em>prima facie</em> in conflict with Article 25 of the <a href="http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/">Constitution of Pakistan</a>, 1973. Article 25 mandates that--with certain exceptions for reasonable classifications--there will be no discrimination. The blasphemy laws are religion-specific and hence cannot be construed as reasonable classification. The blasphemy laws ignore the requirement of <em>mens rea</em> (intention) for the commission of offenses, hence making them strict liability offenses. The construction of these offenses further reveals that they ignore common law exceptions (insanity, minority, etc).</p>

<p>Pakistan formally ratified the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR) in June 2010.  Pakistan's blasphemy laws violate rights enshrined in the ICCPR and the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> (UDHR). Blasphemy laws in Pakistan are in conflict with the UDHR to which Pakistan is a signatory, in particular with Article 7 (equality before the law and protection against discrimination), Article 19 (freedom of opinion and expression), and Article 18 (freedom of thought, conscience, and religion). Blasphemy laws in Pakistan are also in violation of Articles 2, 3, and 4 of the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and Discrimination Based on Religion and  Belief, which categorically prohibits religious discrimination. Blasphemy laws violate Articles 2 and 4 of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious, and Linguistic Minorities that seek to protect fundamental freedoms "without any form of discrimination" and the right to freely "profess and practice their own religion."</p>

<p>Article 19 of the Constitution of Pakistan 1973 states that every citizen shall have the right to freedom of speech and expression, and there shall be freedom of the press - subject to any reasonable restrictions imposed by law in the interest of the glory of Islam or the integrity, security, or defense of Pakistan or any part thereof, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality, or in relation to contempt of court or incitement to an offense. The clawback provision is unnecessarily elaborate and vague. There is a dearth of jurisprudence defining the concept of "glory of Islam," hence the fundamental freedom of speech can often be reduced to nullity with such sweeping clawback provisions. Article 20 lays down the freedom to profess religion and to manage religious institutions subject to law, public order, and morality.</p>

<p>The blasphemy provisions were an important component of a social engineering campaign devised and implemented by General Zia-ul-Haq during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan during the 1980's. The ostensible objective was to Islamize the Pakistani state. Equally imperative was to tailor the social and legal system of the country to make the Mujahideen (loosely contemporary Taliban) appear to be indigenous freedom fighters.  Along with blasphemy laws, the infamous discriminatory Hudood ordinance was promulgated, which sought to punish women - for fornication -who were raped and were unable to bring forth four male pious Muslims who were witnesses to the rape.  The Sharia was sought to be implemented by undemocratically amending the Constitution. Under Article 203 D of the Constitution, the Federal Shariat Court was empowered to strike down any statutory law which may be deemed repugnant to the injunctions of Islam. The school curriculum was modified to be more Islamic. Female television anchors were ordained to cover their heads. Heavy censorship was exercised on both the print and electronic media to safeguard the glory of Islam. </p>

<p>The existence of these laws in Pakistan in practice ensures that there are no freedom of expression or religion safeguards in Pakistan. If Pakistan is to function as a democracy and - equally significantly - to address the threat of extremism both at home and abroad, these laws should be repealed.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.cfob.org/advisory_council.html"><strong>Paul Copeland</strong></a> [Advisory Council, <a href="http://www.cfob.org/index.html">Canadian Friends of Burma</a>]: "Although I practice law in the city of Toronto, for the last 22 years I have been involved with the democracy movement in Burma (also known as Myanmar). I have visited three times and plan to go back soon.</p>

                <p>Daw Aung San Suu Kyi is an amazing woman and the most important figure in the democracy movement in Burma.</p>

                <p>Since her release she has <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/11/suu-kyi-seeks-reinstatement-of-opposition-party.php">attempted to reinstate</a> her political party. The court applications that have been brought on behalf of the National League for Democracy and Aung San Suu Kyi have political value <em>outside</em> of Burma, but the reality <em>in</em> Burma is that the courts are totally corrupt and work hand in glove with the military dictatorship.</p>

                <p>I point to this example: When Aung San Suu Kyi was tried for allowing the American John Yettaw to stay over at her house, the two judges in the case imposed a sentence of three years in jail. General Than Shwe, at the same time as the court sentence was imposed, announced that his government had commuted the sentence to 18 months of house arrest. Clearly Than Shwe knew what the decision was before the court released it.  That is hardly the sign of judicial independence.</p>

                <p>The release of The Lady (as Daw Suu is known) is a very important step, but it is a very small step in the long journey to democracy in Burma. There are 2200 political prisoners in Burma, many serving extremely long sentences in abysmal conditions.</p>

                <p>Getting China, the largest and strongest supporter of the State Peace and Development Council, to change its position on Burma is unlikely. One area worthy of international pressure is the terrible position that the democratic government of India has taken in its dealings with the military dictatorship in Burma. Also, the generals in Burma have for years played the West, occasionally doing things that look like progress. The Roadmap to Democracy certainly fits into that pattern. The release of The Lady is in my view another cynical, manipulative move by the generals.</p>

                <p>The West and the U.N. should not be fooled. It is not time to relax the pressure; it is time to ramp it up. A new U.N Special Envoy on Burma should be appointed. The Special Envoy should not waste time meeting the generals or the so-called democratic government of Myanmar. The Special Envoy should concentrate on the ASEAN countries and special attention should be paid to India."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.stcl.edu/faculty/Geoffrey_Corn.htm">Geoffrey S. Corn</a>, Lt. Col. US Army (Ret.) of South Texas College of Law, says that past actions of a former Army Colonel recently elected to Congress highlight the need for military leaders to look beyond the narrow tactical benefits of harsh measures, to their larger impact on a conflict...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forumy/geoffreycornnew.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><imsrc="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>W</b></font>hile watching <em>Meet the Press</em> late last month, I became interested in learning a bit more about one guest, Allen West, U.S. Representative-elect for Florida's 22nd congressional district. West, a retired U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel was introduced as a veteran of both Gulf wars. A quick internet check confirmed my recollection: this was indeed the Lieutenant Colonel West at the center of a detainee abuse issue that I have always considered much more instructive for the average soldier than the much more highly visible abuse issues related to the "War on Terror." In an effort to obtain information related to a suspected ambush of members of his unit in Iraq, West <a href="http://blogs.browardpalmbeach.com/juice/2010/03/allen_west_military_career_abuse_iraqi_detainee.php">threatened</a> an Iraqi detainee with his 9mm service pistol, and fired a round off to make his point. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_West_(politician)">one summary of the incident</a>:<br />
<blockquote>While serving in Taji, Iraq, on August 20, 2003, as commander of the 2d Battalion, 20th Field Artillery Regiment, Lieutenant Colonel West was in charge of an interrogation of a civilian Iraqi police officer who was suspected of having pertinent information regarding attacks on American soldiers in the area. Interrogators had learned that the detainee had information about a planned ambush. When the interrogators were unable to extract the needed important information for some time, LTC West was asked to come try to obtain the important information. As the detainee continued to hold back the information, LTC West fired his pistol past the detainee's head into a clearing barrel, frightening (but not physically harming) the detainee and getting him to finally give the information. According to Lt. Col. West's sworn statement, the detainee informed West that:<br />
<blockquote>"[The attack] was to occur Friday morning in Saba al Boor vicinity of the police station by positioned snipers supposedly being brought in from Fallujah. [The detainee] was to ID my vehicle and myself for these rooftop firers. We took this information and the following day established flask CPs and used AH-64s overhead. There was no attack and no further attacks have emanated from the town since the apprehension of [the detainee] and his named associates."</blockquote>At least one man was apprehended as a result of the information obtained through the detainee's interrogation. His home was searched, but no plans for attacks on Americans or weapons were found. Colonel West testified that he did not know whether "any corroboration" of a plot was ever found, adding: "At the time I had to base my decision on the intelligence I received. It's possible that I was wrong about [the detainee,] Mr. Hamoodi."</p>

<p>West, who at the time was just short of having 22 years of service, was charged with violating articles 128 (assault) and 134 (general article) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. West was processed through an Article 32 hearing in November 2003, where he admitted wrongdoing, was fined $5,000 . He then submitted his retirement paperwork and was allowed to retire with full benefits in the summer of 2004.</p>

<p>At a hearing, West was asked by his defense attorney if he would do it again. "If it's about the lives of my men and their safety, I'd go through hell with a gasoline can," he said. Apparently not knowing West's gun was aimed into a barrel, "Hamoodi cracked and gave information about the planned ambush on West's convoy, thwarting the attack." West said there were no further ambushes on U.S. forces in Taji until he was relieved of his leadership post on October 4." After West's retirement was brought to public attention the next fall, he received over two thousand letters and e-mails from the American public offering him moral support. In addition, a letter in West's support and signed by ninety-five members of Congress was drafted to the Secretary of the Army. [citations omitted]</blockquote></p>

<p>Well, I guess the moral support translated nicely on Election Day! I don't think that is much of a surprise - I doubt many voters believe that threatening a "bad guy" to save the good guys is really all that problematic. Indeed, West's campaign produced a <a href="http://blogs.browardpalmbeach.com/juice/2010/08/allen_west_video_abuse_iraqi_detainee.php">video</a> that paints him as a hero deserving of great admiration for his commitment to his subordinates. I don't think anyone can question that latter point. West's motivation certainly seems to have been to protect his force. And this is why I think West's story is so instructive. </p>

<p>This incident brings into sharp focus the reality of imposing absolute constraints on the treatment of captured or detained opponents during armed hostilities, and how those constraints are often perceived as conflicting with the duty of combat leaders to do whatever they can to protect their own. Let me be clear - there is nothing about this incident that makes me question the validity of these constraints.  To the contrary, I believe what I taught for years as a JAG - that compliance with these constraints in the most difficult situations is a true mark of distinction for a military unit, and especially the commanders who lead those units. What so interesting about West's conduct, and important about this incident, is how it, and the sympathy he received (which obviously included that of many voters), raises the question of why a commander in his situation should be expected to embrace these constraints?</p>

<p>For me, the answer cannot be the risk of disciplinary sanction for non-compliance. That risk will rarely trump the instinct of commanders like West to use coercion to obtain information they believe is needed to protect their troops.  I have always believed that informing soldiers that battlefield misconduct could result in criminal sanction has minimal deterrent effect. Faced with situations of <em>extremis</em>, it is simply human nature to prioritize the immediate need over a potential future consequence. A commander of West's level of experience and education undoubtedly knew his conduct could result in disciplinary action (indeed, West seemed to have been fully cognizant that he was assuming risk of disciplinary and possibly criminal sanction for his conduct); knowledge that obviously did not deter him from firing his pistol over the detainees head. Instead, the answer to why these constraints must be respected lies in the military logic that informed the development of these rules. If soldiers can come to understand that logic, then compliance suddenly can be reconciled with duty, the duty of all soldiers to sacrifice at the micro level in order to contribute to macro level success.</p>

<p>It is impossible to convince commanders like West that compliance with these constraints will always produce tactical level benefit for them or their units. Incidents like West's serve as a reminder that it is almost inevitable soldiers and their commanders at all levels routinely confront opportunities to obtain tactical advantage by transgressing these constraints. It is therefore essential to convince these individuals that absolute prohibitions imposed on them by the law of armed conflict reflect the reasoned judgment of military commanders through the ages that tactical constraint ultimately contributes to strategic level success.  </p>

<p>When I used to teach these rules to soldiers and commanders, it always amazed me that emphasis of this linkage was not the norm. Emphasizing the macro gain from micro sacrifice is a concept that naturally resonates with members of the armed forces. Indeed, accepting risk in order to contribute to mission accomplishment is the very essence of military duty. Few commanders in West's position would balk at an order that jeopardized members of their unit in order to set the conditions for an operational or strategic success. Imagine a commander sitting in a mission brief being told "your unit must capture that bridge in order to ensure the offensive progresses on schedule, but it will be a tough fight and you should expect heavy casualties." Now try and imagine that same commander balking at the mission and responding, "there is no way I am going to risk my soldiers to capture that bridge!" An inconceivable hypothetical, and for good reason. Every member of the military knows that duty involves accepting risk for the greater good.</p>

<p>Veterans of Operation Iraqi Freedom, like veterans of past wars, were reminded why the rules of war must be understood within this context. Incidents of detainee abuse frustrated their efforts to achieve operational and strategic success by undermining their credibility with the local population and subjecting their conduct to often unjustified scrutiny. Many also believe these incidents contributed to the recruiting efforts of the enemy, thereby aggravating an already volatile threat environment. Veterans of earlier wars learned this same lesson in other contexts. When General Eisenhower announced to his forces that Germans had murdered approximately 100 US prisoners of war in a field in Malmady during the Battle of the Bulge, resolve in the face of the German onslaught stiffened, contributing to the greatest German defeat in the European Theater; knowledge of Japanese abuse of British captives contributed to the fierce British and Indian resistance to the Japanese offensive against India at Imphal. British determination to "fight to the last man" was so widespread that at the battle of Kohima the several British General Officers manned the fox holes alongside their Privates in a battle so close that each side was lobbing hand grenades across a tennis court. The British prevailed and the Japanese offensive reached its high water mark.<br />
  <br />
The law of armed conflict has become a ubiquitous component of contemporary international legal discourse, and a critical aspect of national security decision-making. However, Lieutenant Colonel West's conduct is a reminder that at its core, the law remains a critical check on the brutality of war, reflecting a carefully tailored balance between the power to inflict harm and the constraints imposed upon that power. These constraints find their origins, however, not only in humanity but also in military logic. Indeed, in many instances humanity is a gratuitous beneficiary of that logic.  Understanding how compliance with these constraints contributes to mission accomplishment - even when the cost may be high at the tactical level - is essential for ensuring soldiers understand why the LOAC often asks to do what seems utterly inconsistent with self-preservation. Achieving this understanding is certainly a challenge, but a challenge that disciplined professional warriors are uniquely capable of accepting.  </p>

<p>I suspect the Congressman Elect understands this, and would not counsel future military leaders to follow his example. But I wonder what message his subordinates took away from the event, and his subsequent political success? He may feel that he did what was necessary, but that is a dangerous path to go down, and one the law of armed conflict foreclosed long ago. Necessity is an important concept on the battlefield, but cannot and does not justify violation of absolute protections - like the protection of detainees from cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. This is the real lesson to learn from Lieutenant Colonel West, a lesson that is manifest in the hundreds if not thousands of command counterparts to him that chose the path of compliance, accomplished their missions, and contributed to the strategic objectives of the nation.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.emory.edu/faculty/faculty-profiles/laurie-blank.html">Laurie R. Blank</a> of Emory Law's International Humanitarian Law Clinic says that defining <em>where</em> the so-called "war on terror" is being fought is an important task, and that while traditional frameworks fail to give adequate guidance, there are certain criteria that can provide for more than an <em>ad hoc</em> approach... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/blank.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>T</b></font>he furor over the potential targeted killing of Anwar al-Aulaqi, the latest hot-button issue in the so-called "war on terror," has sharpened the debate on two key questions: who constitutes an enemy in this conflict and against whom can lethal force be used as a first resort?</p>

<p>Who and how are critically important questions that impact not only the use of force, but detention, trial and a host of other questions. There is another question, however - <em>where</em>.  In a broader sense, if the U.S. is in an armed conflict with al Qaeda and other terrorist groups, where can it conduct this armed conflict? In essence, the question is whether an al Qaeda operative carries the battlefield in his rucksack, so to speak, as he moves around the world.</p>

<p>Identifying where the battlefield is in this war against terrorist groups has been ignored or, at best, addressed in an <em>ad hoc</em> way so far. The U.S. is fighting al Qaeda and the Taliban with military force in Afghanistan and in Pakistan. It has launched drone attacks in Somalia and Yemen, areas now sometimes identified as potentially the newest battlefields in the "war on terror." Elsewhere, however - particularly in Europe and on its own territory - the U.S. uses a law enforcement approach of arrest, deportation or extradition, investigation, and trial.  </p>

<p>We have heard talk of a "global war on terror," but actual practice suggests that there are in fact areas that fall within a "battlefield" in this war and areas that remain outside it. Just like we need clear criteria for detention and trial to ensure faithful protection of individual rights while protecting national security, so clear standards are essential in defining the battlefield as well.  </p>

<p><em>Ad hoc</em> decisions about where we can fight terrorists with force can lead to policy paralysis or even mistakes. Mistakes in this arena mean innocent civilian casualties or perhaps a terrorist attack undeterred. Standards, in contrast, create clear frameworks for the lawful use of force where appropriate in accordance with legal and policy obligations.</p>

<p>Some argue we can use force against terrorists only in Afghanistan, because that is where we are in an armed conflict with al Qaeda and the Taliban. Outside that, we need to rely on the law enforcement capabilities of other states to help arrest, detain and try alleged attackers. This seems perhaps too narrow - in effect, an al Qaeda terrorist who is a legitimate target of attack in Afghanistan suddenly becomes immune from attack simply by walking across the border, even though the danger he poses to innocent civilians and U.S. national security interests has not changed.</p>

<p>Others argue that this is a global war, meaning that terrorists can be attacked wherever in the world they are found.  Enticing at first, perhaps, until we consider the possibilities of launching drone attacks in Des Moines, Paris or Oslo. Surely more than a few eyebrows will be raised at the notion that a single terrorist in a city far removed from any conflict, uninvolved in any terrorist activity and unconnected to any terrorist campaign or group is justification for a missile attack.</p>

<p>Defining the battlefield - or the zone of combat, to use a new term - is thus critical to understanding where the U.S. can use force as a first resort and alternatively where law enforcement options are the appropriate tool. At stake are not only the lives of the innocent victims of terrorist attacks that could have been prevented, but also the rights of alleged terrorists and the unintended victims of military attacks.</p>

<p>Classical international legal frameworks fall short in defining the parameters of the battlefield. The law of neutrality defines the battlespace in an international armed conflict as all areas where the forces of belligerent parties meet outside of neutral territory. Modern international jurisprudence emphasizes broad geographical and temporal parameters - as in the <em>Tadic</em> case - to ensure the widest protection possible for persons engaged in conflict or caught up in the conflict zone.</p>

<p>Trying to translate these concepts to today's conflict with terrorist groups leaves us no closer to a workable framework: the conflict is not an international armed conflict, the law of neutrality neither applies nor offers a useful analogy, and focusing solely on broad parameters leaves us with a global battlefield unfettered by geographical or temporal boundaries on the use of force. Indeed, humanitarian law's fundamental principle of protection of civilians weighs heavily in favor of keeping the battlefield away from as many civilians as possible.</p>

<p>Another option, then, is to look for factors that can help define the battlefield, or zone of combat, to create a framework for analysis and future action. Three key criteria in particular are helpful.  </p>

<p>First, we can look at the nature of the terrorist attacks in question. Areas where they more closely mirror wartime hostilities and occur on a regular basis can be considered more closely linked to the battlefield.  </p>

<p>Second, the government response to attacks or to the presence of terrorists is telling.  Areas where the state regularly responds with military force have a closer connection to a battlefield than areas where the state relies on law enforcement tools.  </p>

<p>Finally, the way terrorist groups use certain areas in a regular or extended way can link that territory to the battlefield as well, either through the reliance on safe havens, establishment of training camps and command posts, and the launching of regular attacks.</p>

<p>The absence of clear articulated standards for who and how we fight in this struggle against terrorism has been highly problematic. Failing to explore and identify parameters for where we can fight as well can pose similar challenges because individual rights will inevitably bear the brunt of an <em>ad hoc</em> approach. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Christina Fialho, Santa Clara Law '12, is an immigrant rights advocate and co-founder of the <a href="http://detentiondialogues.blogspot.com/">Detention Dialogues</a>, a graduate student-led organization affiliated with <a href="http://www.detentionwatchnetwork.org/">Detention Watch Network</a>.  Christina writes about the detention of non-criminal immigrants in US jails...<br />
<hr height="1"><br />
<font size="3"><strong>B</strong></font>ehind razor-sharp barbed wire fences and inside cement-block buildings, reality is harsher, confusion greater and the future dauntingly lonely. The detention of immigrants in the United States raises serious ethical concerns about their treatment and our responsibility as global citizens.  As a law student and immigrant rights advocate, I joined a national movement in early August 2010 through the Detention Watch Network to respond to these ethical concerns. My contribution to the movement focused on developing a volunteer-run immigration detention visitation program in Northern California called Detention Dialogues.</p>

<p>The impetus for this program came from my work this past summer as a Research Fellow for the <a href="http://www.globaldetentionproject.org/">Global Detention Project</a> (GDP) in Geneva, Switzerland. While there, I conducted legal and policy research on migration-related administrative detention and discovered that countries all over the world are expanding the detention of migrants.   </p>

<p>For example, the total detention capacity in France was 1,724 in 2007 compared to 739 in 2003, according to GDP research. Since 2007, Poland has increased its migration-related detention capacity from one facility to at least six. This coincided with Poland's rise as a key frontier state of the European Union's Schengen border-free zone. The Asia Pacific region is similar. For instance, GDP has identified 17 immigration detention facilities in Malaysia holding approximately 10,136 people. African countries also detain migrants.One example is Libya, which has a reported 27 distinct immigration detention facilities.</p>

<p>Most of my summer research focused on the United States and Brazil, two countries with vastly different policies on immigration and detention. I found that while Brazil does not maintain dedicated facilities to hold immigrants in administrative detention, immigrants are detained, though rarely, in at least 3 jails throughout the country. Contrast this with the United States, which maintains the largest detention infrastructure in the world, detaining approximately 380,000 people in immigration custody in 2009 at an annual cost of more than $1.7 billion.  </p>

<p>Immigrants in the United States are detained in approximately eight service processing centers owned and operated by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE); seven contract detention facilities owned and operated by private-sector businesses on behalf of ICE; and more than 350 state and local government facilities through intergovernmental service agreements. (See the <a href="http://trac.syr.edu/immigration/library/P3669.pdf%20%20">report</a> [PDF] by the U.S. Department of Justice for details.) Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have issued countless reports explaining how asylum seekers, individuals with severe mental disabilities, and even victims of human trafficking have been detained in our nation's jails. Many have been detained for months and some for years despite the fact that immigration detention is a civil form of custody, not criminal punishment.  </p>

<p>While drafting a working paper on US immigration detention for the Global Detention Project, I asked: Do countries have an ethical obligation to do the least harm to migrants when establishing and enforcing their immigration laws? Is detention a proper means of immigration control? What are the social costs of detaining people for profit, especially when detention is outsourced to private-sector businesses? What are the social costs of immigration detention to family unity and to communities?</p>

<p><a href="http://detentiondialogues.blogspot.com/">Detention Dialogues</a>, co-founded by Christina Mansfield and myself, seeks to address only a small portion of these concerns. Like other visitation programs in the United States and abroad, we have much work to do, not only in educating our community about the effects of immigration detention, but also in providing support to individuals in detention. I recently spoke with Sabrina*, an eighteen-year-old college student from Northern California. Her experience confirmed my desire to build awareness in my community of immigrants' legal rights in detention and to provide support to those persons already detained.</p>

<p>Ethnically Chinese, Sabrina was born in Mexico and brought to the United States by her parents when she was only 8 years old.  She is an honors student, a campus leader, and actively involved in her community. During Summer 2010, ICE conducted a raid on Sabrina's home. ICE chose not to arrest Sabrina because she was attending college, but the seven ICE officers arrested her undocumented father and took him to a detention facility. Sabrina's father has no criminal record.</p>

<p>With limited English language skills, Sabrina's father did not fully comprehend the implication of signing a stipulated order of removal form. Typically, when an immigrant is in administrative detention, he or she has the right to find a lawyer and appear before a judge to seek relief to stay in the United States. However, when an immigrant signs a stipulated order of removal, he or she waives the right to a hearing before a judge and agrees to immediate deportation. Sabrina's father signed this form and, within hours, was deported to Mexico.</p>

<p>Advocates routinely encounter immigrants who do not understand that they signed these orders. According to a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/upr_submission_20100419.pdf">shadow report</a> prepared by the ACLU for the United Nations, federal agents have pressured detained immigrants to sign stipulated orders even though many of these immigrants have claims to remain in the United States. </p>

<p>Moreover, most of these immigrants have no criminal record. The National Immigrant Justice Center, through a Freedom of Information Act request to the Executive Office for Immigration Review, <a href="http://www.immigrantjustice.org/news/detention/preleasestiporderdata20080603.html">collected data</a> showing that eighty-five percent of detainees who sign stipulated orders of removal have no criminal record. In other words, they are detained on a single civil charge because they entered the United States without inspection or overstayed a visa.<br />
 <br />
Most individuals who remain in detention awaiting a hearing will never speak with a lawyer. According to a 2010 <a href="http://www.abanet.org/media/nosearch/immigration_reform_executive_summary_012510.pdf">study</a> [PDF] conducted by the American Bar Association, approximately 84% of immigration detainees lack attorney representation. Many will never even visit with a friend from the outside. While visitors cannot fill the role of an attorney, they can help detainees cope with stress and fear as well as gather documents to support the detainees' applications for relief. Sadly, frequent transfers between facilities and high telephone rates impair detainees' ability to maintain communication with the outside, and many jails restrict visitation to 30 minutes on select days of the week.  </p>

<p>Detention Dialogues seeks to provide support to families like Sabrina's so that immigrants know their rights prior to an ICE raid or detention. We also hope to become an official outreach program of one of Northern California's jails by early 2011, matching detainees without family or friends in Northern California with volunteers who would visit them for a sustained, one-to-one relationship. In February 2011, we will conduct our first volunteer training led by Grisel Ruiz, this year's Sutro Fellow at the UC Davis Immigration Law Clinic. I hope that as more Americans realize what goes on behind prison walls, they will join us in urging the United States to seek alternatives to immigration detention.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&docid=f:hr1031rh.txt.pdf"></a><a href="http://www.davidostewart.com/stewart-bio.htm"><strong>David O. Stewart</strong></a> [<a href="http://www.davidostewart.com/index.htm">Constitutional Lawyer, Author</a>]: "I spent way too much time following the <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/senate-votes-to-remove-federal-judge-from-bench.php">Thomas Porteous impeachment trial</a>, having defended an impeachment trial in 1989 (Judge Walter Nixon) and having written a book about another (<em>Impeached: The Trial of President Andrew Johnson and the Fight for Lincoln's Legacy</em>).</p>

                <p>There were some novel issues in the Porteous trial. It is the first time a judge was removed for conduct which occurred before he took the federal bench (<a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&docid=f:hr1031rh.txt.pdf">Articles of Impeachment</a> [PDF], Article 2). There may be pre-federal conduct that would warrant impeachment and removal, but there was no need to pursue that theory in this case. This also is the first time such pre-federal conduct was bootstrapped into an impeachable offense by accusing the office-holder of failing to disclose it during Senate confirmation proceedings (Article 4). It is both a clever theory and a fair one. A nominee for high federal office is on ample notice that his or her application materials have to be true. </p>

                <p>The argument that most stuck in my craw was the repeated plea by defense lawyers that Judge Porteous' conduct should be overlooked because, well, everyone in his home town of Gretna, Louisiana acts like that. This "Gretna Defense," as it came to be called, is appalling. If everyone rapes their children in a community, does child rape cease to be a crime? </p>

                <p>I am particularly offended by the Gretna Defense because I represented a judge from the deep South in an impeachment trial; it never occurred to us to argue that a different standard should apply to a judge's conduct in one part of the country than in another. Porteous and his lawyers deserved to get stuffed on that one.</p>

                <p>There is, however, a factual component to the Gretna Defense which should give pause to senators and federal judges from the South. In the last two decades, every federal judge who has had a major ethical/legal problem has been from a member of the old Confederacy. These include:</p>

                <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judge_Alcee_Hastings">Judge Alcee Hastings</a> (Florida) (impeached, 1989)<br />
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judge_Walter_Nixon">Judge Walter Nixon</a> (Mississippi) (impeached, 1989)<br />
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Frederick_Collins">Judge Robert Collins</a> (Louisiana) (criminal conviction, 1991)<br />
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_B._Kent">Judge Sam Kent</a> (Texas) (criminal conviction, 2009)<br />
                    Judge G. Thomas Porteous (Louisiana) (impeached this month)<br />
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Tarpley_Camp_Jr.">Judge Jack Camp</a> (Georgia) (criminal conviction, 2010)</p>

                <p>I am not philosopher or sociologist enough to concoct an explanation for why so many men from one part of the country would engage in such high-risk behavior after becoming federal judges. Something, to be sure, is afoot here. But at the very least there is work to be done by the senators from those states who nominate federal judges, the Southern lawyers whose bar associations recommend them, and the other judges who serve with them.</p>

                <p>Pull up your socks, guys. The Gretna Defense does not, and should not, work."</p>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>On the administrative front, while there have been numerous studies over the years showing open service is not a problem, less than a month ago, the Pentagon's Comprehensive Review Working Group <a href="http://www.defense.gov/home/features/2010/0610_gatesdadt/DADTReport_FINAL_20101130(secure-hires).pdf">issued its report</a> [PDF] on the implementation of repeal of DADT, the "largest, most comprehensive review of a personnel policy matter which the department of defense has ever undertaken."</p>

                <p>The report reinforced the widely held belief of proponents of repeal, that with proper training and leadership, repeal will by and large be a "non-event." In fact, the study found that when service members have had experience serving with gay and lesbian service members, it is by and large a non-issue.  The report found:<ul><br />
                    <li>When asked about the actual experience of serving in a unit with a co-worker who they believed was gay or lesbian, 92% stated that the unit's "ability to work together" was "very good," "good," or "neither good nor poor."</li><br />
                    <li>When asked about how having a service member in their immediate unit who said he or she is gay would affect the unit's ability to "work together to get the job done," 70% of Service members predicted it would have a positive, mixed, or no effect.</li><br />
                    <li>"The risk of repeal of don't ask, don't tell to overall military effectiveness is low."</li><br />
                </ul>On the legislative front, Congress is <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/12/house-votes-to-repeal-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">closer than ever</a> to repealing the law. Some of its original proponents, including former Georgia Senator Sam Nunn, have now <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2010-12-09-dont-ask-dont-tell-debate_N.htm">voiced their support</a> for repeal. Our military leadership - the Commander-in-Chief, Secretary Gates, and Admiral Mullen - have all voiced support for repeal before Congress leaves for the holidays. All of them have also stated a preference that change come about through the political process rather than through the courts. </p>

                <p>None of these events have happened in a vacuum. And that is how we may have reached a perfect storm.</p>

                <p>Recently, SLDN and Morrison and Foerster <a href="http://bit.ly/eZg5EL">filed a complaint</a> in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, asking for the reinstatement of three service members discharged under DADT. The complaint also argues that this law is, on its face, unconstitutional on Substantive Due Process, Free Speech, and Equal Protection grounds.  </p>

                <p>Michael Almy served for thirteen years in the United States Air Force, including four deployments to the Middle East, before he was discharged in 2006 under DADT when someone found his personal e-mails (we consequently argue that the Air Force violated the Administrative Procedure Act, when it failed to follow its own rules). Anthony Loverde served for seven years in the Air Force. In 2008, he was discharged under DADT. Ironically, he is currently a contractor serving in Iraq, doing the same job with many of his former colleagues, but now as an openly gay man who's making much more money. And Jason Knight served for a total of five years in the United States Navy. He is a trained Cryptological Technician Interpretive Linguist. In 2005, he was discharged from the Navy under DADT; he was recalled to active duty in 2006 but was discharged again in 2007. </p>

                <p>Because of the current political climate, not only does this suit allow us to advocate for three individuals who want nothing more than to put their uniforms back on and serve our country, it has the benefit of pressuring the political branches to repeal the law. We are confident that we will, once and for all, put this law to rest. If Congress does not act before the end of the year, SLDN will continue to file litigation until we have gotten rid of this law and ended this grave injustice."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.theackermanlawfirm.com/home"><strong>Slobodan Zecevic</strong></a> [Of Counsel, <a href="http://www.theackermanlawfirm.com/home">The Ackerman Law Firm</a>]: "<a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/12/icty-reduces-sentence-for-officer-convicted-of-vukovar-killings.php">The Sljivancanin Review Judgement delivered by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (hereinafter ICTY) Appeals Chamber</a> on December 8, 2010 is a significant breakthrough in the ICTY jurisprudence. Indeed, it is the first time that a request for review of an ICTY judgement, under Rules 119 through 122 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence (hereinafter RPE), has been successful. Rules 119-122 of the RPE were adopted in 1994 and since then a request for review was filed in 13 different cases, but not a single one was granted.</p>

                <p>Section 8 of the RPE, Article 120, provides for a two-step procedure <em>i.e.</em> the preliminary examination and the actual review of the judgement. In all previous cases the requests for review were dismissed during the preliminary examination stage, whereby the Chamber ruled that the moving party failed to establish that the fact(s), based on which the review was requested, constituted  indeed a "new fact." Instead, the Chamber found that proposed facts were but "additional fact(s)" known to the moving party at the time of the proceedings, and thus did not meet the standard for review.</p>

                <p>Perhaps one of the most important features of the Sljivancanin Review is that the request for review of the judgement was granted from the appeal judgement. Originally, the Trial Chamber found Mr. Sljivancanin guilty of aiding and abetting torture as a violation of the laws or customs of war, thereby sentencing him to five years' imprisonment. The Appeals Chamber, in a tight majority judgement of 3 against 2, upheld his original conviction, and added an additional conviction of aiding and abetting murder as a violation of laws or customs of war, increasing the sentence of Mr. Sljivancanin to 17 years' imprisonment. This additional conviction was based on circumstantial evidence and in the subsequent review proceedings the Review Chamber found that the new fact, adduced through the witness testimony, rendered the previous inference untenable, and consequently vacated the conviction for murder.</p>

                <p>There is, however, an additional aspect to the Sljivancanin Review Judgement which is worth noting as it touches on the most fundamental principles of international human rights law. Namely, in his dissenting opinion Judge Pocar has maintained his position held in previous cases that the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY does not have the power to impose on the accused a new sentence that is higher than the original one. Judge Pocar, in our opinion rightfully, directs attention to Article 14(5) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which provides that "[e]veryone convicted of a crime shall have the right to his conviction and sentence being reviewed by a higher tribunal according to law."</p>

                <p>It took 14 attempts over the course of 16 years, to finally bring about the Review of the Judgement at the ICTY. Hopefully, it will not take that long for the Appeals Chamber to recognize and adhere to the principles already enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights." </p>]]></content:encoded>
