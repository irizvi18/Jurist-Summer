		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border"> JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://gunster.com/staff/attorneys/john-w-terwilleger/">John Terwilleger</a>, of <a href="http://gunster.com">Gunster</a>, discusses the development and regulation of "driverless" vehicles and how federal and state governments are addressing this emerging technology...</p>

                <p><strong>S</strong>elf-driving, or &#8220;autonomous&#8221; vehicles have advanced dramatically in recent years, to the point that they are now tested on public roads every day in the United States.  Some consumer cars, such as Teslas equipped with <a href="https://www.tesla.com/autopilot">autopilot technology</a> [official website],  are already capable of driving autonomously on the highway.  Autonomous vehicles are making their way into the passenger transportation industry, with Uber testing a fleet of autonomous cars in downtown <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/09/heres-like-ride-ubers-self-driving-car/">Pittsburgh</a> [backgrounder]. Similarly, autonomous trucks are also beginning to appear, as Uber demonstrated when its autonomous tractor-trailer truck transported 50,000 beers 120 miles across <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/10/ubers-self-driving-truck-makes-first-delivery-50000-beers/">Colorado</a>.   </p>

                <p>Although the autonomous vehicles are speeding along, the law is struggling to keep up with this fast-developing technology.  Only eight states (California, Florida, Louisiana, Michigan, Nevada, North Dakota, Tennessee and Utah) and the District of Columbia currently have statutes addressing autonomous vehicles.  Additionally, the governors of Arizona and Massachusetts signed executive orders concerning autonomous vehicles.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (&#8220;NHTSA&#8221;) also recently issued <a href="http://www.nhtsa.gov/nhtsa/av/index.html.">guidance</a> [text] that included a Model State Policy for autonomous vehicles.   This comment will discuss current state laws that address autonomous vehicles, the NHTSA&#8217;s Model State Policy, and how the law will need to develop further to address emerging issues with autonomous vehicles.</p>

                <p><strong>A. Existing State Laws<br />
                </strong><br />
                    Existing state statutes regarding autonomous vehicles fall into three general categories: (1) those permitting general use of autonomous vehicles, (2) those that permit the use of autonomous vehicles for testing purposes only, and (3) those that do not regulate the use of autonomous vehicles.  </p>

                <p>Florida and the District of Columbia have authorized the general use of autonomous vehicles.  In 2016, Florida amended its autonomous vehicle statute, allowing any person with a valid driver's license (the &#8220;Operator&#8221;) to operate an autonomous vehicle on Florida roads.   Importantly, the statute does not require the Operator to physically be in the vehicle.   Rather, the autonomous technology must have a mechanism to either allow the Operator to take control of the vehicle if the autonomous technology fails, or cause the vehicle to come to a complete stop.   The District of Columbia took a slightly more restrictive approach, allowing autonomous vehicles on public roads if a licensed driver is seated in the driver&#8217;s seat and can manually take control over the vehicle at any time.   With these statutes, Florida and the District of Columbia have taken the lead in permitting the use of autonomous vehicles for any legal purpose.</p>

                <p>Other state laws on autonomous vehicles are more restrictive, permitting the use of autonomous vehicles only for testing purposes, or not explicitly permitting the use of autonomous vehicles at all.  For example, Michigan  and Nevada  only permit autonomous vehicles to be used for testing purposes.  Louisiana defines &#8220;autonomous technology,&#8221; but does not otherwise regulate autonomous vehicles.   And North Dakota  and Utah  authorized <a href="http://www.legis.nd.gov/assembly/64-2015/documents/15-0167-01000.pdf">studies</a> [PDF] on how to best regulate autonomous vehicles.  Finally, Tennessee, rather than authorizing the use of autonomous vehicles, merely barred local governments from prohibiting the use of autonomous vehicles.   </p>

                <p>Even in California, where autonomous Google cars have undergone thousands of hours of testing on public roads, autonomous vehicles are only allowed for testing purposes with a human seated in the vehicle at all times and only with a testing permit.   Additionally, the California Code of Regulations excludes vehicles weighing more than 10,000 pounds, effectively prohibiting the testing of autonomous tractor-trailers.   However, the California legislature recently took the <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/15-16/bill/asm/ab_1551-1600/ab_1592_bill_20160830_enrolled.pdf">significant step</a> [PDF] in allowing permits for limited testing of autonomous vehicles without a human in the driver&#8217;s seat and without a steering wheel, gas pedal or brake pedal. </p>

                <p>Three state governors have taken steps to promote autonomous vehicles in the absence of legislative action.  Arizona&#8217;s governor issued an executive order instructing the Arizona Department of Transportation to <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/executive-orders">establish</a> [document] pilot programs to permit the testing of autonomous vehicles, with or without persons inside the vehicle.   Massachusetts&#8217;s governor issued an <a href="http://www.mass.gov/governor/legislationexecorder/execorders/executive-order-no-572.html">executive order</a> [document] establishing an autonomous vehicle working group whose purpose is to issue guidance for safe testing of autonomous vehicles in designated areas.   And Virginia&#8217;s governor helped create the<a href="https://governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/newsarticle?articleId=8526"> Virginia Automated Corridors</a> [materials], a public-private partnership to encourage the growth of autonomous vehicles by designating portions of public roads for testing. </p>

                <p>In states that have not yet passed legislation or regulations concerning autonomous vehicles, testing autonomous vehicles with a human in the driver&#8217;s seat may still be legal.  This was the conclusion reached in South Carolina, when a company seeking to drive an autonomous vehicle through the state sought an attorney general opinion on the legality of a test-drive with a human driver at the steering wheel.   The opinion explained that because &#8220;South Carolina law neither prohibits nor expressly authorizes the testing of autonomous motor vehicles on public roads in our State,&#8221; and because a licensed driver would be seated in the driver&#8217;s seat at all times, &#8220;we believe an autonomous motor vehicle would classify as a motor vehicle and its test driver would classify as a driver&#8221; under South Carolina law.    </p>

                <p><strong>B. The NHTSA&#8217;s Model State Policy<br />
                </strong><br />
                    The NHTSA&#8217;s recent Federal Automated Vehicles Policy included a Model State Policy, which will likely serve as a basis for many state autonomous vehicle statutes. The NHTSA envisions a system in which the states treat fully autonomous vehicles as the &#8220;driver&#8221; of the vehicle. However, the Model State Policy encourages states, for the current time, to only allow testing, and require an application and approval before companies desiring to test autonomous vehicles are permitted to begin testing. The policy recommends statutes that require autonomous vehicles to comply with general vehicle regulations and be driven, when not in autonomous mode, by licensed human drivers with special training regarding the autonomous vehicle's capabilities. The policy also recommends a review of existing state laws and regulations to address gaps that will become relevant as autonomous vehicles become more common.  The Model State Policy recommends reviewing law enforcement, emergency response and safety rules, and providing additional training for law enforcement.  The policy also recognizes issues that will arise in insurance and tort liability, which will require states to allocate liability between the manufacturers of the vehicle, the owner of the vehicle and other persons who could be involved in an accident.   Overall, the Model State Policy encourages states to begin addressing the many issues that will arise with increased use of autonomous vehicles but recommends that current use be limited to testing.  </p>

                <p><strong>C. The Path Forward<br />
                </strong><br />
                    Existing law regarding autonomous vehicles varies drastically.  This means that, for the present time, cross-country autonomous vehicle trips will be legally challenging, and, at most, will only be allowed for testing purposes.  Only Florida and the District of Columbia allow the use of autonomous vehicles for general purposes. </p>

                <p>As the technology continues to advance, each state is faced with a choice: (1) permit autonomous vehicles for general purposes, (2) allow autonomous vehicles with significant restrictions, such as for testing purposes only, (3) prohibit the use of autonomous vehicles or (4) do nothing.  States that do nothing will find themselves left out of much of the early use of autonomous vehicles but will still be faced with questions as to whether autonomous vehicles may legally be used in the state.  States that prohibit the use of autonomous vehicles will encourage business built around autonomous vehicles to go to elsewhere until the state laws are preempted by the federal government as hampering interstate commerce (once autonomous vehicles become commonplace).  States that choose to permit the use of autonomous vehicles for testing purposes will encourage some use, and will assist the developing autonomous vehicle industry in collecting the essential data necessary to operate fully autonomous vehicles on any road.  </p>

                <p>Those states that permit autonomous vehicles for general purposes will find themselves ahead of the pack, as companies that desire to use autonomous vehicles in the near future will have very limited choices as to where they can operate their business.  Additionally, these states will encourage public use of existing autonomous technology, such as Tesla&#8217;s autopilot, on highways, which should increase highway safety.  However, these states will also be faced with the potential dangers of distracted drivers forgetting to pay attention to the road and will have a higher likelihood of dealing with the first crashes involving autonomous vehicles, along with the numerous liability issues that will inevitably arise.  Ultimately, states must choose whether they want to take on the risks associated with early use of autonomous vehicles to obtain the benefits of increased business and potentially increased safety on the roads.  The State of Florida and the District of Columbia currently have taken this approach, and other states may soon follow.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.syr.edu/profile/david-crane1">David M. Crane</a>, founding Chief Prosecutor of the international war crimes tribunal in West Africa, discusses the UN's recent action that will allow for independent justice-seeking organizations to hold accountable parties committing international crimes in Syria...</p><br />
                <br />
                <strong>O</strong>n Wednesday 21 December, 105 member states of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/">United Nations General Assembly</a> took an important step forward in seeking justice for the people of Syria. The action-taking was a resolution that paves the way for an independent organization to begin collecting, cataloging and analyzing data and other criminal information coming out of Syria into proper evidence to be used someday by a local, regional or international prosecutor someday to hold accountable all parties committing international crimes in Syria from March 2011 to the present. <br />
                <br />
                Since the beginning of the civil war in 2011 there have been dozens of efforts by various nongovernmental organizations to collect data on the crimes being committed in Syria. Though laudable in their efforts, this massive amount of data is useless in a court of law. It is unreliable and not authenticated with no chains of custody or other safeguards. Essentially almost all of the data being collected regarding crimes in Syria is tainted and inadmissible. <br />
                <br />
                Three organizations did begin to emerge that were working in tangent to correct this problem. The <a href="http://www.iamsyria.org/syrian-accountability-project.html">Syrian Accountability Center</a> which I founded in March of 2011 to create a trial package for a future local, regional or international prosecutor. It is designed along the same methods I used to investigate and indict President Charles Taylor for war crimes and crimes against humanity in West Africa. Additionally, two other organizations are doing important work, the Coalition for International Justice and Accountability and the <a href="https://syriaaccountability.org/">Syrian Justice and Accountability Center</a>. The heads of these three organizations met and briefed various UN ambassadors on the evidence challenges in November. It was there I urged the creation of the accountability center concept.<br />
                <br />
                As we began to consider various mechanisms to cure this problem, an accountability center became apparent, a center run by experienced international criminal law professionals who could take this mass of data already collected, and still coming out of Syria, and turning it into that evidence necessary to hold accountable those parties committing crimes in violation of Syrian and international law.<br />
                <br />
                The international community has spent millions of dollars supporting efforts to build data bases by organizations who in large measure do not have the experience to build a criminal case. The accountability center concept was designed to fix this problem. Throughout the Fall of 2016, we carefully planned a campaign to garner the support necessary to succeed in creating the accountability center. Under the leadership of Ambassadors <a href="http://regierung.gmgnet.li/files/attachments/pdf-fl-aussenstelle-newyork-botschafter-cv_635488978033682500.pdf">Christian Weneweser of Lichtenstein</a> [PDF] and <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/CRC/CVMembers/BinSaifAlThani.pdf">Alya Althani of Qatar</a> [PDF] various paths were considered from the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">Security Council</a>, the General Assembly, and possibly a regional organization such as the <a href="https://europa.eu/european-union/index_en">European Union</a> or the <a href="http://www.arableagueonline.org/">Arab League</a>. The General Assembly was the most realistic pathway to success.<br />
                <br />
                Past attempts to consider accountability solutions have failed in the Security Council due to the intransigence of <a href="http://government.ru/en/">Russia</a>. Even the issuance of the Caesar Report, which I co-authored, in 2014 that confirmed horrific crimes against the Syrian people by Assad and his henchmen did not move Russia nor <a href="http://english.gov.cn/">China </a>to support a <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Draft-UNSC-French-Resolution-on-Syria-Referral-to-ICC.pdf">French resolution</a> [PDF] calling for accountability. This stalemate in the Security Council has frozen any action until now.<br />
                <br />
                Our intent in proposing the accountability center concept in September was to create an efficient capability that over the next several years the international community can rest assured that all of the terabytes of data collected will be converted to proper evidence that can be used in a court of law. Additionally, the United Nations had to be seen to be doing something on behalf of the international community. Perhaps this is that "something." It certainly is an important step forward.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.unc.edu/faculty/directory/flattvictorb/">Victor B. Flatt</a> of Universtiy of North Carolina School of Law discusses the recent withdrawal of arctic lands from drilling by President Obama...</p><strong>O</strong>n Dec. 20, 2016, President Obama <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/obama-bans-offshore-drilling-in-portions-of-arctic-and-atlantic.php">withdrew</a> all of the northern Atlantic Ocean and most of the Arctic Ocean under federal jurisdiction from oil exploration and production. The President used the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/43/chapter-29/subchapter-III">Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act</a> (OCSLA), where <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/43/1341">section 12</a> gives the President the power to "withdraw from disposition any of the unleased lands of the outer Continental Shelf."   This section of the Act has been used previously by presidents, including President Clinton, to temporarily withdraw continental shelf lands from leasing, or permanently withdraw very small tracts from leasing. This is the first time that a President has invoked this section to ostensibly withdraw a large part of the Continental Shelf from disposition with no time expiration.</p>

<p>The major legal question this presents is whether a future president, in this case President-elect Trump, can "un-withdraw" said lands and make them available again for oil exploration and production. Unlike a statute governing onshore federal lands, the language of OCSLA specifically says a President can from "time to time, withdraw" federal lands from leasing but does not have any parallel language about putting federal lands "back in" to availability. The answer to the legal question is really unknowable at this time. Laws are to be construed to give effect to the intent of Congress in the law's passage. There are many canons of statutory construction to assist with this determination, the most direct of which is to look at the specific language of the statute. Under that rubric, it would seem that a new President does not have the authority to reinstate withdrawn lands. On the other hand, past practice, which allowed temporary withdrawal, might suggest otherwise.</p>

<p>What is more interesting, however, is that regardless of whether the land can be reinstated by a new President or whether Republicans will risk political capital to amend the law, accomplishing the same thing, is that these offshore lands will likely never see any commercial oil exploration or production.</p>

<p>First of all, OCSLA has a very specific procedure which requires "opening" of land in five year blocks before any auction can occur.  The lands "withdrawn" by President Obama were not part of the available lands in the 2017-2022 five year block.  No subsequent President can change that short of having a new law passed. Moreover, the political situation in the Atlantic and the economic situation in the Arctic are not conducive to these lands ever being put into production.  The offshore Atlantic area has been "temporarily" unavailable for leasing since OCSLA was passed because the mid-Atlantic and Northeastern states have strong opposition to any leasing of the area.  While the state of Alaska supports offshore federal leasing because of the importance of the oil services industry to the state's economy, the technical and environmental difficulties do not allow for any economical extraction.  After a ten year, 7 billion dollar debacle, Shell became the last major oil company to <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/09/28/shell-ends-arctic-drilling-for-foreseeable-future">withdraw</a> from offshore Arctic drilling in 2015, with no success at even drilling an exploratory well.</p>

<p>Why then did Obama take this step, and why are people advising President Trump or the Republican Congressional majority to reverse it? I can only assume it is to send political messages. Donald Trump and the Congressional Republicans can send the signal that they intend to strongly support the oil and gas industry as promised. The Obama decision, on the other hand, seems more calculated. Until his re-election in 2012, the Obama administration assiduously pursued an "all of the above" energy strategy, that felt spectacularly wrong after the <a href="/feature/2014/03/history-of-the-bp-oil-spill.php">Macondo Well explosion</a> (on the same day that Obama announced the opening of parts the Atlantic Ocean for exploration). Withdrawing these federal lands from oil and gas exploration provides a retro-activism (along with the decision on the <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/obama-rejects-request-to-build-keystone-xl-oil-pipeline.php">Keystone XL</a> pipeline and the more recent <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/north-dakota-pipeline-construction-suspended-by-request-of-us-government.php">Dakota Access</a> pipeline) that may influence future historians to view his presidency as one that was environmentally protective. </p>

<p>While more calculated, the changing Obama positions make sense from a practical point of view. When the economy needed recovery and oil was expensive, President Obama encouraged American oil production. At this point in time the situation has changed. Oil's price has plummeted and unless Saudi Arabia significantly cuts its production, American production on marginal sites makes no economic sense. The Republicans would argue otherwise - that more domestic oil production is necessary for the country, when in fact it would be uneconomical and present severe ecological risks.</p>

<p>So, while it is possible that we will spend years in a legal battle to determine exactly what the word "withdraw" means in this section of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, as is often the case, this really isn't a legal issue but a political issues dressed as a legal one.</p>

		<title>Data Localization Laws: an Emerging Global Trend</title>
		<link>https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2017/01/courtney-bowman-data-localization/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border"> JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.proskauer.com/professionals/courtney-bowman/">Courtney Bowman</a> [bio], discusses the emerging trend of localized data and how corporations and governments are reacting this emerging technology...</p>

                <p><strong>T</strong>he combined forces of globalization and technology have enabled an expansion of international business opportunities the likes of which have never been seen before. It is now easier than ever for companies large and small to achieve a global reach: large multinational companies station employees all over the world, while a single enterprising app developer can reach users in far-flung places due in large part to the increasing prevalence of smartphones in all but the most remote areas of the planet.</p>

                <p>However, some national governments are attempting to exert control over the increasingly porous technological barriers between countries. Over the past few years, multiple countries have enacted data localization laws, which are intended to keep citizens&#8217; personal data in-country and subject to local regulation. The implications &#8212 as well as the logistical headaches &#8212 can be enormous, as many companies previously have developed business models that require them to collect personal data from citizens of a particular country, but to process that data in another part of the world. For example, a company may collect personal data from customers in Germany in order to offer a service or product to those individuals, but may then choose to transfer that data to India for the processing required to fulfill their obligations to their customers. Although at first glance this wave of data localization laws may be viewed as national governments&#8217; futile attempts to assert sovereignty over a borderless medium, the reality on the ground suggests the opposite. Most importantly for companies operating internationally, as data localization laws are gaining momentum the world over, they are being enforced by local authorities. </p>

                <p>Many data localization laws are fairly narrow in terms of scope. For example, Nigeria requires government data to be hosted within its borders. Vietnam requires Internet service providers to keep a copy of their data within Vietnam for possible government inspection. Australia&#8217;s Personally Controlled Electronic Health Records Act prohibits the transfer of health data out of Australia in some situations. Although not explicitly characterized as a data localization law, the European Union&#8217;s <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/">Data Protection Directive</a> &#8212 and its successor, the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/reform/index_en.htm">General Data Protection Regulation</a> &#8212 may be viewed as encouraging data localization, as some data controllers may choose to store and process data within the EU in order to avoid the Directive&#8217;s strict requirements for transferring personal data to non-EU countries. </p>

                <p>However, there is an emerging trend of newer, more comprehensive data localization laws with a global reach. One of the most high-profile data localization laws came into force in <a href="http://op.bna.com.s3.amazonaws.com/pl.nsf/r%3FOpen%3ddapn-9sdls9">Russia</a> in September of 2015. That law attracted attention because of its truly comprehensive <a href="http://privacylaw.bna.com/pvrc/7063/split_display.adp?fedfid=63097645&vname=wdprunotallissues&fcn=5&wsn=500680000&fn=63097645&split=0">scope</a>, as it requires that any personal data collected from Russians must be stored and processed on servers located within Russia. Moreover, it applies with equal force to companies based outside of Russia, meaning that foreign companies must comply or risk incurring significant penalties for violating the law, which include the blockage of an offender&#8217;s website within Russia. And it&#8217;s clear that the law is not just all bark and no bite: Russia&#8217;s communications authority, the Roskomnadzor, has demonstrated its willingness to enforce the law and recently has succeeded in blocking websites belonging to US-based companies that have violated its provisions.</p>

                <p>Other countries have enacted their own data localization laws, or broader laws with data localization components. One example of the latter is <a href="http://www.chinalawtranslate.com/cybersecurity2/?lang=en">China's</a> new cybersecurity law, which goes into effect in June 2017. It requires &#8220;critical information infrastructure operators&#8221; &#8212 which could be interpreted to include companies in many sectors, including telecommunications, information services and finance &#8212 to store certain personal and business information in China. Foreign companies subject to the law would have to apply for government permission before transferring data out of China, although the law&#8217;s ambiguous wording makes it unclear precisely which companies would be required to comply with the localization provisions. Naturally, this leaves many organizations wondering whether they should devote the time and resources required to try to understand and comply with the law, risk noncompliance and its associated penalties, or change their business models to avoid collecting data in China altogether &#8212 all unenviable positions for any organization looking to make inroads in the coveted Chinese market. </p>

                <p>Despite the possibly negative effects on businesses, data localization laws do carry some advantages for the countries that enact them, at least in theory. A law requiring data to be stored on servers in-country could help persuade a company to open an office (or at least rent servers) in a nation, which in turn could result in more local investment and perhaps more jobs for residents. Furthermore, countries&#8217; privacy laws generally are not enacted in a vacuum; often, they reflect certain nationally-ingrained concerns about the use and abuse of personal data. For example, it has been theorized that European countries tend to have more stringent data protection laws due to a deep suspicion of possible personal data misuse borne out of the World War II era, when fascist governments collected individuals&#8217; personal information in order to pursue those people and send them to camps. Data localization laws therefore allow countries to assert their own national and cultural priorities over the use of citizens&#8217; personal information, especially where there exists a concern that these values would evaporate if the data was transferred to another country. Of course, by the same token, forcing companies to keep personal data stored in-country may make it legally (or perhaps simply logistically) easier for governments to access their own citizens&#8217; personal information. Additionally, some countries have enacted data localization requirements to address what they argue are cybersecurity concerns. The Chinese government, for example, has argued that the data localization provisions in its new cybersecurity law help support the law&#8217;s mission of enhancing the country&#8217;s data security. </p>

                <p>Regardless of any perceived benefits, however, the fact remains that data localization laws are a formidable barrier to companies seeking to expand their international presence, whether through opening new offices abroad or reaching out to customers in foreign markets. Small companies have a particularly difficult time grappling with these laws, as they often lack the personnel, financial and legal resources to develop compliance strategies. Nevertheless, these types of laws may not make exceptions for small or otherwise under-resourced organizations, and entities like startups, app developers and nonprofits may struggle to open their doors in such markets. Expect the struggle between business and national interests to continue if the data localization trend continues to strengthen in the years ahead.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border"> JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/stephen-a-cooper">Stephen Cooper</a> [bio] discusses the story of Benny King and the criminalization of addiction...</p>

                <p><strong>B</strong>enny King is a gregarious, good-hearted, God-fearing 53-year-old black man from Alabama who shouldn&#8217;t be in prison. </p>

                <p>But he is.</p>

                <p>Mr. King is serving 14-months at the federal correctional institution in Jesup, Georgia, for violating conditions of his supervised release; conditions ordered as part of King&#8217;s sentence over eleven years ago, in 2005, for bank fraud. Mr. King&#8217;s underlying conduct in that nonviolent, low-level federal criminal case (involving stolen checks) bears no relation to his current incarceration other than the fact that, it too, like the entirety of King&#8217;s nonviolent criminal history, was a byproduct of decades-long untreated drug addiction.</p>

                <p>You see, just like hundreds of thousands of poor, disproportionately black and brown Americans sidelined from American life &#8212 stuffed out of sight in state and federal penal institutions across the U.S. &#8212 King is serving time for one, and only one, unconscionable reason: he suffers from a substance abuse problem. He drinks. </p>

                <p>Mr. King started drinking when he was just twelve years old and the problem got worse at age 14 when his mother died; it became worse still, a bare three years later, when his father passed, too. Poverty, tragedy and alcohol abuse are a multi-generational scourge in the King family. </p>

                <p>And for Benny King, as with many alcoholics, when the alcohol flows other substances quickly join stream; marijuana, cocaine, whatever&#8217;s around. As anyone who has battled drug addiction knows (or equally, has had a friend or loved one fight that hellacious war), once the substance-spigot starts its drip the situation often spirals, becoming impossible &#8212 without effective, often repeated, long-term inpatient drug treatment &#8212 to stop.   </p>

                <p>That&#8217;s why what happened this past November 16 in a courtroom in Montgomery, Alabama &#8212 when Senior U.S. District Judge W. Harold Albritton III threw the proverbial book at Mr. King because he relapsed, using alcohol and drugs in the wake of his sister&#8217;s death &#8212 should outrage every American who cares about reducing our abominably bloated prison population. </p>

                <p>Using an official transcript for reference, here is an abbreviated version of the proceedings:</p>

                <p><strong>Judge Albritton:</strong> Mr. King, you are charged with two violations. It&#8217;s alleged that you violated the special condition that required you to participate in a program for substance abuse. You violated that term of your supervision by showing up at Herring House, where you were to be given treatment, and they would not admit you because you had been drinking alcohol. The second violation is a charge that you violated the standard condition that you refrain from excessive use of alcohol or any controlled substance.</p>

                <p><strong>Assistant Federal Defender Donnie W. Bethel:</strong> I have a few things I would like to say, Your Honor. Mr. King was arrested on a Thursday. The following Saturday, his sister passed away from cancer. It was an older sister, 12 years his senior. It was a sister who, after his mother died when Mr. King was a boy, had essentially been his surrogate mother. We were back in court on a preliminary hearing that following week, and at that point I asked for him to be released on bond so he could attend his sister&#8217;s funeral. That was vehemently opposed by the prosecution, by probation, by the United States Marshal Service, which I am still befuddled by. I know what it&#8217;s like to lose a sibling. I was really taken aback that there&#8217;s such a lack of basic Christian compassion in the criminal justice system, that we would do everything we could to deny a man simply the opportunity to attend his sister&#8217;s funeral. </p>

                <p>I convinced Judge Moore to release him to my custody. Everybody was thrilled that Mr. King was able to attend the funeral. At the funeral, he played the piano and he sang. He&#8217;s actually a talented musician. And before I left that day, every member of his family made a point in coming to me and thanking me for taking the time out of my weekend to bring Mr. King up there to attend his sister&#8217;s funeral. And I say that only to make this point. This isn&#8217;t a violation that involves Mr. King out on the street with a gun; Mr. King selling dope; Mr. King committing some other crime, burglary, theft of property. Mr. King has a drug problem. Mr. King knows he has a drug problem. That&#8217;s what this case is about.</p>

                <p>He would like another opportunity to go to the Herring House to get some drug treatment, because that&#8217;s what he needs. And I think we&#8217;ve become so callous, so used to in the federal criminal justice system to shipping people off to prison, that nobody would bat an eye if, for having a drink and getting high, we&#8217;re going to send Benny King off to prison for 14 months. I think we need to step back and say, let&#8217;s stop doing the easy thing, and let&#8217;s do the right thing. </p>

                <p>Mr. King, tell the judge what your plan is after you&#8217;re released.</p>

                <p><strong>Mr. King: </strong>My plan is to go to Florida, be with my fiancée, get married. I&#8217;ve already started the process of enrolling for a GED to get my diploma. And I&#8217;m going to take some college courses at night. I&#8217;m going to work doing paving and construction, and also I&#8217;m working for a church called New Jerusalem Baptist Church in Ft. Myers, Florida.</p>

                <p>I violated, Your Honor. And I know you can&#8217;t overlook that, and I don&#8217;t expect you to. But I was - when I left and went home and saw my sister. And she was fading away, and I just - which was no excuse, but I used that as an excuse to drink. And when I drink, I get high. I violated, and I apologize, and I ask the mercy of the Court. But I&#8217;m just going to be honest with everybody. I&#8217;m tired. Benny King is tired today. I&#8217;m tired. I&#8217;m not trying to pacify nobody ears.</p>

                <p><strong>Mr. Bethel:</strong> He&#8217;s 52 years old. Give him another chance. Let him go to the Herring House. He&#8217;s clean now. He&#8217;s not going to be positive when he shows up down there this time. Let&#8217;s get him straightened out. Let&#8217;s just do what we were planning to do a month ago.</p>

                <p><strong>Assistant United States Attorney Curtis Ivy, Jr.: </strong>So coming forward now with all these great plans and ideas is an easy thing, but it&#8217;s not going to work. What&#8217;s proper in this case is 14 months&#8217; imprisonment with no supervised release to follow. </p>

                <p><strong>Mr. Bethel:</strong> Anybody who thinks that it&#8217;s easy for a drug addict not to use drugs has never had someone close to them who&#8217;s been a drug addict. I have. It&#8217;s not easy. No matter what you do to help them, no matter how much they go through, it is the most difficult thing I&#8217;ve ever seen in my life for someone to overcome a drug addiction. And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re talking about. Talking about criminalizing this case, drug addiction.</p>

                <p><strong>Judge Albritton:</strong> Under the law, being a drug addict is not a defense. In this case, Mr. King has been given more than one opportunity to try to get himself straightened out. I&#8217;m sympathetic with you - and I&#8217;m sorry about your sister&#8217;s death. This time I&#8217;m going to sentence you to the maximum under the sentencing guidelines of 14 months, with no supervised release to follow. You&#8217;ll be on your own after that. The court system and the probation office and everybody has done all they can to help you break your habit.</p>

                <p>Just a day after Benny King was &#8220;maxed out&#8221; by Judge Albritton in Alabama, The Washington Post&#8217;s Lenny Bernstein <a href="http://wapo.st/2giJo7Y?tid=ss_mail">wrote</a> about a new &#8220;landmark&#8221; <a href="https://addiction.surgeongeneral.gov/surgeon-generals-report.pdf">report</a> [PDF] authored by the U.S. Surgeon General calling the drug crisis "a moral test for America.&#8221; Distressingly, the report noted that, &#8220;[i]n 2015, substance abuse disorders affected 20.8 million people in the U.S., as many as those with diabetes, and 1 ½ times as many as those with cancer. Yet, only one in ten receives treatment.&#8221; </p>

                <p>Echoing Benny King&#8217;s defense counsel, the Surgeon General said: &#8220;We would never tolerate a situation where only one in 10 people with cancer or diabetes gets treatment, and yet we do that with substance abuse disorders. Regardless of persistent beliefs, addiction is a brain disease, not a moral failing.&#8221;</p>

                <p>And then, just a month after Benny King began his newly imposed $31,000+ taxpayer-funded prison term &#8212 over four hours away by car from his fiancée and family &#8212 a rigorous, scholarly study by the Brennan Center for Justice convincingly demonstrated that 39% of prisoners in the U.S. should not be in prison. Specifically, the study found (1) that &#8220;39% of the nationwide prison population (576,000 people) is behind bars with little public safety rationale,&#8221; and (2) &#8220;25% of prisoners (364,000 people), almost all non-violent, lower-level offenders, would be better served by alternatives to incarceration such as treatment, community service, or probation.&#8221;</p>

                <p>Benny King is one of these sad, sad, stories in the sea of the overly incarcerated. </p>

                <p>Writing about another equally sad case with many parallels to Benny King, Tamra Ryan, CEO of the Women&#8217;s Bean Project, <a href="http://redf.org/criminalization-addiction-tamra-ryan-ceo-womens-bean-project/">wrote</a>: &#8220;Jessie is now back in prison and we are unlikely to hear from her again. While she may not have access to drugs in prison, she will also likely not receive drug treatment. Instead, she will do her time and, at some point, start over again without addressing the underlying issues that led to her relapse. Jessie&#8217;s addiction and inability to cope with stressors have been criminalized.&#8221; Ryan concluded &#8220;the time has come to address the underlying issue of addiction with treatment, not punishment, so that the potential of the individual is not wasted.&#8221;  </p>

                <p>Exactly. </p>

                <p>We don&#8217;t need more drug addicted people like Benny King or &#8220;Jessie&#8221; filling up this nation&#8217;s jails and prisons. They&#8217;re already overly full. We&#8217;ve got to start moving in the other direction. Now. </p>

		<title>No Ordinary Lawsuit: Juliana v. United States is a Landmark Precedent  for Climate Change Legislation</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Gabriela Steier of the Duquesne University School of Law and Food Law International LLP discusses the possible effects of a landmark court decision in climate change litigation...</p>"This is no ordinary lawsuit," wrote Judge Ann Aiken of the US District Court for the District of Oregon, at the beginning of her opinion denying a motion to dismiss in <a href="https://casetext.com/case/juliana-v-united-states-1">Juliana v. United States </a>, the breakthrough climate change case that might eventually raise carbon dioxide (CO2) regulation into the realm of nondiscretionary agency action. A hopeful reading of this case's opinion, which enables the parties to proceed to trial, paints the picture where the children of the future can sue present day regulators for failure to mitigate climate change.</p>

<p>Climate change is one of the most universal threats of our time. The burning of fossil fuels emits greenhouse gases into our warming atmosphere and accelerates the deterioration of our environment. Impacts of climate change range from floods, droughts, and storms, to socioeconomic instability and political unrest, which cause <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/climateandhealth/effects/">disruptions of physical, biological, and ecological systems</a> and a host of negative public health effects.</p>

<p>Specifically, in what experts call a remarkable expansion of US common law, a group of 21 young plaintiffs (aged eight to nineteen), along with the environmental advocacy organization <a href="http://www.earthguardians.org/">Earth Guardians</a>, and <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/">Dr. James Hansen</a> of Columbia University, acting as guardian for future generations, filed this action against defendants the United States, President Barack Obama, and numerous executive agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), alleging in their complaint that the defendants "deliberately allow[ed] atmospheric CO2 concentrations to escalate to levels unprecedented in human history."</p>

<p>The legal issue covered by the opinion was "whether defendants are responsible for some of the harm caused by climate change, whether plaintiffs may challenge defendants' climate change policy in court, and whether this Court can direct defendants to change their policy without running afoul of the separation of powers doctrine." </p>

<p>Acknowledging the fundamental premise that "air, running water, the sea, and consequently the seashore" are public trust assets imposing upon the trustee a fiduciary duty to "protect the trust property against damage or destruction," Judge Aiken held the defendants responsible for failing to mitigate climate change. Thus, Judge Aiken explained that "[t]his action is of a different order than the typical environmental case. It alleges that defendants' actions and inactions--whether or not they violate any specific statutory duty--have so profoundly damaged our home planet that they threaten plaintiffs' fundamental constitutional rights to life and liberty." The plaintiffs argued that the defendants have violated their obligation to hold certain natural resources in trust for the people and for future generations. Under the public trust doctrine, no government can legitimately abdicate certain powers and obligations without diminishing the power of future legislatures to promote the general welfare. Here, the resources vital to ensure public welfare are at stake because they are threatened by rising CO2 levels which contribute to climate change at threaten the general welfare.</p>

<p>This case could potentially eliminate the <a href="http://time.com/4073881/climate-change-survey-united-states/">nonsensical denial</a> of climate change and declare it ripe for judicial action. Judge Aiken found that "[t]his lawsuit is not about proving that climate change is happening or that human activity is driving it... those facts are undisputed." Climate change has been unequivocally established through scientific evidence <a href="http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf">summarized in 2013</a> [PDF] by the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and makes the pollutant carbon dioxide (CO2) responsible for contributing to sea-level rises, extreme weather events, species extinction, ecosystem threats, ocean acidification oceans, as well as <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2012/03/22/why-global-warming-skeptics-are-wrong/">threats to the natural and cultural heritage of the planet</a>, as  Yale Economics Professor William Nordhaus explained. </p>

<p>Despite recent progress through both the courts and diplomacy, US policy has yet to catch up to a <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2015/536321/IPOL_IDA(2015)536321_EN.pdf">climate change policy</a> [PDF] that fully addresses the IPCC's warnings. The current patchwork of initiatives, encompassing a host of environmental statutes on different levels and with varying intensity, only address a selection of contributors to climate change. For instance, President Obama's <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/image/president27sclimateactionplan.pdf">Climate Action Plan</a> [PDF] deals primarily with power plants by setting CO2 emissions standards from the plants accounting for roughly one-third of all domestic greenhouse gas emissions, and is designed to "protect the health of our children and put our nation on the path toward a 30 percent reduction in carbon pollution from the power sector by 2030." The White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/energy/climate-change">further notes</a> the Climate Action Plan's environmental and health benefits will be worth an estimated $55 billion to $93 billion per year in 2030, which puts climate change mitigation at the center of public debate.  Later, in September 2016, the US <a href="/2016/09/us-china-join-paris-climate-pact.php">submitted its ratification</a> of the November 2015 <a href="/2016/11/paris-agreement-on-climate-change-becomes-effective.php">United Nations Conference of the Parties in Paris</a> global climate agreement. However, since no comprehensive federal US climate action policy exists to-date, <span class="casename">Juliana v. United States</span> gives the judiciary a chance to help US climate change policy to catch up and to establish a body of common law to fill in until Congress passes a comprehensive climate change framework.  <span class="casename">Juliana v. United States</span> enforces the public trust doctrine and applies it to the federal government, establishing the right to a climate system capable of sustaining human life as a fundamental right protected by substantive due process.</p>

<p>Professor <a href="http://www.vermontlaw.edu/directory/person?name=Parenteau,Pat">Patrick Parenteau</a>, an expert in climate change law from the nation's leading institution for environmental law, Vermont Law School, said that, "Judge Aiken wrote a blockbuster opinion in  <span class="casename">Juliana v. United States</span> holding that there is a constitutional right to a safe climate for the youth of America and the world." He emphasizes that "[t]his has set the stage for the trial of the century in summer 2017 featuring some of the world's foremost climate scientists and putting the incoming Trump administration under scrutiny to justify its announced intentions to repeal the Obama administration's clean power plan and withdraw from the Paris climate treaty signed by nearly 200 nations."</p>

<p><span class="casename">Juliana v. United States</span> is a case to remember as we go into the new year. It is the much-needed game changer that the environmental movement needs, that the children of the future count on, and that gives us, as stewards of the Earth, hope that Judge Aiken's opinion will be affirmed by the Supreme Court. As Professor Parenteau predicts, "[t]he whole world will be watching to see how this groundbreaking case turns out." </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://ssdp.org/about/board/reid-murdoch/">Reid T. Murdoch, Esq</a>., Board member of Students for Sensible Drug Policy, analyzes a major Eighth Circuit ruling prohibiting blanket drug testing of college students...</p><strong>B</strong>lanket drug testing of college students is officially unconstitutional, a US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit ruled in December, reversing a previous panel opinion. <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/court-of-appeals-rules-colleges-mandatory-drug-test-policy-unconstitutional.php">The US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit's 9-2 <em>en banc</em> decision</a> in <u><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3187426417450463809&q=Kittle-Aikeley+v.+Strong&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33">Kittle-Aikeley v. Strong</a></u> reinstates a lower court ruling that suspicionless mandatory drug testing of college students' urine violates the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt4frag1_user.html#amdt4_hd4">Fourth Amendment</a>.</p>

                <p>In 2011 a public technical college in Linn, Missouri rolled out a new drug testing plan for all incoming students. Linn State Technical College (recently renamed the State Technical College of Missouri) required students to submit to urine testing by default, imposing on them a $50 fee for a test costing $28. The program's stated purpose was "to provide a safe, healthy and productive environment for everyone who learns and works at Linn State Technical College by detecting, preventing and deterring drug use and abuse among students."</p>

                <p>In its first semester Linn State's testing program<a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-lawsuit-charges-mandatory-drug-testing-policy-missouri-college-unconstitutional"> faced a legal challenge</a> by student activists in coordination with the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU). Branden Kittle-Aikeley and <a href="http://ssdp.org/news/blog/linn-state-technical-college/">other members of the Linn State chapter of Students for Sensible Drug Policy</a> brought the class action after being required to provide urine samples. Their lawsuit alleged that blanket urine testing of all students, without any individualized suspicion, violated the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable searches. Legal representation was provided by the <a href="https://www.aclu-mo.org/">ACLU of Missouri</a> and the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/criminal-law-reform">ACLU Criminal Law Reform Project</a>. <a href="http://ssdp.org/news/blog/mandatory-and-suspicionless-drug-testing-program-at-linn-state-technical-college-ruled-unconstitutional/">Students for Sensible Drug Policy Foundation</a> also submitted an <em>amicus curiae</em> brief in the case.</p>

                <p><u>Suspicionless Drug Testing is Unconstitutional, But Not for Students in Safety-Sensitive Programs</u></p>

                <p>The District Court for the Western District of Missouri held a preliminary injunction hearing in October 2011. In November <a href="https://www.aclu-mo.org/legal-docket/barrett-v-claycomb-linn-state-technical-college/">the district court granted</a> the students' request for a preliminary injunction. This injunction was vacated by a panel of the Eighth Circuit in 2013. The panel construing the students' constitutional claim as a facial challenge, <a href="https://www.aclu-mo.org/download_file/view_inline/168/315/">found that Linn State's program</a> [PDF] "may have some unconstitutional applications" but could not be deemed unconstitutional on its face.</p>

                <p>Plaintiffs amended their complaint to clarify that they were seeking as-applied relief. The Eighth Circuit panel's suggestion that the testing program may be constitutional in certain circumstances led the district court to conduct a program-by-program analysis of safety needs.</p>

                <p>At a bench trial in July 2013, Linn State failed to present evidence of safety concerns associated with its programs, some of which involved heavy industrial projects. Linn State failed to demonstrate any relationship between drugs and the very few accidents occurring on its campus. Instead, Linn State argued for a presumption that all its students were involved in safety-sensitive coursework.</p>

                <p>The district court did not follow Linn State's proposed presumption. In September 2013<a href="https://www.aclu-mo.org/download_file/view_inline/1010/315/"> it upheld the drug testing requirement</a> [PDF] only as applied to the students enrolled in five of Linn State's programs found to be "safety-sensitive." Linn State was permanently enjoined from drug testing most of its students, those not enrolled in one of the five programs posing a "significant safety risk to others." For example, students enrolled in Linn State's "non-safety sensitive" Design Drafting program were no longer subject to suspicionless mandatory testing.</p>

                <p>On appeal a divided panel of the US Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit concluded that the district court erred in conducting a program-by-program analysis. The panel found that Linn State's blanket testing program was a reasonable means of fostering a safe and drug-free environment at a school with many safety risks.</p>

                <p>In December, the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit <em>en banc</em> rejected the panel's conclusion and reinstated the district court's injunction, approving its program-specific analysis of safety risk to others. </p>

                <p><u>Is Maintaining a Drug-Free School Environment a Special Need Justifying Suspicionless Testing?</u></p>

                <p>Under Fourth Amendment doctrine, searches such as urine tests may only be conducted absent individualized suspicion of criminal activity when an important government interest is at stake. Only a substantial special need outweighing the individual's privacy interest can justify the reduction in Fourth Amendment protection required for suspicionless drug testing.</p>

                <p>Last month's ruling follows precedent in recognizing that public safety may be such a significant special need. The holding accordingly limits the constitutional application of Linn State's suspicionless drug testing to those students enrolled in programs posing a significant safety risk.</p>

                <p>Linn State argued that alongside public safety, ensuring a drug-free college environment was an additional special need justifying deviation from traditional Fourth Amendment requirements. Linn State argued that drug testing helps to ready students for the workplace and "helps instructors focus their time on instructing." Linn State also argued that students choosing to attend their college accepted a "package deal" that included drug testing.</p>

                <p>The US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit rejected this line of argument. It relied on <u><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8655257031938182800&q=Chandler+v.+Miller&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33">Chandler v. Miller</a></u>, a Supreme Court case striking down a Georgia statute requiring candidates for state office to pass drug tests. In Chandler, the court did not accept Georgia's claim that it had a special need for that law. The court conducted a close review of the scheme, finding that Georgia had failed to demonstrate the need.</p>

                <p>In Linn State's case, it made no showing that student drug use presented a concrete danger. Linn State did not believe that it had a student drug use problem greater than that experienced by other colleges. Nor did the college present any evidence that student drug use distracted its instructors.</p>

                <p>The latest ruling in <u>Kittle-Aikeley v. Strong</u> holds that fostering a drug-free environment is simply not a "special need" justifying Linn State's suspicionless drug testing program.  </p>

                <p><u>Implications for Future Drug Testing of College Students</u></p>

                <p>What lessons for college administrators and student activists can be taken from the latest decision? The ruling against Linn State on the question of the drug-free school environment as a special need focuses on the college's failure to substantiate any hazards posed by student drug use.</p>

                <p>It does say unequivocally that "protecting adults from disadvantaging themselves in future employment contexts does not constitute a special need" sufficient to justify suspicionless testing. Therefore, any future college drug testing program cannot be premised on the notion that drug testing instills workplace readiness in students.</p>

                <p>Notably, <u>Kittle-Aikeley</u> leaves open the possibility that a college in the midst of a demonstrated drug crisis might be able to implement a suspicionless drug testing program without running afoul of the Fourth Amendment. Quoting <u>Chandler</u>, the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit notes that a "demonstrated problem of drug use, while not in all cases necessary to the validity of a testing regime, would shore up an assertion of a special need." Thus, a college that demonstrated the concrete dangers presented by its students' drug use might be well on its way to justifying a suspicionless testing regime.</p>

                <p>Just how substantial a campus drug crisis must be to rise to the level of a "special need" is unclear. As noted in Judge Beam's <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3187426417450463809&q=Kittle-Aikeley&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33">dissent</a> (joined by Judge Loken), the death rate from drug abuse in the US has doubled from 2000 to 2014. If the status quo is problematic, then perhaps Linn State's admission that its student drug problem is no greater than at other colleges is not persuasive.</p>

                <p>The <em>en banc </em>majority likely would want to see campus-specific evidence of a drug crisis. Their dismissal of Linn State's drug-free environment "special need" claim on the basis of a lack of evidence stops short of denying that such a "special need" may be shown in the future. In two cases involving middle and high school students, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5294601874680736546&q=VERNONIA+SCHOOL+DISTRICT+47J,+PETITIONER+v.+WAYNE+ACTON&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33"><u>Vernonia School District 47J v. Acton</u></a>  and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2355433843347938306&q=BOARD+OF+EDUCATION+OF+INDEPENDENT+SCHOOL++DISTRICT+NO.+92+OF+POTTAWATOMIE+COUNTY,+et+al.,+PETITIONERS+v.+LINDSAY+EARLS&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33"><u>"Board of Education of Independent School District No. 92 of Pottawatomie County v. Earls</u></a>, the Supreme Court upheld suspicionless drug testing programs. In these cases the district courts' findings that the schools were faced with imminent drug problems were not disturbed.</p>

                <p>On the other hand, drug testing programs like Linn State's are distinct from Vernonia/Earls in two significant ways. First, as the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit notes, the government's interests in <u>Vernonia</u> and <u>Earls</u> were heightened because public middle and high schools act as temporary state custodians of their pupils. Meanwhile colleges like Linn State do not play this in <em>loco parentis</em> role with respect to their adult students. Second the drug testing schemes at issue in <u>Vernonia</u> and <u>Earls</u> were not applied to all students, but only to those desiring to participate in extracurricular activities.  </p>

                <p>Future drug testing schemes at the college level will face difficulty equating themselves to permissible testing schemes at the high school and middle school level. Schemes applying to all incoming students are particularly suspect from a Fourth Amendment perspective. Ultimately however, a college with strong evidence of a campus drug crisis may be able to convince a court that a short-term suspicionless test, for example, would be justified in that circumstance. The US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit's holding that suspicionless mandatory drug testing of college students is unconstitutional is an important ruling for the rights of students everywhere to be free of invasive, generalized searches.</p>

                <p>Drug use is a significant public health crisis in the US, with students particularly at risk of harm from drug use. Suspicionless drug testing programs that violate the Fourth Amendment are not the answer.<a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10964-011-9658-2"> Studies show </a>that costly student drug testing programs are of limited effectiveness at reducing drug use. Suspicionless <a href="http://ssdp.org/news/blog/nodrugtesting/">student drug testing programs are opposed by prominent organizations</a> such as the <a href="http://www.nea.org/home/59747.htm">National Education Association</a>, the <a href="http://www.naadac.org/315">Association for Addiction Professionals</a>, the <a href="https://www.apha.org/">American Public Health Association</a>, the <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/early/2014/05/20/peds.2014-0865.full.pdf">American Academy of Pediatrics</a>, the <a href="http://www.socialworkers.org/">National Association of Social Workers</a> and the <a href="https://www.ncadd.org/">National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence</a>.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/faculty/bio_angela_cornell.cfm">Angela B. Cornell</a> of <a href="http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu">Cornell Law School</a> discusses the implications that a recent case in Kentucky will have on labor relations and labor rights...</p><strong>D</strong>eparting from decades of labor and industrial relations practice in the U.S. and rejecting the firmly grounded understanding of the language of the <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/resources/national-labor-relations-act">National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)</a>, the Sixth Circuit recently waded into uncharted waters with its <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/federal-appeals-court-upholds-kentucky-county-right-to-work-law.php">decision to uphold a Kentucky county right to work ordinance</a> in <a href="http://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/16a0275p-06.pdf">UAW Local 3047 v. Hardin County</a>. The decision has wide-sweeping implications for labor relations and will undermine important labor rights.</p>

<p>Hardin County, Kentucky <a href="http://www.hcky.org/ordinances/Right%20to%20Work,%20Ordinance%20300%20Series%202014.pdf">passed an ordinance</a> that prohibits union security agreements. For those who are unfamiliar with labor law, a union security clause is the language in a collective bargaining agreement that requires those employees who benefit from the agreement to contribute dues/fees to the union. The sum has been whittled down for non-union members, who are only required to contribute to the core expenses related to collective bargaining, contract administration and grievance adjustment&#8212not the union's political activities. The payment of dues or the reduced fees are a condition of employment in unionized bargaining units in states that do not prohibit union security agreements. <br />
 <br />
The Kentucky ordinance at issue also places restrictions on dues check off and hiring halls. The U.S. district court decision ruled that the entire ordinance was preempted by the NLRA, but the Sixth Circuit reversed as to the union security clause, finding that this part of the home-rule ordinance falls into the statutory exception that applies to states under the language of &#167 14(b) of the amended NLRA.</p>

<p>Section 14(b) creates an exception to the statute's protection of union security clauses and provides that: <blockquote>Nothing in the subchapter shall be construed as authorizing the execution or application of agreements requiring membership in a labor organization as a condition of employment in any State or Territory in which such execution or application is prohibited by State or Territorial law.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/164">29 U.S.C. &#167 14(b)</a>. This section has enabled states to pass so called right-to-work legislation and <a href="http://www.nrtw.org/right-to-work-states/">27</a> states have done so, spurred on by conservative national organizations that also played a role in this effort. The parameters and permutations of union security in the private and public sector have been the subject of considerable challenge, including several important decisions at the U.S. Supreme Court that have chipped away at the foundation of labor rights. In February, the Court divided evenly in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-915_1bn2.pdf">Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, 136 S.Ct 1083 (2016)</a>, leaving union security in place in the public sector, but the aggressive ideological campaign against the very core of Freedom of Association continues.</p>

<p>Despite the many ways in which union security has been challenged, in 70 years no court has interpreted the language in &#167 14(b) to apply to political subdivisions of the state. The local initiatives that sought to prohibit union-security agreements at the city or county level have been preempted by the federal statute, until this Sixth Circuit decision.</p>

<p>The NLRA establishes a comprehensive national labor policy for the private sector, under which union security agreements are valid as a matter of federal law and are highly regulated. The statute explicitly permits and regulates these agreements with the only exception to exclusive federal regulation being based on the language of &#167 14(b). </p>

<p>Accordingly, the issue before the Sixth Circuit was whether the Hardin County ordinance falls within the coverage of &#167 14(b)&#8212despite being neither a State nor a Territory.  </p>

<p>The Sixth Circuit panel upheld the ordinance by concluding that "State" in &#167 14(b) included political subdivisions, relying significantly on the U.S. Supreme Court's interpretation of similar language in completely distinct statutory schemes.  The Court relied on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Wisconsin+Public+Intervenor+v.+Mortier&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&case=4020635468372754657&scilh=0">Wisconsin Public Intervenor v. Mortier, 501 U.S. 597 (1991)</a> (Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act does not preempt regulation of pesticides by local governments) and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=City+of+Columbus+v.+Our+Garage+and+Wrecker+Service&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&case=2444677080330917078&scilh=0">City of Columbus v. Our Garage and Wrecker Service, 536 U.S. 424 (2002)</a> (Interstate Commerce Act that expressly excluded state safety regulatory authority from preemption was interpreted to permit local ordinance as well). Based on this authority, the Court broadly concluded that when Congress references the regulatory authority of a State, the statute will be interpreted to include political subdivisions unless there is a clear statement to the contrary. <br />
 <br />
Scholars of statutory interpretation have issued strong warnings about the risks of relying on unrelated statutes to interpret meaning because the pertinent context is essential for statutory interpretation. Lawrence M. Solan, The Language of Statutes: Laws and Their Interpretation, 75-76 (Univ. of Chicago 2010)(citations omitted) ("Searching for ordinary meaning in contexts remote from the one in dispute seems doomed to cause misinterpretations.") ("Somewhat more problematic are inferences drawn from how statutes remote from the one in dispute use the same word."); Norman J. Singer & J.D. Shambie Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construction, &#167 53.5, &#167 46.5 (7th ed. 2007) (citations omitted) ("Caution must be exercised in applying the rule that one statute will be interpreted to correspond to analogous but unrelated statutes because an inclusion or exclusion may show an intent or convey a meaning exactly contrary to that expressed by analogous legislation")("The interpretation of one statute by reference to an analogous but unrelated statute is considered an unreliable means to discern legislative intent.")("Two statutory provisions containing similar or identical language are not necessarily subject to the same interpretation, as there are other interpretative factors such as purpose and content of the legislative history."). </p>

<p>Relying on unrelated statutes to interpret the term "State" is flawed not only in this context, but its broad application in the circuit can distort statutory interpretation in other areas as well. Instead of focusing on the touchstone of statutory interpretation, the intent of Congress, with an eye toward the statute's purpose and context, it interposes this artificial definition.</p>

<p>With regard to &#167 14(b) of the NLRA, the focus on unrelated statutes diverts the Court from the more grounded canons of statutory construction, like the: 1) "plain meaning rule," 2) the intentionality of language in one section of a statute, but omitted in another, 3) exceptions like &#167 14(b) are to be interpreted strictly and narrowly, and 4) statutory language should not be interpreted in a way that undermines the purpose of the statute. The Court did rely on one rule of statutory construction, citing <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Powerex+Corp.+v.+Reliant+Energy+Servs,+Inc&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&case=11430619675192308799&scilh=0">Powerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy Servs, Inc., 551 U.S. 224, 232 (2017)</a>(that identical words in the same statute be given the same meaning), however, the lower court also relied on this case to reach the opposite conclusion.  </p>

<p>Furthermore, relying on the unrelated statutes to interpret the word "State" in this context is particularly problematic because it will make it very difficult for business and labor to have functioning collective bargaining agreements across counties. The very purpose of the statute is to "encourage the practice and procedure of collective bargaining."  Potentially thousands of different policies on union security will be a nightmare for the parties to a collective bargaining agreement and a significant challenge to the enforcement of these agreements. The Sixth Circuit decision fails to consider how collective bargaining, and labor and industrial relations more generally, function in the U.S.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, union security is often misunderstood and distorted in these right-to-work struggles. When a majority of employees in a bargaining unit choose to be organized collectively and represented by a union, a collective bargaining agreement is negotiated to improve wages, benefits and provide these employees with a contractual right to "just cause" for discipline, as well as address other issues of concern. The collective bargaining agreement will also contain a union security agreement in states that do not restrict them. Employees who benefit from the agreement and the union's work in obtaining and enforcing it are required to contribute to those expenses and the union is legally obliged to represent everyone fairly&#8212even non-members.  </p>

<p>In right-to-work states, non-union members are exempt from all union dues, creating what is known as the "free-rider" problem. As the Supreme Court acknowledged: "Congress' decision to allow union-security agreements at all reflects concern that the parties to collective bargaining agreements be allowed to provide that there be no employees who are getting the benefit of union representation without paying for them." <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Communications+Workers+v.+Beck&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&case=16586350185991438812&scilh=0">Communications Workers v. Beck, 487 U.S. 735, 750 (1988)</a>. The union still has a legal duty to represent those employees who contribute nothing and that can be a costly endeavor, potentially jeopardizing the financial integrity of the union.</p>

<p>Ultimately the Sixth Circuit decision undermines the very core of what the NLRA sought to enhance&#8212workers' collective rights. The statute, passed on the heels of the Great Depression, sought to bolster the bargaining strength of workers. By joining together workers could enhance their ability to negotiate for better terms and conditions of employment and by doing so the American middle class was created. Now the middle class is shrinking as the gulf between the very rich and everyone else widens. It is worth remembering that labor law serves broader societal interests in very important ways as expressed by the statute's sponsor, Senator Robert Wagner: "The struggle for a voice in industry through the process of collective bargaining is at the heart of the struggle for the preservation of political as well as economic democracy in America."  Now more than ever we need the language and purpose of the statute to be enforced by our judiciary.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://mobile.jmls.edu/directory/faculty/profile-full.php?lastfirstname=Lim_Daryl">Daryl Lim</a> of The John Marshall School of Law discusses the implications and predictions of the recent Mylan investigations after 20 US states file lawsuits...</p>In an age of divisive politics, there has been a surprising amount of consensus on containing the cost of healthcare and ensuring adequate access to it. The <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/about-the-law/read-the-law/">Affordable Care Act</a>'s name itself indicates the aspirations of a president who campaigned for its passage through Congress. While his successor could bring about its avowed demise, even he has been quick to promise cheaper drugs via free market principles and foreign competition. </p>

<p>That consensus permeates an ideologically archipelagian Congress as well. Last month the<a href="https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/114th-congress/house-report/190/1"> 21st Century Cures Act</a> received overwhelming bipartisan support, with the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/114-2016/s157">Senate voting 94-5</a> and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/12/07/congress-passes-21st-century-cures-act-boosting-research-and-easing-drug-approvals/?utm_term=.5438ef6daa13">House voting 392-26</a>. The bill among other things, expedites drug and medical device approval. More treatment options in turn promises to reduce patient healthcare bills.</p>

<p>Access to medicine is an issue with visceral voter appeal. The logic of lowering drug prices is easily understood and its benefits immediately appreciated, particularly by an electorate frustrated by socio-economic inequity and anxious about their futures. On the other side, many who benefitted from that inequity made their fortunes in pharmaceuticals. Some by engorging themselves on the medically vulnerable. </p>

<p>For instance the price of <a href="http://www.mylan.com/">Mylan</a>'s two-pack EpiPen, used to treat severe allergic reactions,<a href="http://newsroom.mylan.com/2016-08-25-Mylan-Taking-Immediate-Action-to-Further-Enhance-Access-to-EpiPen-Epinephrine-Injection-USP-Auto-Injector"> rose five times in seven years by 400 percent to $600</a>. EpiPen became Mylan's most important product, accounting for $1 billion of its $9.4 billion in sales in 2015. Mylan's justifications were the cost of business and the intricacies of America's healthcare system. Its reports however, indicate that most of its expenditure went to marketing and overhead costs. Likewise the price of Daraprim, used in the treatment of fatal parasitic infections, <a href="https://law.stanford.edu/2015/10/05/daraprim-and-drug-pricing/">skyrocketed by 5,000 percent</a>. </p>

<p>In December news broke that<a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/12/20-states-file-suit-against-mylan-for-price-fixing-conspiracy.php"> 20 Democratic and Republican states had filed an antitrust lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] accusing Mylan and other generic drug companies of conspiring to raise prices on an antibiotic and an oral-diabetes medication. Mylan has denied the charge, but it would not be difficult to guess what the public's verdict would be.    </p>

<p><u>The Mylan Conspiracy</u><br />
The <a href="http://trade.gov/topmarkets/pdf/Pharmaceuticals_Executive_Summary.pdf">US generic drug market is worth a staggering $74.5 billion</a> [PDF]. Generic products account for 88 percent of prescriptions and are crucial to the effort to rein in healthcare costs. In a market with generic substitutes, the cost of a drug falls by 80 percent or more. Robust competition through a measured introduction of generic drugs is therefore crucial in any effort to control healthcare costs.  </p>

<p>One battlefront lies in stemming reverse payments, so called because the settlement money flows from the incumbent to the potential generic seeking to challenge the brand's dominance. In 2013 the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11793515772117153465&q=FTC+v.+ACTAVIS,+INC.&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Supreme Court held that such settlement agreements</a> could have "significant anticompetitive effects" and could violate the antitrust laws. Subsequent cases by lower courts have taken a broad view of "payments." For instance non-cash forms of consideration could include the brand company's agreement not to launch its authorized generic drugs to compete with a generic competitor's offering, and sharing the duopoly profits.  </p>

<p>Another battlefront is found in "product hopping" cases. This happens when a <a href="http://www.pacode.com/secure/data/028/chapter25/chap25toc.html#25.53.">brand company switches from one formulation of the drug to another to evade state drug product substitution laws</a>. These laws allow or require pharmacies to substitute generic versions of brand prescriptions. Courts have distinguished between anticompetitive "hard switches," where the brand company removes the original drug from circulation, and generally permissible "soft switches," where the original drug remains on the market.   </p>

<p>The third battlefront involves cases such as the Mylan investigation. Here, it is the generics themselves who seek out rivals, agreeing to maintain market shares and avoid competing on prices. In the Mylan investigation, senior executives at the companies allegedly used informal industry gatherings, personal calls, and text messages to share competitively sensitive information. Mylan then allegedly gave up bidding for at least one major wholesaler and one large pharmacy chain to <a href="http://www.heritagepharma.com/">Heritage Pharmaceuticals</a>. </p>

<p>The two drugs at issue in the alleged conspiracy are a delayed-release form of the antibiotic treatment doxycycline hyclate, and glyburide, a commonly used diabetes drug. Members of Congress singled out the surging price of doxycycline as a symptom of the drug price malady. <a href="http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/must-read/soaring-generic-drug-prices-draw-senate-scrutiny">One form of doxycycline rose from $20 a bottle to $1,849 in six months</a>. Two former executives at Heritage, the alleged ringleader of the companies under investigation, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-top-generic-pharmaceutical-executives-charged-price-fixing-bid-rigging-and-customer">were charged with criminal violations</a>. </p>

<p>The lawsuit came just a day after the <a href="http://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/face-sheet-on-generic-drug-price-increases?inline=file">Justice Department's two-year investigation into the industry's pricing practices</a> [PDF]. According to the Justice Department, consumers paid more for one in nineteen generic drugs sold in the US during the past three years because of price-fixing. The average price hike was 1,350 percent. The investigation uncovered evidence of a wide-spread conspiracy to fix prices and allocate markets for several generic pharmaceuticals in the US that went beyond the two drugs involved. </p>

<p><u>Implications and Predictions </u></p>

<p>The Mylan investigation is symptomatic of a malaise where the fruits of economic growth are hoarded rather than shared. Naked horizontal agreements among competitors to fix the price of a good or service, or to restrict their output, are usually condemned as per se unlawful. Where a product could not exist without certain horizontal agreements, the restraints are normally analyzed under a rule of reason analysis. This involves balancing anticompetitive effects against procompetitive justifications. However the facts involving Mylan and its associates suggest that the parties had no other motive than to throttle the supply of generic drugs. </p>

<p>The criminal charges the Heritage executives face are significant because they represent a more aggressive enforcement of antitrust law. Last year the Justice Department revised its policy in response to public perception that it was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/deputy-attorney-general-sally-quillian-yates-delivers-remarks-new-york-university-school">not doing enough to investigate and prosecute corporate executives</a>. The reasoning is that financial penalties against company directors and officers can be borne by companies' indemnity policies, while the individuals are unaffected. </p>

<p>Individual accountability with the potential for jail time and the stigma of a criminal conviction promises to deter corporate misconduct more effectively. Internal operating procedures now identify potentially culpable individuals early on so as to minimize the risk of evidence getting stale or the expiration of the statute of limitations. Suspects can seek leniency if they admit to illegal conduct and testify in court in a full and timely manner.    </p>

<p>The investigation also raises the question of how executives should communicate across companies. The drug companies allegedly knew their conduct was illegal and had tried to avoid communicating in writing, even deleting written communications when their cover had been blown. At one end, intentional exchange of sensitive information is highly probative of a conspiracy. On the other, total avoidance of interaction is highly impractical. The key then is to ingrain best practices in executives through rigorous compliance programs so that they can traverse the murky ground in between.</p>

<p>Behavioral economics can also help improve antitrust outcomes, including ones that concern cartels in the pharma industry. Behavioral economics highlights the role of information asymmetries, heuristics and non-price variables in influencing perceptions of manufacturers, payors and payees in the healthcare system. It challenges traditional assumptions that stakeholders maximize profits in a rational manner, particularly when the facts suggest otherwise. In turn this influences the analysis market power, the identification of anticompetitive effects and any procompetitive justifications, and aids developing creative remedies through behavioral nudges. Reducing the complex technical analysis to intuitive heuristics that executives in drug industries can readily internalize into their daily business behavior would help foster a culture of competition. It would also help judges navigate complex antitrust analysis while reaching more precise outcomes. </p>

<p>Antitrust law aims to lower prices and increase consumer choice, and it will likely be used as a policy lever to control the cost of healthcare this year. The wave of populist angst that characterized much of 2016 will translate into harsher scrutiny of the drug industry. The political rewards of disgorging wealthy pharmaceutical companies will encourage the agency to stay the course under the new administration. </p>

<p>America's rule of law was admired because it defended the downtrodden from the tyranny of unbridled capitalism. As far as the cost of healthcare is concerned, that age seems all but over. 2017 will continue to accentuate rising income inequality and economic dislocation. An antitrust policy that ensures robust competition in generics is a shot in the arm that will make its citizens stronger together, and on this issue, help make America great again.     </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnists <a href="http://apps.law.asu.edu/Apps/Faculty/Faculty.aspx?individual_id=65847">James G. Hodge, Jr.</a> and <a href="https://isearch.asu.edu/profile/2356505">Sarah Wetter</a>, of <a href="https://www.law.asu.edu/">The Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law</a>, Arizona State University, discuss forthcoming new regulations on controlling communicable diseases through the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ...</p>
<strong>O</strong>n January 19, 2017, the federal <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC) published a <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/19/2017-00615/control-of-communicable-diseases">final rule</a> to enhance and clarify its capacity to prevent the introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable diseases into and across the US. </p>

<p>Pursuant to the federal <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/264">Public Health Service Act</a> (PHSA), CDC is authorized to detain, medically examine, and release foreign and interstate travellers suspected of carrying a communicable disease. However, corresponding regulations stemming from this legislative authority have long been overdue for reforms.</p>

<p>In the process of modernizing these regulations, CDC published an <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/08/15/2016-18103/control-of-communicable-diseases">initial draft</a> of the regulations on August 15, 2016. Ensuing public commentary revealed concerns over <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/12/cdc-quarantine-rule-violate-civil-liberties/511823/">potential infringements</a> of individual and community rights stemming from CDC's efforts to strengthen its authority. While the agency worked extensively to balance modern public health powers and personal freedoms in amending its initial draft, the final rule may still be subject to legal and political challenges. <br />
<strong><br />
Need for Federal Communicable Disease Control Reforms<br />
</strong><br />
Recent communicable disease outbreaks (e.g., <a href="http://harvardmagazine.com/2007/03/the-sars-scare.html">SARS</a> (2003), <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/death-toll-from-flu-rises-as-h1n1-strain-returnswith-young-invincibles-most-affected/2014/02/19/71f539f4-98b0-11e3-b931-0204122c514b_story.html?utm_term=.2fe502447815">H1N1</a> (2014), <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/20/health/the-zika-virus-in-south-florida.html">Zika</a> (2015)) expose existing inadequacies in US public health preparedness. In 2014, 2 individuals infected with <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/12/health/mers-outbreak-u-s-/">Middle East Respiratory Syndrome</a> (MERS) arrived to the US from abroad. Their conditions were initially undetected, resulting in case investigations of over 700 close contacts (other travelers, members of their household and community, and health care workers), costing upwards of $250,000. </p>

<p>The 2014-2016 <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/19/2017-00615/control-of-communicable-diseases">Ebola outbreak</a> reached the US after spreading throughout remote West African villages to major international transportation hubs. One infected individual, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/08/health/thomas-eric-duncan-ebola/">Eric Thomas Duncan</a>, slipped into Dallas, Texas from Liberia. He was initially turned away by a local hospital that failed to properly diagnose his condition, and later died at the same hospital where 2 of his treating nurses were also infected. His case lead to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6349a5.htm?s_cid=mm6349a5_w">screening</a> of over 30,000 additional travelers at US airports between October 11, 2014 and the end of the outbreak months later. However, federal officials failed to detect any new, incoming cases through this lengthy, expensive surveillance. </p>

<p>These outbreaks and events reinforce the need for more coordinated and efficacious governmental responses to detect, prevent, and treat emerging infectious conditions. Modernized powers to institute social distances between infected persons and at-risk communities are essential to protecting the public's health.<br />
<strong><br />
CDC's Final Rule: A Primer<br />
</strong><br />
CDC's final rule seeks to strengthen the authority for federal officials to take rapid and effective action in response to potential or actual public health emergencies. It authorizes federal public health prevention measures at US airports, seaports, railway stations, bus terminals, and other interstate and international transportation hubs. </p>

<p>All travellers, regardless of their destination, may be subject to prevention measures including observation, questioning, and review of available health and travel records. Airline operators must report incidences of persons who fall ill or perish in flight, and take action to confine the spread of potential infectious agents. Affected individuals may be required to provide contact information in the event of suspected exposure to an infectious agent.</p>

<p>The rule broadly defines "<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/19/2017-00615/control-of-communicable-diseases">ill person</a>" to include anyone with signs or symptoms of a communicable disease, allowing CDC to take early action to prevent the spread of contagious and potentially life threatening conditions. Based on "reasonable beliefs" that an individual is infected with a quarantinable communicable condition (listed via <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2014/08/06/2014-18682/revised-list-of-quarantinable-communicable-diseases">Executive Order</a>), a CDC official may issue an order for apprehension, isolation, quarantine, or conditional release of the individual. To assist in this determination, the individual may be required to undergo a medical examination by a licensed health worker. Examinations may include testing as reasonably necessary to confirm or rule out the presence of a quarantinable condition. Infected individuals may not engage in interstate or international travel (with some exceptions) without a federal travel permit.<br />
<strong><br />
From Draft to Final: Key Changes<br />
</strong><br />
Five months prior to the publication of the final rule, CDC published a proposed version of the rule and implemented a two-month period for <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/docketBrowser?rpp=50&so=DESC&sb=postedDate&po=0&dct=PS&D=CDC-2016-0068">public commentary</a>. After reviewing over 15,000 comments, CDC issued its final rule that strikes a finer balance between promoting the public's health and protecting individual and community rights. </p>

<p>The final rule affords several individual protections lacking in the proposed version. CDC eliminated a provision that would have allowed the agency to unilaterally require individuals to submit to procedures including hospitalization, vaccination, and medical treatment. Public health prevention measures must be non-invasive. Medical examinations can only be conducted with prior informed consent. Individuals subject to social distancing measures are entitled to adequate food, water, accommodations, medical treatment, and means of communication. </p>

<p>Federal orders for isolation, quarantine, or conditional release must be issued in close proximity to an individual's initial apprehension. Any order is subject to reassessment by a federal official (who cannot be the same person who issued it originally) within 72 hours. Officials reassessing an order have to consider and determine whether less restrictive means would adequately protect the public's health. Affected individuals subject to continuing orders can request a medical review, present witnesses and testimony, and be represented by medical or legal advocates at governments' expense if the individual is indigent. <br />
<strong><br />
Potential Legal Pitfalls<br />
</strong><br />
Despite meaningful reforms, the final rule may still be subject to legal and policy challenges depending in part on how and when its provisions are executed. CDC's continued reliance on "reasonable beliefs" of an individual's infection in support of its social distancing measures falls below the "<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12392576224835810750&q=445+US+480&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">clear and convincing</a>" standard of evidence generally needed to justify such deprivations of liberty interests. CDC may purport that a lower threshold is justified where the public health threat is substantial. </p>

<p>Broadly defining "ill persons" allows federal officials wide discretion to make initial determinations of a traveler's health status, but could also lead to unjustified social distancing orders impacting individuals with relatively minor conditions. To the extent the final rule does not mandate external, non-CDC assessments or reviews via a <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15775785182348520983&q=504+US+71&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">neutral decision maker</a>, individuals may arguably be denied sufficient due process.  <br />
<strong><br />
Future Implementation of the Final Rule<br />
</strong><br />
CDC published the final rule just one day prior to the Presidential inauguration of Donald Trump and the resulting changes in its own leadership with the departure of Director Tom Frieden and others. How the provisions of the final rule actually play out will only be known after February 21, 2017 when it takes full effect. </p>

<p>To be sure, updating existing, antiquated powers to prevent the introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable diseases into and across the US is a laudable goal. CDC's final rule goes a long way toward clarifying specific federal authority in this critical area of emergency preparedness. Yet, implementation may lead to legal and political challenges. CDC must be diligent in exercising its authority in a manner that properly weighs protection against public health threats with potential infringements on individual rights.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.drake.edu/law/facstaff/directory/keith-miller/">Keith Miller</a> of <a href="http://www.drake.edu/law/">Drake University Law School</a> discusses the future of sports gambling in the United States...</p><strong>I</strong>n a move that caught many people by surprise, on <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-court-seeks-incoming-administrations-views-in-new-jersey-sports-betting-case.php">January 16 the United Supreme Court invited the Solicitor General</a> to set forth the government's view of the validity of a federal law that prohibits states other than Nevada from offering sports betting. Although the significance of the Court's order won't be known for some time, it raises tantalizing questions about the future of sports gambling in the United States. Could nationwide sports betting lie over the horizon?</p>

<p><em><strong>The Background of Sports Betting Law in the US</strong></em></p>

<p>Sports betting in the US is immensely popular. Nevada sports books handled over <a href="http://www.legalsportsreport.com/7902/nevada-record-sports-betting-2015/">$4 billion in bets in 2015</a>. In addition, it is estimated that <a href="https://www.americangaming.org/sites/default/files/research_files/After%20Action%20Report_PDF-Web.pdf">nearly $200 billion</a> is bet illegally on sports annually with bookies and through online sports books based outside the US.</p>

<p>The reason for the financial disparity between legal and illegal betting is the fact that federal law makes Nevada the only state where single game sports betting is legal. The <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/part-VI/chapter-178">1992 Professional and Sports Betting Act (PASPA)</a> prohibited sports betting but granted exceptions to states that had operated forms of sports betting before PASPA's passage. Nevada was the only state with single game sports betting, and when New Jersey failed to take advantage of a provision in PASPA giving them one year from the law's effective date to adopt sports betting, PASPA essentially codified Nevada's sports betting monopoly.</p>

<p>The wisdom of PASPA has been debated since its inception. Supporters assert that PASPA protects the integrity of sports contests from the potential corruption of nationwide sports betting and limits the spread of problem gambling.</p>

<p>On the other hand, PASPA's critics contend that legalized betting actually promotes the integrity of sports contests by establishing a transparent regulatory framework. They further argue that legalization would drive out the criminal elements of illegal betting, and states would benefit from taxing the gambling revenues. Whatever the merits of these arguments, the fact is Congress has not amended the law since its passage.</p>

<p><em><strong>New Jersey's Attack(s) on PASPA</strong></em></p>

<p>In 2012, after voters overwhelmingly approved a <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/New_Jersey_Sports_Betting_Amendment,_Public_Question_1_(2011)">constitutional amendment</a>, New Jersey stopped waiting for a change in PASPA and enacted a sports betting framework in the state. The state contended that PASPA violated constitutional principles relating to states' rights. </p>

<p><em>In Christie I</em>,<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=christie+paspa+2012&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&case=5051117760751020929&scilh=0"> the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled</a> that PASPA was valid. The court held that PASPA did not "commandeer" the legislative processes in New Jersey because it doesn't require a state to do anything. Rather, as a valid expression of Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause, PASPA simply <em>prevents</em> a state from authorizing sports betting and therefore does not violate principles of states' rights.</p>

<p>Moreover, the court ruled that Congress did not violate the Constitution by permitting Nevada to offer sports betting when other states could not. PASPA was designed to stop the <em>spread</em> of sports betting so it was inevitable that some states would be treated differently.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, New Jersey was undaunted by this defeat. It seized on language in the court's opinion that said PASPA did not preclude New Jersey from repealing its laws forbidding sports betting, because a repeal did not constitute an authorization. So in 2014, New Jersey repealed its laws forbidding sports betting at horse tracks and in casinos. In other words, sports betting could be conducted at those facilities because there was no longer a law forbidding it. Once again, the leagues claimed this was in violation of PASPA</p>

<p>It is here that the case began the path of twists and turns that has led to the Supreme Court's recent order. In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9265010675582922013&q=christie+2014&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39 <em>Christie II</em></a>, the district court and a panel of the court of appeals once again held that New Jersey's actions violated PASPA. But the 3rd Circuit vacated the panel decision and granted a motion for an <a href="http://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/144546p1.pdf">en banc rehearing of the case</a>. Because granting such a motion is extremely rare, many believed that the 3rd Circuit was poised to reverse course and strike down PASPA.  </p>

<p>These suspicions were reinforced when questions from the bench on oral argument in February 2016 suggested the court might be reconsidering PASPA's constitutionality, and by a long delay in the court announcing its decision. But the <a href="http://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/144546p1.pdf">3rd Circuit's 9-3 decision</a> announced in August 2016 was anti-climactic. The court reaffirmed its belief that PASPA was constitutional and clarified some of the analysis from <em>Christie I</em>. All that was left was for the Supreme Court, as it did in <em>Christie I</em>, to deny cert sending New Jersey back to the drawing board, or to Congress to seek to have PASPA changed.  But then came the Court's order on January 16.</p>

<p><em><strong>What is the Significance of the Court's "Invitation" to the Solicitor General?</strong></em></p>

<p>The Court's order inviting the Solicitor General to express the views of the United States may suggest the Court believes the case has some merit. It is misleading to call this an "invitation" given that the Solicitor General's office views it as a command appearance.</p>

<p>The Solicitor General's opinion will be taken very seriously by the Court. <a href="http://www.georgemasonlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/16-2_Wachtell.pdf">A 2009 empirical analysis</a> concluded that a petition for cert is over 37 times more likely to be granted in cases where the Court solicits the views of the Solicitor General. This is the case even when the Solicitor General's recommendation is not to grant the cert petition.</p>

<p>Of course, a grant of cert does not necessarily mean the Court would strike down PASPA. The 3rd Circuit's action vacating the panel decision in <em>Christie II</em> and ordering a rehearing by the full court was also highly unusual, but it led to a reaffirmation of the law rather than its invalidation. Predicting how the Supreme Court would rule is thus a precarious undertaking.</p>

<p>Moreover, there are other reasons why a grant of cert by the Court would be unusual. The federal law has been <em>upheld</em> against constitutional attack in five different federal court decisions. There is no "circuit split" that needs to be resolved. Indeed, the 3rd Circuit is the only federal court that has ruled on the validity of PASPA so there has been no "percolation" of the issue among other intermediate appellate courts.  </p>

<p>However, the constitutional attack on PASPA has emphasized issues of federalism and overreach by the federal government in an area of law&#8212gambling&#8212that is typically viewed as being in the domain of state regulation. If the Court grants cert these issues will be front and center.</p>

<p><em><strong>What Would Happen if the Court Struck Down PASPA?</strong></em></p>

<p>Even if the Supreme Court were to grant cert, hear the case on its merits, and strike down PASPA, it would not resolve the sports betting controversy. In fact, it would be just the beginning. Invalidation of PASPA would almost certainly trigger a Congressional response, as the major sports leagues would likely press for Congress to intervene. Possible actions include:</p>

<p>(A) Congress could directly prohibit sports betting in the states. Indeed, that is the core of the "commandeering" attack on PASPA; Congress didn't want to take the responsibility for prohibiting sports betting, so it prevented the states from authorizing it. Congress probably has authority under the Commerce Clause to pass a federal law banning sports betting; or</p>

<p>(B) Congress could pass a law establishing a template for states to follow if they wanted to allow sports betting. That is, states would have to "opt-in" to such a system. This approach would address the concerns that a state-by-state system of sports betting would be unwieldy and inefficient, concerns that have driven some of the opposition to New Jersey's challenge. The major sports leagues would most certainly seek some "monetization" of sports betting to their benefit.</p>

<p>There are several reasons why Congress would be unlikely to take the former path.</p>

<p>First, sports betting is a popular activity that has increasingly entered the mainstream. Betting lines are openly discussed on sports programs and published in media outlets.</p>

<p>Second, while the major sports leagues have vigorously opposed legalized sports betting, their opposition has markedly softened in recent years. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has called for a transparent, regulated system of sports betting.  The NHL has established an expansion team in Las Vegas. And most importantly, the NFL seems ready to allow the Oakland Raiders to relocate to Las Vegas. While these actions don't necessarily suggest support for wider sports betting, they would have been unthinkable even a few years ago.</p>

<p>Third, it may be that the leagues' embrace of daily fantasy sports, and their disingenuous insistence that the activity does not constitute sports betting, has worn thin with policy-makers. A regulatory system that integrates fantasy sports within traditional sports betting may be an idea whose time has come.</p>

<p><em><strong>The Sports Betting Issue Refuses to Go Away</strong></em></p>

<p>The 3rd Circuit decisions emphasized that states needed to take their plea to Congress. Perhaps it takes a Supreme Court decision to force the issue for the major sports leagues and Congress. While a lot would need to happen before it comes to this, the Court's request for the Solicitor General's opinion raises fascinating issues.</p>

<p>President Trump, a casino owner, will soon be appointing a new Solicitor General who will weigh in on the issue for the Supreme Court. This means it will likely be some time before the Court benefits from the Solicitor General's perspective. It also illustrates the intensely political nature of debates in our country over gambling.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://apps.law.asu.edu/Apps/Faculty/Faculty.aspx?individual_id=65847">James G. Hodge, Jr.</a> of <a href="https://www.law.asu.edu/">The Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law,</a> Arizona State University, discusses forthcoming "repeal and replace" strategies regarding the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and how replacements for its provisions must focus on assuring equitable access to quality care...</p>

<p><strong>O</strong>n his first day in office, President Donald J. Trump directed via <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/20/politics/trump-obamacare-executive-order/">Executive Order</a> that federal agencies should "waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay" enforcement of provisions of the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/3590">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (ACA) that impose fiscal burdens. However, in an early exhibition of political restraint, President Trump and the Republican-led Congress have not yet fully repealed the ACA, <a href="http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/blog/2017/jan/repeal-and-delay-budget-neutrality-aca-replacement">despite</a> promises to do so &#8212; and fast. It may have taken decades for multiple Presidential administrations to develop comprehensive health care reform but only one administration to effectively undo it. <br />
	<br />
To be sure, the ACA is on legal life support. The only reason that its shelf-life has been extended may be the recognition that replacing "Obamacare" is <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/replacing-obamacare-will-be-difficult-repealing-it-could-be-just-n702796">not so easy</a>. Americans have developed a love-hate relationship with the ACA. They love the assurance of health coverage despite pre-existing condition, but hate that they are mandated to get covered. They love how their dependents can remain on their insurance policies until age 26, but hate how those policies' premiums have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/16/us/politics/donald-trump-affordable-care-act.html">risen</a> over years. They love how the ACA extended coverage to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/16/us/politics/donald-trump-affordable-care-act.html">20 million</a> Americans who previously lacked it, but hate that such care is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/17/opinion/the-gops-health-care-death-spiral.html">subsidized</a> by new taxes, penalties and other revenues.   </p>

<p>Jettisoning undesirable provisions of the ACA while retaining what works is complicated. Replacement options are percolating across the aisles of Congress and throughout the states. Some proposals would initiate the repeal of the ACA in its entirety. Others seek to repair what is deemed broken without trashing the entire act. Most of the proposals provide patchwork fixes. Some present more comprehensive replacements.  </p>

<p>Time will tell what approaches are actually taken and whether they work in the ongoing conversion of "Obamacare" to "Trumpcare." In the wake of these reforms, however, is the fate of millions of Americans whose individual and community health is tied to efficacious policies to assure low-cost, high-option, quality health care for all. The <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/">Congressional Budget Office</a> estimates that <https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52371?utm_source=feedblitz&utm_medium=FeedBlitzEmail&utm_content=812526&utm_campaign=Express_2017-01-17_10%3a30">18 million</a> Americans could lose their health insurance coverage in less than a year (and nearly double that many in the decade ahead) if the ACA is repealed and not adequately replaced. To the extent that access to quality, affordable health care was the initial promise of the ACA, it may be the measuring stick for Trumpcare for years to come.   <br />
<strong><br />
Repeal Now, Replace Later<br />
</strong><br />
Talk of ACA's repeal is nothing new. Since its passage in 2010, Republican members of Congress have introduced <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/01/house-republicans-obamacare-repeal-votes-102911">dozens of bills</a> seeking to abolish it. The looming threat of a Presidential veto repelled such legislation. However, over years the ACA's impacts have been steadily chipped away by:<br />
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;line-height:1.2;padding-left: 40px;"><br />
<li>multiple judicial decisions questioning its unconstitutionality; </li><br />
<li>internal actions of the Department of <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/">Health and Human Services</a> (HHS) obviating its provisions or enforcement; </li><br />
<li>Congressional <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/10/us/politics/marco-rubio-obamacare-affordable-care-act.html; http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2016/11/14/insurers-risk-corridor-payment-claims-dismissed-new-aca-reg-from-osha/">funding restrictions</a> or limits; </li><br />
<li>state-based decisions to deny citizens' Medicaid coverage despite billions of dollars of federal support; and </li><br />
<li>crafty maneuvers by insurers and providers to raise insurance premiums and costs even while covering millions more than ever before.   </li><br />
</ul><br />
The full impact of the ACA as originally designed is unknown, as its full provisions were never completely in force, nor will they ever be in the future. In a strategy best described by Republican Senator Susan Collins,  ME, as a "<a href="http://www.pressherald.com/2017/01/17/sens-collins-cassidy-to-offer-obamacare-replacement/">death spiral</a>," President Trump's administration and Congress are working in real-time to obliterate the ACA entirely or dismantle it piece by piece, with no meaningful substitute in its stead (at least for the moment).   </p>

<p>On January 12, 2017, former Republican Presidential rival, Senator Ted Cruz, R-TX, introduced <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/106?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22%5C%22affordable+care+act%5C%22%22%5D%7D&r=1">Senate Bill 106</a> to repeal the ACA in its entirety. On January 23, Senator Bill Cassidy, R-LA, and Senator Collins introduced the <a href="http://www.cassidy.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/One Pager (1.20.17) (002).pdf">Patient Freedom Act,</a>, which presented 3 options for states to consider: <br />
<ol type="1" style="line-height:1.2;padding-left: 30px;"><br />
<li>"maintain status quo," continuing to operate under ACA's key provisions;</li><br />
<li>"go rogue," essentially regulating insurance markets without federal assistance; or </li><br />
<li>"take the money," receiving 95% of federal funding for premium tax credits and cost sharing subsidies plus the federal match for Medicaid expansion.</li><br />
</ol><br />
How or whether these reforms would work if states split evenly on the 3 options is unclear. Meanwhile, Senator Rand Paul, R-KY, introduced <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/222?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22%5C%22affordable+care+act%5C%22%22%5D%7D&r=4">Senate Bill 222</a> on January 24 to repeal the ACA and replace it with some reforms of private health insurance. Representative Gregg Harper, R-MS, seeks to turn back the clock. His sponsored Resolution, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/633?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22%5C%22affordable+care+act%5C%22%22%5D%7D&r=2">H.R. 633</a>, would authorize health insurers to continue offering plans similar to those issued prior to the ACA's enactment. Multiple <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/01/24/key-house-committee-will-take-up-first-obamacare-replacement-bills-next-week/?utm_term=.01a8293110d0">Congressional committees</a> promise additional proposals by the end of January. <br />
<strong><br />
A Smorgasbord of "Quick Fix" Replacements<br />
</strong><br />
The imminent, political death of the ACA has generated several legislative replacement options of varying degrees of scope, breadth and potential impact.  None proposes to replace the ACA with equally comprehensive health care reforms. Reports suggest President Trump is working closely with HHS' Secretary nominee <a href="https://tomprice.house.gov/">Tom Price</a> and Congressional leaders on legislation with the goal of "<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-vows-insurance-for-everybody-in-obamacare-replacement-plan/2017/01/15/5f2b1e18-db5d-11e6-ad42-f3375f271c9c_story.html?utm_term=.b02ba2a53c77">insurance for everybody</a>." This is a lofty claim, as not even the ACA managed to guarantee it.</p>

<p>Current replacement options include a litany of quick fixes to retain the ACA's more popular measures, remedy fiscal issues or repair existing deficiencies.  These include plans to:<br />
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;line-height:1.2;padding-left: 40px;"><br />
<li>continue coverage of dependents through age 26 on their guardian's health plans (<a href="https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/011117 Baldwin Dependent Coverage Amend_BAI17074.pdf">S.Amdt.81 to S.Con.Res3</a>);</li><br />
<li>repeal the annual fee on health insurers (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/246?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22%5C%22affordable+care+act%5C%22+%5C%22repeal%5C%22%22%5D%7D&r=3">H.R. 246</a>);</li><br />
<li>return unobligated federal funds in the implementation of state health insurance exchanges (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/640?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22%5C%22affordable+care+act%5C%22%22%5D%7D&r=1">H.R. 640</a>);</li><br />
<li>create a safe harbor for defendants in medical malpractice actions who demonstrate adherence to clinical practice guidelines (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/277?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22%5C%22affordable+care+act%5C%22+%5C%22repeal%5C%22%22%5D%7D&r=4">H.R. 277</a>);</li><br />
<li>reinstate IRS allowances for expenses for over-the-counter drugs under health savings accounts and flexible spending arrangements (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/85?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22%5C%22affordable+care+act%5C%22%22%5D%7D&r=1">S.85</a>);</li><br />
<li>prohibit federal funding for health coverage of abortions (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/7?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22%5C%22affordable+care+act%5C%22%22%5D%7D&r=4">H.R. 7</a>); and</li><br />
<li>prohibit health insurance denials based on pre-existing conditions (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/628?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22%5C%22affordable+care+act%5C%22%22%5D%7D&r=3">H.R. 628</a>).</li><br />
</ul><br />
While the collective viability of these patchwork approaches is questionable, some may be more popular than others. For example, preventing health insurance companies from denying applicants coverage based on their pre-existing conditions is applauded by nearly everyone, except health insurers. </p>

<p>Over <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2017/01/05/new-analysis-uninsured-rate-americans-pre-existing-conditions-dropped-sharply-when-major-affordable">50%</a> of Americans have some sort of pre-existing condition, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/22/business/president-donald-trump-health-insurance-high-risk-pool.html">27%</a> of persons under 65 years old who are largely ineligible for Medicare. Health insurance executives have little incentive to cover these higher risk patients. For decades, they could lawfully "<a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2009/0713/health-obama-insurance-hmo-cherry-picking.html">cherry pick</a>" among available customers. Unless insuring these persons is counterbalanced with a pool of healthy persons (which was the impetus for the ACA's employer and individual mandate provisions), health insurance companies will disdain "pre-existing" coverage requirements.  </p>

<p>To address this reality, more comprehensive replacement approaches include the return of the "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/22/business/president-donald-trump-health-insurance-high-risk-pool.html">high risk pool</a>" concept originally floated in the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffsmedsrud/2016/11/28/when-everything-old-is-new-again/#e3031255534e">Clinton</a> administration. If the sickest individuals are cloistered in their own pool for specific, government-subsidized insurance, healthy persons outside the pool could obtain cheaper health coverage. It is nice idea, but flawed in practice. As the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/22/business/president-donald-trump-health-insurance-high-risk-pool.html">reported</a> on January 23, states like California, Colorado and Washington that operated high risk pools in the past ran into major fiscal and other dilemmas.  <br />
<strong><br />
Medicaid: From Expansion to Retraction<br />
</strong><br />
Additional replacement strategies center on the flailing Medicaid expansion program built into the ACA but bootstrapped by the US Supreme Court and resulting state refusals to participate. In <span class="casename"><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11973730494168859869&q=nfib+v+sebelius&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">NFIB v. Sebelius</a></span> in 2012, the Court found that federal spending conditions tacked onto the ACA's Medicaid expansion initiative were unconstitutional. As a result, only <a href="http://kff.org/health-reform/slide/current-status-of-the-medicaid-expansion-decision/">32 states</a> signed up for expanded Medicaid, despite enormous federal subsidies to pay for it.  </p>

<p>On January 24, Senator Tom Price, R-GA, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/us/politics/tom-price-nominee-secretary-of-health-and-human-services.html">suggested</a> in his HHS Secretary confirmation hearing that "every single individual ought to be able to have access to coverage" via Medicaid. Yet, outright repeal of the ACA means the end of Medicaid expansion for all. In its place, multiple state governors, several Congressional members and President Trump have proposed Medicaid "block grant" <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/22/us/politics/donald-trump-health-plan-medicaid.html?hpw&rref=health&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=well-region&region=bottom-well&WT.nav=bottom-well&_r=1">programs</a>. Massive lump sums would be handed to states to expand and run their Medicaid programs as they see fit.  </p>

<p>Again, a neat idea, but messy in application. Block grants may appeal to states seeking more control, but would likely contribute to increased, widespread variations in Medicaid services and benefits. Colorado's Democratic Governor John Hickenlooper <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/22/us/politics/donald-trump-health-plan-medicaid.html">suggested</a> such block grants would "force us to make impossible choices in our Medicaid program." Millions of state residents who previously qualified for ACA-supported Medicaid expansion benefits might see their coverage curtailed or denied outright. Furthermore, how long will Congress, intent on reducing federal deficits, dump hundreds of billions of dollars into state-based health programs? In 2016, Congress struggled for months to approve a mere $1 billion for <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2841742">Zika preparedness</a> efforts. <br />
<strong><br />
The Future Under Trumpcare<br />
</strong><br />
President Trump may forever be known not so much for what he and his administration did, but what they undid. Crafting and passing the ACA was the product of decades-long work. It is a complicated piece of federal legislation that works to meld access to quality care with patients' choices of providers while attempting to control costs. The ACA is not perfect by any stretch, but <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/01/23/can-president-trumps-executive-order-unravel-the-affordable-care-act/?utm_term=.f99d803d81f6">unraveling</a> and replacing it may prove to be the greatest challenge of a new President in his first elected office. </p>

<p>As Professors Gostin, Hyman and Jacobson surmise in their <a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2588839">JAMA commentary</a> first published online in November 2016, "the goal should be to ensure that all individuals--sick or healthy, poor or well-off--receive the care they need." Absent meaningful replacement strategies, quick, cobbled and inadequate fixes will result. </p>

<p>The timing underlying the emergence of Trumpcare could not be worse. Americans stand to lose access to basic health services and essential public health funding just as threats of communicable diseases like Zika, chronic conditions like Alzheimers, injuries related to guns and opiate abuse and unhealthy environments affected by global climate change are on the rise. National health care costs will likely escalate. Left by the wayside may be millions of Americans who can only dream of a time when they too had access to quality, affordable health care.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.gmu.edu/faculty/directory/fulltime/malcolm_joyce">Joyce Lee Malcolm</a> of <a href="http://www.law.gmu.edu/">George Mason University Antonin Scalia Law School</a> discusses the impact that a recent court opinion will have on Chicago residents and their Second Amendment rights...</p><em>This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof...shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.</em> <u>US Constitution, Article VI</u></p>

<p><strong>N</strong>early seven years after the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=mcdonald+v+city+of+chicago&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&case=5141154246897960488&scilh=0">US Supreme Court overturned Chicago's strict ban on handguns</a> and affirmed the Second Amendment right of law-abiding Americans to keep and bear guns for their protection, few of the people of Chicago are able to exercise their right. In the face of the appalling violence in Chicago before and since that ruling&#8212over <a href="http://crime.chicagotribune.com/chicago/shootings">3800 people shot</a> last year and a <a href="http://crime.chicagotribune.com/chicago/homicides">58% increase in homicides</a>&#8212Chicago's mayor and City Council continue to defy the landmark Second Amendment cases of <em><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=district+of+columbia+v+heller&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&case=2739870581644084946&scilh=0">District of Columbia v. Heller</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=mcdonald+v+city+of+chicago&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&case=5141154246897960488&scilh=0">McDonald v. City of Chicago</a></em> and permit residents to keep guns for protection. On January 18, 2017, however, the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in <em><a href="/paperchase/2017/01/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-chicago-gun-range-restrictions.php">Ezell v. City of Chicago (Ezell II)</a></em>, put the people of Chicago one small step closer to gaining their constitutional right to be armed.</p>

<p>This has been a long, and costly struggle for petitioners, for the city and especially for all its law-abiding residents. Just four days after the Supreme Court overturned the city's strict ban on handguns in <em>McDonald</em>, Mayor Daley and the Council <a href="https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2010/july_2010/0701_supreme_ct_gun.html">issued regulations</a> designed to make it as difficult as possible for a resident to have a gun. Added to the requirement for an Illinois firearms permit the new Chicago regulations required that the applicant pass a police background check, a 4-hour class, and spend one hour at a gun range, although ranges were banned in Chicago. Gun shops were also banned in the city as were all firearm sales. When transported, every firearm had to be broken down, unloaded and in a case, making it useless for self-defense. Only one working gun could be kept in the home. The gun had to be registered within 5 days of purchase with payment of a $100 fee and needed to be re-registered annually with seizure and fines for any failure to re-register. Should a resident manage to negotiate these hurdles, he or she could not take the gun outside their home, even to their garage or porch.</p>

<p>A long series of law suits have followed in an effort to gain Chicago residents the constitutional right that the Supreme Court claimed was theirs. The first round of the present case, <em><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=ezell+v+city+of+chicago&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&case=17044109654189761463&scilh=0">Ezell v. Chicago</a></em>, was decided a year after <em>McDonald</em>, when the Seventh Circuit reversed the ban on shooting ranges in the City of Chicago, refuting the city's claim that the ban was lawful since gun ranges existed outside the city. The Court pointed out that "Chicago could not infringe Second Amendment rights on the grounds that they could be exercised elsewhere any more than it could infringe the right to freedom of speech on the grounds that citizens could speak elsewhere."  </p>

<p>In <em><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=moore+v+madison&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&case=10665754353092136977&scilh=0">Moore v. Madison</a></em> in December, 2012, the Court of Appeals forced Illinois to allow law-abiding residents to carry a concealed weapon. In 2014 District Judge Edmond Chang found Chicago's <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Illinois+Association+of+Firearms+Retailers+v+chicago&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&case=4270257349227803671&scilh=0">ban on gun shops and on the sale and transfer of firearms unconstitutional</a>. While conceding the government has a duty to protect its citizens, the judge insisted it is also obligated to protect constitutional rights, including the right to keep and bear arms for self-defense.</p>

<p>Now comes an opinion in <em>Ezell II</em>. After the ban on gun ranges was struck down in 2011, the city amended its scheme four times, ultimately crafting a zoning rule that no range could be within 100 feet of another range or 500 feet of any district zoned for residential use or planned residential use, or any preschool, day-care facility, place of worship, liquor retailer, children's activities facility, library, museum or hospital. That left only about 2.2% of the city's total area, small manufacturing districts, even theoretically available. Further, no one under 18 was to enter a shooting range, should one actually be established. </p>

<p>The city argued that firing ranges attract gun thieves, cause airborne lead contamination and carry a risk of fire. Judge Sykes writing for the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals pointed out in its January reversal, that the city "provided no evidentiary support for these claims." Indeed their own witness admitted she had not conducted an investigation, or consulted any expert or knew of any evidence to support the city's assertions. The judges concluded that she "essentially did no research at all." In fact, law-enforcement and private-security firing ranges are operating throughout Chicago quite safely. </p>

<p>Nor did the city fare better with the age restriction to meet its burden that a person under the age of 18 be prohibited from a range. That rule, Judge Sykes explained, extinguishes "even the right of older adolescents and teens to receive adult-supervised firearm instruction in the controlled setting of a firing range." The city's witness, Commissioner Krimbel, agreed that shooting ranges are a "good place" to teach a youngster "how to fire a rifle," adding that his son had taken a shooting class when he was 12.</p>

<p>In striking down restrictions making it practically impossible to establish a shooting range in Chicago and the age restriction on entering a shooting range, Judge Sykes reminded the Chicago government of Justice Alito's caution in <em>McDonald</em>, against treating the Second Amendment as "a second-class right, subject to an entirely different body of rules than the other Bill of rights Guarantees."  </p>

<p>The law-abiding people of Chicago have been ill served by the city government's insistence on flaunting the Supreme Court opinions, attempting to circumvent the Appeals Court decisions, and effectively denying residents their constitutional right and ability to protect themselves in the lawless environment in which they live.</p>

		<title>Muslim Ban or Otherwise: Should a Bureaucrat Resign in Protest?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href=http://www.utoledo.edu/law/news/2015/prof-davis-appointed-to-american-bar-association-standing-committee.html>Benjamin G. Davis</a> of University of Toledo College of Law discusses the recent turmoil over the changes in the Trump administration... </p>

<p><strong>W</strong>ith the recent turmoil of the Monday Night Massacre (firing of the Acting Attorney General <a href="http://nypost.com/2017/01/30/trump-fires-acting-ag-for-defying-immigration-ban/">Sally Yates</a> and the firing of the Acting ICE Director <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jan/30/daniel-ragsdale-acting-director-immigration-enforc/">Daniel Ragsdale</a>) coupled with the dissent by members of the Foreign Service to the Trump Muslim Ban Executive Order, the <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/white-house-to-state-department-dissenters-quit?mbid=nl_013117_Daily&CNDID=24101147&spMailingID=10338194&spUserID=MTMzMTgyMzIxNTkxS0&spJobID=1082574209&spReportId=MTA4MjU3NDIwOQS2">response</a> of the current Administration is to tell those bureaucrats to quit  or get on the "<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/rex-tillerson-stresses-unity-in-speech-to-state-department-employees-1486053932">one team</a>." <br />
 <br />
In addition to the plight of said bureaucrats one can think about the plight of top officials who are being portrayed in two ways: either as having been out of the loop ( Secretary of Defense <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-james-mattis-override-torture-2017-1">Mattis</a>, <a href="http://time.com/4655017/the-homeland-security-secretary-said-president-trumps-visa-ban-wasnt-a-surprise/">Secretary of Homeland Security Kelly</a>, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Pompeo, and the nominee for Secretary of State Tillerson) or being overruled (at least for a period of time) by a couple of Presidential assistants (Stephen Miller and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/29/us/stephen-bannon-donald-trump-national-security-council.html?_r=0">Stephen Bannon</a>). Either way these top officials are put in the unenviable position of being humiliated as being mere figureheads in their offices, rather than as engaged senior leaders of the Trump Administration.<br />
 <br />
For those who disagree with a policy and/or the manner in which they are being treated, should they resign in protest? <br />
 <br />
History suggests that if you ever want to work again at a high level in Washington, DC, one better not resign in protest. This view is based on a wonderful somewhat dated book done by the late New York University <a href="http://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/ECM_PRO_062143.pdf">Professor Thomas Franck</a> and Director of International Studies and Associate Professor of Political Science at the State University of New York at Binghamton Edward Weisband entitled <a href="https://books.google.co.nz/books/about/Resignation_in_protest.html?id=IRBIAQAAIAAJ">Resignation in protest: Political and ethical choices between loyalty to team and loyalty to conscience in American public life</a> (Grossman Publishers 1975).<br />
 <br />
The authors examined cases of individuals at the breaking point: protest resignations compelled by unbearable misgivings as well as top officials who disagree profoundly with key government policies but who keep silent, placing loyalty to the team or careerism ahead of loyalty to principle and to the public. It is a reflection on the costs of a system based above all on the value of "team play." <br />
 <br />
The authors noted that "The person who sacrifices team loyalty in order to pursue a competing value, such as integrity, is likely to have brought to bear against him the coercive weight of that society's historically conditioned sense of self-preservation. Societies, groups, organizations systematize the process of making value-judgments. Indeed, they systematize the very process of perceiving reality."<br />
 <br />
After a review of a number of cases spanning the 20th century up to that point, they conclude that "the historic record indicates that ostracism, rather than respectability, is the probable reward for ethical autonomy." <br />
 <br />
Given that ostracism, it appears fairly obvious that calls for resignations in protest in our governmental culture are calls to ask people to commit the equivalent of political suicide without any assurance that they will be rewarded for their ethical autonomy. Our system does not tolerate such acts of rebellion.<br />
 <br />
On the other hand, if one feels compelled to resign, the more quiet resignation with some anodyne statement (for health reasons, to spend more time with one's family) and &#8212; most importantly no hint of dispute &#8212; is the acceptable route. The power of the resignation seems to come in what is unsaid rather than what is said.<br />
 <br />
The authors' recipe is that we should as a polity lower the costs the ordinarily ambitious political aspirant must pay to have, and to manifest, a healthy amount of ethical autonomy. And these costs would certainly be less "if the public were to decide to lower them: by respecting the dissident, the man or woman who refuses to subordinate his conscience or his duty to the public, and by weighing thoughtfully what he has to say, rewarding or punishing in accordance with the social importance and the political validity of his or her dissent."<br />
 <br />
"Vietnam and Watergate: the names are synonymous with insufficiently fettered Presidential discretion. If America is ever to construct a working system of checks and balances within the executive branch, it will have to revise its judgment of those who exercise their option to 'exit' with 'voice.' It will have to excuse, and even reward, that disloyalty to a President which bespeaks a higher loyalty to the democratic system." The authors contrasted us with the British approach and found us wanting.<br />
 <br />
So how do we free our minds?<br />
 <br />
One path to that way of thinking is to stop the confusion in our culture between the individual serving as President and the Presidency. When I was working on a project for the late Vincent Bugliosi on the possibility of a prosecution in California State Courts of former President George Bush  for murder and conspiracy to commit murder with respect to taking us to War in Iraq on false pretenses, one of the first things I found I needed to do was to unlearn the received wisdom that the President's and the Presidency's powers are coterminous. The hypothetical I used to open my mind was to imagine that the President of the United States was selling crack cocaine out of the Oval Office for what he/she said was national security reasons.  Would such a President be immune to prosecution for such actions? Back to President Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon we can see that the individual elected President could incur criminal liability for those acts done while President that were beyond the pale of the President's constitutional or statutory powers.<br />
 <br />
Contrast the quiet resignation, the resignation in protest, with the kind of spectacular firing that we have seen this week. In particular let us think of the case of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/us/politics/sally-yates-trump-immigration-ban.html">Acting Attorney General Sally Yates </a>who no doubt knew that once she had decided to make public her memo she was going to be fired. Her memo remains part of the work of a person in the role rather than some after the fact statement. The authors suggest that as a culture her going public is not rewarded.<br />
 <br />
On the other hand, whether rewarded or not, a firing can be a badge of honor (<a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/la-ol-the-saturday-night-massacre-20170130-htmlstory.html">Archibald Cox</a> by President Richard Nixon who went back to academia) or of shame ("Scooter" Libby , Michael D. "Heckuva job Brownie" Brown by President George Bush). Firings are about causing violence to a person and asserting control over a polity through this act of violence. Time will tell how the Sally Yates and <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jan/30/daniel-ragsdale-acting-director-immigration-enforc/">Daniel Ragsdale</a> firings will be perceived.<br />
 <br />
So at least based on Franck and Weisband, top officials and/or bureaucrats should not resign in protest because we do not as a culture tolerate that kind of activity. They should resign quietly for anodyne reasons, make their disagreements private as opposed to public, and suffer the consequences of being fired for their passionate internal dissent. <br />
 <br />
They should not quit in protest. I am not underestimating the difficulty of their position, but maybe persons should remember what my late father (a Foreign Service Officer) once said to me, "I have served six Presidents." Meaning, at least for the bureaucrats if not the top officials, these folks too shall pass.<br />
 <br />
Just sayin'.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.law.whittier.edu/index/meet-the-faculty/profile/i.-nelson-rose">I. Nelson Rose</a> of <a href="https://www.law.whittier.edu/index">Whittier Law School</a> discusses a recent Supreme Court opinion concerning sports betting in the United States...</p><strong>I</strong>n a surprise move, the US Supreme Court blew a little life into the dying embers of state-authorized sports betting. New Jersey has been trying unsuccessfully for years to overcome a federal law that prevents the state from allowing its casinos and racetracks to take bets on sporting events. Rather than just deny cert., the <a href="paperchase/2017/01/supreme-court-seeks-incoming-administrations-views-in-new-jersey-sports-betting-case.php">high Court asked the Solicitor General</a> of the US to file a brief. Proponents rejoiced at the reprieve. But the odds of New Jersey winning this bet are slim indeed.</p>

<p>The state's problem is the federal <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/part-VI/chapter-178">Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act</a>. Although PASPA is one of the most radical federal laws ever enacted, it has been consistently upheld by the courts.</p>

<p>PASPA is the only statute ever passed by Congress which prevents states from legalizing a form of betting. Because states, and not the federal government, have always had the sole power to determine what they want their public policies to be toward gambling within their borders, the statute is an open affront to "Our Federalism." But the State Legislature and their lawyers have not been able to figure out how to get a court to recognize that.</p>

<p>PASPA makes it unlawful for "a governmental entity to . . . authorize by law" any form of gambling based on real-world sports events. It grandfathered-in a half-a-dozen states that had some sports betting in 1991.</p>

<p>The issue of gambling should be one of the easiest questions to answer under Our Federalism. Gambling falls under the states' police power. This is the right, and obligation, of local governments to protect the health, safety, welfare and morality of their residents.</p>

<p>There has never been any doubt that gambling has always been a state police power issue. The federal government only becomes involved when the U.S. Constitution gives Congress and not the states the exclusive power over an issue, as with Indian gaming, or when the states ask the central government for help. PASPA changed all that for sports betting.</p>

<p><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Office+of+the+Commissioner+of+Baseball+v.+Markell&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&case=7273375532251852934&scilh=0">Federal courts ruled</a> that even states that had sports betting could not change their games. The Delaware Lottery was stuck with parlay bets, and could not start taking straight head-to-head bets like Nevada sports books do, because it didn't offer that particular form of sports betting during the magic years. </p>

<p>New Jersey first tried a direct attack on PASPA. The <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/New_Jersey_Sports_Betting_Amendment,_Public_Question_1_(2011)">state's voters amended</a> the State Constitution and the Legislature enacted a complete regulatory system.</p>

<p>PASPA is also the first Act of Congress giving private organizations the power to <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/3703">enforce a federal law against a state</a>. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Seminole+Tribe+of+Florida+v.+Florida&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&case=12335683590877160073&scilh=0">States cannot be sued without their consent</a>. If a state cannot be sued by an Indian tribe or its own state employees, it is unclear why suits by amateur and professional sports organizations should be allowed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, when the system was attacked by the NCAA, NFL and other sports leagues, the big question of whether the federal government could invade an area reserved to the states was lost in an <a href="http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/glre.2014.18102">esoteric discussion of commandeering</a>. It is not surprising that the state lost in the trial court and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=christie+paspa+2012&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&case=5051117760751020929&scilh=0">court of appeal</a>, since almost no one had ever heard of the anti-commandeering doctrine, and the US Supreme Court had only used it twice in 250 years to invalidate a federal law.</p>

<p>Proponents then tried an end-run. Instead of creating a system to regulate betting on sports events, the L<a href="http://www.gambling-law-us.com/State-Laws/New-Jersey/">egislature passed a statute repealing</a> all of the state's anti-sports-gambling laws!</p>

<p>This would have created interesting problems for federal prosecutors, since almost all anti-racketeering laws require that there be a violation of state anti-gambling laws. I asked an F.B.I. agent at the time how many federal investigations were pending involving violations of New Jersey state anti-sports-betting laws. He said there were three.</p>

<p>Of course, the New Jersey statute only repealed the state's prohibitions on sports pools in licensed casinos and racetracks.</p>

<p>The easy answer to this attempted end-run would have been to look at the reality of how state-licensed gambling operations are regulated. It is impossible to believe that the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, a part of the State Attorney General's office, would allow known organized crime figures to set up sports pools among the slot machines in Atlantic City.</p>

<p><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Glusman&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&case=4961744918922081090&scilh=0">The Nevada Supreme Court has ruled</a> that state gaming regulators could require the owner of a dress shop to be examined for suitability. Planet Hollywood <a href="http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/glre.2010.14102">had to pay a large fine and agree</a> to police a private nightclub on the casino's grounds. </p>

<p>If a casino and its state regulators were not responsible for activities taking place in the casino, what would sports betting in Atlantic City look like? If the 2014 Act truly eliminated all laws and regulations related to sports betting, then anyone could take a bet from anyone else on a sports event. That might be acceptable. But if a company wanted to set up a sports book, it would have to be treated like any other retail business that wished to operate on the casino floor. If a casino has an agreement with Burger King, it is not going to sit by if McDonalds tries to set up a competing operation in the casino building. Any sports book would have to have the approval of the casino's executives. And those executives would have to report the operation to state regulators. The regulators in turn would have to investigate and oversee the sports book, to ensure that the casino company was not doing business with individuals who were unsuitable.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Court of Appeals once again got hung up in technicalities. The end-run was ruled to still violate PASPA, because it pretty blatantly was actually authorizing sports betting in the state's casinos and tracks. But the panels have been split, because another esoteric question had been raised: If a legislature truly does repeal all of its laws in an area, is that the same as if those laws had never existed?</p>

<p>The legal mess was reheard en banc. The majority, again, decided that the State Legislature could call this a repeal; but, the reality was it was authorizing sports betting with restrictions, such as not being able to bet on New Jersey teams, and only in a few licensed locations.</p>

<p>So, why is the US Supreme Court considering hearing the case. Asking the Solicitor General to submit a brief usually indicates the Court wants to know how the federal government construes a federal law. Here, the question is probably whether PASPA does require states to act to outlaw sports betting.</p>

<p>The Court will probably read whatever brief is submitted and deny cert. This end-run law in this case too clearly does authorize sports betting in violation of PASPA.</p>

<p>But there is a slim chance that the high Court will see that there really is a bigger issue involved. The <a href="https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I93fceef9ad0411e6b92bf4314c15140f/View/FullText.html?listSource=Foldering&originationContext=clientid&transitionType=MyResearchHistoryItem&contextData=%28oc.RelatedInfo%29&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0">amicus brief</a> from the American Gaming Association, the lobbying group for casinos, has raised "The fundamental legal question . . . whether a federal court can, consistent with federalism and dual sovereignty, enjoin a State from passing a law that neither violates the Constitution nor addresses any matter preempted by federal law."  Congress cannot order a state to outlaw sports betting. Does it have the power to prevent that same state from changing the state laws it does have?</p>

<p>There is also the issue of discrimination in favor of those few states that were grandfathered-in and can have sports betting.</p>

<p>If Congress had outlawed movies with sound in 1929, would there now be only a few states with "talkies"?</p>

		<title>The Senate&amp;apos;s Role in the Confirmation of Executive Officials</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.samford.edu/cumberlandlaw/directory/Ross-William-G">William G. Ross</a> of the <a href="https://www.samford.edu/cumberlandlaw/">Cumberland School of Law at Samford University</a> discusses the role of the Senate in the confirmation of executive nominees under the new administration... </p>

<p><strong>C</strong>ontroversies involving many of the persons nominated by President Trump to lead major executive agencies provide an important reminder of the Senate's robust constitutional role to provide "Advice and Consent" in connection with the appointment of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/cabinet">Cabinet</a> members and other executive officers.  The <a href="https://www.senate.gov/">Senate</a>'s role is dynamic even when, as now, most senators are members of the president's political party. Although the Senate's consideration of executive appointments generates at least some friction at the beginning of every new Administration, some of President Trump's nominees may further roil the already turbulent period of transition.</p>

<p>The Senate's scrutiny of such nominations has traditionally involved consideration of professional qualifications, temperament and character, conflicts of interest and ideology. The Senate has also considered whether a nominee is sufficiently sensitive toward the doctrine of separation of powers, and would respect the prerogatives of <a href="http://www.house.gov/">Congress </a>even while serving as a member of the President's "team." All of these factors have become particularly prominent in the Senate's scrutiny of Trump's nominees. </p>

<p>In previous Administrations, qualifications rarely have been an issue since most nominees had stellar experience and credentials.  This year, however, the Senate is taking a closer look at qualifications since a uniquely high proportion of Trump's appointees, like Trump himself, have no previous experience in government.  Even the nominees to lead the <a href="https://www.state.gov/">State </a>and <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Treasury </a>Departments, Rex W. Tillerson and Steven Mnuchin respectively, have never held public office. The only nominees who have extensive experience in federal posts are Elaine Chao, who served eight years as Secretary of Labor during the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/presidents/georgehwbush">George H.W. Bush Administration</a>, and Jefferson B. Sessions, a US senator for the past twenty years. Although most of the nominees who lack any record of public service have had glittering careers in the private sector &#8212; Tillerson, for example, was CEO of <a href="http://corporate.exxonmobil.com/">Exxon Mobil</a> &#8212;  some senators question whether success in business translates into the ability to successfully direct the politically and socially sensitive operations of large federal agencies. Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland told Tillerson that "those who suggest that anyone who can run a successful business can, of course, run a government agency do a profound disservice to both." </p>

<p>Thus far, most of the nominees, including those who lack government experience, generally appear to have convinced senators and other observers that they have an ample comprehension of the issues that their departments would address and an ability to manage large bureaucracies. Tillerson, for example, demonstrated a sophisticated and nuanced understanding of international affairs that surprised some of his critics. Some nominees, however, may not have fared so well. The New York Times characterized the testimonies of Elisabeth "Betsy" DeVos (<a href="https://www.ed.gov/">Education</a>), E. Scott Pruitt (<a href="https://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a>) and Thomas E. Price (<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/">Health and Human Services</a>) as "a cavalcade of misstatements, lapses of judgment, conflicts of interest and from time to time spectacular displays of ignorance and insensitivity." </p>

<p>Conflict of interest issues are more prominent and complex in the present confirmation process because perhaps no bundle of nominees in history have had such extensive financial holdings or such far-flung business connections. Two Cabinet nominees, DeVos and Wilbur L. Ross, Jr. (<a href="https://www.commerce.gov/">Commerce</a>), are multi-billionaires. (By comparison, the wealthiest member of Congress is worth an estimated $440 million and the median net worth of members is one million dollars). Tillerson's business contacts with Russia have attracted particular scrutiny, and senators also have expressed concern because Price is heavily invested in health care securities. The Senate's review and analysis of complex financial holdings have slowed the confirmation process, and the gargantuan wealth of so many nominees is likely to permit more conflicts of interest to pass unnoticed or unquestioned because the Senate may lack time and resources to delve deeply into details.</p>

<p>In addition to identifying potential financial conflicts, the Senate also tries to determine whether nominees have any personal conflicts that could hinder their ability to discharge their duties. The absence of such conflict is especially important in an <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag">Attorney General</a>, who as the nation's chief law enforcement officer is expected to administer the law without prejudice. The <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> therefore devoted particular scrutiny to the nomination of Sessions, whose critics questioned his attitudes toward the rights of African Americans. Sessions' deft defense of his record on racial issues and assurances of his commitment to racial equality appear to have disarmed his detractors. Sessions also told senators that he would recuse himself from decisions regarding Hillary Clinton's emails or the <a href="https://www.clintonfoundation.org/">Clinton Foundation</a> because of critical statements about them that he has made. 			</p>

<p>Although conflict of interest issues has been a traditional staple of confirmation hearings, potential conflicts in the past almost always have involved the nominee herself. This year, senators are using the confirmation hearings to identify and try to remedy potential conflicts between government departments and the president, whose vast financial interests generate an unprecedented potential for conflicts of interest. Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio succeeded in obtaining a pledge from Benjamin Carson (<a href="https://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD">Department of Housing and Urban Development</a>) to develop a system for identifying properties that were tied both to Trump and to the Department. Similarly, Mnuchin assured senators that the Treasury Department would help to ensure that Trump would conform to both the law and ethics in managing his extensive assets.<br />
	<br />
Another unprecedented aspect of this year's confirmation process is the extent to which nominees have espoused policy positions that may be at odds with those of the president. Although conflict between a nominee and the president traditionally would be a factor that weighed against confirmation insofar as it would augur conflicts that could impede a smooth and successful administration, some of Trump's positions are so unpopular even with many Republican senators that such deviations may work in favor of nominees. </p>

<p>Tillerson, for example, distanced himself from Trump's controversial remark during the campaign that the United States should defend its allies only if they paid their fair share of defense costs. Unlike Trump, Tillerson expressed support for sanctions against Russia for its incursion into Ukraine. He also appeared more receptive the possibility of climate change than has Trump, stating that "the risk of climate change does exist and the consequences of it could be serious enough that actions should be taken."  Tillerson aligned himself, however, with some of Trump's hardline positions toward China and Iran.  </p>

<p>Similarly, Pruitt expressed disagreement with Trump's characterization of climate change as a "hoax," and Sessions expressed opposition to Trump's proposals for creating a registry of American Muslims and banning Muslim immigrants, while supporting Trump's advocacy of stricter scrutiny of immigrants. Mnuchin's apparent advocacy of a strong dollar seemed at odds with Trump's recent suggestion that the dollar may be overvalued. And James Mattis distanced himself from Trump's suggestions that the United States reject the nuclear accord with Iran. </p>

<p>Confirmation hearings also provide senators with an opportunity to measure the character of nominees. This, too, may be more important during this year's hearings because so many of the nominees have no record of experience in government and are strangers to the senators. Demonstration of fair-mindedness, caution and a willingness to learn may go far toward assuaging apprehensions about ideology or lack of qualifications. Tillerson, who was trained as an engineer, repeatedly expressed hesitation to respond to questions because he explained that he would need more information to reach a conclusion. This caution and an insistence upon the importance of factual analysis may have re-assured senators that Tillerson has the kind of circumspect temperament that is desirable in any government official, particularly one who directs the nation's foreign policy. This may be a particularly attractive quality in Tillerson, who could serve as a counterweight to the more mercurial Trump.<br />
 <br />
Consideration of political ideology, always important in confirmation hearings, may be even more prominent than usual this year since several of Trump's nominees, particularly DeVos and Price, favor policies that may conflict with the traditions of the departments that they have been nominated to lead. The extent to which senators may properly use ideology as a criteria in deciding whether to confirm executive officers is a matter of perennial controversy among senators and scholars. Some contend that the Senate should defer heavily to the President's choice because the President has a mandate from the people to select administrators who favor the President's policies. Others favor more robust scrutiny, pointing out that senators, too, have a mandate from to promote the political views of the voters who elected them. A considerable level of deference is necessary because one hundred senators could never agree upon the ideal candidate to lead any executive department. Moreover, constraints of time and resources necessarily limit the level of scrutiny to which senators may subject nominees, particularly at the start of a new presidential administration, when the Senate must review so many nominations. <br />
	<br />
As the late Senator Henry M. Jackson of Washington explained many years ago, "these are the President's men and he is entitled to have them, barring some flagrant effort or abuse of his prerogatives in making his nominations." Similarly, Senator John H. Glenn once remarked that "faith and trust in key subordinates can have an important bearing on the efficiency and effectiveness of government." </p>

<p>The Senate, however, still needs to conduct a careful and independent review of nominees because executive officials are responsible not only to the President, but also to Congress and the people. As Louis Fisher, a leading expert on separation of powers, has observed, "[d]epartment heads and their assistants are not mere staff support for the President. They are called upon to administer programs that Congress has enacted into law." The Senate therefore has a duty to assure itself that the nominees are sensitive to the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution">Constitution</a>'s separation of powers.</p>

<p>The issue of separation of powers played a particularly prominent part in the hearings on Mattis, who emphasized during his testimony before the Armed Services Committee that Congress should actively participate in decisions regarding the military. Mattis's declaration that "congressional oversight and appropriations, authorizations, are a critical part of civilian control of the military," along with similar statements, help to explain why his nomination sailed through the committee and was confirmed by a vote of 98:1. </p>

<p>Senators and scholars tend to agree that the Senate particularly needs to ensure that the Attorney General will place his responsibility as the nation's chief law enforcement officer ahead of his loyalty to the President. Senate Judiciary Committee members generally seemed satisfied in this regard with Sessions, who assured the committee that the attorney general "cannot be a mere rubber stamp" for the president. </p>

<p>The presence of a Republican majority in the Senate ensures that the confirmation process will be far less bumpy than if Democrats had a majority, particularly since many of the nominees espouse political views that are practically anathema to many Democrats. For example, James Richard "Rick" Perry, the nominee to lead the Department of Energy, once advocated the abolition of the agency. Similarly, Pruitt, in his capacity as Oklahoma's attorney general, has repeatedly sued the EPA to reduce environmental and public health regulations. </p>

<p>Even though Democrats cannot alone prevent the nomination of controversial nominees, their questioning of nominees at committee hearings can help gauge the extent to which they want to expend precious time and energy in opposing a nominee. For example, Democrats grilled DeVos about her ardent support for school vouchers and charter schools, which her critics fear would undermine public schools. </p>

<p>Several of Trump's nominees have espoused such extreme positions at various times in their careers that they have tried to re-assure perhaps even Republican senators that their views today, at least, are more moderate. Representative John Michael Mulvaney, the nominee to serve as federal budget director, declared during his hearing that senators should not "read too much" into his past suggestions that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme. He averred during his testimony that he would not recommend curtailment of the benefits of present retirees, although he explained that he might favor raising the age for eligibility. Carson, a longtime critic of social welfare measures, assured senators that "[s]afety net programs are important. I would never advocate abolishing them without having an alternative for people to follow." </p>

<p>Senators who disagree with nominees on fundamental policy issues also have the opportunity at confirmation hearings to provide nominees, in a face-to-face setting, with information and admonitions that might help nominees to better understand and appreciate opinions with which they disagree. In doing so, senators help to discharge their duty to provide "advice" in connection with nominations, which may help to make executive officials more circumspect or moderate in their administration of the laws and shaping of public policy, even though such advice is unlikely to cause them to change their views about specific issues, much less alter their fundamental ideologies. During the hearings on Trump's nominees, for example, Democrats have urged nominees to be mindful of the hazards of climate change and the plight of economically-distressed Americans. This kind of inter-branch colloquy may be one of the most useful aspects of the Senate's role in the confirmation process. It also provides an educative function for the American people. </p>

<p>It is unlikely that the Senate will reject any nominees on the basis of their ideology, particularly since Republicans have 52 seats in the Senate because Senate Democrats in 2013 abolished a filibuster rule that permitted forty senators to block a vote on nominations. Indeed, the Senate's deference toward Cabinet nominees is so high that it has rejected only nine during the past 228 years, mostly on account of issues of character and conflict of interest.  Such issues might generate the withdrawal of nominees &#8212; one of President Obama's Cabinet nominees withdrew in 2009 because of failure to report income in a timely manner and another withdrew on account of allegations of influence peddling &#8212; but the hearings on Trump's nominees thus far have not disclosed any such serious defects in any nominees. </p>

<p>Even though the Senate seems likely to confirm all nominees, a robust confirmation process helps to ensure that executive officials conform to rigorous standards of character and ability. Vigorous and occasionally rambunctious confirmation proceedings also help to ensure that the political predilections of the officials who will administer the laws neither stray too far from the political preferences of the senators who help make those laws, nor  from the views of the voters who elected senators to advise the President about nominees and to offer &#8212; or withhold &#8212; consent. </p>

		<title>Judge Gorsuch Deserves Non-Partisan Consideration By Senate</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href=" https://www.samford.edu/cumberlandlaw/directory/Ross-William-G">William G. Ross</a> of Samford University's Cumberland School of Law discusses the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch... </p>

<p><strong>J</strong>udge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump's US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/trump-nominates-neil-gorsuch-to-supreme-court.php">nominee</a>, deserves full and fair consideration by Senate Democrats, even though those who are embittered by the refusal of Senate Republican leaders last year to conduct hearings on President Obama's nomination of Judge Merrick Garland. Although Jeffrey A. Merkley of Oregon is the only senator who has <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/317260-merkley-i-will-do-everything-in-my-power-to-block-trumps">announced</a> that he will oppose any Trump nominee other than Garland, many opponents of Gorsuch's nomination who are not senators <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/opinion/neil-gorsuch-the-nominee-for-a-stolen-seat.html?_r=0">allege</a> that it is illegitimate because they contend that Republicans cheated Garland out of his seat and that Democrats therefore ought to <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2017/01/dear_congress_don_t_seat_donald_trump_s_nominee_until_merrick_garland_is.html">oppose</a> Gorsuch as a matter of priniciple. Such per se opposition to a nominee carries the increasing politicization of the Supreme Court appointments process to a dangerously new level. Opposition to a nomination on purely partisan grounds without consideration of the merits of the nominee himself feeds the growing perception that the court is an entirely political institution, which could become a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>

<p>The Republican <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/273230-mcconnell-no-hearing-for-garland">refusal</a> even to schedule hearings on Garland was without precedent. Although this obstruction was not necessarily unconstitutional, it did frustrate the operation of the constitutional process by which the Senate is <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii">required</a> to provide "Advice and Consent" to judicial nominees. Since Obama had eleven months left in office when he <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/03/obama-nominates-judge-merrick-garland-to-us-supreme-court.php">nominated</a> Garland, he was not the "lame duck" that Republicans claimed and he had a mandate to nominate, just as Senate Republicans had a mandate to oppose the nomination if it had proceeded through the normal confirmation process. Two wrongs, however, do not make a right and Democrats have even less justification than Republicans for denying Gorsuch a fair hearing insofar as Trump has virtually a full term ahead of him. </p>

<p>Unless Republicans exercise the "nuclear option" to break a filibuster against Trump, his nomination will need the votes of sixty senators to reach a vote, eight more than the 52 Republicans who serve in the Senate. Many Democrats are likely to oppose Gorsuch because they strongly object to many of his rulings on politically controversial issues during his decade as a judge on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. This is their prerogative, for ideology is a legitimate factor for senators to consider. At least three senators - Charles E. Schumer of New York, Ronald L. Wyden of Oregon and Elizabeth A.Warren of Massachusetts - already have <a href="https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2017/01/31/elizabeth-warren-and-ed-markey-say-they-will-oppose-neil-gorsuchs-nomination-to-the-supreme-court">announced</a> that they will oppose Gorsuch on this ground. Since, however, Gorsuch has such stellar professional credentials and by all accounts has a model judicial temperament, I would hope that more moderate Democrats would be willing to withhold judgment until they have had an opportunity to study his judicial record, examine him during his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee and speak with him personally during the private meetings that are a little-known (and arguably dubious) part of the confirmation process. Democratic senators should evaluate Gorsuch on his own merits and not use his nomination as an occasion to vent their frustrations over Trump's election or to retaliate against the new president. </p>

<p>Since ideology has become an increasingly important factor in Supreme Court nominations during the past half century and since Trump repeatedly vowed during his presidential campaign to nominate a "conservative" justice in the mold of Antonin Scalia, Trump's nomination of a "conservative" judge like Gorsuch should come as no surprise, even though Trump in many ways is quite "liberal" by Republican standards. Unless Democrats want to cripple the court by leaving it without a full complement of members for at least four years, they should not oppose Gorsuch unless they are convinced that rejection of Gorsuch will somehow result in the nomination of someone they regard as more moderate, a possibility that seems very remote. </p>

<p>The reflexive partisan opposition toward Garland's nomination last year and Gorsuch's nomination this year has escalated the already high level of politicization of the Supreme Court appointment process. Although Supreme Court nominations naturally are subject to political scrutiny because the ideological predilections of justices profoundly influence the shaping of American law, opponents of Gorsuch should not allow raw partisanship to blind them to Gorsuch's professional credentials and temperament or to prevent them from carefully studying his ideology before concluding that it is so extreme that they must in good conscience vote against him. Even then, they should allow the nomination to come to a final vote before the Senate rather than killing it by filibuster.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.syr.edu/profile/david-crane1">David M. Crane</a> of the Syracuse University College of Law discusses some alarming similarities between the early days of the Trump administration and the rise to power of Adolf Hitler... </p>

<p>How did a great country with a strong and respected place in the world, a center for culture and tolerance, elect a man who would plunge the world into what a commentator called "a place of anguish and fear"? This is a question many historians and policy makers asked themselves about Germany in the 1930's. <br />
 <br />
The manner in which Adolf Hitler came to power initially was legitimate and within the constitutional bounds of German law. An obscure former corporal in the German army, he ran for the highest political office in his country on a platform of nationalism, essentially declaring it time to make "Germany great again." Stung by the humiliating terms of the Versailles Treaty, Germany retreated inward burdened by reparations and eventual economic depression; this liberal democracy struggled to redefine itself in a post-WWI world. Hitler's speeches declared that Germany could be a great country again, with a strong people, who could move forward to reclaim their historic place in Europe. All this rang true to a defeated people.  </p>

<p>Hitler's rhetoric in those days formed the murky beginnings of a far darker political dynamic, but the German people &#8212; Dem Deuctshevolk &#8212; shop workers, shopkeepers and farmers, looked beyond this darker theme and focused on a more promising future in a proud and assertive Germany. As he ran for Chancellor, Hitler focused on the economic issues of the time, promising to restore the German economy and bring back jobs. "German business first" was what a German citizen liked to hear.</p>

<p>Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, barely more than eight years after he was released from a Bavarian prison for the Beer Hall Putsch. The first year of his rise to power was a heady time where money poured into infrastructure and rebuilding the German army, in blatant violation of the Versailles Treaty. The concept of a people's car, a Volkswagen, became a reality to be driven on the world's first interstate road system, called the autobahn. German citizens saw jobs, better pay, and a brighter future.<br />
  <br />
Then the nibbling at Germany's democratic principles began, subtle at first, but picked up over the next few years, and by the time of the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, led to a state policy to shift power from the people to one person, a Fuehrer. Backed by the Reichstag, new laws were passed shifting the power to a single executive. Additionally, as this happened, Adolf Hitler began to raise the stakes against perceived enemies of the state by using fear to cause the German people to give away their freedoms one at a time to fight the threat &#8212; Bolsheviks, Slavs, and Jews. Claiming a conspiracy to keep Germany weak, various minorities were singled out as a threat to the country and its people. It was this existential threat from within and outside the country that Hitler built upon a fear so much so that the citizens of Germany turned to their leader, their Fuehrer, to protect them.</p>

<p>The intellectual elite of Germany and much of the middle class at first stood back, amused, embarrassed, disbelieving that this proud nation of culture, of tolerance, of openness would elect this small little man who ranted and raved about a great German nation, a Reich that would last a thousand years. They could not believe that he would last long politically and stood aside in the early years thinking that the political system in place would cause his demise. By the time they realized the shift of almost complete power to one man had actually happened, it was too late. They had only one choice: swear allegiance or leave. Some left when they still could, but most stayed and accepted their national fate.</p>

<p>I have faced down dictators most of my professional life. To understand my adversary I have studied the twentieth century's dictators, how they came to power, their psyche, and their methods of destroying their own citizens. There are patterns, similarities, regarding despots, dictators, and thugs who rise to and hold power in their countries. Their track record is horrific with the destruction of over 95 million human beings at the hands of these dictators in the last century.  </p>

<p>Understanding the similar conduct of largely ordinary men rising to absolute power can help us in many ways: from investigating and prosecuting them for violations of domestic and international crimes, identifying those politicians or political movements trending toward despotism, to prevention and counter measures to blunt their move to power. Liberal democracies today need to understand the past, the present trends, to protect our futures. The consideration of these traits are instructive today in the United States and elsewhere.</p>

<p>So what are those similarities among despots and dictators? First in a country where a dictator comes to power, there is an anger towards the establishment, a long term disappointment and lack of trust in their government.They use this loss of faith in the centralized government to start building a political base to gain power. Dictators want to "drain the swamp," to clean house, to start over.  </p>

<p>Second, the rising dictator uses fear to shift that frustration away from their policies to what is called "a boogey man." Dictators for a century all used a "boogey man" to focus their citizenry away from their absolute power to a threat outside the country. The Three Pashas in Turkey blamed the Christian Armenians for the loss of the Ottoman Empire; Adolf Hitler blamed the Jews for weakening Germany; Joseph Stalin and Mao Tse-tung focused on Western capitalism; and the Ayatollah of Iran blamed the Great Satan of America for their economic problems. Outsiders who were different, who had a different religion became an internal and external threat and were either accounted for and interned or deported. Those who sought admission to their country were banned for who or what they were.</p>

<p>Third, dictators view the press as their enemy and initially seek to limit press access to their regimes, then ban or control the press entirely. They consider the press an enemy of the state and take appropriate action. The liberal press is blamed for factual distortions. The dictator declares they are not using real facts and fashion their own truths, what you would call today "alternative facts." Joseph Goebbels stated that "if you lie to the people long enough, they will believe it as the truth." In a dictatorship the truth is the first casualty.</p>

<p>Fourth, a dictator surrounds himself (yes, they are all men) with only those people who tell him what he wants to hear, not what he needs to hear. The truth becomes dangerous to the government and to those who know it. The dictator does not want to know the truth, they fear the truth and those who work with and for the dictator fear knowing and telling them the truth. They could lose their influence, power, jobs, even their lives, as well as their family's lives if they are truthful. It's a downward paranoid spiral.  </p>

<p>Fifth, the dictators of the twentieth century also suffered from some type of psychological disease or defect. From paranoia, schizophrenia, depression, and narcissism these men slipped farther and farther away from reality the longer they stayed in power. A perfect illustration is when Joseph Stalin fell dying on the floor in his bedroom and laid there for fourteen hours, the doctors and handlers were too afraid to declare him dead in fear of the repercussions of even saying, let alone knowing that he had died.</p>

<p>Sixth, dictators over time consider the law only as a guide, to be broken, modified, or ignored. The longer in power the more they feel they are above the law and take action according to their own whims. A political cult develops around them. They become above all men. Society is what the dictator says it is. The national identity becomes the dictator. Where once government workers or members of the armed forces swore allegiance to the law, they now must swear allegiance to the dictator himself without question. The refusal to do so is expulsion or death.</p>

<p>In the United States we now have a President who fits several of these traits and has acted accordingly &#8212; all within two short weeks as President. The surprising thing is how easily he has been able to do this without any institutional resistance. America is not used to someone of this caliber. We sit back stunned, cowed, or in quiet glee as this new President begins to "make America great again." Is he becoming America's first "dictator"? This remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Our only counter to this "new type" of President is the Constitution of the United States. The founders of this nation contemplated a Trump and put in the necessary checks and balances to ensure that America did not create a king or dictator. The power was reserved to the people, us; and all those elected answer to that people, not the other way around. The other two branches of government will be critical to our republic with this power grabbing new President. They must do their constitutional duty and pay heed to the law and to the people to counter his seeking absolute power.  </p>

<p>Another point, the recent singling out of Muslims seeking entry into our country from several countries appears to be, and <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/donald-trump-issues-executive-orders-on-immigration.php">is touted to be</a>, a national security issue protecting our country.  Beware when our federal government tells you the reason they are doing something "in the name of national security." The results were: "The Red Scare," Japanese internment camps, McCarthyism, unauthorized medical testing, the electronic surveillance program, torture, secret camps, and <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/holder-911-terror-suspects-should-have-been-tried-in-civilian-court.php">Guantanamo</a>, to name a few. It is easier to govern a people when they are afraid. Fear is the life blood of a dictator. Singling out a people to blame because they are different and can possibly cause us harm, hoping to play upon our fears is just a first step to despotism.  </p>

<p>In times of real or perceived crisis we must hold tight to our Constitution, not push it away as a hindrance to making our country safe. Thomas Jefferson throughout his life looked to the people to keep the United States on track, our leaders honest, and our focus on the rule of law. Even in the Declaration of Independence he hinted that it is the people who shape that government and have the right and the obligation to change that government should it challenge our constitutional rights. </p>

<p>It is heartening to see people in the United States and <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/un-rights-experts-us-immigration-order-violates-international-human-rights-obligations.php">around the world</a> <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/san-francisco-sues-administration-over-sanctuary-city-funding-dispute.php">who are</a> <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/aclu-files-suit-challenging-immigraton-order.php">standing up</a> to the new President's policies. Make no mistake, we have a man in power who manifests the traits of a dictator. A citizenry who raise the banner of the rule of law holding our elected officials accountable to our Constitution, and not to a man, will eventually cause the Trump administration to reign in their policies or face legal consequences. If we do not, I fear for America. Remember Germany...</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Doris Toyou of the <a href="http://law.pitt.edu">University of Pittsburgh School of Law</a> discusses treaty translation issues in the nation of Cameroon... </j:header><strong>T</strong>he 2016 unrest in the Republic of Cameroon ("Cameroon") started when a group of Anglophone lawyers <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/12/cameroon-teachers-lawyers-strike-english-161205095929616.html">demanded an official English translation</a> of a treaty ratified since 1996. While Cameroon has over two hundred fifty national languages, the colonialization past imported French and English. Under the <a href="http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/Cameroon.pdf">Cameroon Constitution</a> [PDF], French and English are the official languages, both having the same status. </p>

<p>This commentary looks at three international treaties enacted by Cameroon in the 1990s to note how the non-respect of language equality granted by the Constitution favors social uprising.</p>

<p><strong>The colonial past set the tone for two Cameroons</strong></p>

<p>Under French and English administrations, Cameroon was divided into two unequal territories: French Cameroon, called Republic of Cameroon, in the East part of the territory occupied the largest portion. The English Cameroon, called Southern Cameroons, was a smaller portion composed of two federated states in West Cameroon. After the 1961 reunification, the Republic of Cameroon and the Southern Cameroons became the Federal Republic of Cameroon. A 1972 referendum abandoned federalism for a unitary state known as the United Republic of Cameroon. In 1984, United Republic of Cameroon became the Republic of Cameroon.</p>

<p>To this date, Cameroon Constitution maintains both French and English as official languages together with a bi-jural legal system inherited from colonialism, that is French civil law and English common law. </p>

<p><strong>Ratified treaties preempt the Constitution </strong></p>

<p>Laws channeled through the legislative and executive process are published simultaneously in both languages. The Constitution guarantees Cameroon is bilingual, and the government is responsible to promote and protect bilingualism. The benefit of equal treatment granted by the Constitution protects the English spoken minority. Thus, a treaty ratified in French without its English version contradicts Cameroon Constitution.</p>

<p>Under Cameroon Constitution, the President negotiates and ratifies treaties and international agreements. Ratified treaty and international agreements override national laws, once the treaty is approved, ratified and published. During the early 1990s, Cameroon ratified a series of business treaties containing French as the sole working language. An illustration is seen with the following three treaties: </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.africanlawlibrary.net/web/inter-african-conference-on-insurance-markets/overview">inter-African Conference on Insurance Markets</a> ("CIMA," is a French acronym for <em>Conférence Interafricaine des Marchés d'Assurances</em>). CIMA is the regional body for insurance companies with objective to establish an integrated organization of insurance industry. The organization regroups fourteen countries and was signed on July 10, 1992 in Yaoundé, Cameroon. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.internationaldemocracywatch.org/index.php/central-african-economic-and-monetary-community">Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa</a> ("CEMAC," is a French acronym for <em>Communauté Economique et Monétaire de l'Afrique Centrale</em>). CEMAC is the regional organization regrouping central African nations to promote cooperation and exchange between members; they also share the same currency. The countries signed the treaty on March 16, 1994 in N'Djamena, Chad. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ohada.org/index.php/en/">Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa</a> ("OHADA," is a French acronym for <em>Organisation pour l'Harmonisation en Afrique du Droit des Affaires</em>). OHADA treaty promotes business law by providing legal and judicial security for both domestic and foreign investors. There are currently seventeen member states composing OHADA. OHADA treaty was signed in October 17, 1993 in Port-Louis, Mauritius and revised in October 17, 2008 in Quebec, Canada. </p>

<p>These treaties have in common to promote business integration in Africa and establish French as the sole authoritative language. The preeminence of the French language is not surprising since most signatories are French speaking countries and former French colonies. Thus, French is the only working language with CIMA. CEMAC and OHADA had the same approach until subsequent modifications incorporated the working languages of member states. Both CEMAC and OHADA mention documents already published in French shall have their full effect, even if the translation into the other languages is pending. In case of conflicts, French is the authentic version.</p>

<p>The French dominance is obvious, for French laws can be published independent the publication of other working languages. It also means French remains the only language until another language is officially translated. As a practical matter, an English-speaking Cameroonian wishing to establish an insurance brokerage business should be proficient enough to understand the voluminous CIMA treaty and accompanying texts. This insurer is faced with unofficial translations and the possibility of inaccuracies or contradictions. Evidence of translation incoherence are seen with OHADA, the treaty that sparked unrest in Cameroon.</p>

<p>The 2008 revisions of OHADA added English, Spanish and Portuguese as working languages. <a href="http://www.ohada.org/attachments/article/7/OHADA_Treaty-EN_Reviewed.pdf">An unofficial English version</a> found on OHDA website implemented the languages addition but fail to acknowledge other changes, such as the archaization process. It was rectified when the<a href="http://www.ohada.org/index.php/en/component/content/article?id=1848:official-bulletin-of-ohada-special-edition-nov-2016"> official version</a> was made available on OHADA website . On November 2016, twenty years after Cameroon ratified the OHADA treaty, an official English translation was finally available!</p>

<p>To this date, there are still no available official English translation for CIMA or CEMAC treaties. It is unsettling for English-speaking Cameroonians forced to work with unofficial translations of legal texts. This creates judicial insecurity and favors discrimination among Cameroonians based on languages. Cameroon can only benefit if its national or international laws such as CIMA, OHADA or CEMAC are drawn simultaneously in conformity with the Constitution. The prevalence of one language over the other violates the spirit of the Constitution and frustrates the purpose of unity among Cameroonians.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Contributing Editor, Professor Emerita at Thomas Jefferson School of Law, and author Marjorie Cohn discusses the constitutional violations resulting from the executive order banning nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries ...</p>

<p><strong>O</strong>n January 27, 2017, President Trump made good on his campaign promise to institute a ban on Muslims entering the US. Trump's <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/27/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states">executive order</a> ("EO") is titled "Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States."</p>

<p>The EO bars nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries from the US for at least 90 days. They include Iraq, Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Yemen, and Sudan. The EO also indefinitely prevents Syrian refugees, even those granted visas, from entering the US. And it suspends the resettlement of all refugees for 120 days.</p>

<p>None of the 9/11 hijackers came from the seven countries covered by the EO; 15 of the 19 men hailed from Saudi Arabia, which is not on the list. No one from the seven listed countries has mounted a fatal terrorist attack in the United States.</p>

<p>Countries exempted from the EO include Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Egypt, Turkey, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates &#8212; countries where Trump apparently has business ties. </p>

<p>Trump's EO violates the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/establishment_clause">Establishment Clause</a>, the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">Due Process Clause</a>, the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection">Equal Protection Clause</a>, and the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/executive_branch">Take Care Clause</a> of the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution">Constitution</a>. It also violates the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CAT.aspx">Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</a> (CAT), as well as the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR); both are treaties the United States has ratified, making them part of US law under the Constitution's <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/supremacy_clause">Supremacy Clause</a>. The EO violates the <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/laws/immigration-and-nationality-act">Immigration and Nationality Act</a> as well.</p>

<p><strong>Six Federal Courts Stay Trump's EO<br />
</strong><br />
In the face of legal challenges, six federal courts have temporarily stayed implementation of parts of the EO, indicating that petitioners have a strong likelihood of prevailing on the merits.</p>

<p>On January 28, US District Judge Ann Donnelly of the Eastern District of New York concluded that the petitioners "have a strong likelihood of success in establishing that the removal of the petitioner and others similarly situated violates Due Process and Equal Protection." She also found "imminent danger . . . [of] substantial and irreparable injury to refugees, visa-holders, and other individuals from nations subject to the [EO]."</p>

<p>Donnelly thus enjoined respondents Trump, <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/">US Customs and Border Protection</a> (CBP), <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS), <em>et al</em> from removing anyone with refugee applications approved by US Citizenship and Immigration Services as part of the <a href="https://www.state.gov/j/prm/ra/admissions/">US Refugee Admissions Program</a>. Holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas, and other individuals from the seven listed countries who are legally authorized to enter the US, are also protected from removal by Donnelly's order.</p>

<p>In spite of Donnelly's order, CBP agents continued to detain immigrants at airports across the country and send them back, even though some could face persecution in their countries of origin.</p>

<p>On January 28, US District Judge Leonie Brinkema of the Eastern District of Virginia forbade respondents Trump <em>et al</em> from removing the three Yemeni petitioners, who were lawful permanent residents being held at Dulles International Airport, for seven days from the issuance of her order. Brinkema further ordered CBP agents to permit attorneys access to all lawful permanent residents (green card holders) detained pursuant to the EO at Dulles International Airport pursuant.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, CBP agents refused to allow detained lawful permanent residents to consult with lawyers. On February 1, the Commonwealth of Virginia asked a federal judge to force Trump, CBP and other high government officials to show cause why they should not be held in contempt for refusing to obey a lawful court order.</p>

<p>On January 28, US District Judge Thomas Zilly of the Western District of Washington granted a stay of removal and enjoined respondents Trump <em>et al</em> from removing John Does I and I from the US pending a hearing on February 3.</p>

<p>On January 29, US District Judge Allison Burroughs and US Magistrate Judge Judith Gail Dein of the District of Massachusetts found that Iranian petitioners, a married couple, both of whom are engineering professors at University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth, had a strong likelihood of success in establishing the detention/and or removal of them and others similarly situated would violate Due Process and Equal Protection. </p>

<p>The two judges also concluded petitioners were likely to suffer irreparable harm. They issued a temporary restraining order, preventing respondents Trump <em>et al</em> from detaining or removing for seven days individuals with refugee applications approved by US Citizenship and Immigration Services as part of the US Refugee Admissions Program. Holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas, lawful permanent residents,] and others from the seven listed countries who, absent the EO, would be legally authorized to enter the US, were also protected from exclusion.</p>

<p>On January 31, US District Judge Andre Birotte in Los Angeles ruled that the government must permit immigrants from the seven listed nations who have initial preclearance for legal residency to enter the US. Birotte ordered US officials to refrain from "removing, detaining or blocking the entry of [anyone] . . . with a valid immigrant visa" arriving from one of the seven countries. </p>

<p>Attorney Julie Ann Goldberg had filed the Los Angeles case on behalf of more than 24 plaintiffs of Yemeni descent, including US citizens. Over 200 people holding immigrant visas who had left Yemen, and are either related to US citizens or lawful permanent residents, were stranded in Djibouti and prevented from flying to the US.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on February 1, a counsel to the president informed government agencies that the EO does not apply to some categories of immigrants. They include lawful permanent residents, Iraqis who worked for the US government in jobs such as interpreters and people with dual nationality when entering the US with a passport from a country other than one of the forbidden seven.</p>

<p>On February 3, US District Judge James Robart in Seattle issued a temporary nationwide restraining order halting the EO's ban on citizens of the seven countries from entering the US, and the limitations on accepting refugees, including any action that "purports to prioritize the refugee claims of certain religious minorities." He found that the states met their burden of showing they face "immediate and irreparable injury." The judge concluded, "The executive order adversely affects the states' residents in areas of employment, education, business, family relations and freedom to travel. These harms are significant and ongoing." Judge Robart ruled the EO would be stopped nationwide, effective immediately.</p>

<p><strong>The EO Violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment<br />
</strong><br />
The strongest constitutional argument for overturning the EO is that it violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court has held "the clearest command of the Establishment Clause is that one religious denomination cannot be officially preferred over another." The EO "imposes a selective ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries as well as establishes preferential treatment for refugees seeking asylum who are identified with 'minority religions' in their country of origin," <a href="https://www.aclu.org">ACLU </a>National Legal Director David Cole wrote in <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/"><em>Just Security</em></a>. Cole cited Trump's statement on <a href="http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews">Christian Broadcast News</a> that the intent of his EO was to prioritize "Christians" seeking asylum over "Muslims."</p>

<p>Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of <a href="http://www.law.uci.edu/">UC Irvine School of Law</a>, observed in the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, "Although Trump's order does not expressly exclude Muslims, that is its purpose and effect as it bars entry to individuals from predominantly Muslim countries."</p>

<p>When Trump signed the EO, Cole noted, he "pledged to 'keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the US.' Not 'terrorists'; not 'radical terrorists.'  But only 'radical Islamic terrorists.'" Cole concluded that Trump "has violated the Establishments Clause's 'clearest command'" as "[T]here is no legitimate reason to favor Christians over all others who are persecuted for their beliefs."</p>

<p><strong>The EO Violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment<br />
</strong><br />
Procedural due process forbids the government from depriving an individual of life, liberty or property without due process of law. The US government is obligated to hear the asylum claims of noncitizens who arrive at US borders and ports of entry. The Immigration and Nationality Act provides, "Any alien who is physically present in the US or who arrives in the US . . . irrespective of such alien's status, may apply for asylum . . ."  They must be afforded an opportunity to apply for asylum or other forms of humanitarian protection and be promptly received and processed by US authorities. The Trump administration's denial of an opportunity to apply for asylum violates procedural due process.</p>

<p><strong>The EO Violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment<br />
</strong><br />
The Equal Protection Clause prohibits the government from "deny[ing] to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of laws." An executive order that has the "purpose and effect of disapproval of a class recognized and protected by state law" violates the Equal Protection Clause, the Supreme Court held in <u>US v. Windsor</u>.</p>

<p>Muslim immigrants and non-Muslim immigrants from the seven listed countries are two separate classes of people for Equal Protection purposes. Unequal treatment of different groups based on religion, which is a suspect class, are subjected to strict scrutiny and thus there must be a compelling state interest to justify the disparate treatment. None of the 9/11 hijackers came from any of the seven countries. There have been no fatal terrorist attacks on US soil by anyone from those countries. Therefore, there is no compelling state interest for treating the two classes differently. This is particularly true in light of Trump's statements that his order would prioritize "Christians" seeking asylum over "Muslims."</p>

<p>As Corey Brettschneider wrote for <a href="http://www.politico.com/"><em>Politico</em></a>, the Court drew a clear connection between the protection of religious liberty and the Equal Protection Clause's prohibition of invidious discrimination in <u>Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah</u>.  </p>

<p><strong>The EO Violates the Take Care Clause, Art. II, Sec. 3<br />
</strong><br />
Trump's EO violates the Take Care Clause of the Constitution, according to Jeanne Mirer, president of the <a href="http://www.iadllaw.org/newsite/">International Association of Democratic Lawyers</a>. "This provision requires the President to 'take care' that the laws of the country are faithfully executed," Mirer wrote on Facebook. "The EO on immigration violates this clause because it requires government officials to violate various laws as well as human rights treaties we have ratified. He is also violating it by appointing people who openly oppose the laws they are being asked to enforce. Impeachable offense," she added.</p>

<p><strong>The EO Violates the Convention Against Torture<br />
</strong><br />
Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT) establishes the principle of <em>nonrefoulement</em>. It forbids states parties from expelling, returning or extraditing a person to a state "where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture." Refugees often flee repressive regimes to escape persecution. Sending people back to a country where they may well suffer torture violates the CAT. </p>

<p><strong>The EO Violates the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights<br />
</strong><br />
Article 2 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) forbids states parties from making distinctions in the provision of civil and political rights based on "race, colour [<em>sic</em>], sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status." By giving fewer rights to Muslims than non-Muslims, Trump is violating the ICCPR.</p>

<p><strong>The EO Violates the Immigration and Nationality Act<br />
</strong><br />
According to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, no person can be "discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person's race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence."  By singling out people from majority-Muslim countries, Trump has violated the Immigration and Nationality Act.</p>

<p><strong>Legal and political fallout<br />
</strong><br />
Attorneys general from 15 states and the District of Columbia issued a joint statement condemning the EO.  One thousand State Department employees likewise opposed the EO.</p>

<p>After federal courts stayed the ban, acting Attorney General Sally Yates ordered the Justice Department not to defend the EO, saying she wasn't convinced it was lawful. Trump responded by firing Yates, stating she had "betrayed the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a>."</p>

<p>Ironically, Senator Jeff Sessions, who will become Attorney General once the Senate confirms his nomination, asked Yates at her confirmation hearing whether she thought the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag">Attorney General</a> had "the responsibility to say no the President if he asks for something that's improper."</p>

<p>Sessions' fingerprints are all over the Muslim ban.  <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/"><em>The Daily Beast</em></a> reported that Sessions, Steve Bannon and senior policy advisor Steven Miller (a Sessions confidant) drafted the EO.</p>

<p>Hundreds of people were kept in limbo after Trump issued his order. A five-year-old boy was separated from his mother for four hours.  Erez Reuveni, an attorney with the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/civil/office-immigration-litigation">Justice Department's Office of Immigration Litigation</a>, said more than 100,000 visas have been revoked.  He could not say, however, how many people who had visas were sent back to their home countries.  But, William Cocks from the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/about.html">State Department Bureau of Consular Affairs</a> wrote in an email to <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/"><em>NBC News</em></a>, "Fewer than 60,000 individuals' visas were provisionally revoked to comply with the Executive Order."</p>

<p>Although thousands protested the Muslim ban at airports around the country, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus told <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/"><em>CBS News</em></a> that the ban could be extended.</p>

<p>After Judge Robart issued the nationwide stay on February, the White House vowed to appeal the ruling. Trump tweeted, "The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!" In another tweet, Trump wrote, "When a country is no longer able to say who can, and who cannot , come in & out, especially for reasons of safety &.security - big trouble!"</p>

<p>But the Department of Homeland Security announced it would comply with Robart's order. "In accordance with the judge's ruling," DHS acting press secretary Gillian Christensen said, "DHS has suspended any and all actions implementing the affected sections of the Executive Order entitled, 'Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States.' This includes actions to suspend passenger system rules that flag travelers for operational action subject to the Executive Order."</p>

<p>The US State Department also reversed the cancellation of the 60,000 - 100,000 visas revoked after the EO was issued.</p>

<p>The rubber will meet the road when federal appellate judges, and probably the Supreme Court, rule on the merits of these petitions. If the petitioners ultimately prevail, we will see whether the Trump administration fulfills its legal duty to act in accordance with those judicial decisions.</p>

		<title>The Emergence of Evidence Opens the Door for Another Lawsuit by Bosnia and Herzegovina Against Serbia</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Fahira Brodlija of The University of Pittsburgh School of Law, LLM Class of 2017, discusses the implications of revising a lawsuit between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia...</j:header><strong>A</strong>ccording to the former prosecutor of <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/">The Hague International Criminal Court (ICC)</a>, <a href="https://www.gresham.ac.uk/professors-and-speakers/professor-sir-geoffrey-nice-qc/">Geoffrey Nice</a>, there is new evidence based on which Bosnia and Herzegovina could seek the revision of its lawsuit against Serbia which<a href="/paperchase/2007/02/icj-serbia-not-guilty-of-bosnia.php"> was brought before</a> [JURIST report] the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 2007. In his words: <blockquote>"Bosnia and Herzegovina lost its lawsuit due to the lack of evidence, but since 2007, new evidence has emerged which had not been used previously."</blockquote></p>

<p>On February 26, 2007 the ICJ rendered a judgment in re <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/91/13685.pdf"><u> Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro</u></a> [PDF], deciding on the claim of Serbia's violation of the Convention on the prevention and Punishment of Genocide. After 14 years of procedure, the ICJ found that the government authorities of Serbia did not (in official capacity) perform activities which constitute genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Therefore, the Court found that according to international law, Serbia was not liable for genocide in Srebrenica in July of 1995, nor did it act in conspiracy with the intention of committing genocide.</p>

<p>The ICJ did determine Serbia's violations of the <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/genocide.html">Convention on Genocide</a> in its failure to fulfill its international obligation to prevent genocide. Therefore this judgment referred to the failure to perform a duty which was undertaken by signing the aforementioned Convention. According to international law, Serbia was under strict obligation to perform actions and measures in order to prevent genocide, and it could not derogate from this obligation.</p>

<p>In the political discourse through the year following this judgment, the possibility of the revision of this lawsuit has been brought up by Bosniac parties. However no specific steps were taken, mostly due to the lack of strong political will. On the other hand, <a href="http://endgenocide.org/learn/past-genocides/the-bosnian-war-and-srebrenica-genocide/">the international community</a> (most notably the US and the EU) did not get involved in this issue in order to prevent inflammatory nationalistic backlash. The Serbian member of the Presidency, Mladen Ivanić has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bosnia-srebrenica-resolution-idUSKCN0P91UA20150629">recently stated</a> that even if Bosnia and Herzegovina was able to fulfill the onerous requirements to re-open the case before the ICJ based on new evidence, the decision to do so would have to come from the Presidency, for which he would not give his consent. Therefore, the Court would not even be approached for this matter.</p>

<p>In light of the information on the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/07/srebrenica-massacre-bosnia-anniversary-denial/398846/">new evidence in this case</a>, it would be interesting to see the new conclusions drawn by the ICJ and the potential consequences of a new outcome different from the one in 2007. However, it is most likely that this will be another missed opportunity by Bosnia and Herzegovina to obtain justice at the international level due to the lack of political consensus and efficiency of the competent authorities. The statute of limitation for a new claim lapses February 26, 2017.</p>

                <p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Kübra Berberoğlu, <a href="http://opil.ouplaw.com/page/IHRL/oxford-reports-on-international-human-rights-law">Oxford Human Rights Law Reporter</a> (OxHRLR), discusses how, in the case of <span class="casename"><u>B.L. v. Australia</u></span>,  the HRC has made either a careless or a disappointing start in clarifying how it employs the internal relocation alternative and how this might negatively affect refugee protection under the ICCPR. A longer version of this post is available @cgpl... </p> <strong>I</strong>n 2014, the UN Human Rights <em>Committee </em>(HRC) made its internal relocation alternative debut in <a href="http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CCPR/C/112/D/2053/2011&Lang=en">B.L. v. Australia</a>. Internal relocation alternative (also known as "internal flight alternative"), concerns weighing the possibility of relocation for an asylum seeker in her/his country of origin as a ground for refusing refugee status. </p>

                <p>In this post I argue that in the case of  <span class="casename">B.L. v. Australia</span> the HRC has made either a careless or a disappointing start in clarifying how it employs the internal relocation alternative and this might negatively affect refugee protection under <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx">ICCPR</a>. </p>

                <p><u><strong>What Does International Law Say About Internal Relocation Alternative?</strong></u><br />
                    Under current international law, internal relocation alternative is not a pre-requisite <em>per se</em> to apply for asylum. The doctrine is not regulated under the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/protection/basic/3b66c2aa10/convention-protocol-relating-status-refugees.html">Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees </a>(&#8216;Refugee Convention&#8217;) or its <a href="http://www.irb-cisr.gc.ca/Eng/BoaCom/references/LegJur/Pages/RefDef08.aspx#note1">Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees</a>. <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/about-us/background/45dc1a682/oau-convention-governing-specific-aspects-refugee-problems-africa-adopted.html">The OAU Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa</a>, on the other hand, explicitly rejects the internal flight alternative doctrine. </p>

                <p>Despite the absence of a legal prerequisite to exhaust all other options available in the country of origin, internal relocation alternative has been used widely by states in refugee status determination (A study on practices of  different states can be found <a href="http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6b3514.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.unhcr-centraleurope.org/_assets/files/content/resources/_pdf_en/evaluation_and_research/Internal_Flight_Alternative-report.pdf">here</a> [PDF]). It has also been recognized as a factor in refugee status determinations by human rights courts and quasi judicial bodies (For EU and ECHR Law see <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Handbook_asylum_ENG.pdf">here</a> [PDF]; for CAT Committee&#8217;s jurisprudence see <a href="http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6b3514.html">here</a> at page 8 and for CEDAW Committee&#8217;s jurisprudence see <a href="http://juris.ohchr.org/Search/Details/1881">here</a>).</p>

                <p><u><strong>The Human Rights Committee and  <span class="casename">B.L. v. Australia</span> </strong></u><br />
                    Although the internal relocation alternative has been mentioned in some individual opinions of the HRC members (see e.g. Individual Opinion of  <a href="http://juris.ohchr.org/Search/Details/1631">Mr. Yuji Iwasawa in Pillai et al. v. Canada</a>), the majority has not relied on the doctrine when reaching a conclusion in HRC views. That is, of course, until the case that is the subject of this post: <a href="http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CCPR/C/112/D/2053/2011&Lang=en">B.L. v Australia</a>. Before examining where the HRC stood in <span class="casename">B.L. v. Australia</span>, let's have a quick look at the facts of the case and the decision of the Committee. </p>

                <p>BL was born into a Muslim family in Touba, Senegal. When BL converted to Christianity in 1994, he had been attacked both by his family and the Mourides Brothers, a large Sufi order which is politically and culturally very effective in Senegal.  Although BL left his hometown, the brotherhood found him again. When BL reported to the police that his life was threatened, he was told him that there was nothing they could do. Feeling unsafe, BL went forth and back between Senegal and South Africa and finally in 2008 he left Senegal for Australia. BL application for a protection visa before Australian authorities was rejected. After exhausting available remedies in Australia, BL filed a complaint before the Human Rights Committee.</p>

                <p>When deciding whether deportation to Senegal would violate BL';s right to life, prohibition of torture and right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, the Committee reasoned that:<br />
                <blockquote>the author has not put forward any other reason why he could not relocate within Senegal&#8221; and &#8220;it would not be unreasonable to expect him to settle in a location, especially one more distant from Touba, where such protection would be available to him.</blockquote><br />
                Consequently, the Committee concluded that although BL disagreed with the Australian authorities on their factual findings, he failed to show why they were manifestly unreasonable. The HRC did not find any violation of BL's rights provided that he would be returned to a place where adequate and effective protection is available.    </p>

                <p>Although the Committee did not refer to the internal relocation alternative <em>per se</em> as the core doctrinal basis of its decision, it appears that it grounded its decision on the said doctrine. Or did it?</p>

                <p><strong><u>The ambiguous status of internal allocation alternative in <span class="casename">B.L. v. Australia</span> </u></strong><br />
                    When we look at the individual opinions of the Committee members we see that the members themselves were of different opinions on the meaning of the Committee&#8217;s words. <a href="http://docstore.ohchr.org/SelfServices/FilesHandler.ashx?enc=6QkG1d%2fPPRiCAqhKb7yhsukPtYsnxNH1DBeueuCbK4hKQephg53c1o00bjej8SEqFVJEtlhrAzen3gxLMoxDuAiwKAOvG6kRtKlReXNSoJmB22vPFITiSPhB2koaeDjCP2HdXkb1c2B0lIumupT8nw%3d%3d">Mr. Gerald L. Neuman and Mr Yuji Iwasawa</a> said that the decision reflected the well-established principle of internal flight alternative.  It is interesting to note that Mr. Gerald L. Neuman and Mr Yuji Iwasa referred to the internal flight alternative as &#8216;a basic rule of international refugee law&#8217;. This is in clear contradiction with the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/3b83c6e64.pdf">UNHCR Position Paper</a> [PDF], which states that the internal relocation alternative does not amount to &#8216;a principle of refugee law&#8217;, but rather merely a factor in determination of refugee status. <a href="http://docstore.ohchr.org/SelfServices/FilesHandler.ashx?enc=6QkG1d%2fPPRiCAqhKb7yhsukPtYsnxNH1DBeueuCbK4hKQephg53c1o00bjej8SEqFVJEtlhrAzen3gxLMoxDuAiwKAOvG6kRtKlReXNSoJmB22vPFITiSPhB2koaeDjCP2HdXkb1c2B0lIumupT8nw%3d%3d">Mr Dheerujlall Seetulsingh</a> endorsed Neuman and Iwasa&#8217; opinions and further argued that the burden was not upon Australia to prove that B.L. would be returned to a place in Senegal where he could avail himself of State protection, but rather it was upon B.L. to prove why he could not be relocated in another place in Senegal. </p>

                <p><a href="http://docstore.ohchr.org/SelfServices/FilesHandler.ashx?enc=6QkG1d%2fPPRiCAqhKb7yhsukPtYsnxNH1DBeueuCbK4hKQephg53c1o00bjej8SEqFVJEtlhrAzen3gxLMoxDuAiwKAOvG6kRtKlReXNSoJmB22vPFITiSPhB2koaeDjCP2HdXkb1c2B0lIumupT8nw%3d%3d">Mr Fabián Omar Salvioli</a>, had a completely different opinion. He pointed out that the Committee had never based its decisions on the internal relocation alternative doctrine and, according to him, this case should be no exception either. He argued that the Committee should not have said that B.L. failed to prove why he should not be relocated in Senegal or that it was not unreasonable for him to resettle in a location away from Touba. The HRC&#8217;s reasoning, Salvioli argued, should have been that B.L. failed to prove that his claims were &#8216;beyond reasonable doubt&#8217;. If there were a genuine risk, regardless of the fact that there were safer locations in the country, there would have been violations of Article 6 or Article 7 of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx">ICCPR</a>. </p>

                <p>In my opinion, these contradictory opinions of the Committee members show that this case was not an official endorsement of the internal relocation alternative doctrine by the Committee, but rather show how difficult it can be to reach a common decision in certain cases.</p>

                <p><u><strong>What does this imply for refugee protection under ICCPR?</strong></u><br />
                    The internal relocation alternative is not a simple doctrine that can be applied with one mere sentence on the failure of the author to submit reasons as to why he could not relocate in another part in his home country. The <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/publications/legal/3f28d5cd4/guidelines-international-protection-4-internal-flight-relocation-alternative.html">UNHCR</a> provides substantive and procedural safeguards when applying internal relocation alternative. These safeguards, however, were neither applied nor discussed in <span class="casename">B.L. v. Australia</span>. As pointed out by UNHCR  <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/publications/legal/3f28d5cd4/guidelines-international-protection-4-internal-flight-relocation-alternative.html">here</a>, such improper applications of internal relocation alternative has the potential to threaten the right to seek asylum as well as prohibition of <em>refoulement</em>. </p>

                <p>First, if we accept that the Committee applied the internal relocation alternative in <span class="casename">B.L. v. Australia</span>, it has to be identified as one criterion among others. The Committee, instead, merely pointed out that B.L. failed to provide reasons why he could not relocate in another part in Senegal. The internal relocation alternative, however, should have been applied as a part of a <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/publications/legal/3f28d5cd4/guidelines-international-protection-4-internal-flight-relocation-alternative.html">holistic assessment</a> of refugee status. <br />
                    According to the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/publications/legal/3f28d5cd4/guidelines-international-protection-4-internal-flight-relocation-alternative.html">UNHCR guidelines</a>, relevance and reasonableness analyses are to be carried out in the context of a full assessment of refugee status. The relevance test focuses on whether the area of relocation is practically, safely and legally accessible; whether the agent of persecution is a state agent or a non-state agent, and; whether there would be risk of persecution upon relocation. The reasonableness test, for its part, looks at whether the person concerned would be able to have a normal life in the place of relocation.  </p>

                <p>In <span class="casename">B.L. v. Australia</span>, however, the Committee did not focus on any of these questions. Taking into account the Committee&#8217;s practice of deference to domestic authorities (see e.g. <a href="http://juris.ohchr.org/Search/Details/1487">Tarlue v Canada</a>, <a href="http://juris.ohchr.org/Search/Details/1346">P.K. v Canada</a> and<a href="http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CCPR/C/111/D/2049/2011&Lang=en"> Z. v Australia</a> ), the fact that Australian authorities omitted to address any of the question set out in the relevance and reasonable analyses, could indeed have lead the Committee to consider that the national courts decision was arbitrary or amounted to a miscarriage of justice and thus enabled the Committee to evaluate the facts and evidence. </p>

                <p>There are also procedural issues that the Committee should have considered. The first such issue is the country of origin information. According to <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/publications/legal/3f28d5cd4/guidelines-international-protection-4-internal-flight-relocation-alternative.html">UNHCR guidelines</a> in cases where internal relocation alternative is relied upon, a particular area must be identified, rather than an unspecified description of another region of the origin country. In the present case, however, the majority opinion of the Committee failed to concede that the facts before it did not indicate that Australia identified a particular area where Mr. B.L. could avail from state protection. </p>

                <p>Another issue here is burden of proof. UNHCR&#8217;s guidelines provide that the party claiming internal relocation alternative is applicable should establish that there is a specific safe location where effective and adequate protection is available. Then, the person in question needs to prove why the relocation place is not relevant or reasonable. In the present case, however, the Committee&#8217;s position on burden of proof was somehow self-contradictory. Although there was nothing in the facts to suggest that Australia established a specific safe location during the course of refugee status determination, the Committee noted that Mr. B.L. failed to show why he could not relocate within Senegal. While it appears that the Committee placed the burden of proof upon B.L., it later set forth that B.L.&#8217;s removal would not violate ICCPR provided that Australia determined a specific safe location. </p>

                <p>Given that the definition of a refugee and the scope of <em>non refoulement</em> is limited under the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/protection/basic/3b66c2aa10/convention-protocol-relating-status-refugees.html">Refugee Convention</a>, generally applicable international human rights norms, including <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx">ICCPR</a>, provide protection for those not covered by the Refugee Convention. Accepting that HRC endorsed the internal relocation alternative without any of the established safeguards means narrowing the scope of <em>non refoulement</em> to a dangerous level and compromises one of the few protection mechanisms available to millions of people who do not qualify as refugees under the Refugee Convention. </p>

                <p><strong><u>Conclusion: Did the HRC Accept the Internal Relocation Alternative?</u></strong><br />
                    Returning to our main question of whether or not the Committee accepted the internal relocation alternative, I am still hold the opinion that it did not, at least not yet. Although I concede that the Committee&#8217;s choice of words is ambiguous, such ambiguity probably serves the purpose of reconciling the contrasting opinions of different Committee members. Whatever the reason behind this wording might be, it seems we still need more, and better reasoned, decisions to determine the position of the HRC on this issue. If the Committee adopts more views in line with internal relocation alternative doctrine, it is necessary that the concept is not used in a way that impedes right to seek asylum and prohibition of <em>refoulement</em>. </p>

By the end of World War II, there were over <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/world/historical-migrant-crisis/">40 million</a> refugees in Europe. The millions of refugees displaced by war and persecution led to the earliest development of an intricate <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/1951-refugee-convention.html">framework</a> that guides refugee and asylum law internationally. It is a framework that endures today. After the global traumas of World War II, every President has expressed a commitment to participation in the <a href="http://wilsonquarterly.com/quarterly/the-post-obama-world/a-refugee-looks-back-what-the-1940s-teach-us-about-todays-crisis/">development</a> of a global migration policy that considers larger geopolitical interests and that recognizes the importance of international human rights, of which refugee policy is a part.</p>

<p>We are now in the midst of a refugee crisis that is worse than the refugee crisis of World War II. In 2016, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reported that the number of refugees had risen to <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/latest/2016/6/5763b65a4/global-forced-displacement-hits-record-high.html">65.3 million</a> by the end of 2015. This reflected an increase of approximately 5.8 million refugee seekers from the prior year.</p>

<p>The painful memory of a xenophobic, nativist and isolationist immigration policy continues to haunt us in the United States. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, for instance, <a href="https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005267">documents</a> the voyage of a German transatlantic liner, the St. Louis, from Hamburg, Germany, to Havana, Cuba, in 1939. The St. Louis carried 937 passengers, nearly all European Jews fleeing the Third Reich. After Cuba denied entry to most of the passengers, they attempted to set sail to Miami, Florida, seeking refugee status from the United States. On June 6, 1939, after the United States failed to grant permission for the passengers to disembark, the St. Louis returned to Europe. Although Great Britain, France, Belgium and the Netherlands agreed to take some of the refugees aboard the St. Louis, 532 St. Louis passengers were trapped when the Nazis gained control of Europe. According to the Holocaust Museum, 278 survived the Holocaust and 254 died.</p>

<p>For decades after World War II, there was a call to end the <a href="http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=3&psid=1116">National Origins Act of 1924</a> and the racial sciences of eugenics that had <a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/reflections-immigration-act-1924">supported it</a>. The National Origins Act established a restrictive immigration framework to block immigrants from Asia and Africa. It also greatly restricted immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe, specifically targeting Italians, Slavs and Eastern European Jews. The Jewish refugees aboard the St. Louis fleeing the Third Reich were informed that the immigration quotas set by the National Origins Act could not be lifted for them. As Duke University historian Claudia Koontz documents in <em><a href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674018426">The Nazi Conscience</a></em> (2003), Nazi leaders "expressed admiration for the United States as a model both because anti-miscegenation laws and immigration quotas seemed so clear-cut and because public opinion [in the United States] accepted them as natural." </p>

<p>It is not a coincidence that the <a href="http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/fifty-years-1965-immigration-and-nationality-act-continues-reshape-united-states">Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965</a>, the <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/voting_rights_1965.asp">Voting Rights Act of 1965</a> and the <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/civil_rights_1964.asp">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> passed almost concurrently. Although it included some exceptions, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 prohibited discrimination in the issuance of visas on the basis of "race, sex, nationality, place of birth, or place of residence[.]"</p>

<p>On Friday January 27, 2017, on the same day as <a href="https://www.ushmm.org/information/exhibitions/online-exhibitions/special-focus/international-holocaust-remembrance-day">International Holocaust Remembrance Day</a>, President Trump signed an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/27/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states">Executive Order</a> titled, "Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States."  The Executive Order temporarily excludes immigration from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and suspends refugees from Syria indefinitely.</p>

<p>The Saturday morning after the Executive Order was signed, on January 28, 2017, in <a href="https://www.aclu.org/cases/darweesh-v-trump"><span class="casename">Darweesh v. Trump</span></a>, attorneys immediately filed a Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief in the Eastern District of New York on behalf of two Iranian immigrants.  By that Saturday evening, <a href="https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/content/judge-ann-m-donnelly">Judge Ann Donnelly</a> of Eastern District of New York sided with the plaintiffs, finding they would likely to succeed on the merits in showing that the Executive Order violates their Due Process and Equal Protection rights. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.kilpatricktownsend.com/en/Who_We_Are/Professionals/P/PolonskyJonathanE14623.aspx">Jonathan Polonsky</a>, senior counsel at Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton, represented Hameed Khalid Darweesh pro bono. He <a href="http://www.americanlawyer.com/home/id=1202778165917/How-a-Presidents-Immigration-Order-Mobilized-Big-Law?mcode=1202617075486&curindex=1&slreturn=20170106141254">explained</a> to reporters that he is committed to this effort, in part, because his family includes refugees and Holocaust survivors. For the past two years, Polonsky assisted law student volunteers in advising Darweesh on his special immigrant visa. Darweesh's family had suffered death threats because of his work as an interpreter for US Armed Forces, first discovering a bomb in his home and then facing a car explosion in front of his house. For now, as a result of <a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/judges/robart-bio">Judge James Robart's</a> decision in the Western District of Washington on Friday, February 3, 2017, temporarily <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/03/politics/federal-judge-temporarily-halts-trump-travel-ban-nationwide-ag-says/">halting</a> the implementation of the Executive Order in its entirety, those who had been adversely impacted by the Executive Order are safe. </p>

<p>Collectively, President Trump's actions on immigration signal a sharp and dramatic departure from the equality and humanitarian norms of prior administrations, including a reversal of the stance of the most recent Republican President, George W. Bush. In his address to the nation on the need for comprehensive immigration reform, on May 15, 2006, President George W. Bush <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/15/washington/15text-bush.html">explained</a>: "We honor the heritage of all who come here, no matter where they are from, because we trust in our country's genius for making us all Americans, one nation under God."  The Executive Order is currently being questioned in the federal courts for its constitutionality. The Executive Order is also being <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/thousands-join-protests-trumps-immigration-order/story?id=45272058">questioned</a> in the court of public opinion as being inconsistent with American values and as lacking the type of humanitarian leadership on refugee policy expected of American presidents since the close of World War II.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.pacificlegal.org/staff/Brian-Hodges">Brian T. Hodges</a> of <a href="https://www.pacificlegal.org/">The Pacific Legal Foundation,</a> discusses <span class="casename">Murr v. State of Wisconsin</span> and its potential effect on regulatory takings jurisprudence ...</p>

                <p><strong>T</strong>he US Supreme Court is set to resolve a critically important question of regulatory takings law this term in the case, <span class="casename">Murr v. State of Wisconsin</span>, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docketfiles/15-214.htm">Dkt. No. 15-214</a>. At issue is the &#8220;relevant parcel&#8221; inquiry, which is the threshold determination to the multi-factor regulatory takings test established by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16963280698452399899"><span class="casename">Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City</span></a> (1978). That test directs courts to determine the impact of a regulation on the &#8220;parcel as a whole&#8221; by considering the character of the state action, the economic impact of the regulation and the regulation&#8217;s interference with the owner&#8217;s investment-backed expectations. <span class="casename">Murr</span> asks what the term &#8220;parcel as a whole&#8221; means in practice&#8212does it limit the takings inquiry to the regulated parcel or does it allow the government to combine the owner&#8217;s interests in other parcels of land?  </p>

                <p>The answer to that question is currently subject to a nationwide split of authority among the lower courts, resulting in inconsistent decisions applying the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment">Takings Clause</a> of the US Constitution and creating an environment of uncertainty for both landowners and government alike.</p>

                <p>The US Supreme Court has often analogized the takings inquiry to solving a fraction where the impact of the regulation provides the numerator and the relevant parcel provides the denominator. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11190922532053603622"><span class="casename">Keystone Bituminous Coal Association v. DeBenedictis</span></a> (1987). Thus, &#8220;the definition of the relevant parcel of land is a crucial antecedent that determines the extent of the economic impact wrought by the regulation.&#8221; <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-federal-circuit/1702560.html"><span class="casename">Lost Tree Village Corporation v. United States</span></a> (Fed. Cir. 2015). A rule that allows the government to increase the size of the denominator by combining an owner&#8217;s interests in other parcels of property will have a very real impact on the takings calculus&#8212;for example, a regulation that deprives an owner of 9/10 of his or her property is much more onerous than one that impacts 9/20 or 9/100 of the property </p>

                <p>The facts in <span class="casename">Murr</span> demonstrate how this fraction equation can be manipulated to diminish the apparent impact of a regulation on property. In 1960, William and Dorothy Murr purchased a 1.25-acre lot in a subdivision on the St. Croix River in Wisconsin and built a cabin on it. Three years later, the Murrs purchased an adjacent lot as an investment. The family did not build on that lot and the parents later gave the property to their children. When the children began to look into selling the lot to pay for repairs to the family cabin, the government said that they couldn&#8217;t sell or make any valuable use of the land. The government explained that regulations passed after the Murrs purchased their lots require a bigger &#8220;net project area&#8221; than either lot had by itself. Because the neighboring lots were commonly owned, the government combined them into one unit and, consequently, prohibited the development or sale of the investment lot.</p>

                <p>The Murrs filed suit against Wisconsin and St. Croix County, arguing that the governments&#8217; action violated the Fifth Amendment Takings Clause by depriving the Murrs of the value of the investment lot. The US Supreme Court has long recognized that a land-use regulation that &#8220;goes too far&#8221; can rise to a taking. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15307284477438038942"><span class="casename">Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon</span></a> (1922). But defining &#8220;too far&#8221; has often proved difficult. Indeed, with a few exceptions, the court has eschewed any bright-line rules defining what is or is not a regulatory taking. Instead, the court typically relies on the <span class="casename">Penn Central</span> multi-factor balancing test. </p>

                <p>In <span class="casename">Murr</span>, the definition of the relevant parcel was critical. If the &#8220;parcel as a whole&#8221; was limited to the investment lot, then the regulations clearly wiped out all value of the property. But Wisconsin court of appeals <a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/wisconsin/court-of-appeals/2014/2013ap002828.html">ruled against</a> the Murrs, holding that they were not entitled to compensation, finding that the county ordinance had &#8220;merged&#8221; the two lots into one single lot. Because the Murrs could continue to use this merged property for residential purposes, they did &#8220;not suffer the loss of substantially all of the beneficial uses of his land.&#8221;  Having changed the denominator from one parcel of land to two, the court concluded that the regulation only deprived the Murr&#8217;s of half of their overall property interests and did not therefore rise to the level of a compensable taking.</p>

                <p>The US Supreme Court accepted review of the parcel-as-a-whole question after the Wisconsin Supreme Court refused to consider the appellate decision.  The single question presented asks whether, in a regulatory taking case, the parcel-as-a-whole concept as described in <span class="casename">Penn Central</span> establishes a rule that two legally distinct but commonly owned contiguous parcels must be combined for takings analysis purposes. </p>

                <p>In the decades following <span class="casename">Penn Central</span>, the US Supreme Court has repeatedly expressed discomfort with the parcel-as-a-whole concept, but never fully explained what that term means. One can glean from its earlier decisions, however, that the court never intended the rule to merge separate legal parcels into one lot in circumstances like those presented in <span class="casename">Murr</span>. Indeed, in <span class="casename">Penn Central</span>, the court offered only that <br />
                <blockquote>&#8220;Taking&#8221; jurisprudence does not divide a single parcel into discrete segments and attempt to determine whether rights in a particular segment have been entirely abrogated. In deciding whether a particular governmental action has effected a taking, this court focuses . . . [on] the parcel as a whole.</blockquote> Notably, in deciding that case, the court refused to follow a New York rule that had allowed courts to aggregate an owner&#8217;s other property investments and later criticized the aggregative approach as &#8220;extreme&#8221; and &#8220;unsupportable&#8221; in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=659168721517750079"><span class="casename">Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council</span></a> (1992). In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16252252438303095036"><span class="casename">Palazzolo v. Rhode Island</span></a> (2001), the court noted &#8220;the difficult, persisting question of what is the proper denominator in the takings fraction.&#8221;</p>

                <p>Given this backdrop, the parties&#8217; arguments focus largely on the government&#8217;s authority (or lack thereof) to redefine an owner&#8217;s rights in property through regulations enacted after acquisition of the land. The Murrs <a href="https://www.pacificlegal.org/document.doc?id=2203">argue</a> that their rights in each lot were fixed when they took title. Thus, when the government enacts a regulation after acquisition, the fee title presumptively provides the &#8220;relevant parcel&#8221; for a takings inquiry. In response Wisconsin and St. Croix County <a href="https://www.pacificlegal.org/file/WIRspBrf-Murr-41540.pdf">argue</a> that land-use regulations&#8212whether adopted before or after the property is acquired&#8212shape an owner&#8217;s reasonable expectations in regard to his or her property rights. Thus, according to the government, the Murrs&#8217; expectation that the two lots would continue to be separate legal parcels of land was extinguished by the adoption of a regulation deeming the lots to have been &#8220;merged.&#8221; </p>

                <p>That argument, however, hearkens back to <span class="casename">Palazzolo</span>, which rejected the notion that a &#8220;regulation, once enacted, becomes a background principle of property law.&#8221; Thus, it is unsurprising that the United States, which filed an amicus brief, acknowledged that the court had consistently rejected the circular approach of defining the relevant parcel by the terms of the challenged regulation. Instead, the United States suggested that courts determine the relevant parcel on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the spatial, temporal and functional aspects of an owner&#8217;s property interest.</p>

                <p>The three proposed solutions will have very different impacts on the public. The state and county&#8217;s pro-regulation perspective seeks to preserve the flexibility that an aggregative approach provides for government to achieve its regulatory ends without having to pay just compensation for any resulting impairment of property rights. That approach, however, would allow courts to rule that there has been no taking without ever determining the actual impact to the regulated parcel. That is contrary to the purpose of regulatory takings law, which is intended to determine &#8220;the actual burden imposed on property rights&#8230;how that burden is allocated&#8230;[and] when justice might require that the burden be spread among taxpayers through the payment of compensation.&#8221; <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6222089460041367198"><span class="casename">Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc.</span></a> (2005).</p>

                <p>The pro-regulation approach does more than just insulate the government from the risk of just compensation awards. If adopted, it would inject an unacceptable degree of uncertainty into land development projects. It is common for both residential and commercial development to occur in phases. Typically, lots are developed and sold in order to fund further development in a process that can last years. As lots are sold, the developer does not typically retain an ownership interest in all of the land and his economic expectations with regard to the first phase of the development are considered complete. However, it is common for a developer to retain an interest in individual parcels for future development long after a phase has been completed. Thus, although a developer may hold an interest in several adjacent properties over the course of the entire project, those interests will be temporally severed as phases are completed. They will also be severed by different investment expectations. </p>

                <p>The approach advocated by the state and county would deprive developers of the certainty in their projects by allowing the government to impose severely restrictive regulations then avoid the compensation requirement by exaggerating the relevant parcel. Such a rule would harm more than the developer&#8212it would also harm the public&#8217;s interest in new development, which is absolutely essential in the fight against the skyrocketing cost of housing throughout our nation.</p>

                <p>The United States&#8217; case-by-case approach would do very little to eliminate uncertainty. Under that approach, neither the owner nor the government would be able to predict how a court would determine the relevant parcel when faced with a potential regulatory taking. Moreover, the multi-factor threshold test would only operate to significantly drive up the cost of litigation on both parties.</p>

                <p>By contrast, the approach argued by the Murrs would hold government accountable by confining the relevant parcel determination to the individual lot that is being subjected to burdensome regulation, thereby acknowledging and enforcing the constraints that the Fifth Amendment places on the government&#8217;s authority to regulate private property. Moreover, the Murrs&#8217; approach recognizes that the configuration of any given parcel of property may change over time&#8212;particularly in areas where developable lands are limited and the population continues to grow&#8212;and argues that the metes and bounds as set by the current title should establish the relevant parcel.</p>

                <p>Although the question at issue in <span class="casename">Murr</span> is somewhat esoteric, the answer has the potential to affect the public at large. Indeed, this issue crops up more frequently than one would assume. The Supreme Court is <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docketfiles/15-1192.htm">holding a petition</a> filed by the United States challenging a favorable relevant parcel ruling for a Florida developer pending its decision in <span class="casename">Murr</span>. And a <a href="http://blog.pacificlegal.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/734091-I-Kinderace-Pet-for-Revw.pdf">recent case</a> from Washington State shows that the same questions are dogging courts across the nation.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.utk.edu/people/karla-mckanders/">Karla McKanders</a> of the <a href="http://law.utk.edu/">University of Tennessee College of Law</a> Immigration Clinic discusses the immigration and constitutional questions surrounding Executive Order 13769 ...</p><strong>S</strong>ince Donald Trump signed <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-02-01/pdf/2017-02281.pdf">Executive Order 13769</a>, titled "Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States," on January 27, 2017, approximately 60 lawsuits have been filed challenging the order (several of which have been dismissed or rendered moot). One of the primary challenges to the order is that it unlawfully discriminates against foreign nationals from Muslim majority countries. The order is being viewed by some as the president's veiled attempt to test for future implementation of a ban on immigration by Muslims into the United States. The executive order raises issues relating to balancing the president's broad authority over immigration, known as the plenary powers doctrine, and his ability to take actions in the name of national security with overarching fundamental concepts of non-discrimination and equality enshrined within the Constitution and 8 U.S.C. § 1152(a)(1)(A) <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/laws/immigration-and-nationality-act">Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)</a> that provide a check on unrestrained discriminatory execution actions. </p>

<p>The lawsuits allege, in part, violations of non-discrimination provision of the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1152(a)(1)(A). This provision provides:</p>

<blockquote>no person shall receive any preference or priority or be discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person's race, sex, nationality, place of birth, or place of residence.
</blockquote>

<p>This provision does not protect individuals applying for temporary, non-immigrant, visas.</p>

<p>The lawsuits challenge the parts of the executive order that halt the processing immigrant and non-immigrant visas from specific countries and the refugee resettlement program. Specifically, section 3(c) of the executive order places a 90-day ban on the immigrant and non-immigrant entry of aliens from 212(f) designated countries (INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f)), which include Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. In addition, the executive order suspends the refugee resettlement program for all countries for 120 days (section 5(a)), and indefinitely for Syria (section 5(c)). </p>

<p>The executive order raises issues regarding what constitutes discrimination under the INA where agents of immigration system inherently engage in many forms of discrimination in determining numerical limits for immigrants coming to the US. The significance of the non-discrimination provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act in relation to the executive order must be considered in the historical context in which the provision was passed along with the context in which the President is attempting to invoke his authority over immigration and national security.<br />
	<br />
In enacting the INA of 1965, <a href="http://www.house.gov/">Congress</a> eliminated the quota system based on national origin. It was Congress' intent to equalize immigration opportunities for groups previously subjected to discriminatory immigration laws and practices. In signing the Act, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/presidents/lyndonbjohnson">President Lyndon Johnson</a> stated:<br />
<blockquote>This system [referring to the quota system in place] violates the basic principle of American democracy - the principle that values and rewards each man on the basis of his merit as a man. It has been un-American in the highest sense, because it has been untrue to the faith that brought thousands to these shores even before we were a country.</blockquote> </p>

<p>Given the historical context in which the act was passed, it appears clear that Congress and the president intended to extend civil rights protections beyond the borders of the US. Immigration scholars have posited that the INA was passed with a racial egalitarian motivation. <br />
	<br />
The non-discrimination provision of the INA has rarely been invoked in lawsuits. However, in <u>Legal Assistance for Vietnamese Asylum Seekers v. Department of State</u>, Vietnamese asylum seekers cited the INA in challenging the State Department's refusal to process visas of detained Vietnamese boat people in Hong Kong. The plaintiffs' alleged this refusal violated the INA's non-discrimination provision because it discriminated based on their nationality. The court found that the non-discrimination provision within the INA explicitly prohibited discrimination based on national origin. The court also noted that in the context of this case, it need not decide whether the <a href="https://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> could ever justify an exception under this provision, such a justification, if possible at all, must be most compelling--perhaps a national emergency." <br />
	<br />
Some <a href="http://joshblackman.com/blog/2017/02/06/the-statutory-legality-of-trumps-executive-order-on-immigration-part-iii/">scholars have read the non-discrimination provision of the INA in conjunction with the president's authority</a> under 1182(f), as allowing the exclusion individuals when it is in the national security interest of the country. Similarly, they read provision 1152(a)(2) which states that "[n]othing in this paragraph shall be construed to limit the authority of the Secretary of State to determine the procedures for the processing of immigrant visa applications or the locations where such applications will be processed," as granting the president authority to halt the processing of immigrant visas in the national security interest of the US. Contrastingly, in an <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2017/02/06/17-35105%20Additional%20Law%20Professors%20Amicus%20Motion%20and%20Brief.pdf">amicus brief</a> [PDF] filed in the <u>Washington v. Trump</u> case, several law professors argue that 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f), "which authorizes the president to 'suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate' cannot be read to negate the nondiscrimination requirement in 8 U.S.C. § 1152(a)(1)(A), which was passed before section 1182(f)."<br />
	<br />
In determining whether President Trump's executive order violates the INA, it has been asserted that the president's actions cannot be considered in a vacuum. In the <u>Washington v. Trump</u> complaint, plaintiffs cite statements President Trump made prior to his election as evidence of his discriminatory intent to ban nationals from Muslim majority countries. Specifically, examples cited in the complaint include the following:</p>

<blockquote>- On December 7, 2015, candidate Trump issued a press release calling for "a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States."

<p>- Candidate Trump compared the Muslim ban to former President Franklin Roosevelt's decision to intern Japanese Americans during World War II, and stated, "This is a president highly respected by all, [Roosevelt] did the same thing." </p>

<p>- August 15, 2016, candidate Trump noted that the United States could not "adequate[ly] screen[]" immigrants because it admits "about 100,000 permanent immigrants from the Middle East every year." Trump proposed creating an ideological screening test for immigration applicants, which would "screen out any who have hostile attitudes towards our country or its principles - or who believe that Sharia law should supplant American law." During the <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?413977-1/donald-trump-delivers-foreign-policy-address">speech</a>, he referred to his proposal as "extreme, extreme vetting."</blockquote></p>

<p>During <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/media/view_video.php?pk_vid=0000010885">oral argument</a> before the <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals</a> regarding the district court's issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order, the panel of judges pressed the government's counsel to substantiate whether there exists a national security interest that warrants the president's halt and ban within his Executive Order. Today, the Ninth Circuit issued an <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2017/02/09/17-35105.pdf">order </a> [PDF] upholding the district court's temporary restraining order on the enforcement of the President's Order. The court specifically stated, "the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> has repeatedly and explicitly rejected the notion that the political branches have unreviewable authority over immigration or are not subject to the Constitution when policymaking in that context" (citing <u>Zadvydas v. Davis</u>,  that the power of the political branches over immigration "is subject to important constitutional limitations," also  <u>Chadha</u>, rejecting the argument that Congress has "unreviewable authority over the regulation of aliens," and affirming that courts can review "whether Congress has chosen a constitutionally). Citing the <u>American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm. v. Reno</u>, the Court stated noted that executive decisions related to matters of national security are subject to review when constitutional rights are at stake. <br />
	<br />
The president's executive order appears to be an unprecedented departure from the ideals of the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, which was enacted in part to ensure nondiscrimination. The numerous lawsuits challenging the executive order reaffirm our system of checks and balances.  These lawsuits will determine the limits of presidential plenary powers over immigration and national security while considering the principles of non-discrimination enshrined in the Immigration and Nationality Act and the US Constitution.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Uche Ewelukwa Ofodile of the University of Arkansas School of Law discusses the implications of massive agribusiness mergers in relation to eradicating world hunger ...</p><strong>C</strong>ross-border and multijurisdictional mergers and acquisitions (M&A), joint ventures, and strategic alliances are all the rage today.  For instance, on April 12, 2017, European Union regulators will hand down their decision on China National Chemical Corp.'s (ChemChina) <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/chemchina-syngenta-reply-to-eu-over-merger-2017-01-10">proposed $43 billion takeover</a> of Swiss pesticides and seeds group Syngenta AG. The ChemChina/Sygenta deal is not the only multinational corporate deal that regulatory authorities are grappling with presently.  Meanwhile, under regulatory review in the United States and Europe is <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/saginaw/index.ssf/2017/02/dow_dupont_submit_remedy_packa.html">the blockbuster deal </a>($130 billion) between Dow Chemical and DuPont.  Aside from these two high profile examples, crop protection companies are marrying biological companies, chemical companies are courting seed companies, animal protecting companies are eyeing genetic companies, investment companies are actively chasing food companies and grain trading companies are pursing agricultural supply chain management firms. </p>

<p>To some, cross-border M&As in the agri-food sector are a sign of a robust global economy and carry with them the promise of increased agricultural productivity and innovations that can offer new solutions to the problem of world hunger. However, these consolidations are occurring against the backdrop of alarming global food insecurity (where 795 million people &#8212 about one in nine &#8212 <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4646e.pdf">are malnourished</a> [PDF], volatile commodity prices, dwindling natural resources, increased pressure on small holder agriculture and family farms and rising human security problems in the Global South, where a majority of the world's farmers live.  While the immediate impact on farmers, farm workers and rural communities of cross-border M&As in the agri-food sector may be hard to predict, these deals expose worrying gaps in the global governance architecture, underscore the weaknesses of traditional international institutions in the face of relentless market forces and highlight the problem of fragmentation and lack of coherence in global governance frameworks.</p>

<p>Human rights for all is declared and commitment to eradicate hunger in all countries are announced at the same time that deep-integration trade and investment agreements are negotiated and signed without serious consideration given to how these all fit together. In short, although consolidation in the agricultural sector touches on a host of pressing issues at the meeting point between agriculture, the environment, human rights, international law and commerce, there is little to no synergy among these sectors.</p>

<p><a href="https://imaa-institute.org/mergers-and-acquisitions-statistics/">According to </a>the Institute for Mergers, Acquisition and Alliances (Institute), since 1985, more than 300,000 M&A transactions have been announced with a known value of almost $31 billion. Global cross-border M&As are on the rise as well. <a href="httphttps://www.whitecase.com/publications/insight/globe-trotters-guide-merger-control-how-avoid-falling-traps">According to</a> White & Case LLP, global cross-border M&A activity is running at its highest level since the peak of the previous deal boom in 2007 and most big M&A transactions "now have a significant cross-border dimension." The agribusiness sector is attracting a fair share of overall cross border M&As. Indeed 2016 witnessed the announcement of a several blockbuster deals. Notable consolidation in the agrifood sector announced in the last two years include:</p>

<p>2016:</p>

<p>&#8226 Bayer AG, a German multinational chemical and pharmaceutical company, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2016/09/14/bayer-and-monsanto-merge-in-mega-deal-aimed-at-domi-worlds-food-supply/?utm_term=.8d88095b2def">announced plans </a>to buy U.S.-based Monsanto, the world's largest seed company for $57 billion.</p>

<p>&#8226 Belchim Crop Protection, a Belgian company, <a href="https://www.agra-net.com/agra/agrow/companies-business/mergers-and-acquisitions/belchim-acquires-majority-stake-in-engage-agro--1.htm">acquired </a>a 60% stake in Engage Agro, a Canadian agrochemical company.<br />
	<br />
&#8226 The China National Chemical Corporation (ChemChina) announced plans <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-adama-m-a-sanonda-idUSKCN11J1Z3">to fully acquire</a> Adama Agricultural Solutions Ltd. (formerly Makhteshim Agan Industries Ltd.) an Israeli manufacturer and distributor of generic crop protection products. ChemChina had, in 2013, acquired a 60% stake in Adama.</p>

<p>&#8226 Japanese company, Kubota Corporation, the parent company to Kubota U.S.A., <a href="http://www.greatplainsmfg.com/en/10383/kubota-corporation-expands-long-time-partnership-land-pride-and-enters-agreement-purchase">announced plans</a> to purchase Great Plains Manufacturing, Inc. based in Salina, Kansas.<br />

2015: </p>

<p>&#8226 Trading company Olam International (Singapore) <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cocoa-olam-intl-archer-daniels-idUSKCN0SA24Y20151016">completed</a> the acquisition of the global cocoa business of Archer Daniels Midland Co. (United States) in a deal valued at $1.2 billion.</p>

<p>&#8226 France's Danone, owner of Activia yogurt and Evian water, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/yashili-danone-deals-idUSL3N13R07M20151202">sold its</a> flagship Dumex infant formula unit in China to Yashili International Holdings in return for deeper ties with China Mengniu Dairy Co., China's biggest dairy producer. </p>

<p>&#8226 Brazil's JBS S.A., the world's biggest meat packager, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10323975786436414884004581063782207626542">bought</a> Moy Park, the U.K. poultry unit of Marfrig Global Foods, for $1.5 billion. The JBS-Moy Park deal was reportedly Northern Ireland's biggest ever food deal.<br />
	<br />
&#8226 Wilmar International (Singapore) and investment company, First Pacific (Hong Kong), <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-04/wilmar-first-pacific-take-over-goodman-fielder/6279338">bought</a> consumer foods giant Goodman Fielder (Australia) in a $1.3 billion takeover offer. Wilmar, Asia's largest agribusiness group, is into edible oils, sugar milling and refining, grain processing and a host of ­consumer foods. First Pacific owns a 50 per cent stake in Indonesia's largest food company, Indofood.</p>

<p>Farmers and organizations representing farmers are worried about the consolidation in the agricultural sector. In the wake of the announcement of the Dow Chemical-DuPont deal, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa <a href="http://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/grassley-sends-letter-asking-careful-examination-proposed-dow-dupont-merger">sent a letter</a> to the Department of Justice Antitrust Division asking for a careful analysis of the proposed deal, due to concern that the deal, "will impact competition in the agricultural biotechnology and seed industry ... could raise barriers to entry in the market for smaller companies and potentially harm innovation ... and could adversely impact choice and price of products for farmers and consumers." The Dow Chemical-DuPont merger is also reportedly experiencing serious antitrust pushback in Europe. </p>

<p>Mergers, acquisitions, strategic alliances and joint ventures in the agri-food sector are not new. Indeed, the so-called Big Six &#8212 Monsanto, Syngenta, Bayer, DuPont, Dow and BASF &#8212 are the result of previous waves of consolidation. What is new is the increased role of players from emerging markets in the process of globalization and market integration. Across the globe, emerging market firms are rewriting the rules of M&A or are attempting to do so. In 2013, America's largest pork producer, Smithfield Foods <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/smithfield-foods-to-be-taken-over-by-chinese-firm/2013/05/29/a520434a-c873-11e2-9245-773c0123c027_story.html?utm_term=.23187bd46c5b">was acquired</a> by WH Group, formerly Shuanghui International (China) in a $4.7 billion deal reputed at the time to be the biggest Chinese acquisition of a US company. If approved, the ChemChina/Syngenta deal will be China's biggest foreign deal ever. From all indications, the outward global expansion of emerging market firms is likely to continue. According to a 2015 report from <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/">McKinsey&Company</a>, "[b]y 2020 more than half of global GDP growth is expected to come from countries outside the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development."  </p>

<p>Agricultural M&As are occurring at the same time that the community of states are advancing a somewhat radical <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ecosoc/about/mdg.shtml">post-2015 Development Agenda </a>to address serious global challenges of our time such as systemic poverty, world hunger, rising global security threats and a looming environmental crisis. The 2013 <a href="http://www.post2015hlp.org/the-report/">Report of the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda</a> makes the case for a universal agenda that is driven by five big transformative shifts: (i) Leave no one behind; (ii) Put sustainable development at the core; (iii) Transform economies for jobs and inclusive growth; (iv) Build peace and effective, open and accountable institutions for all; and (v) Forge a new global partnership.  The vision is that of a New Global Partnership that is based on a common understanding of our shared humanity and is underpinned by mutual respect and mutual benefit in a shrinking world. The 2015<a href="https://www.stimson.org/content/report-commission-global-security-justice-governance"> Report of the Commission on Global Security, Justice & Governance </a>came to somewhat similar conclusions. Although calls for a truly inclusive global governance structure is welcomed, how market forces and market actors fit in the new global governance framework is a question that is not always seriously asked.<br />
  <br />
The problem, as already noted, is that although consolidation in the food and agricultural sector touch on a host of pressing issues at the meeting point between agriculture, the environment, human rights, trade and commerce, there is little or no synergy among these sectors. Policy incoherence thus remains a problem in global governance. The present wave of cross-border consolidation in the agri-food sector may be a force for good and may prove to be a tool for advancing the post-2015 development agenda, but still raises some serious questions. For example: </p>

<p>&#8226 What is the likely impact of agribusiness mega-mergers on sustainable development, food security and food sovereignty?</p>

<p>&#8226 What is the impact of consolidation in the agri-food sector on the livelihoods and well-being of small holder agriculture, family farms, farm workers, rural communities and the environment in rich countries as well in poor countries?</p>

<p>&#8226 Will consolidation in the agri-food sector advance or undermine human security, human development and human rights across the world?</p>

<p>&#8226 What global rules regulate cross-border M&As particularly those with potential to impact billions of stakeholders across the world? </p>

<p>&#8226 Do cross-border and multi-jurisdictional M&As pose new challenges that exceed the operational capacities of national regulatory bodies and existing global governance mechanisms?</p>

<p>&#8226 Where do multi-jurisdictional M&As and transnational corporations that drive these deals fit in the vision of a new global partnership that is grounded in solidarity, cooperation and mutual accountability?</p>

<p>&#8226 Is our fragmented international system able to deal with the massive economic transformations that are steadily unfolding? Is it ready to deal with old and emerging actors that are bent on rewriting the rules of the game?</p>

<p>According to the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/policy/untaskteam_undf/">UN System Task Team</a> on the Post-2015 UN Development Agenda, "gaps in the international trade, finance and technology regimes have reinforced rather than curbed global imbalances" and "[a]chieving a more enabling and inclusive system of global economic governance will ... be critical to ... enabling sustainable development." </p>

<p>This begs the question: is a more enabling and inclusive system of global economic governance &#8212 one capable of bringing agribusinesses and small farmers together in the fight against poverty, hunger and biting food insecurity &#8212 really feasible?</p>

<p>Mergers, acquisitions and strategic alliances in the global agricultural and food sector have their champions. It is argued that consolidation in the agri-food sector is designed to improve efficiency, strengthen research and development and speed up technological innovations (e.g. by eliminating duplicate research and development programs) and that these developments will ultimately benefit farmers worldwide and contribute to global food security.  According to this line of argument, although small farmers with agrarian operations may not feel the benefits of the present wave of consolidation, food producers &#8212 the large, specialized producers &#8212 will invariably benefit. While this may be true, the fact that agricultural consolidation is occurring at a time when the world is battling food insecurity, severe pressure on existing natural resources, rising global population, and severe impact of climate change on crops, suggests that arrangements that will bring about seismic shifts in the food and agricultural sector deserve very close scrutiny. Because the global food-and-agribusiness value chain comprises thousands of companies, involves a wide range of stakeholders, and impacts everyone across the globe, the future of our world may well depend on the quality of governance mechanism that is designed to manage the challenges and profound changes occurring in this sector.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://apps.law.asu.edu/Apps/Faculty/Faculty.aspx?individual_id=65847">Jessica Evans</a> of <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a>, discusses ongoing litigation regarding the World Bank's International Finance Corporation's immunity to civil suit ...</p>

                <p><strong>A</strong> few days ago, I had the rare opportunity to watch an arm of the <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/">World Bank</a> answer in court for the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/16/why-the-mundra-power-plant-has-given-tata-a-mega-headache">harm</a> one of its projects allegedly caused.</p>

                <p>The <a href="http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/corp_ext_content/ifc_external_corporate_site/home">International Finance Corporation</a> (IFC), the private-sector lending arm of the World Bank, responded to allegations that a power plant it financed harmed fisher folk in Gujarat, India. Such cases are exceptional because the World Bank Group typically claims immunity as an international organization, which US courts have largely accepted. </p>

                <p>While private banks manage to lend internationally without immunity, the IFC&#8212which lends money to companies with the aim of achieving the World Bank Group&#8217;s <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2013/04/17/ending_extreme_poverty_and_promoting_shared_prosperity">twin goals</a> of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity&#8212contends that it needs immunity from the poor in order to do business.</p>

                <p>There is little recourse for communities harmed by World Bank-financed projects. The communities can appeal to the institution&#8217;s apparent good will, hope that the media will shame the institution into doing the right thing or complain to the institution&#8217;s internal, independent accountability mechanisms. The IFC&#8217;s accountability mechanism, the <a href="http://www.cao-ombudsman.org/">Compliance Advisor Ombudsman</a>, investigates alleged violations of IFC policy. But it is the IFC that determines how to address the investigator&#8217;s findings and often it chooses not to.</p>

                <p>In India, fishing communities and farmers unsuccessfully tried this approach. Even after the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman found that the IFC had breached its policies, the IFC didn&#8217;t fix the problems. So, in April 2015, these communities <a href="https://www.earthrights.org/sites/default/files/documents/ifc_tata_mundra_complaint.pdf">sued</a> the IFC in the US District Court in Washington.  They alleged that the pollution from the IFC-funded Tata Mundra coal-fired power plant in the state of Gujarat was a threat to their health and had destroyed their livelihoods and property. The District Court <a href="https://www.earthrights.org/sites/default/files/documents/jam_v_ifc_-_order_granting_mtd.pdf">dismissed</a> the case, finding that the IFC had not waived its immunity.</p>

                <p>The communities&#8217; lawyers, <a href="https://www.earthrights.org/">EarthRights International</a>, are <a href="https://www.earthrights.org/media/federal-appeals-court-hears-challenge-world-bank-group-immunity">asking</a> the US Court of Appeals to overturn the District Court&#8217;s decision and rule that the IFC&#8217;s immunity is not absolute. They have asked the court to find a narrow gap in the IFC&#8217;s immunity for cases in which the IFC&#8217;s accountability body determined that the IFC caused harm to communities by not complying with its own rules, and in which the IFC failed to address these findings. The case, <span class="casename"><a href="https://dockets.justia.com/docket/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2015cv00612/171393">Budha Ismail Jam v. International Finance Corporation</a></span>, was heard before a three judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. </p>

                <p>The IFC argued that losing &#8220;absolute immunity&#8221; would open the &#8220;floodgates&#8221; for a host of other lawsuits against them. One judge seemed incredulous, asking counsel to clarify that this was in fact the IFC&#8217;s argument. Is it so commonplace for the IFC to defy its own rules that a deluge of cases would follow? The IFC&#8217;s lawyer also said that the IFC would be less willing to make loans if a court could hold the IFC to account when it disregards its own policies.</p>

                <p>Meanwhile, the IFC still won&#8217;t address the problems with Tata Mundra. The day after the hearing, the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman published its most recent <a href="http://www.cao-ombudsman.org/cases/document-links/documents/CGPLSecondCAOMonitoringReportFebruary2017.pdf">monitoring report</a>, highlighting that the IFC still has not fixed the problems it identified more than three years ago. The IFC is sending a clear message that left to its own devices, it won&#8217;t comply with its policies or address the problems it creates. It refuses to fix its mistakes while communities continue to suffer. If the IFC is confident that it is not responsible for the harm the community claimed, it should waive immunity and argue the case on its merits.</p>

                <p>This lawsuit could have been avoided if the IFC&#8217;s board of executive directors required IFC management to fully address the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman&#8217;s findings and work with their clients to remedy all harm that communities suffer. The board is composed of IFC&#8217;s shareholder governments. One judge highlighted the &#8220;awkward position&#8221; that the board is putting the court in by failing to do its job.  </p>

                <p>Tata Mundra is one of several cases in which the IFC has avoided accountability. In November 2016, the ombudsman <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/11/08/world-bank-group-india-tea-investment-tramples-rights">found</a> that the IFC failed to identify and address basic risks like grossly inadequate living conditions for workers and child labor when it invested in an Indian tea project. The IFC has acknowledged some of the findings, while contesting and failing to address others.<br />
                    <br />
                    The IFC&#8217;s immunity puts communities harmed by its investments at the IFC&#8217;s whim. It allows the IFC to violate its own rules with impunity. Holding the IFC to account is long overdue. No institution should have immunity when it causes, contributes to or exacerbates human rights abuses.</p>

The bill makes permanent restrictions on federal funding for abortion in the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/142/text">Hyde Amendment</a>, and restricts the ability of public and private health insurance companies from providing coverage for abortions. HR7 makes the Hyde Amendment funding restrictions permanent so that they can only be reversed by new legislation. The original Amendment provided for an exception to the funding ban for abortions that protect the life of the mother and has since been expanded to include exceptions in cases of rape or incest.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/02/pennsylvania-senate-approves-20-week-abortion-ban.php">Amidst a barrage</a> [JURIST report] of news about <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/01/trump-signs-order-blocking-us-funding-to-foreign-ngos-that-provide-or-promote-abortions.php">abortion funding restrictions</a> [JURIST report], the passage of HR7 is significant because it represents a deeper entrenchment of a decades-long erosion of funding of the abortion right that started with the Hyde Amendment and has since spread to the <a href="http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf">Affordable Care Act</a> (ACA) [PDF]. At the same time, a <a href="http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1394&context=wmjowl">nationwide movement to repeal the Hyde Amendment</a> [PDF] is gaining momentum, lead by <a href="http://allaboveall.org/">All Above All</a>, a coalition of reproductive rights and justice advocates and organizations.</p>

<p>It is a critical time to consider the legal implications of the passage of HR7. <a href="https://www.reproductiverights.org/sites/crr.civicactions.net/files/documents/Hyde_Report_FINAL_nospreads.pdf">Research has shown</a> [PDF] that the constitutional right of abortion cannot be realized if women lack the economic resources to access abortion-related healthcare. Funding restrictions for abortion act as a complete barrier to abortion-related healthcare and disproportionately burden the dignity and bodily autonomy of poor women and women of color. Further funding restrictions create a two-tiered system that protects the constitutional rights of those who can afford them and allows governmental coercion of the reproductive decision-making of those who are most vulnerable. HR7 reduces the value of constitutional rights to mere privileges available only to those with the resources to access abortion-related healthcare. More broadly, federal abortion funding restrictions bring into sharp relief the ways in which access to reproductive rights fall squarely within the pursuit of economic justice.</p>

<p><u>Background</u></p>

<p>In 1973, the Supreme Court in <u><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12334123945835207673&q=Roe+v.+Wade&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Roe v. Wade </a></u>recognized that the fundamental right to privacy includes the right to decide to have an abortion with certain limitations.<a href="https://www.reproductiverights.org/document/roe-v-wade-then-and-now"> One of the earliest attacks on Roe</a> was the Hyde Amendment that excluded abortion coverage from the healthcare services provided to low-income people under the federal Medicaid program. The Hyde Amendment, a budget rider that requires annual congressional approval, has been renewed every year since its introduction in 1976. While most states have similar state-level restrictions on public funding for abortions, currently seventeen states fund abortions for low-income women at the same level as pregnancy-related healthcare. In 2010, <a href="http://kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/coverage-for-abortion-services-and-the-aca/">the Hyde policy was applied to the ACA</a> and prohibited the use of federal tax subsidies and credits from being used in abortion-related healthcare coverage in private insurance markets.</p>

<p>The Hyde Amendment was upheld by a narrow five-four majority in <u><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8833310949486291357&q=+Harris+v.+McRae&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Harris v. McRae.</a></u> The majority held that "a woman's freedom of choice [does not carry] with it a constitutional entitlement to the financial resources to avail herself of the full range of protected choices." In the court's view, in choosing to fund costs related to childbirth while restricting funding of abortion, the state was not interfering with protected activity, but rather was expressing a "value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion and . . . implement[ing] that judgment by the allocation of public funds." It was the woman's poverty and not the denial of Medicaid coverage, that interfered with her ability to get an abortion. The dissent rejected the majority's characterization of funding restrictions as expressing a mere preference for childbirth over abortion. Instead, the dissent understood funding as critical to access to the abortion right for poor women. For the dissent, choice and access to healthcare are integrally linked and the practical effect of burdening an individual's right of access is in effect to unconstitutionally burden the choice itself. As Justice Marshall argued in his dissent: "for a poor person attempting to exercise her 'right' of freedom of choice, . . . [the funding restrictions] have precisely the same effect as an outright prohibition."</p>

<p><u>Abortion Access and Poor Women</u></p>

<p>Restrictions on abortion funding disproportionally impact poor women and women of color who are more likely to be poor and dependent on Medicaid for their healthcare coverage because of barriers resulting from historic discrimination and lack of economic opportunity. Poor women are more likely to need abortion-related healthcare. In 2011, women with income below the federal poverty level were more than <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMsa1506575">five times more likely</a> [PDF] to experience an unintended pregnancy than women with an income at or above 200 percent of the poverty rate. In 2014,<a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/report/characteristics-us-abortion-patients-2014"> 75 percent of abortion patients</a> in the US were low-income patients. Most abortion patients state that their main reason for seeking abortion is because they cannot afford to have a child. Abortion is increasingly concentrated among the poor and access to abortion is critical for those in poverty to keep themselves and their families from sliding further into poverty.</p>

<p>The Hyde Amendment targets the rights of poor women for government regulation. The legislation's drafter, <a href="http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=H001022">Senator Hyde</a>, <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2016/07/abortion-lives-women-struggling-financially-why-insurance-coverage-matters">was clear that his purpose</a> in proposing the Amendment was to prevent abortion:<br />
"I certainly would like to prevent, if I could legally, anybody having an abortion, a rich woman, a middle-class woman, or a poor woman. Unfortunately the only vehicle available is the . . . Medicaid bill."<br />
His comments acknowledge that his measure does not reach rich and poor women equally, but rather that government restrictions on reproductive autonomy falls disproportionately on poor women and their families. As <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/courses/122/hill/marshall.htm">Justice Marshall</a> wrote in<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8833310949486291357&q=+Harris+v.+McRae&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39"> his dissenting opinion</a> in <u>McRae</u>, the Hyde Amendment "is designed to deprive poor and minority women of the constitutional right to choose abortion." Funding restrictions bring into sharp relief that reproductive rights are integrally related to economic injustice.</p>

<p>In the lived experience of poor women and women of color and their families, funding restrictions are the equivalent to an outright ban on abortion. Numerous studies conducted in the years following the Hyde Amendment have provided empirical support for finding that poor women have been forced to carry pregnancies to term for no other reason than that they lacked resources. The <a href="https://www.ansirh.org/research/turnaway-study">Turnaway Study</a> conducted out of the University of California, San Francisco found that among those who sought an abortion but never obtained one, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4151926/pdf/AJPH.2013.301378.pdf">85 percent reported that the reason was cost</a> [PDF]. <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/journals/psrh/1995/03/factors-hindering-access-abortion-services">Studies have shown</a> that from 18 to 35 percent of Medicaid-eligible women who want abortions, but who live in states that do not provide funding for abortion, have been forced to carry their pregnancies to term. Funding restrictions create extreme hardship for women and families seeking abortion. A study showed that nearly <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2000/04/rights-without-access-revisiting-public-funding-abortion-poor-women">60 percent of women on Medicaid</a> were forced to use money to pay for abortion that would otherwise be used to pay for living expenses. <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/pubs/journals/j.whi.2013.03.001.pdf">For more than half of the women in the Turnaway Study</a> who received an abortion, their out-of-pocket expenses exceed one-third of their monthly income. In the same study, <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/pubs/2006/10/17/Contraception74-4-334_Finer.pdf">45 percent of the women </a> reported that their abortions were delayed due to raising money for abortion services. Delay in seeking abortion can increase the risk and cost of the procedure. The empirical data of abortion access reveals that funding restrictions have created a two-tiered system of abortion rights in which only those with means can afford to access abortion-related healthcare.</p>

<p><u>Poverty and Access to Constitutional Rights</u></p>

<p>The Court has recognized that the fundamental right of privacy includes the right to decide to have an abortion. <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/40389510.pdf">Many scholars have argued </a>[PDF] that women's ability to control their reproduction through contraceptives and abortion is a critical aspect of women's equal citizenship. Access to abortion and contraception allows women to seek education, participate in the workforce, escape abusive relationships, pull one's family out of poverty, and live life with dignity and autonomy. When seen in this context, funding restrictions are more than simply the state expressing a preference for childbirth over abortion. Rather, the state is creating a barrier that denies the most vulnerable women access to a constitutional right of autonomy that is integrally related to equal citizenship, dignity and autonomy.</p>

<p>Insurance funding restrictions for abortion fail to acknowledge that abortion is essential healthcare. The dissent in <u><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4067161982742187409&q=Beal+v.+Doe&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&as_vis=1">Beal v. Doe</a></u> which upheld state-level funding restrictions for non-therapeutic abortions, described that <blockquote>"[a]bortion and childbirth, when stripped of the sensitive moral arguments surrounding the abortion controversy, are simply two alternative medical methods of dealing with pregnancy."</blockquote></p>

<p>In a period of rapid healthcare expansion under the ACA, poor women and women of color are being denied access to basic women's health. Prior to passage of the ACA, <a href="http://files.kff.org/attachment/coverage-for-abortion-services-and-the-aca-issue-brief">87 percent of private health insurance</a> [PDF] plans covered abortion. The statistics that <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2016/07/abortion-lives-women-struggling-financially-why-insurance-coverage-matters">one in three women of childbearing age </a>has had an abortion highlights how common abortion-related healthcare is in women's reproductive lives. Instead funding restrictions that exclude abortion from healthcare insurance coverage identify abortion as a constitutional claim but fail to recognize it as healthcare, and women who seek abortion are conceptualized as rights-holders rather than as healthcare consumers. For women who are unable to raise funds to pay for their abortion-related healthcare, the nominal right to decide to have an abortion is an abstract right in the absence of meaningful access to affordable abortion care.</p>

<p><u>New Legal Strategies</u></p>

<p>The many challenges facing abortion rights under the current administration, require new legal strategies aimed at addressing access to abortion for poor women and women of color. <a href="http://allaboveall.org/announcement/women-are-already-being-punished-for-having-abortions/">The movement to repeal the Hyde Amendment</a> is gaining momentum, lead by <a href="http://allaboveall.org/">All Above All</a>. In addition, many reproductive rights and justice advocates are l<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/31/magazine/the-dawn-of-the-post-clinic-abortion.html">aying the groundwork for broad access to abortion pills</a>, mifepristone and misoprostol, over the counter and by mail. Abortion pills have been available through pharmacies and mail-order for women all over the world but because of tight FDA regulations, <a href="http://www.escrh.eu/sites/escrh.eu/files/nejm_23feb.pdf">U.S. women have not had access to abortion medication</a> [PDF] outside of the clinical context. A study currently underway in four states by <a href="http://gynuity.org/">Gynuity Health Projects</a> is <a href="http://gynuity.org/programs/more/providing-medical-abortion-using-telemedicine/">studying the safety and efficacy</a> of pregnant women receiving abortion medication through the mail after an online or telephone consultation with a healthcare provider. Numerous studies conducted to date have found that abortion medication is safe and effective.<a href="http://www.ibisreproductivehealth.org/sites/default/files/files/publications/TxPEP_Texas%20womens%20experiences%20self%20induction_ResearchBrief_17Nov2015.pdf]"> A study conducted in Texas</a> [PDF] after one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country, HB2, the subject of <u><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12719084930434459940&q=Whole+Woman%E2%80%99s+Health+v.+Hellerstedt&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt,</a></u> went into effect in 2013, revealed that there was a sharp increase in the number of pregnant women who attempted to end their pregnancies on their own outside of the clinical setting. The study put the estimate as high as 100,000 to 240,000 women.  Mail-order abortion drugs may be one answer to ensuring access to abortion-related healthcare for women who are poor and lack access to abortion-related healthcare due to cost and access barriers. Medication abortion is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21556304">safe, effective, less expensive</a> than surgical abortion, and <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2013/03/medication-abortion-restrictions-burden-women-and-providers-and-threaten-us-trend-toward">saves the cost and time</a> of travelling long distances to abortion clinics. In light of its safety and efficacy, some researchers are calling for abortion drugs to be available over-the-counter and have suggested calling it "Plan C" in reference to the morning-after pill, RU486 that is sold under the name "Plan B." Access to medication abortion<a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/journals/ipsrh/2011/09/medication-abortions-may-be-equally-safe-whether-done-home-or-clinic"> through the mail or over the counter </a>would dramatically increase access and lower cost for women who do not live in one of the seventeen states that currently offer abortion care under state-funded healthcare systems.   </p>

<p>It is critical to consider new legal strategies to ensure abortion access to all pregnant people, especially those who are disproportionately impacted by these funding restrictions. However the recent funding restrictions highlight only one of the many ways in which economic, political, and structural barriers disproportionately deny poor women and women of color access to reproductive rights and justice, not only with respect to abortion, but in all aspects of their reproductive lives. It is equally important to consider the abortion funding restrictions against the backdrop of the lack of support in place for women and their families who carry pregnancies to term, either by choice or because they could not afford an abortion. Social supports such as subsidized daycare, paid family leave and employment protections for pregnancy for many low-wage jobs are effectively non-existent. For women living on welfare, family caps prevent her from obtaining additional resources necessary to provide for a new baby. The passage of HR7 highlights the integral relationship between poverty and abortion access. The lived experience of poor women and women of color since passage of the Hyde Amendment reveals that reproductive justice is inseparable from the quest for economic justice.</p>

		<title>Travel Ban Challenges Present a Non-Reviewable Political Question</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Victor Williams discusses separation of powers between the Executive and Judicial branches, and how this relates to the travel restrictions imposed by Donald Trump...</p>

<p>Among President Donald Trump's fundamental constitutional duties are implementing war strategy as Commander-in-Chief and developing security-related foreign policy as Chief Executive. The president has inherent and exclusive Article II authorities in this area.</p>

<p>The Ninth Circuit panel's ruling in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13663514430846630216">Washington v. Trump</a>, affirming District Judge Robart's TRO suspension of the travel ban, was a shocking usurpation of those Executive powers.   <br />
Or to make this argument re-tweetable: </p>

<p><strong>USA at war. Extreme vetting of aliens not on American soil, not the judiciary's &#$% business!!! SEE YOU COURT!!</strong></p>

<p>Other important court challenges against the January 27th executive order continue to develop in New York and  Virginia. And new lawsuits should be expected after President Trump issues his "streamlined" Travel Ban 2.0.  </p>

<p>The month-old Trump administration is to be commended for its strategic defense against the multi-front legal assault. Donald Trump must fight and win these skirmishes for the sake of the war on terror, and for his broader disruptive agenda to put America first. <br />
 <br />
Now that Attorney General Jeff Sessions is finally on the job, Trump can hope for much better representation than he received from DOJ's publically-insubordinate Sally Yates or the sincere but less-than-zealous August Flentje.</p>

<p>Trump's lawyers must destroy the challengers' purported standing while demanding the federal judiciary's recognition of the president's broad statutory authority under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1182">8 USC 1182(f)</a>. (Neither the Ninth Circuit panel nor Judge Robart analyzed, or even so much as cited the controlling statute.) Congress has explicitly delegated its Article I authority over these immigration matters to the Executive.    </p>

<p>But it is not enough for DOJ to assert substantial statutory authority over immigration. Donald Trump must forcefully, if alternatively, argue that challenges to the travel restrictions present a nonjusticiable political question.</p>

<p>Our judiciary is being drawn into the densest of modern "political thickets." The courts must be persuaded to voluntarily withdraw from reviewing the challenges and immediately exit the escalating, post-election fight between ideological elites and Donald Trump.  </p>

<p>At issue is nothing less than the separation of powers and basic principles of government by consent. The judiciary's full accession to abstention in these matters is imperative for its own continued credibility. Consider a terrorist attack causally connected to the judicial interference.<br />
   <br />
The Constitution textually grants the president the exclusive responsibility to implement war strategy and foreign policy to defeat America's foreign enemies. Only the president has the institutional competence to know what specific actions are required to fulfill that responsibility. And foreign-soil aliens have no standing to raise constitutional liberties that allegedly might conflict. It is a classic political question.</p>

<p>Throughout our Republic's history, the Supreme Court has recognized that some issues are committed by the Constitution's text to the exclusive discretion of the elected political branches. When these political questions manifest, the judiciary must keep out of any dispute.<br />
 <br />
Congressman John Marshall, in 1800, warned his US House colleagues that the political branches would be "swallowed-up by the judiciary" without such abstention.</p>

<p>And as Chief Justice, Marshall provided early nonjusticiability guidance in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/5/137">Marbury v. Madison</a>: "<em>By the constitution of the United States, the President is invested with certain important political powers, in the exercise of which he is to use his own discretion, and is accountable only to his country in his political character, and to his own conscience</em>."  </p>

<p>Much later, Associate Justice Robert Jackson recognized that foreign policy decisions "<em>are delicate, complex, and involve large elements of prophecy. They are and should be undertaken only by those directly responsible to the people whose welfare they advance or imperil</em>."  In <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/333/103/case.html">Chicago & Southern Airlines v. Waterman</a>, Jackson further emphasized that such "<em>decisions are of a kind for which the Judiciary has neither aptitude, facilities nor responsibility and have long been held to belong in the domain of political power not subject to judicial intrusion or inquiry</em>."</p>

<p>More recently in her 2015 <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/10-699.pdf">Zivotofsky v. Clinton</a> [PDF] concurrence, Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor stressed the importance of abstention to honor the separation of powers. As she had done when <span class="casename">Zivotofsky</span> was first before the Court, Sotomayor reiterated the modern political question doctrine as developed in such cases as <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/369/186">Baker v. Carr</a>, <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/444/996/case.html">Goldwater v. Carter</a>, and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/91-740.ZS.html">Nixon v. US</a>.    </p>

<p>And in <span class="casename">Zivotofsky</span> dissent that urged abstention, Associate Justice Steve Breyer detailed in full how judicial review in the foreign policy context can pose a "<em>serious risk</em>" of "<em>embarrassment, show lack of respect for the other branches, and potentially disrupt sound foreign policy decision making</em>." </p>

<p>Breyer particularly urged application of political question doctrine in matters involving a situs of global political chaos: "<em>[I]n the Middle East, administrative matters can have implications that extend far beyond the purely administrative. Political reactions in that region can prove uncertain.</em>" </p>

<p>Perhaps the Court's earlier application of the doctrine in <span class="casename">Goldwater v. Carter</span> best informs. The Court rejected review of a congressional delegation's challenge to President Jimmy Carter's foreign policy decision to terminate a defense treaty with Taiwan&#8212;without acquiescence of the House and/or the Senate. </p>

<p>Then-Associate Justice William Rehnquist wrote: "<em>Here, while the Constitution is express as to the manner in which the Senate shall participate in the ratification of a treaty, it is silent as to that body's participation in the abrogation of a treaty.</em>"  </p>

<p>The Constitution is dead silent as to any support for Washington State's absurd standing claim of concrete injury when its businesses are denied tourism revenues, and its universities are denied faculty services and student tuition dollars of visiting aliens from terrorist-breeding nations.   </p>

<p>The Ninth Circuit panel's promulgation of Washington State's interest to "assert the rights" of alien students, faculty, and even their holidaying families to enter, leave, and re-enter America would be laughable if it were not so dangerous. And the implication of prospective due process rights for all such aliens is ludicrous.      </p>

<p>Beyond applying the <span class="casename">Baker v. Carr</span> enumerated formula, Trump's lawyers should also boldly raise the less "domesticated" judicial abstention promoted by the late Alexander Bickel. In this time of an unusual war with terrorists, prudence should compel courts to abstain where the strangeness, intractability, and/or momentous nature of an issue might tend to "<em>unbalance judicial judgment.</em>" </p>

<p>Disturbingly prescient, Alexander Bickel addressed "<em>the anxiety, not so much that the judicial judgment will be ignored but that it should but will not be.</em>"</p>

<p>Professor Bickel described "<em>the inner vulnerability, the self-doubt of an institution which is electorally irresponsible and has no earth to draw strength from.</em>" </p>

<p>Today our unelected judiciary, which has "no earth to draw strength from," should stay out of the worsening mud-fight between the ideological elites and Donald John Trump.  </p>

<p>Lastly, it should be noted that "finality" is one the political question doctrine's greatest virtues.<br />
 <br />
As Trump derangement syndrome appears virulently contagious among the elites &#8212; particularly among lawyers who need only the federal court filing fee to make manifest their disorder &#8212; finality is needed to retard future litigation against Donald Trump's governance.   </p>

<p><em>Victor Williams is a longtime Washington, D.C. attorney and law professor who has supported the constitutional discretion of the past four presidents. During the 2016 campaign Williams chaired "Lawyers and Law Professors for Trump" which is now being rebranded as an advocacy platform "<a href="http://americafirstlawyers.com/">America First Lawyers Association</a>." He recently lodged an amicus curiae brief in the Ninth Circuit case raising the political question nonjusticiability issue. <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnists <a href="https://apps.law.asu.edu/Apps/Faculty/Faculty.aspx?individual_id=65847">James G. Hodge, Jr.,</a> Sarah Arnold and Sarah Wetter of <a href="https://www.law.asu.edu/">The Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law,</a> Arizona State University, discuss premier takeaways from the recent amendments to the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (aka the "Common Rule")...</p><strong>O</strong>n January 19, 2017, the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/">Office for Human Research Protections</a> (OHRP), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and multiple federal agencies published final amendments to the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/19/2017-01058/federal-policy-for-the-protection-of-human-subjects">Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects</a> (aka the "<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/common-rule/index.html">Common Rule"</a>). Introduced in 1991 based on research ethics <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/index.html">principles</a> dating back to the early 1970s, the Common Rule was viewed by many as <a href="http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2017/02/06/a-new-day-for-oversight-of-human-subjects-research/">antiquated</a> given <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMp1700736">shifts</a> in research practices over decades.  </p>

<p>Research enterprises previously based largely in academic and medical institutions <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/21824/chapter/1#v">expanded</a> exponentially into private sector entities. Conducting research moved far beyond clinical trials to extensive assessments of biospecimens, genetic data and private health information. </p>

<p>In amending the Common Rule, OHRP attempts to simultaneously enhance protections for human subjects while limiting administrative burdens for researchers. It is a difficult balance given competing demands among researchers, subjects and funders reflected in thousands of public comments and multiple professional reviews.  </p>

<p>While many of the changes to the Common Rule will not take effect until <a href="http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2017/02/06/a-new-day-for-oversight-of-human-subjects-research/">January 2018</a>, essential themes already impact researchers, subjects, administrators and attorneys representing their interests. We lay out below 10 premier "take-aways" from the amended Common Rule including major changes to come and opportunities foregone.   </p>

<p><strong>1. Defining Human Subjects Research: What It Is and Is Not </strong></p>

<p>A significant change to the Common Rule is its definition of "research," particularly concerning the types of activities that are excluded or exempted. OHRP largely retains the same basic working definition of "<a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-19/html/2017-01058.htm">research</a>" focused on systematic investigations designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge. </p>

<p>However, several activities once viewed as research among institutional review boards (IRBs) are now explicitly categorized as "not research." These include scholarship, criminal justice data collections and activities in pursuit of national security objectives. Additional activities still classifiable as research are nonetheless "exempt" from the Rule's application including educational studies, behavioral assessments, public benefit program reviews and secondary studies or storage of some biospecimen and private data collections (discussed below). </p>

<p><strong>2. Distinguishing Public Health Practice and Research </strong></p>

<p>Additionally excluded from the Rule's application are public health surveillance activities. For decades, governmental public health authorities have contested with OHRP and IRBs on whether activities classifiable as public health surveillance (including epidemiologic investigations) somehow constitute human subjects research. Neither the prior version of the Common Rule, nor the subsequent <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/index.html?language=es">HIPAA Privacy Rule</a>, adequately addressed this issue. </p>

<p>Though not completely resolved, the distinction between public health practice and research is clarified. Routine and emergency public health surveillance <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11770/">activities</a> conducted by governmental agencies and their contracted partners are not considered research. Explicit recognition of this distinction between public health practice and research may diffuse prior instances where IRBs unnecessarily required public health agencies to meet research requirements for surveillance activities.</p>

<p><strong>3. New Requirements for IRBs and Multi-Institutional Studies</strong></p>

<p>Effective January 19, 2020, the Rule generally requires multi-institutional studies to utilize a single IRB for human subjects research conducted within the United States. The reviewing IRB will be chosen either by the federal agency funding the project or by the lead research institution with federal approval. </p>

<p>Additionally, under the new Rule, studies on the HHS Secretary's <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/categories-of-research-expedited-review-procedure-1998/">list</a> of expeditable research can be approved via expedited review, unless the reviewer determines that the study involves greater than minimal risk and documents the justification for their decision. IRBs do not need to conduct continuing review of studies approved via expedited review, unless reviewer explicitly justifies why continuing review would better protect research subjects. </p>

<p><strong>4. Common Rule Coverage of Vulnerable Populations</strong></p>

<p>IRBs must address the needs of vulnerable populations when considering participant selection, additional safeguards and IRB membership. "<a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-19/pdf/2017-01058.pdf">Vulnerability</a>" under the amended Rule means exposure to <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/billofhealth/2015/11/23/vulnerability-coercion-and-undue-influence-from-the-mud-into-the-muck/">coercion</a> or undue influence, and not necessarily other types of vulnerability such as historical marginalization stemming from racial or gender discrimination.</p>

<p>The new Rule <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-19/pdf/2017-01058.pdf">lists</a> "children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons," as examples of vulnerable populations, but excludes pregnant women and people with physical disabilities. Additionally, in line with the <a href="http://www.inclusionproject.org/nip_userfiles/file/People First Chart.pdf">person-first</a> movement, the Rule <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-19/pdf/2017-01058.pdf">replaces</a> the term "mentally disabled person" with "individuals with impaired decision-making capacity." </p>

<p><strong>5. Informed Consent Requirements</strong></p>

<p>To make <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3146080/">informed consent</a> documents more <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa021212#t=article">comprehensible</a>, the amended Rule requires consent forms to begin with a brief discussion of information (e.g., risks and benefits) most likely to assist a prospective subject or legally-authorized representative in deciding whether to participate in a study. </p>

<p>Furthermore, as a whole, informed consent must be organized to allow potential subjects to grasp the pertinent reasons for their participation. This is a marked departure from the haphazard listing of isolated facts that have often filled long and overly-complex informed consent forms. These changes help further the purpose of informed consent: to provide sufficient information so that every participant can intelligibly and voluntarily decide whether to enroll. </p>

<p>To increase transparency, either the federal agency supporting each clinical research trial or the institution conducting it must post one IRB-approved consent form on a publicly-available federal website. </p>

<p><strong>6. Defining and Revising the Concept of Identifiable Biospecimens</strong></p>

<p>In light of increased genetic research, the Rule newly defines "<a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-19/pdf/2017-01058.pdf">identifiable biospecimen</a>" to include those human materials from which the identity of the subject could be readily ascertained. As tools and technologies advance, increasingly personal information can be generated from <a href="https://www.ijpc-se.org/documents/hhs11.pdf">"non-identifiable" biospecimens</a>, raising significant ethical questions for researchers. </p>

<p>In response, the Rule obligates federal agencies to reexamine and issue guidance on what constitutes an identifiable biospecimen every four years. Agencies must assess whether analytic technologies can generate identifying information from otherwise non-identifiable biospecimens. If so, consent must be obtained before applying the technology to the biospecimen. Though truly non-identifiable biospecimens are <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/339/6117/321.long">increasingly a fallacy</a>, the Rule offers the flexibility needed to craft revised protections as technology advances. </p>

<p><strong>7. Consent for Research Involving Biospecimens and Identifiable Data </strong></p>

<p>Contrary to prior proposed revisions to the Rule, OHRP declined to extend the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3216676/">informed consent</a> provision to non-identifiable biospecimens, instead requiring consent only for identifiable biospecimens. The Rule further permits researchers to seek broad consent for the storage, maintenance and secondary use of participants' identifiable information and biospecimens. Participants can grant researchers permission to re-use their biospecimens in unspecified, future studies without having to re-obtain the participants' consent. </p>

<p>Understanding genetic variation and associated health outcomes requires access to comprehensive collections of biospecimens and personal information. The Rule attempts to balance these interests with participants' desire for control over uses of their data. Where researchers clarify the scope of provided consent, participants can be better informed of the study's potential risks and future implications.</p>

<p><strong>8. Review of Identifiable Data or Specimens for Prospective Research Subjects </strong></p>

<p>Researchers' limited access to existing storages of private information and identifiable biospecimens to screen, recruit and determine the eligibility of prospective participants is authorized. Even where prior participants declined to grant researchers consent to re-use their biospecimens for <a href="https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-015-0020-1">secondary purposes</a>, researchers can reexamine their <a href="https://oir.nih.gov/sites/default/files/uploads/sourcebook/documents/ethical_conduct/guidelines-biospecimen.pdf">stored biospecimens</a> to determine if they would be ideal candidates for subsequent studies.</p>

<p>Allowing access to sensitive information outside the scope of consent may facilitate research efficiency, but is legally and ethically suspect. Individuals and their family members have an interest in protecting their genetic data from unwarranted accesses and disclosures. Without significant limitations and specific confidentiality mandates on the entities that can access the databanks, data breaches and resulting legal challenges may follow. </p>

<p><strong>9. Status Quo on Privacy Safeguards</strong></p>

<p>One's willingness to participate in a research study likely depends on the perceived level of privacy and security. Yet the Rule excludes a <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2015-09-08/pdf/2015-21756.pdf">proposed provision</a> that would have required researchers to implement and maintain reasonable and appropriate safeguards as specified by HHS to protect biospecimens and private information. </p>

<p>The implications of unauthorized accesses to participants' sensitive information warrant heightened protections. Release of Medicare or Social Security data can pose financial risks, while disclosure of chronic illness or mental health status could cause social or emotional damage. Investigators and IRBs have demonstrated competence in requiring appropriate privacy and security safeguards even without specific mandates from the Rule. However, they may not always have the needed expertise to evaluate the risks amidst increasing advancements in <a href="http://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/confidentiality-privacy-and-institutional-review-boards#.WKYJohiZM_U">information technology</a>.  </p>

<p><strong>10. Common Rule Coverage Limited to Federally-funded Research</strong></p>

<p>Extending the Common Rule to cover certain types of non-federally funded clinical trials was considered and ultimately rejected by OHRP. As a result, the Rule still applies only to human subjects research conducted or supported by a federal department or agency that has adopted its provisions. </p>

<p>While it does not cover <a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/1835491">non-federally funded research</a>, federal agencies can, and often do, require entities receiving federal research funds to apply Common Rule protections to all of the entity's research with human subjects. </p>

<p>Furthermore, most institutions voluntarily adopt policies requiring IRB approval for non-federally funded research and other Common Rule requirements. To this end, the Rule as amended will have broader applications than its limited jurisdiction suggests.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Underlying these and other Common Rule amendments is a balance between promoting modern research practices and respecting individual and group privacy. Allowing extensive, secondary uses of research banks based on subjects' initial broad consents and without heavy IRB oversight may generate new findings at less costs. However, unfettered access to identifiable data or specimens lends to public concerns over confidentiality, especially in an era of cyber-security threats, leading some to forego research participation altogether.<br />
 <br />
Whether the needs and interests of funders, researchers and subjects are properly accommodated in the revised Rule is open for debate. Yet, to the extent that it reflects the gamut of data and specimen collections, reframes informed consent practices, improves IRB oversight and allows for ongoing fine-tuning based on new findings or technologies, the revised Common Rule offers individuals greater protections against unethical practices.</p>

Tucker</a> Executive Director of End of Life Liberty Project (ELLP) discusses the End of Life Option Act adopted by California... </p><strong>C</strong>alifornia adopted the <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520162AB15">End of Life Option Act (EOLOA)</a> in October 2015, establishing statutory permission for aid in dying (<a href="https://www.apha.org/policies-and-advocacy/public-health-policy-statements/policy-database/2014/07/29/13/28/patients-rights-to-self-determination-at-the-end-of-life">AID</a>), the medical practice in which a physician provides a mentally competent terminally ill patient with a prescription for medication that the patient may ingest to achieve a peaceful death. California was the fourth state to adopt such a statute, following <a href="https://public.health.oregon.gov/ProviderPartnerResources/EvaluationResearch/DeathwithDignityAct/Pages/ors.aspx">Oregon</a>, <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=70.245">Washington</a> and <a href="http://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/fullchapter/18/113">Vermont</a>. Recently, <a href="https://www.deathwithdignity.org/states/colorado/">Colorado</a> and the <a href="https://www.deathwithdignity.org/states/district-of-columbia/">District of Columbia</a> adopted similar measures. All impose a number of burdens and restrictions on accessing AID.<br />
                <br />
                The first state to vote on a measure intended to empower terminally ill patients with physician-assisted dying was Washington in 1991. California unsuccessfully tried a similar measure the next year. Opponents argued that there were insufficient "safeguards". Voters were swayed by this concern, despite strong public support for AID. Learning from these attempts, Oregonians embraced a 'throw in the kitchen sink' approach and put forth a measure thick with "safeguards." In 1994 Oregon voters adopted the first AID statute in the United States. Implementation of Oregon&#8217;s law was delayed for several years, until a <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17952723309407796690">lawsuit</a> challenging its validity was resolved late in 1997. Beginning in 1998 Oregon became the first state with an open practice of AID.<br />
                <br />
                In 2015 California legislators adopted an Oregon-style AID measure, though slightly more restrictive. While in some ways the EOLOA can be considered a step forward, in others it represents a step backwards. The "step forward" perspective recognizes that California is the largest, most populous and most demographically diverse state to adopt an AID law. The "step backward" can be seen in the fact the EOLOA imposes all of the burdens and limitations as does the original Oregon Measure and goes beyond in imposing both an <a href="https://www.deathwithdignity.org/caforms/">additional restriction</a> and a <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/california/2011/hsc/division-20/25299.81/25299.81/">sunset provision</a>.<br />
                <br />
                Oregon&#8217;s nearly 20 years experience with AID has been closely watched and studied. The State <a href="https://public.health.oregon.gov/ProviderPartnerResources/EvaluationResearch/DeathwithDignityAct/Pages/ar-index.aspx">annually reports</a> on implementation of the program, and a plethora of <a href="http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/whitlr33&div=8&id=&page=">article</a>s examining and discussing the data have been published. The consensus has emerged that availability of AID improves end-of-life care and presents no risk.<br />
                <br />
                Accordingly, it would be appropriate for <a href="http://www.suffolk.edu/documents/Law%20Journal%20of%20H%20and%20B/Tucker-2-19.pdf">the practice to become more normalized</a> within the practice of medicine, with less government oversight and regulation. The regulation of the practice of medicine is not commonly governed by statute; rather it is primarily governed by professional practice standards as they evolve in practice; in other words&#8212;by standard of care. However, the EOLOA is "Oregon Plus": imposing all of the intrusive, burdensome government involvement into medical practice that the Oregon statute requires and adding some additional burden and limitation. The <a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-van-zandt-assisted-suicide-20160814-snap-story.html">obstruction faced by patients is apparent</a> in accounts of families of patients who have attempted to run the gauntlet of requirements in order for the dying patient to achieve a more peaceful death through aid in dying.</p>

                <p>Prior to enactment of the EOLOA, two cases had been filed in California seeking clarification of the reach of California&#8217;s statute that makes a crime of "assisting" a "suicide." <a href="https://www.law360.com/articles/620885/sf-cancer-patients-doctors-sue-calif-for-aid-in-dying"><em>Brody v. Harris</em></a>, <a href="http://www.leagle.com/decision/In%20CACO%2020151029062/DONOROVICH-ODONNELL%20v.%20HARRIS">Donorovich-O'Donnell v. Harris</a>. Plaintiffs, patients and physicians, argued that this law should not apply to physicians providing AID because the choice of a dying patient for a peaceful death is not &#8220;suicide&#8221;; alternatively, plaintiffs argued that the choice at issue deserved protection under California's constitutional guarantees of privacy and equal protection. Adoption of the EOLOA mooted the statutory scope claim, as it made clear that physicians who provide aid in dying cannot be  prosecuted for &#8216;assisted suicide.&#8217;</p>

                <p>Neither of these cases reached the California Supreme Court. Hence the question of whether state constitutional protection extends to the choice of a dying patient for a more peaceful death through AID has not been resolved. It is this commentator's view that the <em>Donorovich</em> court applied law incorrectly and its opinion ought not be persuasive to the California Supreme Court.<br />
                    <br />
                    California courts have repeatedly held that the scope of California's constitutional right of personal autonomy privacy is greater than that protected by the federal Constitution. California&#8217;s privacy jurisprudence has often been ahead of that of the SCOTUS. California's Supreme Court recognized &#8220;[t]he fundamental right of [a] woman to choose whether to bear children&#8221; in invalidating its ban on abortion four years before the SCOTUS recognized this right in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12334123945835207673">Roe v. Wade</a>.<br />
                    <br />
                    Jurisprudence concerning reproductive freedom may be especially relevant to AID. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13603819742685248373">California decisions</a> have held the right of a woman to control her body and to choose to terminate a previable pregnancy as "clearly among the most intimate and fundamental of all constitutional rights." The right of a woman to control her body has been grounded in the right of privacy. The decision of a dying patient about how much suffering to endure prior to death is of a similar profoundly personal nature, concerning one&#8217;s own body, medical treatment, and life course. Because the only life at issue in AID is that of the dying patient, the greatest complexity present in the abortion context&#8212;the potential life of the fetus&#8212;is absent. Respecting this decision does not result in a reality where doing so ends a potential life with no voice in the decision. Principles that compel respect for a woman&#8217;s decision to control her body through abortion apply with equal force to the decision of an individual regarding how much suffering to endure in the final throes of terminal illness, and hence whether to choose AID.<br />
                    <br />
                    Under this approach, the California Supreme Court ought find a privacy or equal protection interest in choosing AID, and hold legislation constraining exercise of this choice to the standard articulated in <em>American Academy of Pediatrics</em>. The State would be required to prove that it has a compelling interest at stake, that it achieves its interest in the least intrusive way, and that the restrictions are narrowly drawn to impinge upon the constitutionally protected area no more than is necessary. It is unlikely that several of the EOLOA provisions could meet this exacting test, including the fifteen-day waiting period. The state might argue that it has an interest in ensuring that a patient&#8217;s choice of AID is carefully considered and enduring, and that this interest is served by the waiting period. In the reproductive rights arena at the federal level <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/counseling-and-waiting-periods-abortion">waiting periods</a> of much shorter duration have been allowed&#8212;most commonly twenty-four hours. And, notably, a medical emergency exception to mandatory waiting periods are included, which the EOLOA lacks.</p>

                <p>In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6298856056242550994"> Planned Parenthood v. Casey</a>, the court upheld a state&#8217;s twenty-four hour abortion waiting period stating that &#8220;only where state regulation imposes an undue burden on a woman's ability to make this decision does the power of the State reach into the heart of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause.&#8221; The court stated that an undue burden exists if &#8220;a state regulation has the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus.&#8221; The Court elaborated on the &#8220;substantial obstacle&#8221; test, stating &#8220;the means chosen by the State to further the interest in potential life must be calculated to inform the woman's free choice, not hinder it.&#8221;</p>

                <p>The fact that the statute contained an emergency exception to the waiting period was significant, as was absence of findings that a twenty-four hour waiting period created &#8220;appreciable health risks.&#8221; The EOLOA&#8217;s failure to include an emergency exception renders it vulnerable, and certainly imposing a wait period causes the patient harm, as additional suffering must be endured or, even worse, sometimes the patient dies exactly the sort of death hoped to be avoided during the long waiting period.<br />
                    <br />
                    A state might assert an interest in ensuring that a patient choosing AID is not acting impulsively and that this interest is served by a waiting period &#8212;though why, specifically, the state has an interest in this is unclear. Even if the state establishes an interest, it could be served by a much shorter period. Patients <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/great-reads/la-me-c1-assisted-death-20150519-story.html">choosing</a> aid in dying do so because they find themselves in an unbearable dying process, where the cumulative burden of suffering imposed by their end stage terminal illness is overwhelming. Forcing them to suffer longer, and possibly be forever denied the right to access aid in dying, seems unjustifiable. </p>

                <p>If the California Supreme Court reviews restrictions imposed by the EOLOA under a strict scrutiny standard, its jurisprudential history suggests it would almost certainly invalidate a fifteen-day waiting period, and likely other of the EOLOA&#8217;s burdensome restrictions. Under the strict scrutiny standard laid out in <span class="casename">Roe v. Wade</span>, prior to the undue burden standard expressed in <span class="casename">Casey</span>, the court recognized only <a href="http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&context=wmjowl">two state interests as sufficiently compelling to justify governmental restrictions on abortion</a>: the state's interests &#8220;in preserving and protecting the health of the pregnant woman&#8221; and &#8220;in protecting the potentiality of human life.&#8221;[8] Neither of these sorts of interests are addressed by the restrictions on AID. There is no &#8220;health&#8221; to protect, as terminal illness by definition destroys health, and there is no potential life interest at stake. Under a strict scrutiny standard, AID regulations would not survive. Even if the more permissive undue burden analysis were to be applied, the fifteen-day waiting period is likely to fail.</p>

                <p>Other elements of the EOLOA may not survive scrutiny: requiring patients to make a written request in addition to the two oral requests, and that they see a consulting physician to confirm diagnosis, prognosis, and competence, delay access to AID. Delays always force additional unwanted suffering and sometimes prevent patients from access entirely, given the progressive nature of their illnesses.</p>

                <p>The restrictions imposed on AID by the EOLOA will likely be challenged and ultimately examined by the California Supreme Court, which ought find this choice to be protected by privacy and/or equal protection guarantees under the California constitution, and that various restrictions contained in the EOLOA do not survive constitutional scrutiny. Those who believe it is the individual who ought be vested with autonomy to make their own informed decisions about profoundly personal matters involving their own body, life course and medical treatment will applaud such an outcome.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href=http://www.utoledo.edu/law/news/2015/prof-davis-appointed-to-american-bar-association-standing-committee.html>Benjamin G. Davis</a> of University of Toledo College of Law discusses the use of fear as a mechanism for social control... </p><strong>F</strong>ear is deployed in the United States as a means of social control. The ICE raids are one kind of way of making people fear by the sudden disappearance in deportation or in facilities where they are being held. The threat of <a href="http://readersupportednews.org/news-section2/318-66/42014-focus-trump-considers-calling-up-100000-national-guard-troops-to-round-up-illegal-immigrants">100,000 National Guard being deployed</a> that is swiftly denied. The dismantling of health care and the other structural destruction being imagined (<a href="https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa">Environmental Protection Agency</a>, <a href="https://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/about">Department of Housing and Urban Development</a>) all of these are spikers of fear. Another aspect of this is the language of repression and power we have heard from persons close to the President such as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/11/us/politics/stephen-miller-donald-trump-adviser.html?_r=0">Stephen Miller</a> most recently over last weekend.<br />
 <br />
What I hope people are noticing is just how much pleasure these deployers of fear seem to get from their role. Instilling fear is a way to exercise dark power on all those around. It is a method that forces praxis: identifying those who can be disdained as being weak for they kowtow to the fear bringer and those who must be destroyed who resist such fear.<br />
 <br />
Not expecting any kind of broad coalition to develop in this country since there are so many ways that any movement gets co&#45;opted, side-tracked, oppressed, or killed, one is left watching a monster growing in one's midst who stimulates paralyzing fear.<br />
 <br />
As an ordinary citizen experiencing disquiet one must first find a way of naming that emotion. Once one recognizes that the inchoate feeling that one experiences is a form of a much deeper and complex emotion called fear, I submit one begins to regain one's bearing. The fear that seems so ambient is seen for what it is &#45; something being weaponized to make one malleable and docile.<br />
 <br />
Coming to terms with this weaponization of the emotion of fear, the next question is to what extent one wishes to acquiesce to that fear and succumb to paralysis. It is certainly tempting to succumb and stay out of the line of fire of those who are pushing out this fear. It is the thing that people in many cultures over many centuries have done to avoid being in the path of the wrath of some uber leader.<br />
 <br />
If through one's position of privilege and comfort a vague disquiet is all that one can muster, then it is truly unlikely that one will be hero or heroine in somebody's story let alone one's own. That lack of ability to sense the contradictions or to be moved by the contradictions being experienced, suggests one is not sufficiently engaged in experiencing oppression.<br />
 <br />
But, for whatever reason, if the experience of what is happening causes you to be in a heightened state of stimulation by the contradictory emotions and facts, rather than being ashamed of that heightened state of arousal one might think of something else. Rather than being immobilized by the fear, let it stimulate you to action.<br />
 <br />
That action might seem trivial or it might amount to something much more extravagant. The scale of what any individual does cannot be significant for we each have our means&#8212some modest and some more extensive. But by one's actions one begins to respond to the fear as deployed and confront it.<br />
 <br />
And what do we do to confront such fear? Might I suggest that we confront that fear with the energy derived from our better angels. In other words, put forth energy of inclusion and support. Inclusion and support of others, dialogue on difficult topics, peaceful means of dispute resolution, and insistence on decency in the face of governmental oppression and corruption<br />
 <br />
One does not have to become the abyss when one looks at it.  In the storm, we must again learn to dance between the raindrops.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href=http://www.utoledo.edu/law/news/2015/prof-davis-appointed-to-american-bar-association-standing-committee.html>Benjamin G. Davis</a> of University of Toledo College of Law discusses President Trump's affection for torture... </p> <strong>P</strong>resident Trump likes torture. He has said that <a href="https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography-View/Article/1055835/james-mattis">Secretary of Defense Mattis </a>convinced him not to use it and he would defer to Mattis. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/mike-pompeo-is-confirmed-as-donald-trumps-cia-director-1485220999">CIA Director Pompeo</a> in his written responses before his confirmation showed himself open to reopen the possibility of torture. In voting for Pompeo, <a href="http://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/">Senator Feinstein</a> noted she did it thanks to the late further clarifications she received from him as to his commitment not to torture on which she relied.</p>

<p>With the ink barely dry on his confirmation, Pompeo then proceeds to name as <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/02/02/trumps-cia-chief-selects-major-torture-operative-to-be-agencys-deputy-director/">CIA Deputy Director Gina Haspel</a> who is a torturer. President Trump now can bypass Mattis and Pompeo who can retain plausible deniability vis-à-vis the Senate Armed Services Committee or the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, respectively, about ordering any torture. The torture will come by having things routed through Haspel who has demonstrated herself as being ready, willing, able and enthused about the torture to the point that she was perfectly happy to assist in the destruction of the famous torture tapes.</p>

<p>Haspel is one of the persons that would have been prosecuted in a normally constituted society for putting in place the torture. But, in our cesspool, instead she gets a promotion.  </p>

<p>Let us be absolutely clear. In the coming war or action against ISIS and possibly others, there will be torture done by the United States. Trump as much as promised that in his <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/02/remarks-president-trump-national-prayer-breakfast">Prayer Breakfast speech</a> on February 2, 2017 when he said, "It was not going to be pretty."</p>

<p>So now that the torturers are back in business, we see the action we will be taking against the barbarians of ISIS and see again that we have become the barbarians. It really would have been something if President Obama had formally apologized to the world after the election and before the inauguration (as I had suggested at the Annual Review of National Security Law of the ABA Standing Committee on Law and National Security in mid-November) for the United States putting in place a 54 country torture regime.</p>

<p>Now, the torturers are being put back in the saddle and we shall again be witness to barbaric state violence by ourselves.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://ku.academia.edu/ValentinaAzarova">Valentina Azarova</a> of <a href="https://kuremer.ku.edu.tr/">the Centre for Global Public Law</a> of Ko&ccedil University, Istanbul, discusses the implications of Security Council Resolution 2334 on the Israel-Palestine conflict...</p><strong>T</strong>he US decision not to veto Security Council <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/2334(2016)">Resolution 2334</a> (SCR 2334 or "the Resolution"), adopted on December 23, 2016, as the last political act of the Obama administration on the Israel-Palestine conflict, may have gained more attention than the Resolution itself. As a dispositive instrument, the Resolution does <a href="http://www.ejiltalk.org/security-council-resolution-2334-2016-and-its-legal-repercussions-revisited/">little more</a> than stir the pot on a range of existing determinations and positions on the unlawful character of Israel's settlement activities in occupied Palestinian territory. The Resolution does not <a href="https://lawfareblog.com/unscr-2334-israeli-settlements">provide</a> new substantive determinations of the legality of Israeli acts, and does not have the binding authority of a Chapter VII measure in response to a threat to international peace and security. But it still has normative weight. In particular, it affirms that the situation created by the settlements is legally invalid, and that third party states and international actors are obliged to distinguish between the settlements and Israeli territory. </p>

<p>Complementing other analyses of the Resolution (<a href="http://www.ejiltalk.org/security-council-resolution-2334-2016-and-its-legal-repercussions-revisited/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.ejiltalk.org/legal-bindingness-of-security-council-resolutions-generally-and-resolution-2334-on-the-israeli-settlements-in-particular/">here</a>), this comment focuses on the context and telos of the Resolution to show how its normative pull arises from its close affinity with recent developments in interstate and private dealings with Israel. Specifically, I account for three regulatory logics that underpin the Resolution: (1) the systemic integrity of international law that ascribes consequences beyond international humanitarian law (IHL) to Israeli settlements, (2) the legal invalidity of unlawfully-constituted facts and the its contribution to the operability of international law, and (3) the necessity to guarantee territorial distinction as an imperative of third party enforcement.</p>

<p><strong>1. Systemic Integrity Beyond IHL</strong></p>

<p>The basic premise of the Resolution is elementary: Israel is an occupying power in breach of its international law obligations inter alia for (i) appropriating land for the use of settlements and (ii) altering the demographic character of the Palestinian territory through the transfer of its civilians into the occupied territory. In line with a list of previous resolutions, the Resolution affirms that settlements constitute violations of international law.</p>

<p>The acts underpinning Israel's establishment and maintenance of the settlements are widely <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document.html?reference=EXPO_STU(2015)534995">understood</a> to be violations of IHL. Israel's acts to maintain the settlements include the extension of its domestic legal jurisdiction to the occupied territory, and other acts that amount to the de facto exercise of sovereign authority in over <a href="http://www.btselem.org/download/201306_area_c_report_eng.pdf">60 percent</a> of the occupied West Bank. Such actions demonstrate Israel's <a href="http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFA-Archive/2003/Pages/DISPUTED TERRITORIES- Forgotten Facts About the We.aspx">rejection</a> of the application of the law of occupation to the territory and its intention to maintain permanent control there (a recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/06/world/middleeast/israel-settlement-law-palestinians-west-bank.html?_r=0">example</a> of Israel's rejection of the sovereign status of the Palestinian people in the territory is the 'Regularisation Bill'). Beyond IHL, these actions attract responsibility under other international laws.</p>

<p>As the Resolution affirms, Israel remains an occupying power despite its insistence on the non-applicability of the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention to its activities in the occupied territory - territory that it claims instead to have a 'disputed' status (as per a recently <a href="http://akevot.org.il/en/article/comay-meron-cable/">uncovered</a> cable). An occupying power is not immune to consequences under other international law if it is unlawfully using force to seek the permanent acquisition of the occupied territory. Russia's occupation of Crimea did not shield it from sanctions imposed by the <a href="https://www.state.gov/e/eb/tfs/spi/ukrainerussia/">US</a> and the <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/sanctions/ukraine-crisis/">EU</a> following its annexation, for violations of Ukraine's territorial integrity. Similarly, SCR 674 (1990) maintained that Iraq is liable for any loss, damage or injury resulting from "the invasion and illegal occupation of Kuwait"; and the ICJ's 1971 Advisory Opinion on South Africa's continued presence in Namibia concluded that the condition of prolonged occupation had the effect of creating an "illegal situation" by permanently eroding the right to self-determination. </p>

<p>Where the use of force to maintain an occupation is unlawfully intended to annex or impose permanent control over the territory, such actions also attract consequences as violations of the UN Charter's prohibition of the use of force and its protection of the self-determination of peoples. The preamble of SCR 2334 mentions the Charter's prohibition on "the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force," but rather curiously, not even cursory reference is made to the Palestinian people's internationally recognized right to self-determination.  </p>

<p>To protect the continuity of the rights of the ousted sovereign, the application of IHL to a situation of occupation presupposes and depends on the occupying state's full implementation of other international law. By foregrounding IHL, however, the Resolution regrettably downplays the urgency of redressing the consequences of de facto annexation. Israel and the international community have an obligation to end the objective illegality resulting from the use of force to acquire title to territory. </p>

<p><strong>2. "No legal validity"</strong></p>

<p>Although the Resolution foregrounds IHL, its central thrust is not confined to the law of occupation, since the Resolution states that Israel's settlements have "no legal validity" (para. 1). The Resolution reaffirms, in other words, that a situation predicated on violations of peremptory norms of international law (which include, as per the ICJ, violations of the "intransgressible principles of international humanitarian law"), is objectively illegal. Furthermore, the consequence of the legal invalidity of Israel's settlements is that the legislative and administrative acts that maintain them, as well as any activities and operations that are predicated on those acts, are also legally invalid.</p>

<p>The Resolution's reference to legal invalidity extends not only to facts related to the establishment of the settlements <em>ex ante</em>, but also to facts that are illegally constituted <em>ex post</em>. The rights and titles that are predicated on Israel's unlawful acts of abruption and <em>de facto</em> annexation of the settlements into Israel are themselves invalid. Financial gains accrued as a result of the wrongful enjoyment of these rights could also be invalidated.<br />
  </p>

<p>The regulatory logic of legal invalidity derives from the principle <em>ex injuria jus non oritur</em> (unlawful acts cannot create law, or rights): it ensures that a wrongdoer does not accrue rights and benefits from its wrongful acts and omissions. To this end, the invalidity construct mandates that third party states and international actors adhere to a minimum obligation of abstention from recognition, aid or assistance. Facts constituted by Israel's unlawful acts have "no legal validity" and can be disputed on the international level as well as in transnational contexts by third states and actors that rely on the operation of comity and mutual recognition to enable their dealings.</p>

<p>In sum, the invalidity construct clarifies the illegal situation maintained by the settlements and solidifies the effects of that illegality on the legal orders of third party actors, including <a href="https://kuremer.ku.edu.tr/en/contending-limits-extraterritorial-regulation-transnational-corporate-wrongs">corporate nationals</a>. Indeed, the legal house-keeping measures the EU has <a href="https://kuremer.ku.edu.tr/en/contending-limits-extraterritorial-regulation-transnational-corporate-wrongs">adopted</a> to ensure the exclusion of settlements from the scope of its relations with Israel show that the obligation to invalidate certain facts can effectively place domestic authorities in the position of enforcers of international law.</p>

<p><strong>3. Territorial distinction</strong></p>

<p>To protect the transnational regulatory order from the risks created by unlawfully-constituted facts, all states are subject to an obligation to abstain in the common interest from recognizing as lawful such facts, as well as any rights or titles predicated on them. It is to this end that the Resolution maintains that the Security Council "will not recognise any changes to the 4 June 1967 lines, including with regard to Jerusalem, other than those agreed upon by the parties through negotiations" (para. 3). This is why it calls on all States to adhere to their obligations of abstention by "distinguish[ing], in their relevant dealings, between the territory of the State of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967" (para. 5).</p>

<p>The logic of this obligation of distinction resonates with the international law-based duty of third states not to recognize as lawful, aid or assist wrongful acts, codified in the 2001 ILC Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. The international law practice of these duties is so widely inconsistent, however, that some experts were led to <a href="http://www.ejil.org/article.php?article=1983&issue=95">conclude</a> that this as far as its international legal standing is concerned, the duty is in fact a 'soap bubble'. </p>

<p>Another iteration of the logic of non-recognition is observed at the level of domestic legal orders of states and international actors such as the EU. In these contexts, non-recognition is based on a deeply-engrained imperative to ensure consistency between the state's legal practice (in applying its domestic law and any legal instruments organising its interstate relations), and its positions and commitments in international law. This internalised imperative, embedded in states' administrative laws, has driven a little-known process of peer enforcement: mandating states to exclude (by refraining from giving legal effect to) facts and situations predicated on internationally unlawful acts. </p>

<p>In recent years, this process has taken <a href="http://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/eu_differentiation_and_israeli_settlements3076">root</a> in the context of the EU and its member states' interstate and private dealings with Israel. The EU found itself obliged to exclude facts arising from Israel's unlawful acts in Palestinian territory from the scope of EU-Israel relations (e.g. the exclusion of Israeli entities based or operating in settlements from the EU's Horizon 2020 research fund). Since 2012, the EU's Foreign Affairs Council has affirmed the need to adopt such measures in all domains of EU-Israel relations in two Conclusions: one reaffirming the EU's commitment "to ensure continued, full and effective implementation of existing EU legislation and bilateral arrangements applicable to settlement products"; and another mandating "that - in line with international law - all agreements between the State of Israel and the EU must unequivocally and explicitly indicate their inapplicability to the territories occupied by Israel in 1967."  </p>

<p>The exclusion of foreign territory from the territorial scope of an interstate agreement is also a corollary of the rule that agreements cannot affect the rights and obligations of a third party without the latter's consent; enshrined in Article 29 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. In its 21 December 2016 <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:62014CJ0524">judgment</a>, the CJEU's Grand Chamber applied this rule to Morocco's wrongful extension of the EU-Morocco Association Agreement to the territory of Western Sahara, which Morocco has unlawfully annexed and presently treats as part of its domestic jurisdiction. </p>

<p>SCR 2334 does not provide a coherent account of the international law applicable to the unlawful acts underpinning Israel's settlements, or pronounce upon the effects of settlements on the legality of Israel's continued presence in the Palestinian territory. Nonetheless, the Resolution supports the legal processes that have thus far been activated by the objective illegality of Israel's settlements, and may therefore be the harbinger of more to come.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/profiles/khan-ali.html">Ali Khan</a> of <a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/">Washburn University School of Law</a> discusses the recent executive order banning individuals from seven Muslim-majority countries, and the effects of US Customs and Border Protection officials' perpetuation of harassment at US airports... </p><strong>E</strong>ver since President Trump signed an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/27/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states">executive order</a> banning individuals from seven Muslim-majority countries, reports of harassment at US entry points, including airports and road crossings, have inundated newspapers, news websites, and social media.  Tourists, legal immigrants, even US naturalized and US born citizens have reported degrading treatment, humiliation, and intimidation by <a href="http://cbp.gov">US Customs and Border Protection</a> (CBP) officials. In addition to travelers with Muslim names from all over the world including European Muslims, non-Muslim visitors have also been detained and subjected to pointless questioning. </p>

<p>For example, French Holocaust scholar <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/26/us/french-historian-detained-immigration-henry-rousso.html?_r=2">Henry Rousso was detained</a> for more than 10 hours at the Houston airport.  Mem Fox, an eminent Australian writer of children's books, was detained at the Los Angeles airport. "I have never in my life been spoken to with such insolence, treated with such disdain, with so many insults and with so much gratuitous impoliteness," <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/25/australian-childrens-author-mem-fox-detained-by-us-border-control-i-sobbed-like-a-baby">Fox said</a>.  Of course, the degradation of Muslims arriving at US airports has been widespread.  The son of legendary boxer <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/02/24/muhammad-ali-jr-detained-immigration-officials-fla-airport/98379082/">Muhammad Ali</a> was detained for hours at Fort Lauderdale airport after he was returning from speaking at a Black History Month event in Jamaica. He, a US-born citizen, was asked whether he was a Muslim. </p>

<p><strong>Harassment</strong></p>

<p>Harassment is a well-known legal concept in the US.  Harassment is both criminal and civil. As a general concept, criminal harassment means a course of conduct, including words and gestures, knowingly directed at an individual to alarm, annoy, torment, or terrorize the targeted person. Civil harassment is a form of discrimination, practiced in employment and housing, based on race, religion, sexual preference, national origin, or gender. Federal laws prohibit civil harassment where state laws prohibit both civil and criminal harassment.  <br />
There is no federal law specifically prohibiting CBP officials from "harassment" of travelers arriving at the US points of entry.  In fact, the CBP officials at points of entry have more powers than police officers on the streets. Unlike police officers, the CBP officials need not have a probable cause to ask intruding questions to incoming travelers, nor a reasonable suspicion to search their luggage. They may do so at will for their primary responsibility is to prevent the entry of persons and goods that pose threat to national security or violate the US immigration, agricultural, monetary, or other laws.</p>

<p>The reported cases of harassment by the CBP officials are inconsistent with the "national goal" that in 2015 the Departments of Homeland Security and Commerce proposed to President Obama: "The United States will provide <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/travel/travel-tourism">a best-in-class arrival experience</a>, as compared to our global competitors, to an ever-increasing number of international visitors while maintaining the highest standards of national security."</p>

<p>There could be several reasons why the CBP is engaging in a course of conduct incompatible with providing a best-in-class arrival experience as promised in the 2015 proposal: </p>

<blockquote>1.	President Trump or Secretary John Kelly of Homeland Security may have abandoned the 2015 goal (even though the <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/travel/travel-tourism">goal </a>is still displayed at the CBP website), now focusing more on national security and less on the commercial benefits that flow from international visitors. The stories of CBP harassment might reduce the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-03/trump-slump-signs-of-drop-in-international-tourism-to-us">already dwindling number of international travelers to the US</a>.

<p><br />
2.	The reported stories of intense questioning by the CBP officials is getting more than usual press coverage because of the illegal executive order banning refugees and other travelers.</p>

<p>3.	 The CBP officials conducting secondary inspections (detention, detailed questioning, and luggage searches) are not well-trained in effective but dignified questioning of international visitors including US legal immigrants and citizens coming back home.</blockquote></p>

<p><strong>Consequences</strong></p>

<p>Whatever is causing the perceived and actual harassment at the US points of entry, concrete consequences flow from negative perception among the peoples of the world that the US has turned into a land of disrespect, discrimination, and deportations. </p>

<p>First, fewer visitors from Muslim and non-Muslim countries will undertake expensive trips to the US. They are unlikely to spend money to be degraded at US airports. Visitors wish to have good time without being abused and harassed in the host country. Once a country loses goodwill, most i<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/politics/a-sweeping-order-unlikely-to-reduce-terrorist-threat.html">nternational travelers think twice</a> before visiting there.  </p>

<p>Second, fewer new students will opt to study in US colleges and universities. Already, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1317973">China is attracting hundreds of thousands of foreign students</a>. Likewise, specialty occupations might also fail to recruit skilled professionals. As the 2015 report rightfully points out there are global competitors who wish to divert traffic from the US to their own countries. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/">Department of Homeland Security</a> and CBP need to understand that they are doing a disfavor to the economy and reputation of the US by their over-zealous detention and questioning of international visitors. They should presume, unless there are apparent contra-indications, that international travelers with valid visas obtained from US consulates and embassies located in foreign countries are innocent travelers and not potential security threat. This presumption applies even more strongly to legal immigrants and US born and naturalized citizens returning home after vacation or business travel.  </p>

<p>The President's <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/06/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states">new executive order on Monday morning</a>, though it excludes Iraq from its coverage, is still focused on Muslim countries. Like the previous executive order, It too is likely to make  Muslims traveling to the US more vulnerable to CBP vetting procedures. The harassment stories at US points of entry will multiply again.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.unl.edu/jo-r-potuto/">Josephine R. Potuto</a> discusses some of the controversies facing collegiate athletes today...</p><strong>A</strong>re college athletes employees? Are college athletes entitled to be paid for competing on college teams? Should college athletes be able to market their names and likenesses? Should college athletes share in profits made when their schools, or the NCAA, markets their names and likenesses? Do colleges conspire through adoption of NCAA rules to engage in anti-competitive conduct? Is there a pro-competitive aspect to preserving a separate identity for college sports that clearly distinguishes them from professional sports such that NCAA rules do not violate the federal antitrust laws? These are questions raised by a spate of lawsuits brought against the NCAA by current and former student-athletes in football and basketball.</p>

<p>So far, the NCAA lost, and won, in a <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=o+bannon+ncaa&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&case=2209792366733605448&scilh=0">lawsuit brought by Ed O'Bannon</a> seeking, among other things, a share of profits from an NCAA college football video game. The case brought a judicial decision that NCAA amateurism does not have a blanket pass under the federal antitrust laws (the loss) and a decision that the NCAA may cap payouts to athletes at the full cost of attending college (the win). So far, the NCAA lost, and won, in the effort to unionize brought by football players at Northwestern. The regional director of the <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/nlrb-director-region-13-issues-decision-northwestern-university-athletes">National Labor Relations Board decided</a> that the football players were employees of the university (the loss) and a unanimous <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/board-unanimously-decides-decline-jurisdiction-northwestern-case">NLRB decided</a> to decline jurisdiction and dismiss the player petition to form a union (the win). An additional two cases, one brought by former West Virginia football player Shawne Alston and the other brought by former Clemson football player Martin Jenkins were consolidated to be heard by federal district judge Claudia Wilken, the trial judge in the O'Bannon case.</p>

<p>On <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/ncaa-and-conferences-agree-to-2087-million-settlement-in-antitrust-suit.php">February 3d the NCAA announced a $208.7 million settlement</a> in the Alston part of the consolidated lawsuit. That settlement now waits approval from Judge Wilken.  </p>

<p>Alston sued on behalf of a class of former and current men's and women's basketball scholarship athletes and football scholarship athletes at schools in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of Division I. Teams from FBS schools compete in bowl games, not in the NCAA Football Championship. Alston challenged a then-existing Division I rule that capped athletic scholarships at tuition, fees, room, board, and books. Alston sought the difference between such a capped scholarship and full cost of attendance for any year from 2010 forward in which he and other class members received a capped scholarship. Full cost of attendance covers the additional money students need to meet all their living expenses as well as travel home.</p>

<p>In 2015, the NCAA <a href="http://www.ncaa.com/news/ncaa/article/2015-09-03/cost-attendance-qa">changed its rules</a> so that FBS schools could offer scholarships to athletes that cover the full cost of attendance. It could be said that the Alston settlement simply extended to athletes from 2010 to 2105 a scholarship award that they would have received had the cap been eliminated sooner. There is one thing to remember, however. Eliminating an NCAA ban on cost of attendance scholarships does not mean that each FBS school must choose to give them, although the competitive recruiting environment makes that an exceedingly likely result. The Alston settlement, therefore, effectively provides cost of attendance scholarships to some athletes who might not have been awarded one.     </p>

<p>The amount each athlete gets under the settlement depends on the number of years between 2010 and 2015 (s)he received what was then a full athletics scholarship. Because cost of attendance varies from school to school, the amount paid also depends on the school the athlete attended. It is expected that on average, the settlement will pay out $7,000 to each athlete in the class. What the Alston settlement (and the O'Bannon case before it) does not address is scholarship limits for athletes in other sports. The NCAA extended the opportunity for a full cost of attendance scholarship to athletes in head count sports like football and basketball, where each athlete on scholarship gets the full scholarship permitted under NCAA rules. Most NCAA sports are what the NCAA calls "equivalency" sports. NCAA rules in these sports limit the total amount of scholarship money that may be spent by a team and permit a coach to divide that money among team athletes in any way (s)he chooses. When the NCAA lifted its ban on full cost of attendance scholarships, it also raised team caps proportionately. The team cap was not enough to pay each athlete a full capped scholarship before the NCAA rule change.  It continues to be not enough to pay each athlete a full cost of attendance scholarship.  </p>

<p>Cost of attendance scholarships compensate athletes on a full ride for the full cost they bear to attend school. These scholarships are directly tied to educational expenses. The Alston settlement is grounded in educational values, therefore, and capped at the total amount of those expenses. Paying the full cost of educational expenses does not constitute pay for play any more than paying any lesser scholarship amount did. The result: making these awards permissible does not change the NCAA's stance that college athletes are students, not employees, of their universities. The NCAA reinforced its stance by settling without conceding that it violated the antitrust laws by capping scholarships at tuition, fees, room, board, and books. The Alston settlement, therefore, is not a game-changer. Instead, the Alston settlement is a sensible, if costly, resolution, that clears the way for the Jenkins part of the lawsuit before Judge Wilken.</p>

<p>Jenkins claims that the antitrust laws forbid any NCAA limit on what schools may pay an athlete to attend and compete. In other words, athletes are entitled to receive whatever a free market for their services (or deep-pocket big boosters) provides. The Jenkins litigation is a full-bore court fight on the future of college sports. Jenkins believes that fundamental fairness dictates that athletes share in the revenue pie they produce. Colleges and the NCAA see such a result as creating a wild west for college recruiting, jeopardizing the ability of schools to offer athletic opportunities to athletes who compete in Olympic and other non-revenue sports, and, fundamentally, to eliminate the line of demarcation that separates college from professional sports. Jenkins, then, is the potential game-changer.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Laurie Blank, Emory Law School, discusses the recent airstrikes against al Qaeda targets in Yemen, and how self-defense raises questions in US response against al Qaeda... </p><strong>L</strong>ast week's sustained campaign of airstrikes against al Qaeda targets in Yemen brought the conflict with al Qaeda to the forefront of our attention, after a few years of heavy media concentration on the US and coalition fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. It thus served as a reminder that the US campaign against al Qaeda and affiliates &#8212; often termed "associated forces" &#8212; is now in its sixteenth year and does not appear to be ending anytime soon.</p>

<p>	In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the US responded in self-defense against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan and since then has used force against al Qaeda and several affiliated groups from Pakistan to Yemen to Syria to Somalia and beyond. The passage of time alone raises a critically important question: how long does self-defense last? And as the US has shifted its stated objective from preventing future attacks to "ensuring the lasting defeat of al Qaeda and violent extremist affiliates," a second essential question is how far can a state go &#8212; both in the geographic sense and in the sense of the legitimate aims of using force &#8212; when acting in self defense?</p>

<p>	These questions are essential for effective legal analysis of US actions against al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. Most discussions of self-defense under international law focus on the right to use force at the initiation of action in self-defense &#8212; based on the existence of an armed attack or imminent armed attack and the necessity and proportionality of the force used to deter or repel the attack. At some point, however, sixteen years and thousands of miles from the initial trigger for self-defense authority, it is clear that we must transition from <em>whether</em> there is a right to act in self-defense to <em>what is the extent</em> of the right to act in self-defense.</p>

<p>	As I analyze in greater depth <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2929076">here</a>, examining the extent of self-defense raises three categories of questions. First, what are the legitimate aims of self-defense against terrorist groups and how do such aims affect our understanding and application of necessity and proportionality? Second, if the campaign against a terrorist group is an armed conflict, how does that change our assessment of self-defense or the legitimate parameters of action against that group? And third, how does a state's initial success against a terrorist group affect the application of necessity and proportionality in the self-defense analysis?</p>

<p>	Traditionally, the international law of self-defense recognizes the right of states to use force to deter or repel an attack &#8212; and the force used must be necessary to achieve that purpose and proportionate, in degree or amount of force, to that goal. The foundational self-defense criteria of necessity and proportionality thus require that any assessment of self-defense must start with the victim state's aim or objective in using force in response to an armed attack or imminent armed attack. </p>

<p>In the counterterrorism arena, however, using the traditional notion of "deterring" or "repelling" an attack as the legitimate aim of self-defense is significantly more complicated. Terrorist attacks tend to be singular events causing mass civilian casualties rather than military operations to gain territory or achieve other conventional strategic objectives, such that the very idea of halting or repelling an attack does not translate well into the counterterrorism scenario, where targets are unknown and the terrorists may be gone long before the attack itself takes place. Most states therefore justify the use of force in self-defense against terrorist groups as action taken to prevent future attacks. Although preventing future attacks makes sense, it can have very different operational meanings: it could be limited to action to stop specific terrorists in the last window of opportunity before an attack or it could include action to destroy the terrorist cell or group entirely. </p>

<p>This lack of clarity hampers the legal analysis. One could argue that only preventing an immediate future attack is a legitimate aim of self-defense. Or one could argue that broader action to defeat the terrorist group is a question of proportionality and how elastic the degree of force allowed can be for achieving the traditional objective of deterring or repelling an attack. Finally, one might contend that the destruction of the terrorist group's capability is a legitimate objective of self-defense itself. The extent of self-defense &#8212; how much force the state can use and for how long &#8212; varies significantly depending on which of these interpretations one applies.</p>

<p>Second, the US has consistently framed its campaign against al Qaeda and affiliated terrorist groups as an armed conflict. At the most basic level, the armed conflict paradigm raises the question of whether victory in war supplants self-defense against an attack or imminent armed attack as the analytical structure for assessing the lawfulness of state action. That is, the key issue is whether the characterization as armed conflict removes the necessity and proportionality criteria from consideration and leaves the extent of self-defense &#8212; how much force against which groups and for how long &#8212; to be determined solely by the idea of victory in war. </p>

<p>The challenge, of course, is that no one seems to know what winning looks like against a terrorist group. Without tools for identifying when a conflict ends or, in effect, victory is achieved, it is difficult to delineate metrics for when a state has exceeded the parameters for the use of force against a terrorist group. Indeed, allowing a state to characterize operations against an armed conflict can potentially give that state <em>carte blanche</em> to set perpetually expanding aims in self-defense, a highly problematic scenario. Given the uncertainties, it would be wise to consider if and how necessity and proportionality can continue to play a role in assessing the reasonableness of the use and extent of the use of force, thus helping to maintain the balance between sovereignty, territorial integrity and order in the international system, and the state's inherent right of self-defense.</p>

<p>Finally, several questions arise from the shifting nature of a terrorist group and military operations against it as the state enjoys initial success in its forceful responses to the terrorist group's attacks or series of attacks. As a state takes forceful action, the terrorist group's ability to launch attacks will likely diminish, at least temporarily. As the threat of future attacks lessens, an assessment of the classic criteria of necessity and proportionality correspondingly changes &#8212; the necessity for action has lessened and the amount of force needed to attain the objective is lower &#8212; suggesting that the scope of self-defense is thus narrower. Operationally, however, this approach is counterintuitive. If initial success means a state has less room for maneuver, then the terrorist group has more space to reconstitute and launch attacks, thus re-triggering the state's right to act in self-defense. The result is a circular argument and legal framework divorced from the operational reality of how states respond to threats. </p>

<p>Ultimately, therefore, it is essential to examine how initial success and the responsive acts or maneuvers of a terrorist group affect how we consider the extent of self-defense against terrorist groups. Three features of contemporary counterterrorism are of particular interest here: terrorist groups finding safe haven in another state; terrorist groups splintering or reconstituting as one or more new or related groups; and attacks or propaganda inspiring the creation of new groups or vows of allegiance from other existing groups. The first expands the geographic range of self-defense and the latter two expand or potentially expand the spectrum of groups against whom the state proposes to use force in self-defense. In other words, initial success and its resulting effects have significant consequences for the reach of self-defense--both whom the state can use force against and where it can do so.</p>

<p>The discourse over the past sixteen years has focused on whether and when a state can use force in self-defense against a non-state group, the classic questions surrounding the initiation of the right of self-defense. It is now essential to develop sophisticated tools for understanding and assessing the extent of self-defense to avoid significant gaps in the ability of international law to guide and regulate the long-term use of force against terrorist groups.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.utoledo.edu/law/faculty/fulltime/BDavis.html">Benjamin G. Davis</a> of <a href="http://www.utoledo.edu/law/">University of Toledo College of Law</a> discusses the International Criminal Court's looking into investigating Americans for criminal prosecution for torture of prisoners in Afghanistan...</p><strong>A</strong>s has been recently <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/10/31/exclusive-international-criminal-court-poised-to-open-investigation-into-war-crimes-in-afghanistan/">reported in the news</a>, the International Criminal Court is looking into investigating Americans for criminal prosecution for torture in Afghanistan. A <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/us-options-responding-icc-scrutiny-afghanistan">commentary at lawfareblog</a> almost solely focused on how the United States can avoid such prosecutions, as opposed to how we could assist the ICC in successfully prosecuting the high level torturers, prompts this comment.</p>

<p>The most serious American offenders capable of putting in place a 54 country torture regime with Afghanistan being merely one spoke in a wheel and spoke torture structure would be the logical focus of such an ICC effort. The CIA and DOD personnel onsite in Afghanistan in the Salt Pit and other places of course are in the line of fire, but as revealed in the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence declassified summary of their torture report, actions were directed in the most minute detail by others in the US and around the world. Those actions in the US and around the world might be addressed in this setting under the territoriality principle of actions overseas having and intending to have effects in a country make those actions abroad within the jurisdiction of that country. In this case the effects test leads to Afghanistan at least and from there to ICC jurisdiction.</p>

<p>US failure to meaningfully investigate let alone prosecute one senior level official for such torture is patent. The capacity of the US to in fact prosecute has been demonstrated for low level soldiers such as those court-martialed at <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/01/federal-judge-orders-defense-department-to-release-abu-ghraib-photos.php">Abu Ghraib</a>. The consequence of this different treatment between the lower level persons and the higher ups which has now persisted over both Republican and Democratic administrations is strong evidence of American "inability and/or unwillingness" to hold these high level people to account. In the harsh light of international law, the domestic US foreign relations law machinations to protect our high-level torture mafia from their day of reckoning appears hopelessly transparent and painfully hypocritical.</p>

<p>The Status of Forces Agreement between Afghanistan and the United States provides one method of allocating jurisdiction for such prosecutions, but under a hierarchy of norms view of the SOFA it would be the height of perverse bad faith performance for the SOFA to operate as a get out of prosecution card.</p>

<p>In the event the investigation proceeds to actual indictment, some who might speak of head of state immunity rationae materiae or personae preventing third States or Afghanistan handing over Americans as a matter of international law should keep in mind that those protections are not impediments to the United States itself handing over its own high level present and/or former officials to the ICC. And to the extent there is US domestic law that seemingly would prevent such a handover, surely that unitary Executive Power so bandied about by the proponents of torture would reach the ability and allow the President to bring American torturers to justice albeit in The Hague. I would fully expect a US citizen to seek judicial review under habeas or otherwise to protest their handover by the United States to the ICC, but surely the guarantees of the ICC process would not disturb an American court. And, that American would have their day in court, an American court, before they were sent by our state to The Hague.</p>

<p>In the end, if internal law rules are invoked to prevent such a rendition by the United States, surely the kinds of surreptitious renditions used in the torture regime might be reinvigored by the <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/02/19/516064645/with-intelligence-leaks-the-deep-state-resurfaces">Deep State</a> Intelligence aspects of our government to make such transfers to The Hague. Moreover, under the old and banal international legal rule that no state can extract itself from its international obligations through its internal law, US treaty obligations under the Convention Against Torture or customary international law serve to temper and possibly trump those internal law rules.</p>

<p>Those who find this commentary nonsensical or outrageous as it imagines the United States handing over Americans to an international criminal tribunal to be prosecuted for crimes directed and ordered by the President of the United States should not feel that way. The problem these persons are facing is their own inability to comprehend such high level lawlessness as a crime that should be preferably sanctionable in United States domestic courts. Our inability to do that prosecution opens the way to think how alternatives might be put in place. This commentary is suggesting that rather than time being spent and words being written in order to caress American torturers in a direction that keeps them on the streets, we might think about getting this scum off the streets and in front of a decent court.</p>

Trump issued a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/06/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states">revised EO</a> that addresses several shortcomings. Yet, the new EO, issued on March 6, 2017, remains fundamentally flawed because it perpetuates the central constitutional infirmity: discrimination on the basis of religion in violation of the Establishment Clause.</p>

<p>Trump issued the original EO, entitled "<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/27/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states">Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States</a>," on January 27, 2017. (The revised EO bears the same title). The original order caused widespread chaos and unwarranted hardship for noncitizens traveling to the United States, including refugees and legal permanent residents. The EO sparked legal challenges by individuals and by several states, nearly all of which resulted in judicial rulings invalidating key portions of the order.  Most notably, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/02/04/read-washington-judges-ruling-trumps-immigration-ban/97484850/">blocked</a> enforcement nationwide of the EO's provisions temporarily suspending entry of noncitizens from the seven identified countries and temporarily suspending the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. In a unanimous decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2017/02/09/17-35105.pdf">denied</a> the Trump administration's motion for an emergency stay of the district court's order pending appeal.  </p>

<p>The Trump administration's decision to issue a revised EO represents a concession of the first order's legal indefensibility. The revised EO addresses several flaws, including excluding application of the travel ban to lawful permanent residents. It also does not apply to foreign nationals with valid visas or refugees whose travel to the U.S. has previously been scheduled with the State Department. Those provisions, coupled with the 10-day delay in implementation, are designed to avoid a repeat of the mass chaos that accompanied the first EO.</p>

<p>But the immigration ban continues to target six nations that are more than 90 percent Muslim: Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, Syria and Yemen  The EO's sole changes in this regard are to make the ban on Syrian nationals temporary and to exclude Iraqi nationals, purportedly based on increased cooperation from Iraq, but <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/06/politics/trump-travel-ban-iraq/">more likely</a> based on political and diplomatic pressure from Iraq and internally from within the Trump administration.  Additionally, the revised EO maintains the temporary suspension of refugee admissions and the 50,000 cap on refugees for 2017 once the program resumes (thus cutting the current total in half).  </p>

<p>The order also poses new concerns, including by requiring relevant federal agencies to collect and publish information about convictions of terrorism-related offenses, government charges of terrorism, and gender-based violence against women committed by foreign nationals, while containing no corresponding publication requirement for U.S. citizens. This provision discriminates based on national origin and is likely to inflame bias against noncitizens by deliberately misrepresenting to the public that they alone&#8212;and not U.S. citizens&#8212;are responsible for terrorist activity. Indeed, the Trump administration could seek to use this information to lay the groundwork for further bans or restrictions on immigration. </p>

<p>The Constitution's Establishment Clause prohibits discrimination by the government based on religion, including giving preference to one religious denomination over another. Like the original order, the revised order continues to discriminate both in its purpose and effect by maintaining the ban on countries that are overwhelming Muslim. The ban need not include all Muslim-majority countries; as long as religious discrimination is a motivating factor, it may run afoul of the Establishment Clause. </p>

<p>The Trump administration, to be sure, will defend the revised EO by claiming  that religion is not the motivating factor and that the ban on immigration from the six countries is based on national security considerations. Further, the administration will likely point to the revised EO's elimination of any preference for religious minorities.</p>

<p>But context is crucial, and nothing in the new order is sufficient to overcome the evidence of discriminatory purpose surrounding the original order. That evidence includes <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/trump-revised-travel-ban-still-muslim-ban-564885">multiple statements</a> by Trump indicating his wish to restrict immigration of Muslims to the United States as well as a statement by Trump's close advisor, former New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani, that Trump was looking for a way to make a Muslim ban legal.</p>

<p>Further, despite the more restrained rollout that accompanied the new EO, the discriminatory intentions of Trump and several key advisors continue are still evident.  For example, White House adviser Stephen Miller <a href="http://www.salon.com/2017/02/22/stephen-miller-admits-the-new-executive-order-on-immigration-ban-is-same-as-the-old/">noted</a> that any changes to the first executive order would be "mostly minor, technical differences," and that "[f]undamentally, you are still going to have the same, basic policy outcomes for the country."  </p>

<p>Additionally, evidence continues to show that the Trump administration's purported security concerns are merely a misguided attempt to use territory as a proxy for religion.  A Department of Homeland Security <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/dhs-report-casts-doubt-on-need-for-trump-travel-ban/2017/02/24/2a9992e4-fadc-11e6-9845-576c69081518_story.html?utm_term=.b0d513903de2">report</a> recently found "country of citizenship is unlikely to be a reliable indicator of potential terrorist activity" and that "few of the impacted countries [under the executive order] have terrorist groups that threaten the West."</p>

<p>Previously, Judge Leonie Brinkema of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia held in <a href="https://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/IM-VA-0004-0055.pdf">Aziz v. Trump</a> [PDF] that the travel ban in the original EO was adopted for the constitutionally impermissible purpose of discriminating against Muslims. Applying the Supreme Court's decision in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-1693.ZS.html">McCreary County v. ACLU</a>&#8212;where the court looked at the history of events surrounding the visible display of the Ten Commandments in Kentucky courthouses&#8212;Judge Brinkema concluded that the EO was the outgrowth of Trump's previously promised Muslim ban.   </p>

<p>The revised EO is best understood as another step by the Trump administration in its efforts to achieve this goal.  It seeks to clean up some glaring instances of executive overreach to defeat legal challenges, while keeping the underlying policy of discriminating against Muslims intact.</p>

<p>The first EO may have made an easier target, given the disorder it unleashed and its inclusion of legal permanent residents.  But none of the Trump administration's tinkering to the revised EO repairs its fatal flaw.  </p>

		<title>Arizona’s Death Penalty Procedures &amp; Professional Ethics</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Tasha Russell discusses ethical issues that arise from the death penalty plan in Arizona, which attempts to put the onus on the lawyer's of convicted criminals awaiting the death penalty to provide the drugs to be used in their client's execution...</p><strong>J</strong>just recently, it has come to light that the State of Arizona has put forward a new <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/15/arizona-death-penalty-bring-your-own-lethal-injection-drugs">death penalty</a> plan given the lack of availability of anesthetics and sedatives previously used in the death chamber, namely, Pentobarbital and Sodium Pentothal. The plan being put forward is a provision that puts the onus on a death row inmates&#8217; lawyer to provide the drugs so the State can follow through with the planned death penalty. To say that this plan throws some ethical issues in the face of those lawyers would be a great understatement. </p>

                <p>One of the main duties of any lawyer is to act in the clients&#8217; best interests and in accordance with their instructions. Here we have a situation where Arizona is attempting to put a duty on a lawyer to act in the state&#8217;s best interests and per their instructions rather than the clients. This flies in the face of the duties of a lawyer to their client. This is before we even take into account the fact that it is against Federal law in the US to import these drugs. It should be noted that a lawyer is bound to not assist or take part in criminal conduct with their client but here, Arizona expects a lawyer to commit a criminal act for the State so that they can execute their client? One could say that the plan is rather nonsensical when compared with a lawyers professional responsibilities. Not to mention the fact that committing a criminal act can be seen to indicate that the lawyer is not fit to practice and can amount to professional misconduct.</p>

                <p>In addition to working in their clients best interests, it is also a professional conduct rule that lawyers must work with <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_3_diligence.html">diligence</a> in representing their client and with dedication and commitment to the interests of the client. I don&#8217;t think anyone could argue that assisting the state to execute your client, assuming that it is against their wishes of course, is hardly working in an effort to seek the best results for their client with the dedication and commitment that a lawyer is bound to put into their work. </p>

                <p>We could also turn our mind to the matter of professional ethics which stipulates that a lawyer must act independently and impartially in providing legal services but the plan being put forward is essentially asking the lawyer to be a slave to the aims of government and hammer their client to the stake, so to speak. Further, when acting with this independence the lawyer is given the right to refer to considerations such as moral, social and political factors in addition to matters of law. So in the few US jurisdictions that allow voluntary euthanasia, a doctor cannot administer end-of-life drugs to a terminally ill person because this goes against a doctors ethics, otherwise when voluntary euthanasia legislation is discussed in jurisdictions that are debating whether to implement this kind of legislation all we ever hear is &#8220;How can this fit with the ethics of being a doctor?&#8221;. Never mind that though, it is perfectly fine for a lawyer to buy end-of-life drugs for someone who is not choosing to die, when there is a likelihood that they do the work that they do with death row inmates because they are not in favour of the death penalty for their clients.</p>

                <p>Even more ironic than any of the above would have to be the professional rule that Arizona lawyers are bound by, which insists that a lawyer should reveal any information they receive that could prevent their client from committing a criminal act that would result in death. But here we are expecting a lawyer to commit a criminal act that results in the death of their client?</p>

                <p>At the end of all that, we can also add the fact that the lawyer has also likely engaged in conduct that could be seen to be prejudicial to the administration of justice. Now we could potentially end up with a bunch of lawyers who will have been acting in the way they have so been ordered by the State, yet are likely in prison themselves for importing an illegal substance into the US. Of course, this is in addition to the fact that all the years of study, continued research and self-directed legal education is now irrelevant as the lawyer has potentially been disbarred for professional misconduct. Is Arizona trying to ensure the end of the lawyers that advocate for these people too?</p>

		<title>Evaluate New Travel Ban in Light of International Law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.tjsl.edu/directory/marjorie-cohn">Marjorie Cohn</a>, Professor Emerita at <a href="http://www.tjsl.edu/">Thomas Jefferson School of Law</a>, discusses the constitutional violations resulting from the executive order banning nationals from six Muslim-majority countries...</p><strong>A</strong>fter a <a href="http://www.hid.uscourts.gov/files/announcement142/CV17-50%20219%20doc.pdf">federal district court</a> [PDF] judge and a unanimous three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2017/03/15/17-3510ebo.pdf">ruled</a> [PDF] that Donald Trump's Executive Order (EO) instituting a travel ban was likely illegal, the president suspended it and issued a new EO on March 6, 2017.</p>

<p>On March 15, a federal judge granted a temporary restraining order in <span class="casename">Hawaii v. Trump et al.</span>, halting the operation of the new EO nationwide. US District Judge Derrick K. Watson found that plaintiffs met their burden of establishing a strong likelihood of success on the merits of their Establishment Clause claim, that irreparable injury is likely if the requested relief is not issued, and that the balance of the equities and public interest counsel in favor of granting the requested relief. </p>

<p>When the case is heard on the merits, the legality of the new EO, which categorically suspends immigration from six Muslim majority countries to the United States, should be assessed in light of US treaty and customary international law, according to an amicus brief filed in the case.</p>

<p>Eighty-one international law scholars, including this writer, and a dozen non-governmental organizations with expertise in civil rights law, immigration law or international human rights law (amici) argue in their amicus brief that the new EO threatens discrimination that would run afoul of two treaties. They are the <a href="https://treaties.un.org/doc/publication/unts/volume%20999/volume-999-i-14668-english.pdf">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> [PDF] (CCPR) and the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/ProfessionalInterest/cerd.pdf">International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination</a> [PDF] (CERD).</p>

<p>When the United States ratifies a treaty, it not only makes the US a party to that treaty; it also becomes US domestic law under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/supremacy_clause">Supremacy Clause</a> of the Constitution, which says treaties "shall be the supreme law of the land." Courts have a duty to restrain federal executive action that conflicts with a ratified treaty. </p>

<p>Customary international law develops from the general and consistent practice of states. It is part of federal common law and must be enforced in US courts, whether or not its provisions are contained in a ratified treaty. </p>

<p>Under the Constitution's <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii">Take Care Clause</a>, the President must "take care that the laws be faithfully executed." This means Trump has a constitutional duty to comply with our legal obligations under both treaty and customary international law.</p>

<p>"<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/chapter-12">[T]he Immigration and Nationality Act</a> and other statutes must be read in harmony with these international legal obligations pursuant to the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution and long established principles of statutory construction requiring acts of Congress to be interpreted in a manner consistent with international law, whenever such a construction is reasonably possible," amici argue. "In this case, the international law obligations . . . reinforce interpretations of those statutes forbidding discrimination of the type threatened by Sections 2 and 11 of the EO."</p>

<p><b>The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</b></p>

<p>The United States ratified the CCPR in 1992. Article 2 prohibits "any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference" based on religion or national origin, which has "the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by all persons, on an equal footing," according to the United Nation Human Rights Committee (HRC), the body charged with monitoring implementation of the CCPR.</p>

<p>Article 2 prohibits discrimination against the family as well as individuals. "The family is the natural and fundamental group of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State," Article 23 says. The HRC has opined that states have an obligation to adopt appropriate measures "to ensure the unity or reunification of families, particularly when their members are separated for political, economic and similar reasons."</p>

<p>Many immigrants and refugees flee their countries of origin and come to the United States to reunify with their families. The CCPR protects them against discrimination based on religion or national origin. </p>

<p>Amici state in their brief, "Restrictions on travel and entry caused by the EO that impose disparate and unreasonable burdens on the exercise of this right violate CCPR article 2." According to the HRC, although the CCPR does not generally "recognize a right of aliens to enter or reside in the territory of a State party . . . , in certain circumstances an alien may enjoy the protection of the Covenant even in relation to entry or residence, for example, when considerations of non-discrimination, prohibition of inhuman treatment and respect for family life arise."</p>

<p>Thus the non-discrimination mandates and protection of family life in the CCPR "should be considered by courts in interpreting government measures affecting family unification," the brief says.</p>

<p>Article 26 prohibits religious and national origin discrimination and guarantees equal protection in any government measure. These provisions are not limited to individuals within the territory of the state party and subject to its jurisdiction. So immigrants need not be physically present in the United States to enjoy the protection of Article 26.</p>

<p>Moreover, the non-discrimination requirements enshrined in the CCPR also constitute customary international law. In 1948, the United States approved the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/udhrbook/pdf/udhr_booklet_en_web.pdf">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> [PDF] (UDHR), which is part of customary international law. The UDHR forbids discrimination based on religion or national origin, guarantees equal protection of the law, and protects family life against arbitrary interference.</p>

<p><b>The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination</b></p>

<p>The United States ratified CERD in 1994. That treaty also prohibits discrimination based on religion or national origin. "Racial discrimination" includes any distinctions and restrictions based on national origin. Article 1 specifies that states can only adopt "nationality, citizenship or naturalization" policies that "do not discriminate against any particular nationality."</p>

<p>Like the CCPR, CERD does not limit its non-discrimination provisions to citizens or resident noncitizens. "While CERD does not speak specifically to restrictions on entry of nonresident aliens," the brief says, "the general language of CERD expresses a clear intention to eliminate discrimination based on race or national origin from all areas of government activity."</p>

<p>In Article 4, CERD provides that states parties "[s]hall not permit public authorities or public institutions, national or local, to promote or incite racial discrimination." This includes discrimination based on national origin. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the body of independent experts that monitor the implementation of CERD, interprets Article 4 as requiring states to forbid speech that stigmatizes or stereotypes noncitizens, immigrants, refugees and those seeking asylum. </p>

<p><b>International Law Should be Considered in Evaluating the EO</b></p>

<p>"Those international law principles require courts to reject any attempt by the President to define classes based on national origin or religion, and then to impose on those classes disparate treatment, except to the extent necessary to achieve a legitimate government purpose," amici wrote.</p>

<p>Their brief continues, "The EO...makes an explicit distinction based on national origin that, unless necessary and narrowly tailored to achieve a legitimate government aim, would violate US obligations under international law."</p>

<p>In effect, the EO makes a distinction based on religion. All six of the listed countries have majority Muslim populations. As the brief says, "the EO does not suspend immigration from any state with a non-Muslim majority."</p>

<p>Amici also argue that international law is relevant to Section 11 of the EO, which requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to "collect and make publicly available" information relating to convictions of terrorism-related crimes, government charges of terrorism, and "gender-based violence against women" by foreign nationals. But the EO does not require publication of this information on US citizens. </p>

<p>"By mandating that the Secretary publish pejorative information about noncitizens without comparable information about US citizens," amici wrote, "Section 11 makes a suspect distinction based on national origin." Section 11 "may bear on the intent to discriminate, because the decision to publish derogatory information about noncitizens alone is stigmatizing, and appears to be motivated by a desire to characterize noncitizens as more prone to terrorism or gender-based violence than US citizens." Moreover, "a measure designed to stigmatize noncitizens cannot be proportionate and thus violates article 26 of the CCPR and articles 2 and 4 of the CERD."</p>

<p>Thus, amici "request that the Court consider US obligations under international law, which forms part of US law, in evaluating the legality of the EO."</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sleight of Hand in Florida's New Death Penalty: Requiring, But Not Requiring, Jury Unanimity<br />
<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.law.nova.edu/faculty/adjunct-faculty/meyer-chance.html">Chance Meyer</a> of <a href="https://www.law.nova.edu/index.html">Shepard Broad College of Law,</a>NOVA Southeastern University, discusses the Florida Supreme Court's recent death penalty decision in <span class="casename">Hurst</span> and its implications ...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/29/nyregion/dai-vernon-98-an-expert-magician-who-taught-others.html"><strong>D</strong>ai Vernon</a> knew how to spot a cardsharp.</p>

<p>He searched the country for the best of them, learned their techniques and became the greatest sleight of hand magician that ever lived. He said magic tricks lead the mind, step by step, to defeat its own logic. By his definition, Florida's new death penalty law is a first-rate magic trick.</p>

<p>Florida recently <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/florida-governor-signs-new-death-penalty-law-requiring-unanimous-decision.php">made itself appear</a> to fix its death penalty system, but really just palmed the broken part.</p>

<p>On March 13, after half a century of death sentences requiring majority jury votes, Governor Rick Scott signed <a href="http://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2017/0280/">Senate Bill 280</a>, requiring unanimous juries. Twenty-nine of thirty-one death-penalty states already required unanimity (Alabama <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/node/6677">remains</a> the holdout).</p>

<p>The change has been <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/florida-lawmakers-fix-states-death-penalty-law-46020017">lauded</a> as "a big step to fix [Florida's] death penalty law." The Florida Supreme Court <a href="http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2016/sc12-1947.pdf">declared</a> that Florida "bring[s] its capital sentencing laws into harmony with the direction of society." One reporter even <a href="http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/politics/political-pulse/os-scott-signs-death-penalty-bill-20170313-story.html">proclaimed</a> "Florida's death penalty is now legally sound."</p>

<p>All the stage banter distracted from what the magician's hands were doing.</p>

<p>Focus was directed to the <a href="http://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2017/280/Analyses/2017s00280.pre.cj.PDF">313</a> defendants whose capital trials, yet to occur, were awaiting a new death penalty regime and away from the <a href="http://www.dc.state.fl.us/activeinmates/deathrowroster.asp">381</a> death row inmates already pending execution. The inmates' death sentences are based on findings of judges, rather than juries (unanimous or otherwise), and were imposed under a sentencing regime <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2015/14-7505">found</a> unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>From 1977 to today, Florida executed <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/views-executions?exec_name_1=&exec_year%5B%5D=1977&exec_year%5B%5D=1979&exec_year%5B%5D=1981&exec_year%5B%5D=1982&exec_year%5B%5D=1983&exec_year%5B%5D=1984&exec_year%5B%5D=1985&exec_year%5B%5D=1986&exec_year%5B%5D=1987&exec_year%5B%5D=1988&exec_year%5B%5D=1989&exec_year%5B%5D=1990&exec_year%5B%5D=1991&exec_year%5B%5D=1992&exec_year%5B%5D=1993&exec_year%5B%5D=1994&exec_year%5B%5D=1995&exec_year%5B%5D=1996&exec_year%5B%5D=1997&exec_year%5B%5D=1998&exec_year%5B%5D=1999&exec_year%5B%5D=2000&exec_year%5B%5D=2001&exec_year%5B%5D=2002&exec_year%5B%5D=2003&exec_year%5B%5D=2004&exec_year%5B%5D=2005&exec_year%5B%5D=2006&exec_year%5B%5D=2007&exec_year%5B%5D=2008&exec_year%5B%5D=2009&exec_year%5B%5D=2010&exec_year%5B%5D=2011&exec_year%5B%5D=2012&exec_year%5B%5D=2013&exec_year%5B%5D=2014&exec_year%5B%5D=2015&exec_year%5B%5D=2016&exec_year%5B%5D=2017&sex=All&state%5B%5D=FL&sex_1=All&federal=All&foreigner=All&juvenile=All&volunteer=All">92</a> people. At that pace, 381 would take 165 years. So, with a century or two of unconstitutional executions yet to conduct, Florida's current celebration of a legally sound death penalty looks an awful lot like sleight of hand.</p>

<p>The change to unanimity is an illusion that works like Vernon described. Step by step, legal developments surrounding Florida's death penalty convoluted matters until logic was defeated. Justice Lewis of the Florida Supreme Court <a href="http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2016/sc16-223.pdf">described</a> it as "tumble[ing] down the dizzying rabbit hole of untenable line drawing." A law professor testifying before the Florida Legislature's House Judiciary Committee and Criminal Justice Subcommittee <a href="http://www.floridabar.org/DIVCOM/JN/JNNews01.nsf/cb53c80c8fabd49d85256b5900678f6c/23fe0f8eeff6ea57852580b1004b02e0!OpenDocument&Highlight=0,slippery,otter*">described</a> it as "trying to hold onto a slippery otter."</p>

<p>The sad result is that the public can no longer meaningfully scrutinize actions being taken with respect to Florida's death penalty (which creates a <a href="http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/stet45&div=14&id=&page=">paradox</a> in Eighth Amendment law).</p>

<p>I will try to demystify two of the key maneuvers leading up to the unanimity law&#8212to spoil the trick, like Vernon would catch a false deal of cards&#8212but, fair warning, they are terribly complex. After all, that is what makes the trick work in the first place.</p>

<p><strong>The Harmless Error Maneuver</strong></p>

<p>Rewind to June 24, 2002. The Supreme Court ruled in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13989927396342823081"><span class="casename">Ring v. Arizona</span></a> that, under the Sixth Amendment, juries&#8212not judges&#8212must find the facts that a state requires to be found before a defendant can be sentenced to death, even though judges can then make the sentencing decisions based on those facts. </p>

<p>In Florida, juries found facts supporting death sentences (such as a murder <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/aggravating-factors-capital-punishment-state">being</a> "heinous, atrocious, or cruel") and <em>whether those facts outweighed evidence supporting a life sentence.</em> </p>

<p>If the weighing seems less like a finding of fact than it does a matter of opinion on sentencing, then you are already beginning to see the trick. Hold on to that.</p>

<p>Based on the facts they found, juries would <em>recommend</em> a sentence, by simple majority. But judges would then find their own (alternative) facts and make the ultimate sentencing decision based on those.</p>

<p>Sometimes a jury would vote for life and a judge would impose death anyway. That was known as the "<a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/468/447.html">override</a>." It may sound like a barbaric thing of the past, but it is not. Just ask Matthew Marshall and William Zeigler. Their juries <a href="http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2016/sc16-223.pdf">believed</a> they should live, but they are sill on death row and Florida can still execute them.</p>

<p>In any event, <span class="casename">Ring</span> raised a big question in Florida: <em>are jury fact-findings that support a recommendation, rather than the ultimate sentence, good enough to satisfy the Sixth?</em></p>

<p>It took fourteen years of desperate litigation and <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/views-executions?exec_name_1=&exec_year%5B%5D=2002&exec_year%5B%5D=2003&exec_year%5B%5D=2004&exec_year%5B%5D=2005&exec_year%5B%5D=2006&exec_year%5B%5D=2007&exec_year%5B%5D=2008&exec_year%5B%5D=2009&exec_year%5B%5D=2010&exec_year%5B%5D=2011&exec_year%5B%5D=2012&exec_year%5B%5D=2013&exec_year%5B%5D=2014&exec_year%5B%5D=2015&exec_year%5B%5D=2016&sex=All&state%5B%5D=FL&sex_1=All&federal=All&foreigner=All&juvenile=All&volunteer=All">forty-one</a> executions to get an answer to that question. Uselessly to the forty-one, the answer ended up being no.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to January 12, 2016. The Supreme Court struck down Florida's death penalty in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2106370146029758456"><span class="casename">Hurst v. Florida</span></a> pursuant to <span class="casename">Ring</span>. Turns out, <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/death-sentences-united-states-1977-present">961</a> people, including the forty-one and the remaining 381, were sentenced under an unconstitutional death penalty regime.</p>

<p>It was widely reported that the constitutional problem addressed by <span class="casename">Hurst</span> was that Florida <a href="http://wlrn.org/post/unanimous-jury-still-sticking-point-floridas-death-penalty-debate">gave</a> "judges rather than juries the power to condemn someone to death." But that was not quite right. Remember, <span class="casename">Ring</span> was about <em>fact-findings</em> under the Sixth Amendment, not <em>sentencing decisions</em>, which are the province of the Eighth. While <span class="casename">Hurst</span> certainly has Eighth Amendment <a href="http://repository.law.miami.edu/umlr/vol70/iss4/6/">implications</a>, its holding was of the Sixth, of <span class="casename">Ring</span>.</p>

<p>The problem addressed in <span class="casename">Hurst</span> was that juries did not make the fact-findings upon which sentences were ultimately based. Judges did.</p>

<p>Two things happened next.</p>

<p>In March, the Legislature hurriedly enacted a new death penalty with <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2016/7101">House Bill 7101</a>. It got rid of the life-to-death override and required 10-2 jury "recommendations" (which became rather a misnomer once the override was gone). Politicians favored 10-2 over unanimity because (clearly not fans of <a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-12-angry-men-1957">Reginald Rose</a> or <a href="http://www.best-norman-rockwell-art.com/1959-the-jury.html">Norman Rockwell</a>) they did not want "<a href="http://www.tbo.com/list/news-opinion-editorials/editorial-reviving-the-death-penalty-20160224/">lone holdout</a>" jurors standing in the way of death sentences.</p>

<p>The new law lasted all of seven months. In October, the Florida Supreme Court struck it down.</p>

<p>The court <a href="http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2016/sc12-1947.pdf">made</a> two earth-shattering rulings: that <span class="casename">Hurst</span> required <em>unanimity</em> for fact-findings and, going a step further, also for <em>sentencing determinations</em>.</p>

<p>That gets us back to present day. SB 280 was just a formalization of what the court had mandated, making the statute square with the case law.</p>

<p>But <em>why</em> did the court say that <span class="casename">Hurst</span>&#8212a Sixth Amendment ruling about majority fact-findings&#8212ends up requiring unanimous sentencing determinations? Well, remember when you started to see the trick and I asked you to hold on to it?</p>

<p>What happened was this: Florida had intertwined fact-findings and sentencing decisions, when it made the <em>weighing</em> of facts a prerequisite to imposing death. After all, what else is there to deciding someone deserves to die than deciding that the facts dictate that they deserve to die? (Mercy, perhaps, but mercy is a small footnote in Florida's death penalty practice.)</p>

<p>Sometimes, when constitutional rights <a href="http://www.rutgerslawreview.com/wp-content/uploads/archive/vol64/issue2/Raban Article_Final.pdf">interact</a>, they eat each other. In Florida, the Sixth just swallowed up the Eighth. The fact-findings could not be separated from the sentencing determination, so the fact-findings having to be unanimous meant the sentence did too.</p>

<p><span class="casename">Hurst</span> ended up meaning Florida's death penalty violated the Sixth <em>and</em> the Eighth. So, everyone on death row had their unconstitutional death sentences overturned, right?</p>

<p>Not so fast. The trick was just getting started.</p>

<p>The Florida Supreme Court also ruled that <span class="casename">Hurst</span> violations are subject to harmless error analysis, in which an appellate court can find that a constitutional violation did not matter to the outcome of a case. No harm, no foul. Pre-<span class="casename">Hurst</span> death sentences can still be carried out if a court finds that a jury probably would have made the necessary findings anyway, had the law complied with the Sixth Amendment.</p>

<p>So consider this&#8212here's the real magic trick&#8212if the problem in <span class="casename">Hurst</span> was that <em>trial judges</em> were supplanting jury findings with their own, how then can <em>appellate judges</em> do the very same, under the guise of harmless error analysis, guessing what twelve, lay strangers might have done, had the law been something other than it was.</p>

<p>It is Florida's incredible disappearing/reappearing constitutional violation. Juries, unanimous or split, are being replaced by judges, in order to cure the problem of juries being replaced by judges.</p>

<p><strong>The Retroactivity Maneuver</strong></p>

<p>Another big question that remained after <span class="casename">Hurst</span> was retroactivity; would <span class="casename">Hurst</span> even apply to the hundreds of death row inmates that came before?</p>

<p>The good news here was that we could at least expect a definitive answer, because retroactivity is a yes-or-no question. As Justice Lewis would later <a href="http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2016/sc16-223.pdf">explain</a>, "retroactivity is a binary&#8212either something is retroactive, has effect on the past, or it is not." As Florida's Capital Collateral Regional Counsel South would later <a href="http://www.floridabar.org/DIVCOM/JN/JNNews01.nsf/cb53c80c8fabd49d85256b5900678f6c/23fe0f8eeff6ea57852580b1004b02e0!OpenDocument&Highlight=0,slippery,otter*">tell</a> the Legislature, "I have never seen the concept of partial retroactivity. . . . I just don't know that it really exists."</p>

<p>But the Florida Supreme Court conjured it up anyway. Abracadabra. As to whether <span class="casename">Hurst</span> is or is not retroactive, the court <a href="http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2016/sc16-223.pdf">ruled</a>, quite impossibly, it is both.</p>

<p>The court made June 24, 2002 the cutoff. For defendants whose cases were final after that date, <span class="casename">Hurst</span> exists. For those before, <span class="casename">Hurst</span> doesn't. Of the 381 about <a href="http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2016/sc16-223.pdf">45%</a>, or 171, came before.</p>

<p>Justice Lewis <a href="http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2016/sc16-223.pdf">admonished</a> that this "makes constitutional protection depend on little more than a roll of the dice."</p>

<p>The trouble with partial retroactivity is that the whole reason for applying a case retroactively in the first place is that the case is so significant that extending its benefit to some (going forward) and not to others (from the past) would be too <a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/florida/supreme-court/1980/58329-0.html">unconscionably unjust</a>. The same is of course true of the June 24, 2002 cutoff.</p>

<p>The Florida Supreme Court once <a href="http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2015/sc13-865.pdf">wrote</a> that it is "difficult to justify depriving a person of his liberty or his life, under process no longer considered acceptable." So it is, like ending a life based on a death penalty regime declared to violate the Constitution and society's will.</p>

<p>But difficult magic tricks are the most impressive, which brings us back to Vernon.</p>

<p>Legend has it that when Vernon was a boy someone asked him what sort of magic he did. His response was to have them pick a card and, right then and there, to somehow pull that very card out of his pocket, then to say, "That's the kind of magic I do." After having pulled partial retroactivity out of thin air, it seems to be the kind Florida does as well.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>As the law stands now, 171 defendants who came before June 24, 2002 can be executed unconstitutionally due to nonretroactivity. The remaining 210 can be executed unconstitutionally due to harmless error analysis. Florida could conduct the greatest campaign of knowingly unconstitutional execution in American history, while the audience has its head turned to the future.</p>

		<title>ICJ Rejects Bosnia &#038; Herzegovina&amp;apos;s Request of the Revision of 2007 Judgment</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Fahira Brodlija, an LLM student at the <a href="http://law.pitt.edu/">University of Pittsburgh School of Law</a>, discusses the recent ICJ response to Bosnia and Herzegovina's request for a revised judgment from its 2007 lawsuit against Serbia regarding the application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in its case... </j:header><a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/"><strong>T</strong>he International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) in <a href="https://www.denhaag.nl/en.htm">The Hague</a> rejected a revision request of the judgment based on Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&H)'s lawsuit against Serbia concerning the questionable legitimacy of the legal representation from Sarajevo.  Namely, Sakib Softić has submitted the request for the revision of claims to the ICJ on February 23, 2017 (three days before the established deadline) without the previous approval by the President Mladen Ivanić of B&H. Thereupon, the ICJ has requested clarifications on Softić's legitimacy as well as individual statements of all three members of the B&H Presidency concerning the revision of the judgment.</p>

<p>The ICJ concluded that the request was not submitted based on the appropriate approval by the competent government body and that it could not proceed based on such a request about the "application for the revision of the judgment from February 26, 2007 in the case of the application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (B&H v. Serbia)". The court was in the position to decide on such a revision in a case involving genocide for the first time, but ruled on procedural grounds without addressing the merits. </p>

<p>As a reminder, the initial case was decided by the ICJ a decade ago. Namely, on February 26th 2007, the ICJ rendered a judgment in <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&p2=3&case=91&p3=4"><u>re Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro</u></a>, deciding on the claim of Serbia's violation of the <a href="https://treaties.un.org/doc/publication/unts/volume%2078/volume-78-i-1021-english.pdf">Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide</a> [PDF]. After 14 years of procedure, the ICJ found that the government authorities of Serbia did not (in official capacity) perform activities which constitute genocide in B&H. Therefore, the Court found that as per international law, Serbia was neither liable for genocide in Srebrenica in July of 1995, nor did it act in conspiracy with the intention of committing genocide.</p>

<p>The ICJ did determine Serbia's violations of the Convention on Genocide in its failure to fulfill its international obligation to prevent genocide, therefore this judgment referred to the failure to perform a duty which was undertaken by signing the aforementioned Convention. According to international law, Serbia was under strict obligation to perform actions and measures in order to prevent genocide, and it could not derogate from this obligation.</p>

<p>The request for revision itself caused a strong reaction from the officials of the government of Republika Srpska (RS), most notably Serbian President Milorad Dodik, who emphasized that the attempt to reopen this case is proof that B&H is not moving towards a better future, but continues to look back to the past. Dragan Čović, the Croatian member of the B&H Presidency who notified the ICJ on the lack of authorization to Softić for filing the request in question, shared this view, and announced a stronger cooperation between his party and RS to prevent such unilateral decisions by parties from Sarajevo.</p>

<p>Bosniak member of the B&H presidency, Bakir Izetbegović, stated that the decision of the ICJ is politically motivated and that the court did not actually examine the merits of the request or Softić's authorization. He characterized this development as another blow to the dignity of the Bosniacs who continue to be victimized through the denial of the genocide committed by Serbia under the Milošević regime. He also noted that he had expected more support from Mr. Čović in the pursuit of justice related to the numerous war crimes which took place during the 1992-1995 war.</p>

<p>The deadline for the revision of the judgment has officially expired on February 26, 2017, but the effects this attempt will certainly continue to shape the daily socio-political events in B&H, especially raising national tensions which are certainly going to rise after such an overt unilateral decision. In the wake of these developments, the <a href="http://www.srbija.gov.rs/vlada/sastav.php">Prime Minister of Serbia</a>, Aleksandar Vučić is visiting Sarajevo on March 16, 2017. This visit should provide more clarity as to the position of the two countries and the future steps towards overcoming the current difficulties. Bakir Izetbegović has emphasized that he does not associate the Vučić government with Milošević and that Vučić is always welcome in Sarajevo.  </p>

<p>The matter took another bizarre turn when it was established that Mr. Sakib Softić was notified by the ICJ in May of 2015, stating that he lacks the proper authorization and legitimacy to act as a legal representative of the Government of B&H before that court. This finding has created political and social outrage motivated by the fact that along with the failure to follow the proper procedure for the request to the ICJ during the 10 years from the initial lawsuit, the person chosen to ultimately submit the request knowingly act outside of his capacity in the process. Many questions are raised on the Bosniak side regarding possible explanations for this development, the main one being whether this was another blatant example of political incompetence and negligence, or if this was a planned activity supported by the Serbian side to undermine and prevent the attempts to reach justice regarding the war crimes B&H. The pressure on Mr. Softić is mounting as the President of Republika Srpska Dodik has urged the Republic's prosecutor's office to file a suit against him for false representation.</p>

<p>The author of the revision request, former-US Ambassador for Matters of Genocide, <a href="https://www.aba-icc.org/board-of-advisors/hon-david-scheffer/">David Scheffer</a>, expressed great disappointment in the fact that the court rejected the revision request due to technicalities. Mr. Scheffer emphasized that unlike other state to state litigation such as oil and gas concessions or border disputes, matters of genocide should not be allowed to fall easily on procedural grounds. He also encouraged appeals and challenges to this rejection, as he firmly believes that B&H has enough evidence to substantiate its genocide claims against Serbia. </p>

<p>It remains to be seen how this complicated scenario unveils both on the day to day political stage, as well as in the context of the new partnerships being built with long term perspectives. There is no doubt that this attempt of accessing justice for the crimes committed over two decades ago has allowed some of the old sentiments and tensions to resurface, thus demonstrating that no matter how long such tension remains dormant, it can re-emerge at any moment in full-force with all the detrimental effects it carries. </p>

		<title>Race to Death: A Critical Look at the Death Penalty as Arkansas Executes Eight</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.wvu.edu/faculty-staff/full-time-faculty/valena-elizabeth-beety">Valena Beety</a> of <a href="http://www.law.wvu.edu/">West Virginia University College of Law</a>, discusses the impending Arkansas execution of eight people in ten days ...</p>

<p><strong>T</strong>he state of Arkansas plans to execute eight people across ten days this April. Arkansas will attempt to execute two people per day on four days in order to use up their stock of execution drug, midazolam, before its expiration date. </p>

<p>Until now, Arkansas's mark in death penalty history was its execution of Rickey Ray Rector: a man so <a href="http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=4160">unable to comprehend</a> his surroundings that he ate his final meal and saved his slice of pecan pie for later. Rector had shot himself in the head after committing his crime, but survived. Legally, the state may not execute a person who does not understand they are about to die. Yet the courts ducked the issue, and another famous Arkansas Governor&#8212Bill Clinton&#8212made sure to be present for Rector's execution even while campaigning for the presidency in 1992. </p>

<p>Has the death penalty changed since Rector was executed? Yes. As noted by the <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/number-executions-state-and-region-1976">Death Penalty Information Center</a>, the use of capital punishment is the lowest it has been since Rector's execution twenty-five years ago.</p>

<p>States can no longer execute someone who is <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2043469055777796288">mentally handicapped</a>. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16987406842050815187">Teenagers</a> cannot be sentenced to death. And approximately 1 in 10 people on death row is <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/innocence-and-crisis-american-death-penalty#Sec05a">innocent</a>, if we look at the death row exonerations since 1973. </p>

<p>Justice Breyer, in a dissent in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9523726705510775009"><span class="casename">Ruiz v. Texas</span></a>, recently raised the question whether solitary confinement on death row is cruel and unusual.  Breyer questioned the cruelty and psychological toll of knowing one is waiting for death and being unable to communicate with other living people.  Rolando Ruiz lived in this solitary containment for 22 years. Breyer's consideration of solitary confinement as a factor in the legality of the death penalty could open another restriction on death row and executions.  </p>

<p>In these past 25 years, the cost of litigating capital cases has risen, with an increasing use of experts and forensic evidence. Nationally, death sentences <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2014/05/01/considering-the-death-penalty-your-tax-dollars-at-work/#38bad532664b">cost more</a> than life sentences.  In neighboring Tennessee, death sentences cost the state <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/death-penalty/us-death-penalty-facts/death-penalty-cost">48% more</a> to pursue than death in prison.   </p>

<p>Arkansas is routinely one of the poorest states in the country, yet the state pays to keep the death sentence alive. While courts vary in how they divvy up costs for capital trials and appeals, I found in my own <a href="http://mississippilawjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/3_Beety_Final.pdf">research</a> that the neighboring state of Mississippi applies these costs to the state citizens in an obfuscated way. In Mississippi the individual counties pay for the death penalty trials and appeals&#8212and yet no money is allocated for these cases in county budgets. The yearly budget for counties does not have a line item for an expense that can routinely be $50,000 per case. </p>

<p>Instead, the prosecutor or the circuit clerk petitions the sitting county commission with an individual request for funding for each death penalty case. That request is granted. Extra costs for the court include jury costs, expert witness fees and additional bailiffs for security. Circuit clerks who have spoken candidly have compared a death penalty trial to the cost of a natural disaster, depleting the county resources.  For poor counties, this money is surreptitiously going to fund capital trials, instead of repairing roads or bridges. The money for the trial is simply taken from other line items in the budget to make up the difference.</p>

<p>It is, of course, completely within the discretion of the prosecutor to seek a death sentence, largely without financial repercussions for their individual offices. Prosecutors normally aren't chastised for prosecuting death penalty cases, rather for <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/03/orlando-chief-prosecutor-rejects-death-penalty-for-all-future-cases.php">not prosecuting</a> a case as capital. Likewise, the Governor often has the power to commute a death sentence to life without parole. The Governor of Arkansas receives a non-binding report from the Arkansas Board of Pardons and Paroles to prepare for his decision whether to commute a sentence. </p>

<p>Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson supports the execution of eight men in April, specifically <a href"http://www.thestate.com/news/nation-world/national/article139844253.html">stating</a> "the families of the victims that have endured this for so many years deserve a conclusion to it."  Arguments on behalf of the victims and their families are commonly invoked by governors when they refuse to commute a death sentence. </p>

<p>Yet when the victims oppose the execution, they are often ignored. Henry "Curtis" Jackson, Jr. was on death row for killing his nieces and nephews. The surviving victims were his sisters. His sisters pleaded with the Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant to commute Jackson's sentence to life and not to execute their brother. In <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/sisters-death-row-brother-henry-curtis-jackson-jr-killed-kids-spared-article-1.1089873">their words</a>, "[w]e are the victims in this case, and we are begging you not to let Curtis be killed. You can keep him in Parchman forever, but please don't put our family through this horrible execution . . . We are not asking you to take pity on Curtis, we're asking you to show US mercy. We have been through enough."  Their brother was executed by the state of Mississippi on June 5, 2012. </p>

<p>What has stayed the same since the execution of Rickey Ray Rector twenty-five years ago? Lethal injection and botched executions. For <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/25/us/1992-campaign-death-penalty-arkansas-execution-raises-questions-governor-s.html">fifty minutes</a>, executors struggled to find a vein to inject the lethal cocktail of drugs into Rector's arm. He was heard to <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1993/02/22/death-in-arkansas">moan eight separate times</a>. This parallels the experiences of people being executed with the use of the drug midazolam&#8212the drug Arkansas needs to "use up" before it expires at the end of April. According to the Death Penalty Information Center, no state has <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/node/6692">successfully executed</a> two prisoners on the same day using midazolam.  Death penalty opponents fear inevitable botched executions in Arkansas with the rush.</p>

<p>As we face these oncoming eight executions in Arkansas, there's no final word on the death penalty and the debate continues about the humanity of death sentences. But what is the most common last word of the people executed? <a href="https://priceonomics.com/what-death-row-inmates-say-in-their-last-words/">"Love."</a></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.unc.edu/faculty/directory/wilsonerikak">Erika Wilson</a> of <a href="http://www.law.unc.edu/">University of North Carolina School of Law</a>, discusses the potential perils of Kentucky's new charter school law ...</p>

<p><strong>O</strong>n March 21, 2017, Kentucky governor Matt Bevin signed into law <a href="http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/ky-general-assembly/2017/03/22/matt-bevin-signs-charter-schools-bill-into-law/99489126/">House Bill ("HB") 520</a>, a bill that will allow charters schools to operate in Kentucky for the first time in the state's history. Beginning with the 2017-2018 academic year, school boards in Kentucky will have the authority to approve an <em>uncapped</em> number of charter schools. The bill adopts the same <a href="http://www.lrc.ky.gov/recorddocuments/bill/17RS/HB520/bill.pdf">rhetoric</a> commonly used in support of charter school proliferation, namely that charters schools will allow for innovation, flexibility and provide an opportunity to reduce socioeconomic, racial and ethnic achievement gaps. Yet, as seen in other states that allow for an unlimited number of charter schools, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/29/us/for-detroits-children-more-school-choice-but-not-better-schools.html?_r=0">realities</a> of uncapped charter school growth are often very different from the rhetoric. As Kentucky embarks on its charter school odyssey, three important warnings are worth heading.</p>

<p><strong>The Perils of Limited Regulation and Schools</strong></p>

<p>First, the very nature of charter schools changes the dynamics of what is supposed to be a system of public education. Though charter schools are public schools, a private charter operator under a contract with the state essentially runs them. Charter schools are also exempt from many state and local regulations. They are afforded wide latitude on matters that traditional public schools are not; issues such as hiring and firing practices, curriculum design, teacher pay and qualifications. The inevitable result of giving private charter operators license to run public schools with relaxed regulation is the introduction of elements of privatization into the system of public education. Case in point, Kentucky's HB 520 allows teachers, parents, school administrators, citizens, public organizations, non-profit organizations or a combination of the aforementioned, to become charter school operators. Only local school boards and the mayors of Louisville and Lexington can approve contracts with charter operators. Importantly however, once the local school board or mayor approves the charter contract, there is nothing in HB520 that precludes the charter school operator from contracting out the management and operation of the school to a third-party for-profit Education Management Organization ("EMO"). Indeed, EMOs run a <a href="http://www.publiccharters.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/New-Closed-2016.pdf">sizeable</a> percentage of charter schools nationwide. EMOs have long elicited concerns that given the regulatory latitude afforded charter schools, they may enact educational policies with the goal of maximizing profit, rather than sound educational policies aimed at student learning. Indeed, a study of for-profit charter schools in <a href="https://aefpweb.org/sites/default/files/webform/41/singleton_aefp030116.pdf">Florida</a> found that charters operated by for-profit EMOs schools spent less money overall, less money on instruction and achieved lower student proficiency gains. Failure to include clear limits or prohibitions on the use of for-profit charter EMOs leaves some subset of Kentucky public schools vulnerable to the possibility of the charters run by for-profit entities emphasizing financial gains over student gains. </p>

<p><strong>Unsavory Competition for Students</strong></p>

<p>Second, another potential danger raised by HB520 is the possibility of unrestricted growth of the charter school. Under HB520, charter schools will receive state money based on how many students are enrolled in the school. Put another way, the money follows the student. As seen in places like Detroit and New Orleans, unrestricted charter growth can lead to predatory competition for students and the public dollars that follow them. <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/vouchers/choice/choice.html">Proponents</a> of charter schools contend that removing caps on the number of charter schools permitted to operate in a state leads to increased competition amongst schools for students and increases the number of good school options available to students. Again, the realities of how that competition plays out for the most-vulnerable students--poor and minority students--belies such rhetoric. In states that do not have caps on the number of charter schools, <a href="http://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/in/2015/01/29/charter-school-offered-100-reward-to-anyone-who-referred-students-who-enrolled/">stories</a> abound of schools competing for students through unsavory enticements such as cash gift cards for example. They do so for purposes of having the student in the building on the day enrollment is counted for purposes of receiving the government funding that follows the students to charter schools. Once the enrollment count day has ended, concerns about maintaining enrollment erode, children deemed academic or discipline problems can be easily dismissed. </p>

<p>Further, allowing an uncapped number of charter schools prohibits charter schools from collaborating with public schools in ways that might be useful to both the charter and public schools. The <a href="http://www.rethinkingschools.org/archive/28_01/28_01_karp.shtml">initial</a> charter school movement began with the premise that charter schools could serve as useful laboratories of experiment. Relaxed regulations would allow new teaching methods and techniques that could be tried, tested and imported back into traditional public schools. It was a model that envisioned collaboration rather than competition. Yet the influx of charter schools is more likely to cause <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/eval/choice/district_impact.pdf">competition</a> between charter and traditional schools rather than collaboration. The possibility of competition rather than collaboration is particularly likely in Kentucky given the language of HB520, which allows an existing public school to be converted into a charter school if (among other things) sixty percent of parents in the school and the majority of the school board in the district in which the school is situated approve the conversion. </p>

<p><strong>Racial and Socioeconomic Equity Issues</strong></p>

<p>Lastly, key concerns raised by charter schools are related to issues of racial and socioeconomic equity. Kentucky has shown a steadfast commitment to maintaining racially and socioeconomically integrated schools. Most notably, the Jefferson County school district maintained a voluntary integration plan for years after their court ordered desegregation plan ended, until the Supreme Court struck their plan down as relying upon an unconstitutional use of race in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13995371921000266257&q=Parents+Involved+in+Community+Schools+v.+Seattle+School+District+No.+1&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39"><span class="casename">Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1.</span></a> Even after the decision in <span class="casename">Parents Involved</span>, Jefferson County continued to rely on a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/03/the-city-that-believed-in-desegregation/388532/">bussing</a> plan between urban and suburban areas in the County in order to maintain racial and economic balance in its schools. However, the introduction of charter schools to the public education landscape in Kentucky may jeopardize racial and socio-economic integration in Kentucky's schools, particularly the urban schools. Recent research <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ccf_20161021segregation_version-10_211.pdf">has shown</a> that charter schools undoubtedly influence patterns of racial segregation in schools. In many ways, charter schools can represent an "opt-out" for parents in suburbs or urban areas who are tired of having their children bussed. Indeed, the rise of charter schools in states like North Carolina <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w21078">provided</a> a vehicle for white parents to secede from more racially and economically diverse schools. A proliferation of neighborhood based charter schools could change the balance of racial integration in Kentucky schools. In approving charter applications, serious attention should be paid to the racial and socioeconomic implications of citing a new charter school. </p>

<p>Ultimately, the success (or failure) of HB520 will depend upon the Kentucky Board of Education. HB520 charges the Kentucky Board of Education with implementing regulations to support the implementation of the law. The Kentucky Board of Education would be wise to heed the aforementioned warnings regarding limited regulation, unsavory competition and racial and socio-economic equity.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.olemiss.edu/faculty-directory/william-w-berry-iii/">William W. Berry III</a> of the University of Mississippi School of Law discusses the constitutional questions and unclear future of the death penalty ... </p><strong>T</strong>he State of Mississippi legislature has recently passed a <a href="http://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/documents/2017/pdf/HB/0600-0699/HB0638PS.pdf">bill</a> [PDF] to amend its death penalty statute to provide for additional alternative methods of execution if lethal injection becomes unconstitutional, and to broaden the acceptable techniques of lethal injection. Specifically, the new statute provides that if lethal injection becomes unconstitutional, the state must use the gas chamber as the method of killing. If then the gas chamber also becomes unconstitutional, the state must use a firing squad as the method of execution. Finally, if lethal injection, gas chamber, and firing squad all become unconstitutional, the state must execute using electrocution. </p>

<p>This new approach is a bizarre reaction to the current lethal injection crisis where the state wants to make sure that it has some way to execute the 47 inmates on its death row. While other states have increasingly explored other methods of execution, Mississippi is the first to sequentially stack and prefer a series of methods. Like most states, the new Mississippi statute does not provide a choice of method to inmates.</p>

<p>This concern with the efficacy of execution methods underscores the broader death penalty landscape, with states facing increasing difficulty in obtaining the needed drugs to conduct lethal injection procedures. The drug in particular that states cannot obtain is the anesthetic given before the lethal drugs. The European companies that made such drugs, most often sodium thiopental or similar barbiturate, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/02/can-europe-end-the-death-penalty-in-america/283790/">have ceased manufacturing them</a>, and American companies have not attempted to fill the void, both because of FDA restrictions and public stigma that might attach from manufacturing death penalty drugs.</p>

<p>As states have run out of sodium thiopental, some began to use pentobarbital as a substitute, but supplies of that drug have dried up as well. The most recent substitute adopted by a number of states is midazolam, an anesthetic used in surgeries. Indeed, the state of <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/arkansas-judge-rules-executions-can-proceed.php">Arkansas has chosen</a> to execute eight inmates in a ten-day period in April largely because its supply of midazolam faces an upcoming expiration date.</p>

<p>These approaches by states in executing inmates remain troublesome on two levels. First, the procedures in many cases are experimental&#8212;states are using new protocols for execution and the inmate receiving the lethal injection becomes the guinea pig for their approach. For obvious reasons, states have not tested such approaches before, but there remains an alarming lack of medical involvement in developing these procedures. </p>

<p>Second, in many lethal injection protocols, the second drug (after the anesthetic) is a paralytic, making it impossible to determine the effect of the lethal injection on the inmate with respect to anesthesia and pain. While assuaging the visual picture for observers (inmates appear to drop off into a peaceful sleep), the use of a paralytic hides the success (or failure) of the anesthetic. If the anesthetic wears off, the inmate receives the sensation of being burned alive from the inside, with the added torture of not being able to move in response to this excruciating pain. Several botched lethal injections (where the anesthetic did not work) have demonstrated the potentially gruesome nature of this kind of punishment. There may be <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2944779">constitutional issues</a> with the use of secrecy in this context.</p>

<p>Inmates have challenged the use of midazolam specifically, as having a ceiling effect, where additional dosage does not lengthen the period of sedation. With no clinical trial to observe, states have simply increased the dosage amount for midazolam and hoped for the best. The paralytic, though, makes it very difficult to determine whether (and how) such an approach has worked in recent lethal injections.</p>

<p>In 2015, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-7955_aplc.pdf">considered</a> [PDF] the constitutionality of the lethal injection protocol using midazolam, upholding the approach as a punishment that did not fall within the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendment's</a> proscription against cruel and unusual punishments. In adopting a very high standard for showing unconstitutionality (proving a substantial risk of severe pain and showing a feasible statutory alternative), Justice Alito's opinion chastised the "guerrilla warfare" attacks on the availability of lethal injection drugs, emphasizing that if a punishment is constitutional, there must be a constitutional way to impose it.</p>

<p>His opinion, however, demonstrated the manner in which the court has muddied the distinction between the punishment (the death penalty), the method (lethal injection), and the technique (three-drug protocol with midazolam). All three must meet the requirements of the Eighth Amendment. Despite the similar nature of the question&#8212;whether the punishment, method, or technique is a cruel and unusual punishment&#8212;the court uses different tests to assess each issue. </p>

<p>With respect to the punishment and its application, the court uses its evolving standards of decency test. This test looks to the majority practice and then requires the court to determine whether the application of the punishment satisfies one or more purposes of punishment. As for the technique, the court uses its "substantial risk of pain" test as it did in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-7955_aplc.pdf"><em>Glossip v. Gross</em></a> [PDF], and its predecessor, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10752510346595419167"><em>Baze v. Rees</em></a>, which upheld Kentucky's lethal injection protocol in 2008. It is unclear whether the former test or the latter test would apply to challenges to the method itself, particularly because there have been no recent challenges to methods, only techniques.</p>

<p>The constitutionality of statutes such as the proposed Mississippi statute could hinge on which test the court elects to apply. If the evolving-standards-of-decency test constitutes the applicable standard, the court would look to whether other states use the methods in question. Currently, <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/methods-execution">thirty-three states</a> use some form of lethal injection. Not counting Mississippi, only eight states allow electrocution, five states allow the gas chamber, three states allow hanging, and <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/methods-execution">two states</a> allow firing squads. Under the court's doctrine, no method other than lethal injection would satisfy the majoritarian part of the test, as an overwhelming majority of jurisdictions do not use such methods. The second part of the test, the application of the purposes of punishment, would be more uncertain. The central question would be whether the method (electrocution, gas chamber, hanging, or firing squad) would satisfy the purpose of retribution or the purpose of general deterrence. Interestingly, the court has never had a case where the results of the two evolving standards inquiries diverge.</p>

<p>If the court applied the <em>Glossip</em> test, the question would be whether the method created a substantial risk of severe pain. If the petitioner could make such a showing, the petitioner would then have to show that an available alternative method offered a substantial lower risk of severe pain. </p>

<p>A petitioner offering such a theory with respect to lethal injection had his petitioner for certiorari recently <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-602_n758.pdf">denied by the court</a> [PDF]. Alabama death row inmate Thomas Arthur amassed significant evidence that lethal injection would create a much more substantial risk of severe pain because he has a heart condition and requested death by firing squad. Justices Sotomayor and Breyer dissented to the denial of certiorari, arguing that Arthur had met the <em>Glossip</em> standard.</p>

<p>Despite the doctrinal confusion, the court has never held that a method or technique of execution was unconstitutional. If, however, states continue to experiment with old methods and techniques or create new ones, it remains to be seen whether the court might intervene in a given circumstance.</p>

<p>Given the continued issues with obtaining lethal injection drugs and renewed efforts by states to find alternative methods and techniques of execution, the future of the death penalty remains both murky and unpredictable. To be sure, the myriad of issues relating to the legality of methods and techniques has spurred action by states in a number of different directions. What makes this even more interesting is the gradual decline of the death penalty over the past decade in terms of <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/29/support-for-death-penalty-lowest-in-more-than-four-decades/">public opinion</a>, number of <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/death-penalty-trends">new death sentences</a>, and number of <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/executions-year">executions themselves</a>. The current rash of action might be the impetus to return to the heyday of the 1990's, or more likely, the <a href="http://time.com/deathpenalty/">last gasp</a> of the death penalty before it gradually disappears.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.gpwlaw.com/attorneys/id/30/jason-e-luckasevic/">Jason Luckasevic</a> of Goldberg, Percy &#38; White discusses his firsthand account of the fight with the National Football League (NFL) regarding the neurocognitive disease, CTE ... </p><strong>L</strong>ike so many other young boys, I dreamt that someday I would become a professional athlete. I would watch the games and then imitate my favorite players in the backyard. I lived my life around sports growing up. When the school day ended, it was off to play whatever sport was in season. Sports provided me with a sense of teamwork and accomplishment. Our society has placed sports at such a high level that today&#8217;s professional athletes are amongst the highest paid of any profession in America. The National Football League &#8220;NFL&#8221; sits at the top with its $15 Billion a year entertainment business.</p>

                <p>My dream of the big leagues ended after high school. I instead took the path of attending law school in Pittsburgh, PA. I always kept the hope alive that someday maybe I could be an agent to the players or be hired as a general counsel for a professional team. The reality is that those legal jobs are sparser than becoming a professional athlete. </p>

                <p>By the age of 30, I was in my 6th year at Goldberg, Persky & White. My law firm was one of the pioneers of representing victims of asbestos exposure. I had groomed my career helping victims one by one who were dying from cancer by helping them through depositions and all the way to an occasional trial.  </p>

                <p>On one fall day in 2006, my friend and expert on some of my cases stopped by my office in the morning to discuss a case he had reviewed. I had just set down the local newspaper. Walking into my office was the young Nigerian neuropathologist who had diagnosed the second former Steeler with Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) a chronic and latent developing neurocognitive disease of the brain caused from repeated trauma to one's head. Dr. Bennet Omalu sat across my desk from me, holding an article which characterized his findings on CTE as speculative" and "unscientific." As a friend, I told him he needed to fight back from the harsh criticism printed in the article, cast by doctors employed within the NFL. Dr. Omalu suggested to me that I investigate filing a lawsuit against the NFL, and this is where the most publicized litigation in the last decade all began.</p>

                <p>I started my investigation into the science of head injuries and spoke with the leaders in the field. I briefed myself on the research that led Dr. Omalu to conclude that football had first disabled, and then killed Pittsburgh football legends Mike Webster and Terry Long. I conferred with Bob Fitzsimmons, a skilled West Virginia lawyer, who was the first to contemplate the legal ramifications of football and brain injuries when he took on the NFL disability plan. My investigation turned to reading and reviewing scientific journals. I did a literature search locating nearly one hundred medical articles concerning sports, concussions, and CTE-like conditions.  </p>

                <p>I reviewed the history of the NFL over its decades of existence, the formation of the league and its corporate structure, myriad injury reports, as well as rule changes and new penalties that may have been intended to reduce the occurrence of brain injuries, but failed to do so. I learned about the NFL&#8217;s Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Committee, and read the dozens of articles it published contesting Dr. Omalu&#8217;s findings. </p>

                <p>I read about retired players&#8217; struggles in media reports. I studied other sports leagues, particularly the NHL and its management of concussions. I researched return-to-play guidelines that had been in existence for decades in published literature. I spoke to players, families and widows. I ordered medical records and reviewed family histories. I even investigated other causes and sources of neurocognitive impairments in an effort to understand all aspects of the disease.</p>

                <p>I studied the issue of neurocognitive impairments intensely and became intimately familiar with the unique cognitive and behavioral symptoms surrounding CTE. I explored the issue of causation. It was always the biggest question: How can it be proven that the disease was caused from football? I also spent countless hours discussing that very issue with Dr. Omalu. All of this research had become more than a lawsuit; it had become my life and career.</p>

                <p>I then turned to conducting a legal analysis. I explored past lawsuits against the NFL. There were over 35 published cases where the NFL was a party. Most were anti-trust cases, but there were three cases that analyzed legal issues of negligence and personal injury. I reviewed the materials on the dockets of those cases, reading the pleadings, orders and evidence. I learned for the first time that the NFL routinely escaped liability due to labor preemption under the <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/resources/national-labor-relations-act">Labor Management Relations Act</a> (LMRA) based on its collective bargaining agreement with the players. I spent hundreds of hours determining whether there were any legal theories that would circumvent the preemption under the LMRA. I read and studied many of the past voluminous NFL collective bargaining agreements. I studied the NFL disability plan. I researched the Mike Webster case against the disability plan. I analyzed workers compensation cases to rule out the NFL as an employer to the players.</p>

                <p>Soon, the NFL faced further media scrutiny through Congressional hearings concerning the plight of the retired player.  Additional self-serving medical publications showed further cover up by the league to refute a link between football and head injuries. This led me to develop legal theories that the NFL was acting with fraud, conspiracy and with negligence trying to monopolize the science of sports head injuries.</p>

                <p>As more former players were confirmed to have CTE upon autopsies, those that were living began to understand the root of their cognitive and emotional problems. The former players wanted to share their stories and the stories of their friends with me. They all started contacting me to learn of my pioneering plans to take on the NFL. They all wanted to be part of this endeavor to hold the league accountable for failing to protect them from the long term risks of repeatedly hitting their heads against one another. After all, they were the players of the 70s, 80s and 90s. They participated in a violent collision game. It had left many of them bruised, broken, battered and confused after an average career span of three years making around $100,000 per season.</p>

                <p>By 2010, I had associated with two litigation firms to offer strength and support to our litigation. On July 19, 2011, we had 75 clients and filed the first complaint ever against the NFL captioned <em><a href="http://profootballconcussions.com/pdf/court_documents/7-19_11_Maxwell_v_NFL.pdf">Maxwell v. NFL</a></em> [PDF]. This case that has been repeatedly referenced by all courts as the case which originated the NFL Concussion litigation.</p>

                <p>Word of this massive personal injury lawsuit against the NFL spread quickly as national media outlets reported on the filing and continued bringing attention to the &#8220;concussion in sports crisis.&#8221; By August third, our litigation team filed a second suit on behalf of another 47 former players.</p>

                <p>Shortly thereafter, our work was mirrored by other lawyers who began filing cases for their clients across the country.  Ultimately, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated all of the actions in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania located in Philadelphia where the Honorable Anita Brody was selected to preside and organize the litigation which was titled <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3879375901912515180">The NFL Concussion Litigation</a>.  </p>

                <p>Judge Brody ultimately encouraged the parties to mediate the cases prior to any rulings on preemption. This resulted in a settlement that was proposed as a class action that would benefit every former player who developed medical evidence of dementia, Parkinson's Disease, ALS and some CTE deaths for decades to come. After years of appeals, many of the former players finally will soon collect on what may someday cost the NFL well over a billion dollars. <br />
                    <br />
                    Some former players, including a few of mine, have said the settlement was not sufficient. The NFL had lied. I gathered the evidence to prove it. Those cases will continue in court in an effort to make the NFL answer for what they did to the generation of athletes that I grew up admiring. It will provide the public with the much needed knowledge to make an informed decision about letting children engage in contact sports.</p>

                <p>During the investigation and litigation, I faced many challenges and struggles. But, all of those were nothing in comparison to what the many players and their families faced and continue to experience. This case started as an effort of a young lawyer to vindicate the reputation of his young friend, who found a disease of the brain impacting America's beloved sport.  Along the way, it turned into an unending passion to obtain justice for the athletes that I grew up admiring that I never dreamt would someday ask me to help them.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href=" https://www.samford.edu/cumberlandlaw/directory/Ross-William-G">William G. Ross</a> of Samford University's Cumberland School of Law discusses the constitutional legacy of the First World War... </p><strong>A</strong>merican entry into the First World War one hundred years ago, on April 6, 1917, generated significant constitutional changes that resonate a century later. The war enormously expanded the economic regulatory powers of the federal government, laid the foundation for the emergence of the modern administrative state, aggrandized presidential powers, expedited women's suffrage, sowed the seeds of the civil rights movement, and provided a catalyst for modern civil liberties law. </p>

<p>Participation in the war constituted an abrupt departure from the American tradition of non-interference in disputes that did not affect the Western hemisphere. President Wilson, who had valiantly tried for nearly three years to keep the United States out of the European conflagration, reluctantly asked Congress to declare war only after Germany announced a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare that threatened American shipping. Since Germany had no intent or ability to invade the United States, the declaration of war did not necessarily require the United States to send troops overseas. The Wilson Administration quickly decided however, to commit the full resources of the nation to a thirty-fold expansion of the military forces, raising an army of nearly three million men that ultimately secured the defeat of Germany in November 1918. </p>

<p>Such massive military mobilization required mobilization of economic and social forces never before seen in the United States. Like Lincoln during the Civil War, Wilson claimed that the United States was fighting for the preservation of democracy, even though Germany was not significantly less "democratic" than were the Allied nations of Britain, France, and revolution-torn Russia. Germany had made major strides toward representative government during the pre-war years and held far fewer persons in colonial subjugation than did Britain or France. As the war continued, federal, state and local authorities became increasingly strident in their insistence that civilization itself was at stake, a contention that they used again and again to justify extraordinary measures that would have been politically and constitutionally unthinkable before the war. </p>

<p>Since remarkably few men volunteered for military service, Congress quickly <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title50/html/USCODE-2011-title50-app-selective.htm">instituted</a> a draft that ultimately conscripted two million men. Mindful of the widespread resistance toward much more limited conscription during the Civil War, Congress approved the <a href="http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=3&psid=3904">Espionage Act</a> that criminalized attempts to interfere with conscription. </p>

<p>The Espionage Act also reflected anxieties about potential opposition toward the war among powerful segments of the American population. German-Americans, the nation's largest ethnic group, were an obvious source of dissent, as were Irish-Americans, many of whom were hostile toward Britain, which opposed Irish independence. Labor unions, committed to international working class solidarity, were another source of potential opposition toward the war, as was the large and growing socialist and pacifist movements. Although it became clear early in the war that most members of these groups would support the war, the federal government remained so anxious about the prospect of opposition that Congress in 1918 enacted a <a href="http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=3&psid=3903">Sedition Act</a> that criminalized "disloyal" or "abusive" language about the Constitution and the American form of government or any "word or act" that opposed the American cause in the war. </p>

<p>Even though conscription generated surprisingly little resistance, its constitutionality was promptly challenged in a series of cases that culminated in unanimous Supreme Court decisions sustaining the draft. The court held that the congressional power to raise armies and support navies necessarily presupposed a power to provide men for those forces. The court petulantly brushed aside in a single paragraph the allegation that conscription constituted involuntary servitude in violation of the Thirteenth Amendment. Although there is no reason to suppose that any of the Justices doubted the constitutionality of conscription, the court could hardly have ruled otherwise without striking a horrible blow to its institutional powers and prestige since Congress and the President would almost surely have defied any decision that would have had the practical effect of calling a halt to the war.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in a sharp departure from the nation's laissez faire tradition, a blizzard of congressional legislation and presidential orders minutely regulated agriculture, manufacturing, mining, transportation and retailing. The federal government seized control of the railroads, telephones and telegraphs, dictated prices for a wide range of commodities, and became the world's largest insurer by providing insurance for military personnel and their families. Interjecting itself into labor-management relations, federal authorities established guidelines for labor practices, adjudicated labor disputes and created a national employment bureau. Wartime restrictions on the consumption and sale of alcohol led directly to the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxviii">federal prohibition amendment</a> of 1919, which was <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxxi">repealed</a> in 1933. No detail was too petty to escape the attention of federal authorities, who boasted that they were able to build two warships by persuading clothing manufacturers to remove metal from women's corsets. </p>

<p>Although legislation such as the <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/food-and-drug-act-1906">Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906</a> had expanded federal regulatory powers during the Progressive Era even before the war, the magnitude of federal economic activity eclipsed any previous initiatives. Congress spent more money during the war than the total of what it had spent since 1789. It financed the war through aggressive sales of war bonds to tens of millions of Americans, precipitous increases in the income tax and a steep inflation. The war permanently shifted the bulk of taxation from consumption taxes (particularly tariffs and liquor excises) to levies on incomes. The modern <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/ninetyestate.pdf">estate tax</a> [PDF] was introduced for the first time.</p>

<p>This transformation of governmental powers generated remarkably little resistance from regulated industries or consumers. Although the government sometimes coerced compliance, business and consumers usually cooperated because they prospered in the wartime economy and they believed that the war promoted their long-term interests, especially because the United States had loaned so much money to its allies. Large businesses tended to benefit, often at the expense of smaller competitors, from regulations that they helped to formulate and administer. Unable to assemble a large bureaucracy overnight, the federal government relied heavily upon corporations for advice and assistance and many business leaders - "dollar a year men'--served for nominal compensation in federal agencies that regulated their businesses. Various private enterprises also benefited from large infusions of public capital. The government, for example, invested billions of dollars in the ailing railroad industry, whose shareholders received generous dividends from Uncle Sam. In addition to providing positive incentives to support regulation, the suppression of speech through the Espionage and Sedition Acts and other measures provided reminders of the perils of criticizing economic regulation. </p>

<p>Although this radical shift in the role of government generated a veritable seminar of constitutional law questions involving federalism, separation of powers, the commerce clause, taxation and due process, members of Congress tended to stifle their qualms, often explaining that they would rather risk violating the Constitution than losing the war. Most war measures never were tested in court, partly because the duration of the war was so short. The US Supreme Court sustained the constitutionality of nearly of all of the few statutes that it reviewed, sometimes on technical or other narrow grounds that side-stepped more fundamental issues. The court balked only once, in a postwar <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1349705860552836297">decision</a> holding that price controls were too vague. The radical wartime extensions of federal power did not immediately alter judicial skepticism about economic regulatory legislation, for the court in July 1918 <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17101646802366258583">struck down</a> the federal child labor law on the ground that goods manufactured by children were not part of interstate commerce. </p>

<p>Even though the federal government suspended most of its regulations shortly after the war, federal expenditures never receded to anything close to pre-war levels. New attitudes toward the role of government were demonstrated during the 1920s by federal regulation of the nascent <a href="http://thetravelinsider.info/airlinemismanagement/airlineregulation2.htm">aviation</a> and <a href="https://definitions.uslegal.com/r/radio-act-of-1927/">radio</a> industries and federal relief during the disastrous <a href="https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/roaring-twenties/essays/great-1927-mississippi-river-flood">Mississippi River floods</a> of 1927. Wartime programs provided the template for many New Deal measures during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Congressional delegation of powers to the president during the war permanently altered the relationship between the president and Congress and laid the foundations for the modern administrative state. The aggrandizement of federal powers also profoundly affected federalism by shifting regulatory authority away from the states. </p>

<p>The war also hastened the enactment of the women's suffrage, which became the law of the land in the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxix">Nineteenth Amendment</a> in 1920. Although many states had enacted at least partial suffrage for women before the war, the momentum of the suffrage movement had slowed by 1917. Although social progress made enfranchisement of women inevitable, the war accelerated support for it because a nation that purported to fight for democracy could not without hypocrisy deny the vote to half its population on the basis of gender. The war also generated support for suffrage because the important contributions of women in households, factories, farms, offices, and hospitals demonstrated that women were responsible citizens who could be trusted with the ballot. Although suffrage did not result in the rapid elevation of the social, economic and legal status of women that many proponents of suffrage had hoped and expected, it was a necessary predicate for the enormous advance of women's rights during the final decades of the century. </p>

<p>Federalism was the principal argument against the suffrage amendment, for its opponents insisted that it intruded upon the power of the states to regulate their elections. This argument lost much of its power, however, because opponents of suffrage tended to support the prohibition amendment, which interfered with the tradition of allowing states to regulate the purchase, sale and transportation of commodities, including alcohol. Although the prohibition amendment was a more radical constitutional measure because it was the only part of the Constitution that has ever regulated personal behavior, both amendments were consistent with the expansion of federal powers that helped to transform the relationship between the federal government and the states, which enabled the federal government later in the century to further expand the economic regulatory powers of the federal government and protect the rights of women and racial minorities. </p>

<p>The advancement of the rights of racial minorities during the civil rights revolution that began during the 1930s and reached its apex during the 1960s had at least some of its origins during the war. Many African Americans welcomed the war because they hoped that their military valor and their important economic contributions would encourage whites to break down racial barriers. Blacks provided significant support for the war and brushed aside German propaganda that called attention to racial injustices, even though African Americans suffered from much discrimination in the military and received virtually no relief from prejudice anywhere else. Indeed, the start of the "<a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Great-Migration">Great Migration</a>" of blacks to the North during the war exacerbated racial tensions among blacks and whites who competed for jobs in the North. The war, however, promoted the later civil rights movement by bolstering the self-confidence of blacks and providing them with experiences and heightened expectations that proved useful in their coming struggles. To at least some extent, the war had the same effect on Native Americans, Hispanics and Asian Americans. </p>

<p>The war similarly set back civil liberties in the short-term but helped to advance them in the longer term. Federal and state governments suppressed personal liberties more extensively and more harshly during the First World War than at any other time in American history. Although "only" approximately two thousand persons were prosecuted under the Espionage and Sedition Acts, the mere prospect of prosecution chilled and stifled speech against the war, particularly because federal and state officials, legions of members of private quasi-patriotic organizations and countless nosy neighbors were eager to report any sign of "disloyalty." By warning that no one could question the need for the war, but could criticize only the manner in which it was conducted, Wilson and other federal officials choked off any meaningful debate about the constitutionality of virtually all wartime measures. Numerous Americans received prison sentences merely for expressing opposition to American participation in the war or suggesting that the nation was fighting to protect economic investments rather than democracy. In one of the most absurd cases, <a href="http://www.academia.edu/6619821/The_Espionage_Act_and_Robert_Goldstein_s_The_Spirit_of_76_1917_A_Historical_and_Legal_Analysis">Robert Goldstein</a> was sentenced to ten years in prison for producing a patriotic film, "The Spirit of '76," because it portrayed British atrocities against Americans during the American Revolution. Courts often used the Espionage and Sedition Acts to silence socialists and other political radicals, particularly <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Eugene-V-Debs">Eugene V. Debs</a>, rather than to prevent any realistic threat of interference with the war effort. </p>

<p>The government also censored or withheld mailing privileges from countless ethnic and socialist publications, which caused hundreds of such journals to forever cease publication. During so-called "slacker raids" in the summer of 1918, approximately fifty thousand men in cities throughout the United States who could not immediately produce draft registration documents were snatched from streetcars, theaters, restaurants and other public places and incarcerated in jails and armories until they could produce such documentation or prove that they were not subject to the draft. Only about three percent were found to have evaded registration. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the government churned out floods of pamphlets, posters and films that convinced most Americans that any opposition to wartime measures, much less the war itself, was unpatriotic and treasonous. Senator Hiram W. Johnson of California, who supported the war but deplored the suppression of civil liberties, brilliantly mocked such hyper-patriotism in a private letter feigning fear that he and his wife were guilty of treason for praying that their son would return home alive from fighting in Flanders. </p>

<p>State and local officials, often assisted by zealous vigilantes, also helped to suppress criticism of the war and coerce cooperation with war efforts. Officials often menaced persons who failed to fly the flag, purchase war bonds, plant so-called "victory gardens" or otherwise demonstrate patriotism and assist the war effort. Some states and communities enacted constitutionally questionable measures requiring all able-bodied adults to work. In the South, these laws sometimes were used to force African American women to work outside their homes for a pittance as domestic laborers for white persons. </p>

<p>German Americans suffered enormous abuses during the war that forever eradicated their pre-war role as an important political and cultural force. Many states and localities enacted laws that prohibited or restricted the speaking or teaching of German, the governor of Ohio issued an edict banning the public use of any foreign language and federal officials suppressed German language journals. Some German-American Lutheran churches were burned, many were vandalized and far more received curt and often menacing messages from local officials and vigilantes demanding that they immediate cease any use of the German language. </p>

<p>Federal and state courts lacked precedent for protecting personal liberties because few previous laws had suppressed speech or publications and the Supreme Court had not yet held that the First Amendment was binding upon the states. Bar associations and law professors tended to provide spirited constitutional defenses of the suppression of civil liberties, often citing the ancient maxim the law is silent in times of war and arguing that suppression of liberty was necessary to save liberty. Only a few lawyers spoke out against repressive measures and their opposition formed the basis for what became the American Civil Liberties Union. </p>

<p>The Supreme Court sustained the constitutionality of the Espionage Act in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7591076590836704265">several cases</a> shortly after the war (<em>see also</em>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8474153321909160293">here</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14321466231676186426">here</a>). Although the first decisions were unanimous, Justices Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. and Louis D. Brandeis in later cases wrote prophetic dissents in which they pointed out the link between free speech and democracy and argued that the Constitution does not permit government to repress speech unless it can to demonstrate a very close proximity between speech and imminent unlawful action. These dissents limned the outlines of the modern doctrines of freedom of speech and freedom of the press. </p>

<p>The war also helped to generate the court's modern role as the guardian of noneconomic personal liberties. In <span class="casename"><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16175793893966768030">Meyer v. Nebraska</a></span>, a landmark case arising out of the widespread wartime animus against German Americans, the Supreme Court in 1923 invalidated various state statutes that prohibited the teaching of German in elementary schools. Although the court based its decision on property rights, the court in dicta declared that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protected a raft of other liberties, including the right to marry, raise children and worship according to one's conscience. This case helped to provide the predicate for the court's gradual nationalization of the liberties prescribed by the Bill of Rights, beginning with freedom of speech in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5505973138575755803"><span class="casename">Gitlow v. New York</span></a> in 1925. The incorporation of the Bill of Rights into state law greatly expanded liberty even though state constitutions contained mostly the same rights, because federal judges at least until recently have tended to interpret the scope of the federal Bill of Rights more broadly than state judges interpreted analogous language in their state constitutions. </p>

<p>At the start of the war, <a href="http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1347.html">Charles Evans Hughes</a>, the future Chief Justice, proclaimed that the Constitution would adapt itself to the "novel and complex" exigencies of the war because "the Constitution marches" and "we have a <em>fighting</em> Constitution." The war, however, generated so many repressive and constitutionally questionable measures that it might be more accurate to say that the Constitution was on furlough during the war. The war ultimately, however, made the Constitution more adaptable to measures that improved the lives of Americans by providing precedents for the far-reaching economic regulatory legislation that followed later in the century, hastening women's suffrage, planting many of the seeds of the civil rights movement and generating cases that transformed civil liberties law.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href=http://www.lexmetis.com/our-members/dr-bettina-nemeth>Bettina Nemeth</a>, a partner in LexMetis, discusses Hungary's approach to the refugee crisis. . . </p>

                <p><strong>I</strong>n June of 2015, the Secretary of Interior Dr. Sándor Pintér, filed a <a href="http://hungarytoday.hu/news/hungarian-parliament-passes-law-amendments-tighten-immigration-rules-56850">legislative bill</a> in the Hungarian Parliament to overhaul the country's asylum proceedings and to restructure the border police force. The Parliament debated the bill and overwhelmingly approved it on March 6, 2017, with 138 members voting "yes", 6 voting "no", and 22 members abstaining. The Asylum Amendments became the new Asylum Law in March of 2017 and contains four main provisions:  <br />
                <ol><br />
                    <li>The Government has the authority to designate "transit areas" around the country, which are places of temporary stay for applicants of asylum in Hungary. The primary purpose of the law is to prevent the free movement of individuals that have been denied asylum or those that have pending asylum applications.  </li><br />
                    <li>The Government can seek relocation remedies against those individuals that flee from the "transit zones" while their applications are pending, and transfer them back to the transit zones anywhere in the country.  </li><br />
                    <li>The Government can detain unaccompanied minor children between the ages of 14-18 in the transit zones when they cross over the Hungarian border.  </li><br />
                    <li>Asylum proceedings need not be held in the native language or a language spoken by the applicant for asylum. </li><br />
                </ol><br />
                There were also some procedural changes which now allow the hearing to be conducted by electronic means without transporting the applicant to the court or judicial body where the hearing will take place. Further changes in the law were also adopted to accelerate and simplify the entire process and also to exclude legal tactics that may end the asylum proceedings through judicial review. Court orders are only allowed in very limited circumstances when the asylum seeker somehow frustrates the process or he/she does not have the intention to proceed through such a process. For example, a termination of the proceedings by an order of the court is allowed if: (a) the asylum seeker withdraws the application in writing; (b) he/she refuses to file the necessary declarations; (c) he/she refuses to volunteer the taking of the fingerprints or photographs; and (d) the asylum seeker leaves the transit zone. There is however, a right of appeal for further judicial review in the event the asylum petition is denied, provided the request for further relief is filed within three days from the receipt date of the decision. The Asylum Authority also has three days to forward the application for further judicial review to the Court. </p>

                <p>Relevant to this law is the referendum held in Hungary on October 2, 2016, which had a very specific question on the ballot: "Do you want the European Union to have the right to mandate the resettlement of non-Hungarian citizens to Hungary without the approval of the Hungarian Parliament?" While only 41.32% of the eligible voters actually voted, which resulted in the invalidation of the referendum since Hungarian law requires a minimum of 50% turnout, 98.36% of the votes casted were "No". While there has been a lot of criticism of the Government for placing such a question on the ballot, the referendum could be seen as social consensus that Hungarians are not in favor of open borders and the imposition of refugee mandated policies from the EU. </p>

                <p>According to <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/press-releases/hungary-container-camp-bill-is-flagrant-violation-of-international-law">Amnesty International</a>, the Asylum Law (or the "Container Camp Bill" as Amnesty International refers to it) is a flagrant violation of international law, as it is a continuous detention and a restraint of the freedom of movement of asylum seekers without the issuance of warrants for arrest, rights of appeal or any judicial oversight. Of particular concern is the section in the legislation that affects minor children between the ages of 14-18, which are now excluded from the Child Protection Laws. However, Amnesty International's commentary fails to reference the consistent problem Hungarian authorities were facing when adult asylum seekers claimed falsely that they were below the age of 18 for more favorable treatment. </p>

                <p>Of particular interest is also the recent decision of the European Court of Human Rights, in <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#{"itemid":["001-172091"]}">Ilias and Ahmed v. Hungary</a>, where the Court held that the place of stay in the transit zones is unlawful detention; the lack of any rights of the detainees is a violation, and the procedures at the borders are unfair. The Court also held that a detainee in the transit zones has the same rights as any other detainee in Hungary because the transit zones are within the jurisdiction of the Hungarian State. The Prime Minister of Hungary, Viktor Orban, <a href="http://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-zero-refugee-strategy-viktor-orban-europe-migration-crisis/">commented</a> that the uncontrolled migration crisis is an act of aggression against Hungary necessitating the closing of the borders. He declared that Hungary is under siege and the legislation is in line with EU law as the necessary defensive measures are nothing more than an attempt to defend the national integrity of Hungary. He also stated that the Hungarian viewpoint is controlling in these tumultuous times. In response to a question by a journalist, the Prime Minister added: "It is not easy to be a good European in Central Europe, since countries in the region have different historical legacies, different kinds of instincts on some issues which may vary due to local traditions and values. These differences can lead to the implementation of different approaches to the issue of migration, although, the Central European approach is becoming the standard." </p>

                <p>From the Central European perspective, Hungary is simply taking steps to deal with international terrorism and the inherent difficulties in vetting terrorists that claim to be refugees or migrants when they enter Hungary. For Hungarians, this method of infiltrating to Europe, is arguably similar to when terrorists use civilians as human shields in Aleppo, Syria or in Mosul, Iraq. Despite that, Hungary has been wrongly portrayed as insensitive to the plight of refugees simply because it has taken steps that are a departure from the EU policies that deal with this unprecedented crisis. Many Europeans also fail to see that the dismantling of border controls between member countries will not immediately lead to the unification of values, traditions and opinions in European nations. There will be divergence and disagreement, as there will be implementation of different policies that seek to protect national identities. </p>

                <p>Although Hungary's approach may not be popular in many ideological centers, the prevalent opinion and the majority of the political leaders in Hungary see the adoption of this law as a necessary proactive measure given the deadly terrorist attacks in the EU over the last few years. Furthermore, the lack of a cohesive approach by the EU in dealing with the migration crisis leaves member countries to take matters into their own hands as they seek to protect their citizens from terrorists crossing their borders. One only has to look at some of EU's policies in Turkey and Greece, which have been implemented to keep the "migration problem" away from the EU borders by flooding money to both countries or by mandating the acceptance of certain number of refugees by each member nation. This could be viewed as inducement of the Turkish and the Greek Governments that are asked to stop the flood of migrants into the EU, when what is required is a comprehensive approach that deals with the underlying causes of this human tragedy. It could also be argued that Hungary's position is just a calling for a complete revaluation of the EU migration policies and a stern warning that Hungary will not stand idle when the EU policies fail to adequately protect Europeans from the threat of international terrorism. Funding programs to keep refugees in Turkey and Greece temporarily will not be sufficient to deal with the migration crisis in the long run. What may work is a common, effective plan that is based on mutual cooperation and the acceptance of the general principle that EU member countries must be free to implement policies that affect the protection of their citizens.  Unity in the European Union will not be accomplished by indifference to popular but different values in member countries.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Andreas Kuersten discusses the flawed reasoning of recent legislation that allows Internet Service Providers to sell customers' personal information without their consent ... </p>

                <p><strong>C</strong>hairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Ajit Pai and Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Maureen Ohlhausen begin their recent <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/no-republicans-didnt-just-strip-away-your-internet-privacy-rights/2017/04/04/73e6d500-18ab-11e7-9887-1a5314b56a08_story.html?hpid=hp_no-name_opinion-card-e%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.57c2e28b497c">op-ed</a> (a bull-headed defense of controversial legislation that, among other things, allows Internet service providers (ISPs) to sell customers&#8217; personal information without their consent) with the quip that &#8220;April Fools&#8217; Day came early last week, as professional lobbyists lit a wildfire of misinformation about Congress&#8217;s action.&#8221; Yet given the chairmens&#8217; obstinate lack of awareness regarding ISPs and the legislation in question, it is more accurate to say that their attempt at April Fools&#8217; Day trickery came late. </p>

                <p>In 2015, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/03/how-isps-can-sell-your-web-history-and-how-to-stop-them/">FCC voted to regulate ISPs</a> (companies like Comcast, Verizon and AT&T) as &#8220;common carriers&#8221; (companies providing public telecommunications facilities and services), moving jurisdiction over these entities from the FTC to the FCC. The FTC had previously allowed ISPs to sell user data (such as their browsing history) except where users proactively opted out of such programs. Under the FCC&#8217;s oversight, ISPs were prevented from profiting off of customers&#8217; private data without their consent. This year, however, legislation passed in both houses of Congress on party-line votes (with Republicans supporting and Democrats opposing) and was signed by President Trump on April 3rd undid the FCC&#8217;s actions and reverted ISP regulation to its previous form. Customers will soon have to proactively opt out of any programs that their ISPs put in place to sell their personal information to advertisers. </p>

                <p>Pai and Ohlhausen&#8217;s main argument for why recent legislation is a good thing is that the FCC&#8217;s 2015 actions unfairly treated ISPs differently than Internet browser and search providers and social media companies (like Google and Facebook) who could still freely collect and market user data. The chairmen argue that since ISPs and companies like Google and Facebook have access to much of the same customer information, the &#8220;FCC&#8217;s regulations weren&#8217;t about protecting consumers&#8217; privacy. They were about government picking winners and losers in the marketplace.&#8221; </p>

                <p>The chairmens&#8217; reasoning is seriously flawed for a number of reasons. The FCC&#8217;s rationale for more strictly regulating ISPs was its determination that they are common carriers akin to public utilities (i.e., companies that provide the public with necessities). In today&#8217;s Internet-centered society and economy, it&#8217;s hard to argue that Internet access hasn&#8217;t become a public necessity. Tellingly, Pai and Ohlhausen don&#8217;t challenge the importance of Internet access in today&#8217;s world. In fact, Pai is a <a href="http://www.commlawmonitor.com/2017/01/articles/universal-service-fund/pai-fccs-first-commission-level-vote-targets-rural-broadband-access/">big supporter of expanding Internet access</a> to rural and poor areas to aid their development. This is a clear acknowledgment of the modern necessity of this resource. Pai has, however, <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-15-24A5.pdf">expressed</a> [PDF] the conviction that the Internet has become so important and successful because of a lack of regulation. But this is not an effective argument against ISPs being common carriers. Rather, it&#8217;s simply a preference for how the government can best nurture the expansion of Internet access. </p>

                <p>In providing access to the Internet, ISPs do something very different than companies like Google and Facebook, which simply aid in one&#8217;s utilization of the Internet. In the parlance of another public necessity, ISPs are the water companies, whereas firms like Google and Facebook merely help one more effectively use the water they already have access to. </p>

                <p>In addition, Pai and Ohlhausen are completely incorrect in saying that Americans don&#8217;t face &#8220;a unique lack of choice and competition in the broadband marketplace.&#8221; To support this claim, they put forth that &#8220;Verizon, the largest mobile broadband provider, holds only an estimated <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/199359/market-share-of-wireless-carriers-in-the-us-by-subscriptions/">35 percent</a> of its market.&#8221; But this data point is completely meaningless. Verizon&#8217;s overall market share is trivial if it is the only ISP in the regions where it supplies Internet access. There is in fact a substantial lack of choice for consumers when it comes to ISPs. According the FCC&#8217;s latest <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-342358A1.pdf">Internet Access Services Report</a> (pg. 6) [PDF], only 4% of Americans have a choice between three or more ISPs and 20% have a choice between just two ISPs if they want access to Internet download speeds of at least 25 megabits per second (Mbps) (the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/29/7932653/fcc-changed-definition-broadband-25mbps">FCC&#8217;s benchmark</a> for determining whether an individual has adequate broadband access). 47% of Americans are serviced by only one ISP. </p>

                <p>Rather than coherently backing up their clearly incorrect claim that American consumers don&#8217;t lack choice when it comes to ISPs, Pai and Ohlhausen instead curiously put forth that consumers similarly lack choice when it comes to Internet search providers: &#8220;Google dominates desktop search with an estimated 81 percent market share (and 96 percent of the mobile search market).&#8221; But again, this data point is irrelevant. Google is not providing Internet access; it&#8217;s not providing a public necessity. Moreover, consumers have a large quantity of options when it comes to Internet search providers (Microsoft&#8217;s Bing, DuckDuckGo and Baidu, to name a few). The fact that they choose to use Google has no bearing on the availability of alternatives. Users can also counter tracking by Internet search and browser providers and websites by disabling the downloading of &#8220;cookies&#8221; from these sources that track user activity, and by installing ad blocker software. These actions have no effect on tracking by ISPs. </p>

                <p>All of the aforementioned shows that the FCC was not picking winners and losers in the marketplace back in 2015, as Pai and Ohlhausen so inelegantly allege. Rather, the Commission was curtailing the degree to which ISPs, which provide a public necessity, could take advantage of a lack of consumer options to trade in customers&#8217; personal information. The FCC instituted a much clearer and uniform regulatory structure for ISPs, replacing the unclear requirements of and <em>ad hoc</em> enforcement by the FTC, which will now again be the law of the land. </p>

                <p>It is disheartening that such educated and informed individuals in such positions of power as chairmen Pai and Ohlhausen are so oblivious to the true nature of ISPs, the FCC&#8217;s previous actions, and recent legislation undoing them. Make no mistake, the law signed by President Trump on April 3rd undermines consumer privacy by allowing the monopolistic providers of a public necessity to much more freely trade in customers&#8217; personal information. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Ali Khan discusses the potential deportation of the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the US, and international documents' and treaties' prohibition on state actions like deportation...</p><strong>T</strong>hreats of deportations are evolving into a global phenomenon as nativism, racism, and xenophobia sweep the world. All over the world, nations are turning against "foreigners," particularly against the most vulnerable populations such as refugees, migrant workers, and undocumented immigrants. For example, Pakistan is forcing millions of <a href="http://pakobserver.net/afghan-refugees-repatriation-from-pakistans-starts-today/">Afghan refugees</a> born in Pakistan to "go back home."  Myanmar is persecuting the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2015/10/rohingya-151024202611276.html">Rohingyas</a>, an unwanted religious minority, pressing them to leave the country. Saudi Arabia has been <a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20170307-saudi-to-deport-5m-illegal-workers/">expelling migrant workers</a> after consuming their labor for years. Right-wing Europeans wish to oust even legal immigrants from North Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East. The United States has escalated its campaign to deport hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants.</p>

<p>This commentary focuses on the potential deportation of 11 million undocumented immigrants, including <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/03/02/what-we-know-about-illegal-immigration-from-mexico/">six million of Mexican national origin</a>, the largest group of undocumented immigrants living in the United States. These immigrants live in mortal fear of the <a href="https://www.ice.gov/">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) agents picking them up from work, school, home, hand-cuffing them, putting them in buses and planes, and discarding them out of a country they have made home for years, if not decades. A Mexican man leaped off a bridge and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/23/mexican-man-deported-suicide-trump-tijuana">killed himself after being deported</a>. This cruel expulsion is justified under the popular label of "illegal aliens" and under the rhetoric of removing rapists and criminals. </p>

<p><strong>Law against Deportation</strong></p>

<p>International law in the form of human rights, international criminal law, the humanitarian law of war, regional compacts including the <a href="http://www.oas.org/en/sla/dil/inter_american_treaties_A-41_charter_OAS.asp">Charter on the Organization of American States</a>, treaty provisions of state constitutions, and universal norms identified in scholarly treatises, all endorse, directly or indirectly, a simple principle that deportation is a crime against humanity.   </p>

<p>The Nuremberg tribunals stated in unambiguous terms that enslavement or deportation of a population is a crime against customary international law, as in the Nuremberg Case xiv-xv (1971). Further, <a href="http://www.endusmilitarism.org/nuremberg_principles.html">Nuremberg Principle IV(b)</a> provides that the "deportation to slave labor ... of civilian populations of or in occupied territory" constitutes both a "war crime" and a "crime against humanity."</p>

<p>Building on the Nuremberg principles, more recent international treaties and scholarly treatises reaffirm that deportation is a crime against humanity, even if committed in peace times, and even if the deported population is not shipped to slave labor. In addition to apartheid, disappearances, torture, and enslavement, Article 7 of the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/ea9aeff7-5752-4f84-be94-0a655eb30e16/0/rome_statute_english.pdf">Rome Statute</a> [PDF] of the International Criminal Court lists deportation or forcible transfer of population as crime against humanity. Article 4 of the <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.tr/european-convention-on-human-rights-fourth-protocol-to-the-convention.en.mfa">4th Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights</a> states: "Collective expulsion of aliens is prohibited." In the United States, courts have reaffirmed the principle that deportation of civilian populations to slave labor is a crime. See Iwanowa v. Ford Motor Co., 67 F.Supp.2d 424, 444-45 (D.N.J.1999). </p>

<p>Time is ripe for the US courts to reconsider the deportation of settled communities. This commentary offers the concept of adverse citizenship derived from the prohibition against deportation as a crime against humanity. </p>

<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>

<p>Several arguments may be offered to challenge the thesis that US deportation of undocumented immigrants is a crime against humanity. First, it might be argued that forced expulsion of only citizens/legal residents could be a crime against humanity and, therefore, the prohibition does not cover undocumented immigrants. Second, the United States is not a signatory to the Rome Statute or a party to the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights and the Protocols</a> [PDF]. Third, no US court has ruled that deportation of undocumented immigrants is contrary to the US Constitution, much less a crime against humanity. In fact, federal immigration laws allow deportation of undocumented immigrants, and removal of some illegal aliens under expedited procedures. To cap these arguments, one might point out that if deportation of undocumented immigrants were to be a crime against humanity, nations will surrender their sovereignty to alien invaders.   </p>

<p>These arguments have some merit under the US notion of sovereignty, as the distinction between legal and undocumented immigrants lays at the heart of US immigration law. But see, <a href="http://www.brill.com/extinction-nation-states">The Extinction of Nation-States</a>. </p>

<p>Yet, in the case of settled communities, the legal/illegal distinction is elusive, if not <a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/immigrants-rights/ice-and-border-patrol-abuses">abusive of fundamental rights and liberties</a>. With respect to undocumented communities, the US enforces its deportation laws in an arbitrary, cruel and unusual manner, in fits and starts, using the threat and actual removal as an <a href="http://www.cvt.org/news-events/press-releases/center-victims-torture-deeply-disturbed-ice-raids">instrument of mental torture</a>, which itself is a crime against humanity.  </p>

<p>The so-called undocumented immigrants in the United States are living in plain view of the federal government and enforcement agencies, including the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/">Department of Homeland Security</a>, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a>, <a href="http://www.house.gov/">Congress</a>, and the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/">White House</a>. They are not hiding in caves or mountains. They live and work in big cities and farming towns, in almost all states. Many speak their own native languages, and some undocumented immigrants speak not a word of English because they live in places that once belonged to Mexico and later conquered by the US through wars.  It is <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/03/5-facts-about-illegal-immigration-in-the-u-s/">no secret that millions of undocumented immigrants have been residing in the US</a> for decades, giving birth to at least one, if not two, generation of US citizens.</p>

<p>The US itself is conflicted over the future of undocumented immigrants. In 2013, a bipartisan senate bill proposed to provide a path to legal status for millions of undocumented immigrants on the theory (affirmed by the <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/">Congressional Budget Office</a>) that such a path could reduce the deficit by $700 billion in 20 years. Some congressional bills instruct the Secretary of Homeland Security <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/s229/text">not to disclose the identity of undocumented immigrants brought as children</a> to the ICE. Some proposed policies aim at deporting only those undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes, and not others. Only extreme demagogues advocate removing all undocumented immigrants, a task that no one believes can be accomplished. </p>

<p><strong>Adverse Citizenship</strong></p>

<p>Settled communities with no documents acquire a right to "adverse citizenship"&#8212;a concept I offer for the courts to consider. Somewhat similar (though not exactly) to the common-law doctrine of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6283124321750903583&q=adverse+possession&hl=en&as_sdt=2006">adverse possession</a>, it might be forcefully argued that undocumented immigrants living for years in the United States, paying taxes, and the federal government having full knowledge of their undocumented status, acquire a right to US citizenship. Such undocumented communities are no different from <a href="http://www.americaslibrary.gov/jb/colonial/jb_colonial_subj.html">early colonists</a> who entered America and acquired land and citizenship through adverse possession. </p>

<p>Regardless of legal origin, families and communities settled in various states have been participants in promoting the economy and welfare of the United States. A settled Mexican family is no different from a settled Scottish, Czechoslovakian, or Slovenian family. Uprooting settled families, separating children from parents, tearing apart spouses from each other, can no longer be defended under the prevailing norms of human dignity, equal protection, and due process.  Deportation is a crime against humanity. Much like genocide, even deportation of part of an undocumented community is a crime against humanity. No notion of sovereignty may be asserted to defend wholesale or partial genocide, apartheid, disappearances, or deportations.  </p>

<p>In 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed a <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/99/s1200">law</a> that allowed about four million undocumented immigrants to regularize their status. Since 1986, Congress has passed <a href="https://www.numbersusa.com/content/learn/illegal-immigration/seven-amnesties-passed-congress.html">seven amnesty statutes</a> to confer potential citizenship on undocumented immigrants. These amnesties are consistent with international law against deportation and support the concept of adverse citizenship. </p>

<p>President Trump's policy decision to deport undocumented immigrants is a crime against humanity, particularly with respect to families who have settled in the US for long periods of time, have established homes, or have minor children. It is irrelevant whether these residents entered or stayed in the US illegally. Deportation of a settled family or community is a violation of right to life, right to family, right to property, right to privacy, and numerous other rights protected under customary international law, human rights treaties, due process, and fundamental legal principles that sustain the concept of law. If the US fails to enforce its immigration laws for years and allows families to lay their roots, the balance of equities shifts in favor of resident families to claim adverse citizenship. Through <a href="http://www.lectlaw.com/def/l056.htm">laches</a>, the US loses its power to remove undocumented immigrants openly living, working, and paying taxes for decades.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://law.und.edu/faculty/profile/grijalva.cfm">James M. Grijalva</a> discusses the recent controversy concerning the Dakota Access Pipeline...</p><strong>A</strong>s spring emerged on the northern plains in late March, news broke of unrelated but congenerous developments in the long running sagas of two oil pipelines proposed for the Midwestern United States. <a href="http://www.energytransfer.com/">The Energy Transfer partnership</a> completed construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline under Lake Oahe in North Dakota just upstream from the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's reservation, and <a href="paperchase/2017/03/us-district-judge-denies-emergency-injunction-against-dakota-access-pipeline.php">federal courts denied requests for injunctive relief</a>, with Bakken shale crude oil expected to begin flowing at any moment. Over in Montana, the U.S. State Department opened the border for <a href="http://www.keystone-xl.com/">TransCanada's Keystone XL Pipeline</a>, planned for moving Alberta's tar sands crude oil to refineries in the Gulf of Mexico, and the <a href="http://www.ienearth.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Complaint_for_Declaratory_and_Injunctive_Relief.pdf">Indigenous Environmental Network promptly filed suit</a> [PDF]. Both lawsuits stem from the unexpected election of Donald Trump, and his nearly immediate reversal of President Obama's decisions halting both pipelines.</p>

<p>Three South Dakota tribes downstream from the DA Pipeline crossing filed suit&#8212the Cheyenne River, Yankton and Oglala Sioux Tribes&#8212and the DC District Court consolidated the cases with Standing Rock. On March 7, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3509171-170307-DenyInjunction.html">the court denied a Cheyenne River request</a> for an injunction under the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act, despite acknowledging "the Tribe is likely to suffer irreparable harm to its members' religious exercise if oil is introduced into the pipeline." The court found tribal success on the merits unlikely, and that Energy Transfer, which claims to be "one of the largest and most diversified investment grade master limited partnerships in the United States," would be substantially harmed financially and logistically from an injunction pending merits analysis.</p>

<p>Cheyenne River <a href="https://www.eenews.net/assets/2017/03/17/document_ew_04.pdf">appealed to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals</a> [PDF] on February 14, and unsuccessfully sought from the District Court an emergency injunction pending appeal. On March 18, the <a href="https://turtletalk.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/2017-03-18-order-denying-injunction.pdf">DC Circuit affirmed that latter denial</a> [PDF] per curiae, concluding the Tribe had not met "the stringent requirements" for relief pending appeal. Meanwhile, Standing Rock and Cheyenne River have summary judgment motions pending before the District Court on a variety of treaty rights and environmental law claims.</p>

<p>Unlike the nearly completed DA Pipeline, the XL Pipeline is a proposed project. It stalled in November 2015 when the <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/11/06/statement-president-keystone-xl-pipeline">Obama State Department concluded</a> that importing Alberta's tar sands crude oil would not contribute significantly to the economy or lower energy prices for Americans; instead, it would hinder the United States' global leadership on climate change and its movement toward a clean energy economy. Four days after his inauguration, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/24/presidential-memorandum-regarding-construction-keystone-xl-pipeline">President Trump invited TransCanada</a> via Presidential Memorandum to resubmit its application and directed the relevant Departments to "expedite" review and decide within 60 days. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/24/executive-order-expediting-environmental-reviews-and-approvals-high">Trump also issued an Executive Order</a> directing federal agencies "streamline and expedite" environmental reviews of "high priority" infrastructure projects.</p>

<p>In two days TransCanada resubmitted its application, and two months later, on March 23, the <a href="https://keystonepipeline-xl.state.gov/documents/organization/269323.pdf">Trump State Department announced its unsurprising decision</a> [PDF]: the XL Pipeline is in the national interest. The Department found the project would "meaningfully support U.S. energy security by providing additional infrastructure for the dependable supply of crude oil." The Department noted that crude oil has continuing importance to the economy, the U.S. is still a net oil importer despite increased domestic production, and Canada is our best trading partner and a stable source of crude oil. The next day the State Department issued the <a href="https://keystonepipeline-xl.state.gov/documents/organization/269322.pdf">Presidential Permit</a> [PDF], and three days later the Indigenous Environmental Network--a grassroots organization headquartered in the U.S. but representing Indigenous Peoples worldwide--<a href="http://www.ienearth.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Complaint_for_Declaratory_and_Injunctive_Relief.pdf">filed suit</a> [PDF] asserting violations of the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA), the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Bald and Golden Eagle Acts.</p>

<p>The legal claims in both cases are too numerous and complex for a full analysis here. But mainly, both center around an alleged failure of genuine consideration of the projects' foreseeable negative impacts on the environment, Indian treaty rights and Indigenous human rights. Underlying these controversies is an important environmental justice question: to what extent will American society continue to tolerate sacrificing Indigenous cultural rights for short-term economic gains, especially from an outmoded energy source?</p>

<p>Curiously, although both projects are similar, the agencies' environmental analyses differed significantly. The XL Pipeline would transport about 830,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil over 875 miles through three states, and the <a href="https://keystonepipeline-xl.state.gov/finalseis/index.htm">State Department did a full EIS</a> (over 1,000 pages excluding appendices). The DA Pipeline will carry some 570,000 bpd over 1,100 miles through four states, but the Corps of Engineers did only an <a href="http://cdm16021.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p16021coll7/id/2801">abbreviated Environmental Assessment</a> (EA) on the DA Pipeline (just over 100 pages). The Corps reconsidered that decision when faced with the Sioux Tribes' NEPA suit, the presence of 10,000 Water Protectors encamped at the lake crossing, and several violent confrontations with corporate security guards armed with dogs and riot-like tools that drew international media attention. In the final days of Obama's term, the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/18/2017-00937/notice-of-intent-to-prepare-an-environmental-impact-statement-in-connection-with-dakota-access-llcs">Corps issued a notice of intent</a> to do a full EIS; Trump's memo to issue the lake crossing easement expeditiously caused the Corps to reverse course and cease further environmental review</p>

<p>The Sioux Tribes' NEPA claims against the abbreviated DA process are multifaceted and strong. While <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/463/29.html">Administrative Law allows agencies to change course</a>, they must confront contrary facts and conclusions that supported the former direction.  The Corps did not confront the opinions of EPA and the Department of the Interior Solicitor that the EA had fundamental shortcomings requiring further investigation in an EIS. The Corps did not address the Tribes' expert reports documenting numerous EA flaws and gaps, including: dismissing impacts on Indian treaty rights without analysis; violating NEPA regulations for actions with impacts that are "highly controversial" and "highly uncertain"; understating the risk of significant pipeline leaks; ignoring the inability of detection systems to identify slow leaks that could result in large oil discharges over time; inadequately analyzing spill risks; and depriving the public of comment by keeping the underlying spill modeling data secret.</p>

<p>Especially poignant is the <a href="http://earthjustice.org/sites/default/files/files/Memo-ISO-SRSTs-Mtn-for-PSJ.pdf">Tribes' contention</a> [PDF] the Corps' environmental justice analysis was "gerrymandered" and kept secret from the Tribes and public. The draft EA didn't even mention the Standing Rock Reservation less than a mile downstream from the proposed Lake Oahe crossing. The final EA "recognized" that fact, but rather than confront the health and cultural impacts of contaminating the Reservation's largest water body and its shorelines, the EA instead re-emphasized the pipeline's off-Reservation location, the expensive and high-tech nature of the horizontal drilling technique for putting the pipeline below the lake, and the very low likelihood of spills. Illogically, that same low risk of spills justified rejecting an alternate route upstream of the State Capitol of Bismarck, whose racial composition is overwhelmingly White. The Corps' explanation for dismissing the obvious EJ issue strains credulity: focusing narrowly on the site of the pipeline crossing, that rural county has fewer minorities than Bismarck, a city of nearly 70,000 people, so the agency asserted the Bismarck route would affect more minorities than the proposed route. Adding insult to injury, the EA defined the area of impact as the site crossing plus 0.5 miles downstream, and then compared the county that begins 0.55 miles downstream and encompasses the northern half of the Reservation (82% native) to conclude again that few minorities would be affected. EPA's and DOI's pointed criticisms of the Corps for not considering the downstream impacts on the Tribe and its citizens went unmentioned.</p>

<p>Indigenous environmental justice also pervades the <a href="http://www.ienearth.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Complaint_for_Declaratory_and_Injunctive_Relief.pdf">Complaint recently filed</a> [PDF] against the XL Pipeline permit, which alleges numerous NEPA flaws as well as statutory claims prohibiting the taking of endangered species, migratory birds and eagles. The XL EIS, like the DA EA, assumes tribal interests are minimal since the pipeline route (intentionally) avoids crossing any Indian reservation. Outside Indian country, the analysis properly focuses on identifiable traditional cultural properties, but does not recognize that modern Indigenous Peoples have important cultural connections to traditional lands beyond ceremonial sites and burial grounds. For example, the State Department identified no Indian treaty rights whose exercise might be affected by the pipelines, nor discussed modern cultural uses of wild game, fish or plants in the affected areas. And, treating the pipeline&#8212whose sole purpose is carrying tar sands crude oil&#8212as divorced from the extensive, destructive impacts of tar sands mining in northern Alberta, the EIS is completely silent on the cultural survival of numerous Canadian First Nations. (That silence is mirrored by the Canadian Government's own Environmental Assessment Act analysis.)</p>

<p>These EJ issues implicate international human rights. In its <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/DRIPS_en.pdf">Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</a>, the United Nations recognized Indigenous Peoples' ability to maintain spiritual, religious and cultural traditions, and their connections to traditional lands and resources, as fundamental human rights, and exhorted nation-states to consult and cooperate in good faith when implementing legal and administrative procedures that may affect those rights. The UN has not yet spoken to the XL Pipeline controversy, although the lawsuit alleges failures of genuine consultation. At the Oceti Sakowin camp in North Dakota, an Expert Member of the UN's Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/2016/Docs-updates/Report-ChiefEdwardJohn-DAPL2016.pdf">noted apparent violations</a> [PDF] of the Declaration's consultation requirement (and duty to protect Water Protectors from violence) in November 2016, a theme also raised in the Sioux Tribes' litigation. In March 2017, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21274&LangID=E">the UN's Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples said</a> US consultation, while well intentioned, is "a confusing and disjointed framework that suffers from loopholes, ambiguity, and a general lack of accountability. </p>

<p>The XL EIS lists ostensibly extensive tribal consultations, and the <a href="http://earthjustice.org/sites/default/files/files/order-denying-PI.pdf">DC District Court denied Standing Rock</a> [PDF] a preliminary injunction in September in part because it found the Tribe had not availed itself of multiple opportunities for consultation with the Corps. But the court and the federal agencies approach consultation from a narrow, project-specific perspective. They ask if tribes can identify qualified, discrete geographic sites that might necessitate adjustments in proposed projects, say for example, by moving a pipeline half a mile to avoid an ancient archeological site. </p>

<p>Tribes certainly want to avoid actual destruction of culturally important places and resources. But tribes come to these project-specific discussions with the broader perspective that consultation is an exercise of government-to-government relations with the federal government that recognizes tribes' unique legal and political status as inherent sovereigns. And the larger context for those relations cannot be understood apart from Indigenous Peoples' historical trauma at the hands of the federal government. Federal administrators processing permit applications, and judges reviewing their actions, are likely not thinking about&#8212indeed, may not even know about&#8212the genocide, suppressed religion, forced religious indoctrination, cultural assimilation, relocation, education, and more&#8212but tribal representatives can't forget so easily.</p>

<p>As the Great Plains Chairmen's Association <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3462189/170214-GreatPlains-Tribal-Leaders-Amicus.pdf">informed the court</a> [PDF], the traditional territory of the Great Sioux Nation was repeatedly taken by war, genocide, forced negotiation, and outright theft. It is not insignificant that the main federal actor in the DA Pipeline saga is the Corps of Engineers, an arm of the Department of the Army that killed so many tribal ancestors in the 19th century, and in the 20th century built multiple dams on the Missouri River flooding traditional cultural properties and the most fertile reservation lands for the benefit of non-Indian farmers and ranchers. The UN Special Rapporteur noted the sordid treatment of the Sioux Tribes and recognized "the painful history of Lake Oahe has resurfaced" because of the proposed pipeline crossing. In January 2017, the <a href="http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2017/01/trump-dakota-pipeline.aspx">American Psychological Association urged</a> the Corps to find an alternate route for the DA Pipeline, noting research has linked historical trauma to significant health disparities and increased risk of premature death. So when the Sioux Tribes were invited to "consult" on a pipeline carrying millions of gallons of someone else's oil through their traditional territories to markets elsewhere, it was hard not to see it as an yet another federal project benefitting others at the possible expense of tribal citizens.</p>

<p>That perception is very likely the main reason for the unprecedented tribal solidarity shown by the DA Pipeline protests and the first assembling of the Seven Council Fires perhaps since the stunning defeat of Custer in 1876. Some who camped at the river may have been more concerned with the intensive energy needs for mining Alberta's tar sands and fracking North Dakota's oil shale, and the Greenhouse Gases generated by our continued reliance on fossil fuels. But others were wondering what happened to the trust responsibility, which the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/316/286">US Supreme Court has nobly proclaimed</a> imposes on the federal government "moral obligations of the highest responsibility and trust" toward Indian tribes. The Canadian Supreme Court, drawing on the country's continued affinity for royalty, <a href="https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2189/index.do">has often declared</a> that "the honour of the Crown is always at stake" in the government's dealings with Aboriginal peoples. That court says the fundamental objective of Canada's Aboriginal law is reconciliation between Indigenous and other peoples and their respective claims, interests and ambitions. So far, President Trump's approach on the DA and XL Pipelines reflects little concern for moral obligation, honor or reconciliation with the nation's Indigenous citizens.</p>

<strong>O</strong>n March 23, <a href="https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/55306.htm">Thomas A. Shannon, Jr.</a> [bio], the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, <a href="https://keystonepipeline-xl.state.gov/documents/organization/269323.pdf">determined</a> [PDF] that issuing a permit to authorize the Keystone XL pipeline (KXL) "would serve the national interest." In doing so, Under Secretary Shannon noted that, from an environmental justice perspective, the 875 miles of the KXL traversing portions of Montana, South Dakota, and Nebraska, "could ... disproportionally affect[ ]" Indian tribes in the region "should an oil release occur." </p>

<p>The State Department's national interest determination relied upon <a href="https://keystonepipeline-xl.state.gov/finalseis/index.htm">environmental reviews</a> completed in 2014, but the legal, cultural, and social protests brought last year by the Standing Rock Sioux and other tribes to the Dakota Access Pipeline prompted a distinct shift in the world's consciousness of tribal rights. Although the water protectors have been evicted from their camps and oil can now flow beneath Lake Oahe, Standing Rock's legal challenge to the pipeline is yet to be resolved. As lawsuits over the State Department's KXL decision begin to mount, the pending outcome of Standing Rock's case may give tribes new grounds on which to challenge the State Department's decision by properly protecting tribal treaty rights and the federal government's trust responsibility to tribes. </p>

<p><strong>Treaty Rights</strong><br />
At its core, tribal opposition to both Dakota Access and KXL simply seeks some legal accounting for the disproportionate burden often borne by Indian tribes when the federal government considers actions to be taken in service of broader, national interests. While the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-national-environmental-policy-act">National Environmental Policy Act</a> (NEPA) requires federal agency analysis of the potential environmental impacts, that law does not expressly demand specific consideration of the rights reserved by tribes in treaties with the federal government.</p>

<p>The history and nature of tribal treaty rights argue for their distinct treatment and recognition. Treaties have formed the basis of the governmental relationship between the United States and Indian tribes since before the nation's founding. Treaty-making continued until 1871 and the interpretation of these time-honored, government-to-government bonds formed the basis of the Supreme Court's foundational Indian law jurisprudence in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6938475705816460383"><em>Worcester v. Georgia</em></a>. </p>

<p>The court took special care to account the rights of tribes enshrined in treaty language. In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6214061654668746785"><em>United States v. Winans</em></a>, for example, the court made clear that those rights were not granted to tribes by the federal government but, instead, were reserved by the tribes in recognition of their pre-extant exercise of those rights. In addition, when a treaty reserved land for tribal homelands, the court recognized in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15635506864764654916"><em>Winters v. United States</em></a> that the treaty also ensured adequate water rights necessary to fulfill those purposes. Although the court allowed for the Congressional abrogation of treaty rights in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7850018948516966670"><em>Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock</em></a>, it also protected those rights from state interference in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9960128717379587618"><em>Washington Game Dept. v. Puyallup Tribe</em></a>. The court further held in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4489545945245924720"><em>United States v. Dion</em></a> that any Congressional intent to abrogate those rights be clearly evidenced and not be lightly inferred.</p>

<p>Given the Constitutional supremacy of treaties, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has pressed treaty rights as a basis for challenging the approval of the Dakota Access Pipeline by <a href="http://www.usace.army.mil">US Army Corps of Engineers</a>. In doing so, the Tribe <a href="http://earthjustice.org/sites/default/files/files/Memo-ISO-SRSTs-Mtn-for-PSJ.pdf">argues</a> [PDF] that the Corps failed to adequately account for the potentially devastating impact that a failure of the pipeline could have on the hunting, fishing, and water rights that the Tribe reserved in 1851 and 1868 treaties with the federal government. In the Tribe's <a href="http://earthjustice.org/sites/default/files/files/SRST-Opp-and-Reply_Redacted-Sanitized.pdf">view</a> [PDF], it is not "just another stakeholder," and the Corps had to do more than summarily determine that its permitting of the pipeline would "have no direct or indirect effects" on the Tribe or its treaty rights. </p>

<p>In opposing the Tribe, the Corps and Dakota Access argue that the agency sufficiently complied with its environmental review obligations under NEPA and that, by analyzing the potential impacts of its permitting decisions on the natural resources of the area around the pipeline, the agency also adequately analyzed the impacts on the Tribe and its treaty rights. According to the Corps, NEPA does not demand that the agency look at environmental impacts "through the lens of the Tribe's rights." Similarly, Dakota Access suggests that tribal rights were included within "the multitude of potential impacts" considered by the Corps. </p>

<p>If Standing Rock's treaty rights require additional and specific analysis of the potential impacts of the Corps' decision on those rights, the implications for the State Department's review of KXL would be significant. For example, in response to tribal and public input expressing concern about the impact of KXL on tribal treaty rights, including rights flowing from the exact same 1851 and 1868 treaties at issue with Dakota Access, the State Department <a href="https://2012-keystonepipeline-xl.state.gov/documents/organization/221210.pdf">argued</a> [PDF] that its review was consistent with NEPA and that the scope of such review is defined by location and alternatives without specific mention of or relation to tribal treaties. </p>

<p>Like Standing Rock's concerns with Dakota Access, however, tribes across the proposed path of KXL face <a href="http://www.ncai.org/attachments/Testimonial_UkbhoziSbdrsSGfibMHfjfdKvjlZBHcrVkGDiYgBFhDNBpKeYEJ_KEYSTONE%20COMMENTS%20APRIL%20222013%20-%20FINAL_1.2.pdf">unique threats</a> [PDF] to their treaty-reserved water rights. Although the State Department's national interest determination recognized the potential "disproportionate impact" on tribes of a spill from KXL, the earlier environmental analysis, like that of the Corps, did not specifically analyze those impacts in the context of tribal treaty rights and reserved homelands.</p>

<p><strong>Trust Responsibility</strong><br />
In addition to arguing that treaty rights demand analysis in addition to the procedural requirements of NEPA, Standing Rock contends that the federal government's trust responsibility demands protection of the Tribe's rights and interests as a substantive outcome as well. </p>

<p>The federal government's trust obligations to Indian tribes arose from the earliest Indian law jurisprudence of the Supreme court which, as described above, reviewed and interpreted the nature of the federal-tribal relationship based on the terms of the treaties entered by and between the two sovereigns. Chief Justice John Marshall, after analyzing the treaty relationship that provided for the protection and service of tribal interests in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6481524100903611909"><em>Cherokee Nation v. State of Georgia</em></a>, noted that the federal government had obligations to tribes like that of a guardian. From those roots, many of the court's subsequent decisions have recognized the existence and contours of the trust responsibility, including, more recently in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=518599398712147628"><em>United States v. Navajo Nation</em></a>, the narrow grounds on which tribes may recover money damages from the federal government for alleged breaches of trust duties. Notwithstanding the narrow limits in that context, however, Congress <a href="https://www.congress.gov/114/plaws/publ178/PLAW-114publ178.pdf">reaffirmed</a> [PDF] the federal government's more general trust duties to tribes just last year. </p>

<p>Standing Rock relies on those trust obligations to buttress its argument that any potential impacts the Tribe's treaty rights demand to be reviewed more carefully than other potential environmental impacts. In addition, however, Standing Rock relies on prior lower federal court cases interpreting the trust responsibility to argue that the Corps was obligated to avoid a result that would unduly burden the Tribe, its interests or resources. The Corps and Dakota Access counter the Tribe's assertion by arguing that the Supreme Court's narrower interpretation of the trust responsibility in the context of damages controls and that, under that interpretation, the Tribe must demonstrate some clear statutory basis for the trust obligation to apply.</p>

<p>The federal trust responsibility looms large for tribes facing the prospect of KXL. In fact, when commenting on the project to the State Department, the <a href="https://www.doi.gov">Department of the Interior</a> [official website], the federal agency most responsible for carrying out the trust responsibility, <a href="https://2012-keystonepipeline-xl.state.gov/documents/organization/249456.pdf">noted</a> [PDF] that it was aware of "significant concern" from tribes about both the protection of treaty rights and the "fulfillment of the trust responsibility." Attached to the inter-Departmental comment was a <a href="https://2012-keystonepipeline-xl.state.gov/documents/organization/249461.pdf">compendium</a> [PDF] of tribal comment letters, resolutions, emails, and other correspondence, in which many of the tribal demands for additional review and protection relied upon the trust responsibility.</p>

<p>Those working on Standing Rock's behalf have suggested that their challenges to the Dakota Access Pipeline are the starting point for a range of challenges to KXL and similar fossil fuel-related projects yet to come. While it remains to be seen whether the social protests that inspired thousands to join Standing Rock's opposition to Dakota Access will materialize against KXL, the legal issues surrounding the Tribe's treaty rights and trust obligations will certainly shape the litigation that various tribes may pursue to stop KXL. For Standing Rock, these matters will soon be resolved on the Tribe's motion for summary judgment before the US District Court in Washington D.C. but KXL and similar future projects threaten that, notwithstanding their treaty-guaranteed rights and time-honored federal trust relationship, tribes will continue to bear "disproportionate impacts." It will fall to the federal judiciary to determine whether such burdens are the necessary costs of infrastructure projects of national interest or whether those interests are better served through broader federal recognition of the treaty-reserved rights and trust interests of tribes and their members.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">Guest Columnist Kip Wainscott, Head of Legal & External Relations at <a href="https://www.crowdjustice.org">CrowdJustice</a>, discusses the fight against gerrymandering,<br />
                and the value of digital organizing tools to empower movements and make them more accessible...</p>

                <p><strong>A</strong>cross the country, lawyers and voting rights advocates are bringing fresh vigor to the fight against unjust election practices.  Just last week, a federal judge in North Carolina <a href="http://wnct.com/2017/04/03/another-gop-redistricting-map-ruled-unconstitutional/">struck down</a> a set of local electoral boundaries as unconstitutional, the latest in a series of similar rulings in the state.</p>

                <p>Particularly as political and legal communities reorient themselves in the wake of the 2016 election, a palpable sense of energy and urgency has emerged around combating the scourge of gerrymandering, the maligned (but widespread) practice of drawing electoral districts to curtail the voting power of certain political or racial constituencies.  As legal forces prepare to ramp up this critical fight for fair elections, it's important that these efforts be responsive to, and inclusive of, the very citizens who are threatened by gerrymandering's corrosive effects.  In light of the chilling objectives of gerrymandering &#8212;  muting or muffling the voices of communities in our elections &#8212;  it is especially appropriate that the legal battle for redistricting reform be as inclusive and democratic as possible.  </p>

                <p>Although impact litigation is among many important mechanisms for positive change in our democracy, it traditionally has lacked the inclusive and galvanizing traits that infuse other forms of activism.  Digital tools like <a href="https://www.crowdjustice.org/">CrowdJustice</a> can make it easier for lawyers to give concerned citizens and impacted voters a role in legal action.  At a time when voices are being silenced and diluted at the ballot box, giving communities a voice in the fight to reclaim the electoral system is an especially powerful notion.  </p>

                <p><strong>A Landscape Primed for Legal Action<br />
                </strong><br />
                    Gerrymandering is not a recent a phenomenon; many advocates have indeed committed decades to addressing this challenge.  But a new level of intensity and interest has been on display in courtrooms and news reports in recent months.  Consider this snapshot: </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Encouraging judicial decisions: Beyond North Carolina, reformers have seen several encouraging decisions recently.  In March, the <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/virginia-gerrymandering-supreme-court-235565">Supreme Court ordered a lower court to reexamine</a> whether Virginia's legislature racially gerrymandered legislative districts to dilute the voting power of African-Americans.  Within days, that decision was cited by a federal panel in Texas in a ruling that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/court-says-texas-congressional-districts-gerrymandered-to-hurt-minorities/2017/03/11/97b6ab0a-0685-11e7-b9fa-ed727b644a0b_story.html">invalidated </a>three of the state's congressional districts as unlawfully limiting the influence of minority voters.

                        <p><br />
                            Novel legal strategies: After voting rights lawyers in <u><a href="http://www.campaignlegalcenter.org/case/whitford-v-gill">Whitford v. Gill</a></u> introduced a <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/How_the_Efficiency_Gap_Standard_Works.pdf">quantitative model  for measuring partisan gerrymandering</a> [PDF] as part of their case, a three-judge federal panel struck down Wisconsin's legislative districts as unconstitutional, representing the first victory of its kind in 30 years.  The case is now on its way to the Supreme Court.<br />
                            <br />
                            Star treatment: Arnold Schwarzenegger recently teamed with ATTN:, a media company whose mission is to engender greater participation in communities and the political process, to launch a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/attn/videos/1292839037418219/?hc_ref=PAGES_TIMELINE">viral digital campaign</a> to highlight the absurdities of gerrymandering and to galvanize public support for reform.</p>

                        <p>Marquee legal talent: In January, elite Supreme Court litigator Paul Smith &#8212; "<a href="https://thinkprogress.org/one-of-the-biggest-legal-guns-in-the-country-is-coming-for-partisan-gerrymandering-4e6d3a0385fe">one of the biggest legal guns in the country</a>" and partner at Jenner & Block &#8212; announced that he was leaving to pursue a full-time position with the Campaign Legal Center, a leader in the fight against gerrymandering.  </p>

                        <p>Super-powered organizational efforts: Former Attorney General Eric Holder and powerhouse lawyer Marc Elias recently<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/us/eric-holder-to-lead-democrats-attack-on-republican-gerrymandering.html?_r=1"> launched a new organization</a> devoted exclusively to fighting for redistricting reform in the years ahead.  The group's active supporters include none other than President Obama, who is targeting redistricting reform as one of his <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/eric-holder-obama-ready-public-235508">post-presidency priorities</a>. </p>

                        <p>These developments evoke a legal community that is primed to earnestly fight gerrymandering, and also reflect the central role lawyers and the courts will play in addressing this challenge.  But these activities also signal a growing public awareness of, and interest in, issues that the legal community should cultivate and harness.  While empowering voters is among the most important outcomes that can result from these battles, we've seen that by using digital techniques like crowdfunding, empowerment can also be a component of the legal strategy itself.  </p>

                        <p><strong><u>Vesilind v. VA Board of Elections</u> & Democratizing the Fight for Fair Elections<br />
                        </strong><br />
                            Amid the escalating national profile of redistricting reform, a small nonprofit organization is making an outsized statement in its ongoing lawsuit challenging Virginia's state legislative map.  By infusing its litigation strategy with a crowdfunding dimension, the group &#8212;  <a href="https://www.onevirginia2021.org/">OneVirginia2021</a> &#8212;  has transformed a somewhat technical and esoteric legal challenge into an inspired, community-powered battle for progress. </p>

                        <p>Last month, the <a href="https://www.crowdjustice.org/case/virginiagerrymandering/">organization created a CrowdJustice</a> page with the aim of sharing information about their case and raising a modest sum to defray litigation expenses.  Within hours, online donations shattered the initial $5,000 target (en route to a $51,000 total) and the page became a centralized hub for information about the case, opportunities to help raise awareness, and resources to better understand the issue of gerrymandering.  In the process, OneVirginia2021 enlisted more than a thousand case supporters and cultivated a spirit of community around the case.</p>

                        <p>While ultimately this case &#8212;  like any other &#8212;  will be decided in the courtroom, the community dimension can matter a great deal.  We've seen the important ways that the public climate can shape judicial attitudes in meaningful ways &#8212; from our country's earliest civil rights struggles, to recent victories for LGBT equality, legal successes have often followed vocal public sentiments.  Moreover, democratizing these lawsuits is a potent antidote to unhealthy perceptions that legal activism is a pursuit reserved solely for powerful or well-funded interests.   </p>

                        <p>The volume of cases across the voting rights landscape is expected to rise in the years ahead &#8212; owing in part to the Supreme Court's decision to gut core provisions of the Voting Rights Act in <u>Shelby County v. Holder</u> &#8212; especially as states begin redrawing districts following the 2020 census.  Harnessing resources to support this work is important, as is ensuring that the grassroots and impacted communities are able to engage directly with impactful action in the courts.</p>

                        <p>As the profile of social and political issues continues to rise, advocates should not undervalue the advantages of giving the public a voice and a role in these efforts.  Crowdfunding and other digital organizing tools can create new pathways for empowerment around legal battles &#8212; a means of participation that stands in sharp relief to the odious effects of gerrymandering even before the courtroom battles are won.  With the integrity of our political system at stake, let's ensure that redistricting reform is a legal cause that's both by and for the People. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.du.edu/index.php/profile/christopher-lasch">Christopher N. Lasch</a> of the University of Denver discusses Attorney General Sessions' position on sanctuary cities ... </p><strong>A</strong>s JURIST previously <a href="http:///paperchase/2017/03/sessions-threatens-to-cut-funding-sanctuary-cities-that-refuse-to-enforce-immigration-laws.php">reported</a>, Attorney General Jeff Sessions has threatened to cut Department of Justice funding to so-called "sanctuary" cities. The Attorney General's <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/27/press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-3272017-29">comments</a> during the White House press briefing on March 27, 2017, and on other occasions, demonstrate that our nation's top law enforcement official is concerned far less with enforcing the law than with pursuing the Trump administration's political agenda.</p>

<p><strong>Ignoring the Law</strong><br />
Anti-sanctuary politicians like to claim that sanctuary cities defy or flout federal law. President Trump, for example, in his January 25 <a href="http:///documents/executiveorders/13768.php">executive order</a> on interior immigration enforcement, claimed that "[s]anctuary jurisdictions across the United States willfully violate Federal law in an attempt to shield aliens from removal from the United States."  Echoing this, Attorney General Sessions on March 27 likewise tried to paint sanctuary policies as defying federal law. He said that the DOJ Inspector General previously "found that these policies ... violate federal law." PolitiFact rightly rated this claim "mostly false" after consulting with immigration law experts and reviewing the Inspector General's <a href="https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2016/1607.pdf">report</a> [PDF], which was fairly explicit in not reaching the conclusion that any particular policy violated the law.<br />
 <br />
Sessions's inaccurate portrayal of the Inspector General's report fits into a larger pattern of dishonesty about the law when it comes to sanctuary policies. His remarks on March 27 suggested that sanctuary policies might violate numerous federal laws. But only one specific statute has ever been cited by those (including President Trump, in his executive order, and Attorney General Sessions, in his March 27 remarks) who suggest sanctuary policies defy federal law: <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1373">8 U.S.C. § 1373</a>.</p>

<p>8 U.S.C. § 1373 is a very narrow law, addressed only to prohibitions on local law enforcement sharing information with federal immigration officials concerning a person's citizenship or immigration status.  The overwhelming majority of "sanctuary" policies across the country have nothing to say about such information sharing.  (San Francisco, for example, while perhaps the jurisdiction most often maligned by the anti-sanctuary campaign, takes the position that it complies with 8 U.S.C. § 1373).  Instead, most policies address whether immigration "detainers" (requests by federal immigration officials for the continued detention of a state or local inmate who is otherwise entitled to release) will be accepted by local law enforcement.</p>

<p>Lack of compliance with detainers is what is really at stake in the current debate over sanctuary cities. We know this because while administration officials point to 8 U.S.C. § 1373 to support the claim that sanctuary policies violate federal law, they fail to discuss any claimed violations of 8 U.S.C. § 1373.  Instead, they talk about jurisdictions failing to honor detainers&#8212which is exactly where Attorney General Sessions took the conversation on March 27, trotting out the San Francisco case of Francisco Sanchez and the Denver case of Ever Valles as examples of prisoners released, despite ICE having lodged a detainer--only to be subsequently charged with murder.</p>

<p>We also know that detainers are what is really troubling the administration because the President's executive order directed the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov">Department of Homeland Security</a> "on a weekly basis, [to] make public a comprehensive list of criminal actions committed by aliens and any jurisdiction that ignored or otherwise failed to honor any detainers with respect to such aliens."  Attorney General Sessions cited this order on March 27 before turning to the Sanchez and Valles cases, claiming the <a href="https://www.ice.gov/declined-detainer-outcome-report">DHS report</a> showed "that in a single week, there were more than 200 instances of jurisdictions refusing to honor ICE detainer requests with respect to individuals charged or convicted of a serious crime."  The report, it turns out, was riddled with errors&#8212"corrections" to the report issued by DHS included, for example, that Franklin County, Iowa; Franklin County, New York; and Franklin County, Pennsylvania were all erroneously listed as having declined detainers in the first report.  Its issuance was discontinued after just three weeks.</p>

<p>Despite the obsession with declined detainers, Attorney General Sessions has in his remarks demonstrated utter obliviousness to the actual law governing detainers.  On March 27, Sessions suggested honoring detainers was a "fundamental principle of law enforcement" and in February at a meeting of states' attorneys general, Sessions called it a "shocking thing" that localities were not honoring detainers. These comments suggest unawareness of a steady stream of federal court decisions since 2014.  The Third Circuit US Court of Appeals, in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12712403176548919142">Galarza v. Szalczyk</a>, established that localities cannot be compelled to honor detainers.  A district court in Oregon <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10567130403344047032">held</a> further that localities can be held liable for <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> violations, given that the detention requested by federal officials amounts to a new warrantless arrest that must be justified under the Constitution. This line of precedent was sufficiently strong that the Obama administration put an end to the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/14_1120_memo_secure_communities.pdf">"Secure Communities"</a> [PDF] program (which relied heavily on detainers) because of it.  </p>

<p>If Sessions is aware of this body of law, he is not talking about it.</p>

<p><strong>Playing Politics with Immigration</strong><br />
The Attorney General's attempt to paint the crackdown on sanctuary jurisdictions as an issue of enforcing the law is thus readily revealed as cynical and false&#8212a monumental misdirection. What is really driving the Attorney General?</p>

<p>At the February meeting of state attorneys general, California AG Xavier Becerra pointed out to Sessions that crimes rates dropped in California in part "because we have the cooperation of folks throughout the communities.  We need witnesses.  We need to have them cooperate with us when crimes do occur ..."  Becerra then noted that the Trump administration "is causing a lot of fear," causing law-abiding undocumented people to "fear approaching law enforcement" as witnesses to crime.</p>

<p>Becerra was articulating a principal defense of sanctuary policies&#8212that sanctuary policies improve public safety&#8212and telling Sessions that the federal government was undermining effective local policing.  One might expect Sessions, or indeed any true Republican for that matter, to fully embrace Becerra's point.  Less than two months later, Sessions would write in a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/954916/download">memorandum</a> [PDF] that "[l]ocal control and local accountability are necessary for effective local policing. It is not the responsibility of the federal government to manage non-federal law enforcement agencies."  This, of course, is an articulation of the classic Republican anti-federal-government viewpoint.</p>

<p>Sessions's response to Becerra, however, made clear that local control over local policing is a policy that does not apply where immigrants are concerned.  "I understand the argument you've made," he said, even acknowledging a "certain validity to it."  But, Sessions said, "there are other countervailing principles at work."  Sessions did not elaborate on what those "countervailing principles" might be.  </p>

<p>The fact is, the notion advanced by Becerra, that sanctuary policies improve public safety, is simply unacceptable to the Trump administration.  Trump's entire immigration platform was premised on the idea that immigrants regularly rape and murder U.S. citizens. He named five murder victims in his <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/donald-trump-immigration-address-transcript-227614">"immigration speech"</a> [transcript] in Phoenix on August 31, 2016, and had parents of three murder victims speak on the first night of the Republican nominating convention.  As President, he said in his executive order that sanctuary jurisdictions "have caused immeasurable harm to the American people and to the very fabric of our Republic," and he ordered the DHS declined detainer report produced "[t]o better inform the public regarding the public safety threats associated with sanctuary jurisdictions."  Sessions, in his March 27 comments, claimed that "these policies endanger lives of every American" and that "countless Americans would be alive today and countless loved ones would not be grieving today if these policies of sanctuary cities were ended."</p>

<p>These policy positions, however, are contradicted by all available data.  <a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/criminal_justice2000/vol_1/02j.pdf">Study</a> [PDF] after study has shown that immigrants, regardless of status, commit crimes at lower rates than citizens.  In the words of <a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=834111114068083086124101126013102092051072061008025071104124068085009024100099090026058013060031021036017103025006001082121001114050071046052024025119068109004094060029056121093025004027073082017115100029115126122084121092097072121091027098093067127&EXT=pdf">Michael Tonry</a> [PDF[, "high levels of legal and illegal Hispanic immigration ... [are] credited with contributing significantly to the decline in American crime rates since 1991."  And sanctuary policies have not made cities unsafe--the <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/reports/2017/01/26/297366/the-effects-of-sanctuary-policies-on-crime-and-the-economy/">recent study</a> by Tom K. Wong concludes that crime rates are lower and economic indicators are stronger in sanctuary jurisdictions.</p>

<p>JURIST guest columnist Ali Khan <a href="http:///forum/2017/04/deportation-as-a-crime-against-humanity.php">recently situated</a> America's current war on immigrants in global trends of nativism, racism and xenophobia.  This, in my view, provides the answer to the question of what "countervailing principles" might cause Attorney General Sessions not only to ignore all available data on immigration, sanctuary, and crime, but to upend traditional Republican views on federal-versus-local control of policing.  Trump's anti-sanctuary rhetoric, I have <a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=978074069119093083089089081095008065022033067082008069010096028077095077104109027077049010006099009024001093112012031006100079055029063052011090064109002096077113063026087093120100079101081086097067103087104123103025098016068098104121031085102007102&EXT=pdf">argued</a> [PDF], is racial rhetoric.  It is part of an illogical, counterfactual, counter-legal, and highly successful political formula: Demonizing immigrants wins votes; deporting immigrants wins votes.  </p>

<p>Sanctuary cities stand in the way of this political agenda.  The Attorney General's words and actions reveal that, when it comes to sanctuary cities, Jeff Sessions is not serving the role of chief law enforcement lawyer.  He is just another politician chasing down votes for the President.</p>

		<title>Texas &#034;Bathroom Bill&#034; Offers Up More of the Same False, Tired Anti-LGBT Arguments</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Dara Purvis of Penn State Law discusses some deficiencies of a recent Texas bill resembling North Carolina's "HB2"...</p><strong>I</strong>n January, Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick introduced <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB6/2017">Senate Bill 6 </a>(SB6), another so-called "bathroom bill" aimed at preventing transgender Texans from using a bathroom consistent with their gender identity.</p>

<p>The bill itself is straightforward, with two primary effects. The first requires public schools, open-enrollment charter schools, and government buildings to require that bathrooms and changing rooms that are used by more than one person at a time be gender-segregated and used only by people whose "biological sex" is consistent with the labeled gender. The bill defines biological sex as the sex reflected on an individual's birth certificate. Bathrooms may only be entered by a person of the other sex (as defined by their birth certificate) for exceptions outlined in the bill, including custodial or maintenance work or if a person using the bathroom requires assistance. Banned from using typical public bathrooms with multiple stalls, transgender students or visitors to government buildings would have to hope the building provided special access to a single-stall bathroom, including such options as "controlled use of a faculty bathroom."</p>

<p>The bill's second action is to overturn local anti-discrimination ordinances that require businesses to allow customers to use bathrooms consistent with their gender identity. Several of Texas's largest cities have ordinances prohibiting discrimination on the basis of gender identity, including Austin, San Antonio, Dallas and Fort Worth. </p>

<p>Texas statutes provide that a birth certificate may be amended to "correct a record that is incomplete or proved by satisfactory evidence to be inaccurate."  In order to change the identified sex on a birth certificate, an applicant must obtain a court order, which <a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/vs/reqproc/forms/VS-170-REV-7-15-application-to-amend-birth.pdf">a state form </a> [PDF] describes as justified by "gender reassignment surgery."  Not all transgender people choose to undergo sex reassignment surgery, and typically the surgery would not be performed on a growing child, meaning that it would be very difficult for a school-age child to petition a court for an order to change his or her birth certificate to reflect his or her accurate gender identity.  <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/news/news/2014/10/26/for-transgender-lawyer-with-own-practice-change-has-been-good">Anecdotal evidence confirms</a> that a judge's willingness to issue such an order varies considerably based on his or her location within Texas, and whether the area is predominantly conservative or progressive.</p>

<p>Patrick introduced SB6 as a measure to counter guidance from the Department of Education telling schools that barring transgender students from using a bathroom consistent with their gender identity violated Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972. Title IX prohibits discrimination based on sex, and <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/11-states-sue-obama-administration-over-transgender-guidance-letter.php">in a May 2016 "Dear Colleague" letter</a> the Department's Office of Civil Rights told school administrators that refusing to allow transgender students to use the bathroom consistent with their gender identity, including requiring such students to use a single-stall bathroom when cisgender students used multiple-stall bathrooms, constitutes sex-based discrimination.   </p>

<p>After the inauguration of the Trump administration, however, and confirmation of new Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, the Department of Education <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/trump-administration-revokes-public-school-transgender-bathroom-guidelines.php">withdrew the Dear Colleague letter</a>.  Title IX's underlying statutory protection remains, but it appears that the Trump administration's Education Department will take the position that denying transgender students equal access to bathrooms is not sex discrimination.</p>

<p>SB6 <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/texas-senate-approves-bathroom-bill.php">quickly passed in the Texas Senate</a> on largely partisan lines. One key justification for the bill offered in debate and the media was the safety of women and girls. This logic, which has been used in arguments over equal bathroom access for transgender students and people in many contexts, is that if transgender women are allowed to use women's bathrooms, then male predators will falsely claim to be transgender in order to legally gain access to women's bathrooms and assault or expose themselves to women and girls inside.</p>

<p>There is no evidence, however, that so-called "bathroom bills" have any effect on assaults committed by male predators falsely claiming to be transgender. A <a href="http://www.vox.com/identities/2017/1/5/14173882/texas-transgender-bathroom-law-lgbtq">recent Vox article</a> cited research by MediaMatters.org and PolitiFact showing that states with laws protecting transgender people from discrimination, including requiring bathroom access, had no increased crimes in bathrooms. </p>

<p>Moreover, examples of assaults that occurred in bathrooms often cited by proponents of bathroom bills did not happen in the wake of nondiscrimination provisions passed to protect transgender people. To the contrary, transgender people <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/05/15/477954537/when-a-transgender-person-uses-a-public-bathroom-who-is-at-risk">are far more likely</a> to report violence directed at them in a bathroom. </p>

<p>There is thus no evidence that SB6 furthers one of the main policy goals offered to justify its passage. Instead, it exacerbates the severe negative experiences transgender youth have at school. One organization that works with transgender youth <a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/transgender-children-2012-6">estimates that</a> one or two students out of every 500 students is transgender. One national survey found that ninety percent of transgender students <a href="https://www.glsen.org/sites/default/files/Harsh%20Realities.pdf"> had heard</a> [PDF] "derogatory remarks" about sexual orientation and gender identity while at school, often from school employees themselves.  Knowing that bathrooms are often a flashpoint of harassment and even violence against transgender people, both transgender children and adults often try to avoid using them in public at all, leading to problems including chronic dehydration and bladder and kidney infections.</p>

<p>It is hard to imagine a more vulnerable population for legislators in Texas to target. In the absence of any rationally linked justification such as safety, it is particularly difficult to understand the law as backed by anything but animus. Indeed, the single Democratic State Senator who supported the bill explained his support in thinly-veiled prejudice against transgender children. That Senator, Eddie Lucio, Jr., <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/news/texas-legislature/2017/03/14/bathroom-bill-gets-first-thumbs-texas-senate">argued that</a> SB6 is "a bulwark against society's moral decline," preventing schools from "indoctrinat[ing] children in gender theories and other mature topics they may not comprehend." <br />
   <br />
This line of argument is familiar to scholars of the gay rights movement. Not even a full generation ago, LGBT people <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2163837">were characterized</a> as indoctrinating and even recruiting children into lives of homosexuality.   From this perspective, introducing homosexuality to children in the context of anything less than a full-throated condemnation would teach children that homosexuality was acceptable and make them more likely to be queer themselves. Lucio's argument makes the same logical leap: that allowing fellow students to use the bathroom consistent with their gender identity will teach children that gender is something different than two binary categories permanently enshrined at birth, and thus more children will identify as transgender.</p>

<p>Science, of course, <a href="http://time.com/4231379/gender-south-dakota-bathroom-bill/">tells us that</a> such a black and white concept of gender is medically inaccurate.  The Constitution and Supreme Court, moreover, tell us that such reasoning is impermissibly based in animus. SB6 lacks a rational relationship to the legitimate state interest of public safety, and its own supporters explain it as necessary to communicate moral disapproval of transgender Texans to children. This is the same prejudice repeatedly found to run afoul of the Constitution in cases such as <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17758055891258118781">Romer v. Evans</a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15714610278411834284">Lawrence v. Texas</a>. In Romer, the Court struck down Amendment 2, a statewide ordinance prohibiting antidiscrimination ordinances protecting the LGBT people as inflicting "immediate, continuing, and real injuries that outrun and belie any legitimate justifications that may be claimed for it." SB6 suffers from precisely the same unconstitutional deficiency. Should SB6 progress through the Texas legislature into law, it will become another embarrassing, <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2017/03/28/price-tag-for-north-carolina-bathroom-bill-reaches.html">costly </a>and unconstitutional debacle to enter the history books alongside North Carolina's HB2.   </p>

		<title>The Fist in a Velvet Glove: Hardened Humanitarianism</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.syr.edu/profile/david-crane1">David M. Crane</a>, Syracuse University College of Law, discusses the necessity of use of force in the Syrian conflict... </p>

<p><strong>T</strong>he cornerstone to the UN paradigm is to settle disputes peacefully, using force only as a last <a href="http://www.un.org/en/charter-united-nations/">resort</a>. Yet, restoring international peace and security sometimes requires a hardened approach to ensure that peace and security. </p>

<p>There are decades of international treaties, custom and precedent that support what I call <a href="http://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law/9780582302457.001.0001/law-9780582302457">hardened</a> <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41047/41047-h/41047-h.htm">humanitarianism</a>. When we have to deal with a tyrant, thug, dictator or rogue head of state who turns on his own citizens, the international community or a member state of that community should step forward with a clear and firm position-stop it or force will be used.</p>

<p>A tyrant only understands one thing-power. When he feels the sting of consequence for his actions that tyrant begins to focus on that use of force against him. The use of this more hardened approach in using force to stop a tyrant's actions will cause that tyrant to pause, to consider his next steps.</p>

<p>Appeasement in the face of tyranny never works. History is replete with anecdotal evidence of this from the Armenian genocide to <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10426.html">the</a> <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Chamberlain_and_Appeasement.html?id=7KbDQgAACAAJ">Sudetenland</a>. A hardened policy of seeking a peaceful dialog with the assurance of a forceful resolution, should that dialog fail, makes for a more meaningful discourse.</p>

<p>Our international legal and policy system has drawn lines related to protecting civilians in a conflict and banning certain type of weapons systems <a href="https://www.icrc.org/en/war-and-law/weapons.">per se</a>. Most, if not all, states parties have signed onto these norms. We don't have to be histrionic when a tyrant ignores these clear lines beating our chests with empty words. When that tyrant steps over a line hit them hard, use force, show the world there are consequences!</p>

<p>US action against Al Qaeda after they attacked the US Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania are examples of facing down the lawless elements of our society under the international legal concept of reprisal. In 2005 the world came together to create a doctrine that laid down a marker that declared that the international community has a right to step in to block a tyrant or head of state who is turning against his own citizens committing war crimes and crimes against humanity. Called the Responsibility to Protect (R2P), the doctrine was a clarion call to arms should there be alleged violations of international law. Unfortunately, R2P has fallen short of the ideal based on the political perception that it is a doctrine that can be easily used by various powers against weaker nation states for alleged violations. Despite this the principle idea of this responsibility to protect citizens from their own leaders remains.</p>

<p>The long and tragic kaleidoscopic conflict that is Syria has now gone beyond peaceful resolution. A hardened sense of humanity calls for continued cruise missiles strikes and other military action every time Assad crosses the lines laid out under international norms. Kaleidoscopic conflict is fast becoming a new concept in the dirty little wars of the 21st century. Old doctrines for war fighting and the legal set of rules that surround warfare that have been tested over time are being challenged at all levels. Just when planners think there is a viable course of action developing related to a conflict, such as in Syria, one thing changes and everything changes, hence the term kaleidoscopic. This impacts on what is called the deliberate planning cycle in modern parlance throwing out how international and domestic organizations plan for and deal with conflict on a day to day basis. At the end of the day we are beginning to face situations where there is no solution under current policy and doctrine. This gives us pause as to how to advise world leaders in dealing with any given conflict. This pause can allow a tragedy, such as in Syria, to go on and on without any foreseeable ending.</p>

<p>These dirty little wars have a direct impact on how parties to a conflict deal with civilians found in and around the battlefield. One of the key cornerstone concepts of the international humanitarian law is that civilians are to be protected and that the intentional targeting of a civilian is a war crime plain and simple. We see around the globe today parties to a conflict flagrantly ignoring this key legal concept. With no apparent repercussion to these attacks on civilians, actors move about the battlefield with impunity. Again this is the conflict in Syria, but can be seen also in the fighting in South Sudan. This is why a more hardened approach to our humanitarian principle of using force where legally appropriate will cause actors to pause and reconsider wholesale destruction in any given conflict.</p>

<p>This hardened approach must be done under law or we weaken our international norms, yet it must be done. Enough is enough in Syria. States parties who for whatever reason give that tyrant support should also be dealt with for their aiding and abetting of international crimes with legal sanctions. We charged President Charles Taylor with aiding and abetting a conflict, among other modes of liability, in next door Sierra Leone, and he was convicted on those charges I signed in an indictment against him on an aiding and abetting theory. The aiding and abetting mode of liability in international criminal law is alive and well and certainly can be touted as a possible ramification for a country who aids a party to a conflict that gasses its own people with sarin. Russia's complicity in that gas attack sets Putin and his regime up for political sanction and possible legal action in the future.</p>

<p>Certainly, dialog and appropriate diplomatic discourse should continue. An end to the Syrian conflict must be the goal, hopefully a peaceful end, yet the hardened fist of a legal use of force to protect humanity should be a viable course to bolster that dialog. The missile strike on the airfield in Syria changed the political discourse on how the world's is looking at the quagmire that is the Syrian conflict. Regardless of how one feels about the motives or the rationale behind the strike, it is posited that Assad, with the advice of Russia and Iran will think carefully about another sarin gas attack. If they know that force could be used again in reprisal for clear violations of international norms such as gas, perhaps they will refrain. This is the outcome that is hoped in using this new concept of hardened humanitarianism.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://mckinneylaw.iu.edu/faculty-staff/profile.cfm?Id=607">Mohamed Abdelaal</a>, a professor at Alexandria University School of Law and Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law, discusses how the revival of the Emergency Law No. 162 of 1958 can negatively impact the rule of law in Egypt.... </p>

<p><strong>E</strong>gypt's longtime former president Hosni Mubarak, who was forced to step down during the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, ruled the country under the grip of emergency law for almost three decades, restricting individuals' freedoms and suspending several constitutional rights. Egypt's Emergency Law, Law No. 162 of 1958, was first imposed during the Egypt-Israel War in 1967 and was suspended after the 1973 War before being reactivated following the assassination of President Anwar Al-sadat in 1981 and has been in effect for almost 30 years during the regime of President Mubarak.</p>

<p>During the 2011 Revolution, one of the most key reforms demanded by the protesters was to put an end to the state of emergency and to revoke <a href="http://www.icnl.org/research/library/files/Egypt/162-1958-en.pdf">Law No. 162 of 1958</a> [pdf]. However, the Egyptian Supreme Council of Military Forces (SCAF), which assumed power after President Mubarak was forced from office pending the designation of an acting president until a presidential election is to be held, extended the emergency state before repealing it on May 31, 2012. In August 2013, the emergency law was restored when the acting president Adly Mansour declared the state of emergency for only one month to counter sabotage done by the supporters of the now ousted Islamist President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood.</p>

<p>On April 10, 2017, following the recent Egypt church bombings by Islamic militants, Egypt's current President Abdul Fattah Al-sisi issued the <a href="http://www.youm7.com/story/2017/4/10/%D9%86%D9%86%D8%B4%D8%B1-%D9%86%D8%B5-%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%B1%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%B3-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%85%D9%87%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D9%81%D8%B1%D8%B6-%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A6-%D9%81%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AF/3184268">Presidential Decree No. 157 of 2017</a> [in Arabic] reinstating the state of emergency for three months, which was later approved by the House of Representatives pursuant to Article 154 of Egypt's current <a href="https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Egypt_2014.pdf">Constitution of 2014</a> [pdf], which reads "[T]he President of the Republic declares, after consultation with the Cabinet, a state of emergency in the manner regulated by law. Such proclamation must be submitted to the House of Representatives within the following seven days to consider it."</p>

<p>The Presidential Decree No. 157 of 2017 contains five short articles, among them Article 4 is of a great significance. Specifically, Article 4 of the Decree punishes by imprisonment "whoever violates the orders issued by the President of the Republic pursuant to Law No. 162 of 1958 regarding the state of emergency." Law No. 162 of 1958 authorizes the president to take the required precautions to restrict the freedom of meeting, movement, residence, arrest suspects or those who threat public security and public order, to inspect people and places notwithstanding the provisions of the Criminal Procedures Law. (<a href="http://www.icnl.org/research/library/files/Egypt/162-1958-en.pdf">Art. 3(1))</a> [pdf]. It also entitles the president to order surveillance on any kind of messages, monitor, confiscate and close newspapers, leaflets, publications, fees and all means of expression, propaganda and advertising before its publication. (<a href="http://www.icnl.org/research/library/files/Egypt/162-1958-en.pdf">Art. 3(2))</a> [pdf]. Further, under this law, the president determines the opening and closing times of public stores, withdraws weapons' licenses and evacuates or segregates certain regions. (<a href="http://www.icnl.org/research/library/files/Egypt/162-1958-en.pdf">Art. 3(3), (5), (6))</a> [pdf].</p>

<p>Accordingly, a cursory examination of <a href="http://www.youm7.com/story/2017/4/10/%D9%86%D9%86%D8%B4%D8%B1-%D9%86%D8%B5-%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%B1%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%B3-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%85%D9%87%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D9%81%D8%B1%D8%B6-%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A6-%D9%81%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AF/3184268">Article 4</a> [in Arabic] of the Presidential Decree No. 157 of 2017 reveals that it brings Law No. 162 of 1958 back into effect after it was last applied in 2013, a move which is likely to represent a major step back towards the proper application of the rule of law in Egypt.</p>

<p>Below, I discuss how the revival of the Emergency Law No. 162 of 1958 can negatively impact the rule of law in Egypt. In doing so, my analysis centers around two main points.</p>

<p>Firstly, the case could be dated back to 2013, when the Egyptian Supreme Constitutional Court (SCC) invalidated [the Court's ruling in Arabic]<a href="http://www.icnl.org/research/library/files/Egypt/162-1958-en.pdf"> Art. 3(1)</a> [pdf] of the Emergency Law No. 162 of 1958, which allowed the President a great deal of discretion in imposing restrictions on some fundamental rights such as, the freedom of meeting, movement and residence. The <a href="http://www.icnl.org/research/library/files/Egypt/162-1958-en.pdf">article</a> [pdf], further, authorized the President to order the arrest and search of people as well as private places without being bound by procedures and safeguards mentioned in <a href="http://laws.jp.gov.eg/home/altshryat/alqwanyn-aljnayyte">the Criminal Procedures Law No. 150 of 1950 as amended by Law No. 95 of 2003</a> [pdf in Arabic]. The Court ruled the article <a href="http://www.cc.gov.eg/Images/L/291364.pdf">unconstitutional</a> [pdf in Arabic] reasoning that,<br />
<blockquote>Article 3(1) of Law No. 162 of 1958, in authorizing the President of the Republic to arrest and search persons and places without judicial warrant, infringes fundamental freedoms of the citizens and represents an assault on the sanctity of their homes and private places, and thus violates the rule of law which is the basis of governance in the State.</blockquote></p>

<p>Given the fact that, in the context of the Egyptian legal system, decisions of the SCC bind the state authorities since the last word on constitutional questions rests with the Court, Egypt's House of Representatives vowed to abide by the Court's aforementioned ruling when considering the merits of the President's declaration of emergency.However, such vow is only as good as the intention of the House of Representatives itself which fulfills it. Precisely, in approving the Presidential Decree No. 157 of 2017, which declared the emergency state and restored Law No. 162 of 1958, the House of Representatives announced its intention to amend Law No. 162 of 1958, a step which has been seen by many as an attempt by the House to show its commitment to abide by the SCC's decision in ruling Art. 3(1) of the law unconstitutional. However, the House approved a minor <a href="http://www.youm7.com/story/2017/4/11/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%81%D9%82-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%84-%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A6-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%AA%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D8%B7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AF%D8%A9/3186201">amendment</a> [in Arabic] introducing a new article to the law which reads<br />
<blockquote>with exception to the provisions of other laws, when the state of emergency is being declared, law enforcement officers are authorized to arrest any person if evidence indicates he may have committed a felony or a misdemeanor and searching his place of residence, and any place where there is a suspicion that he hides any dangerous or explosive materials, weapons or ammunition, or any object or instrument that might be the product of a crime, and he may be detained, after obtaining the permission of the public prosecutor, for a period not exceeding 7 days for evidence gathering.</blockquote></p>

<p>In fact, the language of this amendment cannot be described to mean anything but an attempt by the House of Representatives to bypass the SCC's ruling which invalidated Art. 3(1) of Law No. 162 of 1958 for violating the rule of law and individuals fundamental rights when authorizing the arrest and search of people and private places without a judicial warrant and without following the procedures mentioned in the Criminal Procedures Law. A careful reading to the language of the new amendment shows that the House of Representatives decided to adopt the content of Art. 3(1) of Law No. 162 of 1956 using different words.</p>

<p>Apart from the requirement to have the permission of the public prosecutor in order to detain the suspected person, the language of the amendment is so evident that procedures concerning arrest, search and confiscation are excluded from the protection pack that might be provided in other laws, including the Criminal Procedures Law. That being said, it is obvious that the House of Representatives failed to honor the SCC's ruling adopting an amendment that is likely to be construed as an attempt to circumvent the Court' ruling.</p>

<p>Secondly, an equal significantly failure to the rule of law in Egypt is evident in the attempt of Egypt's authorities to recall Emergency Law No. 162 of 1958 back from its deep slumber, a step that I regard as no more than a poor <a href="https://www.jurist.org/forum/2015/08/mohamed-abdelaal-egypt-anti-terrorism.php">legislative redundancy</a>. Specifically, in 2013 and 2015, <a href="http://www.constitutionnet.org/files/protest_law_issued_nov_24.pdf">Egypt adopted the Protest Law (Law No. 107 of 2013)</a> [pdf] and the <a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl-nat/a24d1cf3344e99934125673e00508142/4d39e76935f76f4fc125767e00320698/$FILE/Anti-Terrorism Law.PDF">Anti-Terrorism Law (Law No. 94 of 2015)</a> [pdf] respectively. Interestingly, both laws contain punitive provisions that address most of the areas Emergency Law No. 162 of 1958 tries to cover. The two laws for instance, punish for crimes that are similar to mentioned in Law No. 162 of 1958 such as "the possession of weapons and explosives, the dissemination of false news and information and the joining of an armed group." Further, both laws resemble Law No. 162 of 1958 in punishing "the publication, broadcast or promotion of false news or statements regarding terrorist attacks committed within the country or operations associated with fighting terrorism that differ from official statements by the Defense Ministry."</p>

<p>Also worth noting is the fact that <a href="http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/research/Egypt/criminal-code.pdf">Egypt's Penal Code of 1937</a> [pdf] includes a broad range of acts regarding which acts shall be considered an act of terrorism, a matter that is likely to put the Penal Code in conflict with the Emergency Law, the Protest Law and the anti-terrorism law since they all contain provisions defining acts of terrorism.</p>

<p>Egypt's path in seeking stability and security after the toppling of two defiant regimes in 2011 and 2013 respectively necessitates the deterrence of those who create chaos and spread terror. However, this should not be done at the expense of the certainty of the rule of law. One should not argue against the approach of the Egyptian authorities in designating a law to help counter terrorism and violence. However, in designating such law, decisions of the SCC as well as fundamental rights and freedoms must be maintained and respected. In fact, the approach of the Egyptian House of Representatives in evading a SCC's ruling to readopt a provision that had been ruled unconstitutional is undoubtedly a stab to the rule of law in Egypt. Likewise, the methodology adopted by the Egyptian authorities in issuing new laws that govern issues already governed by existing laws is likely to create discrepancies in courts regarding which law is to be applicable, which harms the predictability of law and thus, constitutes a threat to the rule of law.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Jillian Blake, an attorney at Blake &amp; Wilson Immigration Law, PLLC, discusses the violation of basic judicial and human rights principle regarding to the creation of the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement office...</p>
<strong>I</strong>n late April the Trump Administration announced the creation of VOICE, or the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement office, which it claims will assist Americans who are victims of crimes perpetrated by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/homeland-security-formally-opening-immigrant-crime-office/2017/04/26/721dc9e0-2a53-11e7-9081-f5405f56d3e4_story.html?utm_term=.133cb1a3c068">immigrants</a>. President Trump has stated that this office is necessary because immigrants are victimizing the US population and those victims are too often <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/28/politics/donald-trump-voice-victim-reporting/">ignored</a>. In reality, immigrants are much less likely to commit crimes than native-born <a href="http://thehill.com/latino/324607-reports-find-that-immigrants-commit-less-crime-than-us-born-citizens">Americans </a>and the cases of those who are accused of crimes are often highly-publicized and used as an example to generate an unfounded fear of all immigrants. Furthermore, immigrants accused of crimes face harsher consequences, and their basic rights are regularly violated in the judicial system.

One of the fundamental principles of the US judicial system is that a criminal defendant is considered innocent until proven guilty in the court of law. This principle is also a human right enshrined in the UN <a href="http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/instree/b1udhr.htm">Declaration of Human Rights</a>. Furthermore, the US Constitution guarantees the right to a “speedy and public trial” for criminal defendants and the right to due process.

Nevertheless, immigrants are often not afforded the presumption innocence. Immigrants accused of crimes are commonly considered guilty before having the chance to defend themselves in criminal court. As immigration enforcement ramps up under President Trump, and he implements programs like VOICE which target immigrants, more and more people will be subject to this unjust system.

After non-citizens are arrested they may be transferred to immigration custody if they are released from criminal custody on their own recognizance or after paying a criminal <a href="https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/immigration-detainers-overview">bond</a>. At this point, they must secure a separate immigration bond from an immigration judge to be released to attend their criminal hearing and defend themselves in criminal court.

The problem with this system is that immigration bonds are much higher than criminal bonds for minor offenses (usually between $5,000 and $20,000). Some immigration judges set high bond or deny bond completely even for misdemeanor charges or suspicion of criminal <a href="http://myattorneyusa.com/storage/upload/files/matters/matter-of-guerra.pdf">behavior</a> [pdf]. In these cases, the accused have no chance to defend themselves in criminal court and are stuck in detention purgatory. They cannot get out of immigration detention because they have not yet been found innocent of the charges against them, but they cannot be found innocent because they cannot get out of immigration detention.

The immigration system must respect the basic judicial and human rights principle of innocence until proven guilty by allowing those in immigration detention to attend their criminal hearings. There should be a clear mechanism by which those accused of crimes can be transferred back to criminal custody from immigration custody so that they can defend themselves in criminal court.

In Virginia where I practice immigration law, only the Commonwealth’s Attorney can issue a writ to bring a defendant back to state custody from immigration custody. If the Commonwealth’s Attorney declines to issue the writ the defendant can be deported before he or she is ever able to defend against charges in criminal court. Ironically, those accused of more serious crimes are more likely to be transferred back to state custody to get their day in court, while those accused of minor crimes are unlikely to warrant the effort of a prosecutor to bring them back to state custody and therefore may never be able to defend themselves.

This system also opens the door to exploitation. If immigrants can be subject to no or high bond detention based on allegations alone, those who wish to abuse or hold power over them can easily use the threat of a false police report. Those who fabricate allegations need not worry because the accused may never have the chance to defend themselves in court before being deported.

The system must change to respect constitutional and human rights. Those accused of crimes do not lose their humanity because of their immigration status, and we shouldn’t lose ours to deny them their most basic rights.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.syr.edu/profile/david-crane1">David M. Crane</a> and <a href="http://www.nccit.org/staff/">Catherine Read</a> discuss the Supreme Court's decision on denying cert in the ACLU's Freedom of Information Act lawsuit... </p>

<p><strong>L</strong>ast Monday, 24 April, it was easy to miss the important news that the Supreme Court denied cert in the ACLU's <a href="https://www.foia.gov/about.html">Freedom of Information Act</a> lawsuit to make public the full Senate Intelligence Committee report on the CIA's use of torture. The news was lost in the frenzied media analysis of Trump's first 100 days, new opinion polls on his performance and a looming possible government shutdown over the border wall.<br />
 <br />
The ACLU is to be commended for their leadership both in this FOIA request, and in the ground-breaking lawsuit <a href="https://www.aclu.org/cases/salim-v-mitchell-lawsuit-against-psychologists-behind-cia-torture-program">Salim v. Mitchell</a>. That suit was brought by torture victims and the family of a man tortured to death by the CIA, and fortunately is moving forward in a Spokane federal court. <br />
 <br />
But this Supreme Court decision on the Senate report is a blow to efforts at accountability for this dark chapter in US history, and bad news for Americans who want open government and transparency. From the declassified but heavily-redacted executive summary that is available, we know that the CIA's interrogation tactics were both more brutal and less effective than was acknowledged publicly. The CIA did not provide oversight at the black sites it maintained, and it lied to Congress and the public about the number of detainees it held and tortured during the period following 9/11. <br />
 <br />
The Supreme Court's denial of public access to the full Senate report means we will be forced to continue wondering how much torture was used, the level of damage it did to the US, and which private entities may have been involved. Most disturbingly, the decision blocks the robust public debate that release of the full report would stimulate. It continues the shielding of responsible officials from any form of accountability, and keeps the American public and our elected leaders from learning lessons from the failed tactics of the past. <br />
 <br />
One of President Obama's final acts in office was to preserve the report under the Presidential Records Act &#8212; a positive step given that many elected officials, including Senate Select Intelligence Committee Chair Richard Burr (R-N.C.), have advocated destroying all classified versions. But this step also meant that the report would remain hidden from the public for at least twelve years, and perhaps much longer. <br />
 <br />
Our current President has, at best, easily-influenced and inconsistent views on torture. President Trump, both while campaigning and even after taking office, has openly supported and endorsed resuming torture, although he has also backtracked on his own statements. His appointment of Deputy CIA Director Gina Haspel, who once oversaw a CIA black site in Thailand and was physically present during torture sessions, further underscores that more information about the torture, rendition and detention program must be revealed. <br />
 <br />
The lack of government transparency and public accountability &#8212; reinforced by this week's Supreme Court decision &#8212; makes the work of organizations pushing for accountability all the more vital. One such initiative worth noting is the recently launched non-governmental North Carolina Commission of Inquiry on Torture (NCCIT). <br />
 <br />
NCCIT was established to investigate and bring about public accountability for the specific role that North Carolina's state and local governments played in supporting the US torture program. The declassified portion of the Senate report's executive summary, as well as independent media investigations, have confirmed that it was a CIA-affiliated company, Aero Contractors, which for several years launched "torture taxi" flights from public airports in Smithfield and Kinston, North Carolina. These flights were dispatched to pick up suspected terrorists abroad and transport them to black sites and third countries, where they were indefinitely detained and tortured. <br />
 <br />
Since 2005, the use of taxpayer-supported state aviation facilities as staging grounds for abduction missions has driven North Carolinians to insist that local and state elected officials investigate and try to halt the "torture taxis." Now, NCCIT has assembled a high-profile panel of policy experts, academics and community leaders who are doing the job that their government refuses to do: hold public hearings to investigate North Carolina's role. The inquiry is probing what elected officials knew, how public resources were used, and &#8212; critically &#8212; who was harmed in the process and therefore deserves acknowledgement and redress. Elected leaders at all levels can use that information to ensure state resources are not further spent on human rights abuses, and to try to right past wrongs. <br />
 <br />
North Carolina citizens have a right to know what role their tax dollars, their elected officials and companies operating in their state played in the US torture program. And this information may be contained within the Senate report that all branches of our federal government apparently think should remain classified. <br />
 <br />
The truth will eventually come out one way or another, and history will be our judge. The real-time question is whether we will have the opportunity to learn from this dark chapter in American history before it is repeated. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://ricardoarredondo.wixsite.com/home">Ricardo Arredondo</a>, a professor at University of Buenos Aires, responds to David Crane's commentary article in respect to the international law on the use of force... </p>

<p><strong>A</strong> few days ago Prof. Crane wrote a very interesting <a href="https://www.jurist.org/forum/2017/04/David-Crane-hardened-humanitarianism.php">article</a> about the international law on the use of force, particularly regarding in situations where mass atrocities are being committed. The article drew particular attention of <em>JURIST</em>'s readers and this is the reason why I would like to share some thoughts about Prof. Crane's article with your readership.</p>

<p>Let me start by those topics on which I share my colleague's point of views: a) most of us support the view that international law is a core element of international relations and it should be strengthened rather weakened by international actors. There is also a wide agreement on much of the content of this law, including the objectives and purposes of the UN, whose primary task to maintain international peace and security; b) although, the UN Charter aims to prevent and resolve disputes by peaceful means, it also envisages the possibility of using <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-vii/">force</a>; c) the lack of response from the international community to these mass atrocities, prompted a reaction the UN and other international actors and the principle of Responsibility to Protect (R2P) came out in 2001 and was endorsed by the UN General Assembly in <a href="http://www.responsibilitytoprotect.org/index.php/component/content/article/134-americas/5628-responsibility-to-protect-a-latin-american-perspective">2005</a>. Since then, the UN Secretary General (UNSG) issued eight reports on the subject, where it clarified some of the matters in this highly contested principle. Basically, since its first report it stated that the R2P principle encompasses three different dimensions: (1) the responsibility to prevent; (2) the responsibility to react; and (3) the responsibility to rebuild. The UNSG emphasized the importance and challenges of ensuring timely and decisive responses to the four core crimes covered by the principle. Therefore, one can (and I did in my book and several papers) wish that force will be used in a timely and decisive manner so to prevent or put to an end mass atrocities occurring all over the world.</p>

<p>However, when it comes to the US reaction in Syria I beg to differ with Prof. Crane and I do so as a matter of principle and practice. As a matter of principle, it must be recalled that R2P maintains that the States have an obligation <em>erga omnes</em> to take all measures in their power to prevent or put an end to serious and massive human rights violations as soon as possible. This a collective international responsibility, exercisable by the Security Council authorizing military intervention as a last resort, in the event of genocide and other large-scale killing, ethnic cleansing, and serious violations of international humanitarian law which sovereign governments had proved powerless or unwilling to prevent. This is so because the necessity of a timely and decisive response is clearly the most controversial aspect of R2P as it opens the possibility of the use of force within the framework of Chapter VII of the UN Charter. In the case of the US Missile Strike on Syria there has not been a UNSC authorization, therefore this use of force, technically, can be labeled, as Russia did, an act of "<a href="http://news.sky.com/story/united-states-launches-missile-strikes-on-syria-10827993">aggression against a sovereign state in violation of international law</a>."</p>

<p>In practical terms, I don't believe that the decision by the Trump administration to launch a missile strike on Syrian military targets in response to the regime's chemical attack in Khan Sheikhoun is a good one. As it has been said <br />
<blockquote>On the one hand, any feeling person would welcome the Syrian regime being constrained from future chemical weapons use against its own people. On the other hand, it is unclear the missile strike will achieve that outcome and could invite unintended consequences that risk US reputation, blood, and <a href="https://www.rand.org/blog/2017/04/withholding-judgment-of-the-us-missile-strike-on-syria.html">treasure</a>.</blockquote></p>

<p>Maybe it is true that rogue States only understand powerful answers. Anyway, I don't share the view that brutal force should be dealt with more use of force and, in any case, that decision should come from the only competent body that can authorize the use of force: the UNSC.</p>

		<title>Victims of Rape and Law: How the Laws of the Arab World Protect Rapists, Not Victims</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Mais Haddad, University of Pittsburgh School of Law, discusses laws in Arab countries that protect rapists and further oppress rape victims.... </j:header></p>

<p><strong>I</strong>n the Arab world, women are under systematic discrimination socially, politically and economically. This discrimination is mirrored, deepened and embodied within the Arab countries' legal systems. A quick study of these countries laws is enough to realize that male is the dominant gender and women fall at the bottom of the social hierarchy. Laws that deal with rape are one of many other examples on how women are treated as second class citizens. Even though rape's punishment found in the Arab states criminal codes can be up to life imprisonment and death penalty. However, the problem lies not in the punishment of rape, rather in the burden of proof and the provision that a rapist shall not be prosecuted if he marries the victim. Consequently, these laws are further oppressive on women to come to light and report such crimes. Victims also face pressure and fear from their families and societies as the norms are to shame and stigmatize the victim of rape.</p>

<p>Criminal Codes of <a href="http://www.refworld.org/docid/452524304.html">Iraq</a>, <a href="http://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/ar/sy/sy013ar.pdf">Syria</a> [Arabic] [pdf], <a href="http://www.ilo.org/dyn/natlex/docs/ELECTRONIC/97659/115997/F-671669284/LBY97659 Ara.pdf">Lebanon</a> [Arabic] [pdf], <a href="http://www.ilo.org/dyn/natlex/docs/ELECTRONIC/97659/115997/F-671669284/LBY97659 Ara.pdf">Libya</a> [Arabic] [pdf], <a href="http://gulfmigration.eu/database/legal_module/Kuwait/National Legal Framework/Rights and Obligations/2.1 Penal Law_AR.pdf">Kuwait</a> [Arabic] [pdf], <a href="https://www.unodc.org/res/cld/document/bhr/1976/bahrain_penal_code_html/Bahrain_Penal_Code_1976.pdf">Bahrain</a> [pdf], <a href="http://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/ar/dz/dz027ar.pdf">Algeria</a> [Arabic] [pdf], <a href="http://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/ar/tn/tn030ar.pdf">Tunisia</a> [Arabic] [pdf] and the <a href="http://www.equalitynow.org/content/palestinian-penal-code-no-16-1961">Palestinian Territories</a> provide that if the offender of rape lawfully marries the victim, any action becomes void and any investigation or other procedure is discontinued and, if a sentence has already been passed in respect of such action, then the sentence will be repealed. A unique case is Saudi Arabia where Islamic Law is applied and there is no codified Penal Code and no clear definition of rape. Also, the criminal codes of Sudan and Mauritania have no definition of rape as a crime at all. Further, even though, this provision has been removed from the Criminal Code of <a href="http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/Archive/1999/427/eg11.htm">Egypt</a> since 1999, however, in practice this custom is still widely applied away from the court system. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/24/world/africa/after-debate-moroccan-government-amends-rape-law.html">Morocco</a> revoked the law in 2014 after a 16 year old girl committed suicide when she was forced to marry her rapist. Recently, Jordan succeeded quashing the law in 2017. As <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39692020">Jordan</a> took steps towards abolishing Article 308, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39680838">Lebanese activists</a> were hanging wedding dresses along Beirut's famous sea front, in protest against the Lebanese version of the law. Thus, <a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/12/lebanon-abolish-article-522-rape-marriage-women-rights.html">Lebanon</a> is on the same path with a lot of efforts and hope. Last month, Lebanon's parliamentary committee for administration and justice announced a recommendation to repeal Article 522 of the country's penal code, which allows for suspending the conviction of someone who has raped, kidnapped or committed statutory rape, if he marries the victim. The recommendation must now go through parliament, a process that could still take months. </p>

<p>The logic behind this law is to protect, though not the victim, rather the reputation of the victim in the society where she lives after her honor has been wounded. The honor of a woman is defined by her chastity, and when she is raped she is stigmatized and no longer marriageable. Hence, a marriage to her rapist is perceived as a solution to this problem and an exit from shame that is suitable to the society. This way her family needs not to feel dishonored or, in many cases, the need to seek vengeance-honor crime. Therefore, better than leaving girls shamed, unmarriageable and dishonored or to be killed by their families or relatives the law protects the girls by forcing attackers to marry them. As a result, such legal system legitimizes rape if it was followed by marriage, rewards the rapist and, in fact, allows him to continue his act. Also, the law ignores any redress for the victim, which should be the aim of the law at the first place. Further, it gets its legitimacy from the concept of shame, and prioritizes wrongful social customs over principles of protecting women and their right, as citizens and humans, to live safely with the protection of law and society.  </p>

<p>Further judicial drawback to already troubling laws regarding rape is the burden of proof. For a rape conviction to actually be handed down, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Qatar and Mauritania laws mandate either a confession from the rapist or a witness account from four adult males. One must pause here and imagine the circumstances of which a woman is being raped and four adult male are witnessing this crime. In all cases, with neither of those things readily available, along with laws that make extramarital sex illegal, women reporting rape are likely to find themselves as the subject of criminal investigation and often, actually, sentenced. The result is the victims often don't report rape, fearing they will be tried for adultery. In the <a href="http://mironline.ca/burden-proof-sexual-assault-laws-uae/">UAE </a>in many cases, foreign women who are in a tourism vacation in Dubai, not knowing of these laws ended up being arrested after they went to the police to report they had been raped. In Saudi Arabia a victim known as '<a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/15836746/ns/world_news-mideast_n_africa/t/rape-case-calls-saudi-legal-system-question/#.WQUo18b9lPY">Girl of Qatif</a>' was gang-raped by seven men. At her 2006 Trial, she was sentenced to 90 lashes for being alone in a car with a man to whom she was not married. The rape was not established in the trial and it could not be proved. There were no witnesses and the men had recanted confessions they made during interrogation, and the verdict cannot be appealed.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the burden of proof in rape cases before the court and the provision of solving the problem of rape by marring the victim to her rapist among many other violations of women's rights found in the Arab states' legal systems, such as honor killing, child marriage and martial rape, reveal the level of cultural, social, political and legal failure these states have. A small success here and there of changing or revoking a certain articles and provisions is far away from what needs to be achieved. The amount of work to be done in order to revolutionize the way society and law perceives women and end the highest levels of female objectification are tremendous. Unfortunately, the Arab states do not seem to be on the right track at the first place. In fact, the recent unfortunate developments even show set back of what has been already little for women rights, especially with the ongoing instability and armed conflicts in the region and the clear rise of extremism over modernity.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.pattersonslist.com.au/index.php?option=com_comprofiler&task=userProfile&user=262&Itemid=520">Greg Barns</a>, Lecturer in Jurisprudence RMIT University (Melbourne, Australia) and <a href="https://www.lawyersalliance.com.au/about-us/about-us/anna-talbot">Anna Talbot</a>, Legal and Policy Adviser Australian Lawyers Alliance discuss the human rights of unwell asylum seekers at the refugee facility on Manus Island... </p>

<p><strong>O</strong>n April 30th, the National Court of Papua New Guinea <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/04/30/deportation-of-injured-manus-asylum-seeker-blocked_a_22062966/">granted</a> an urgent request for an injunction to prevent Lebanese asylum seeker Azzam el Cheikh from being forcibly deported by the Australian and PNG governments and returned to the homeland he fled in 2013. <correction num=1>Mr. el Sheikh has suffered serious physical and mental mistreatment, and at least one doctor in Port Moresby has declared him unfit to travel.</correction><br />
 <br />
Mr. el Cheikh and his case raises an important moral and legal issue - should Australia be party to forcibly deporting individuals who are demonstrably not fit to travel?<br />
 <br />
Mr. el Cheikh had resisted deportation on two previous occasions. According to Behrouz Boochani, an Iranian asylum seeker, Mr. el Cheikh suffered injuries and was placed in a filthy jail cell on Manus Island before being taken to Port Moresby last week.  "He was seriously hurt on his neck, back and hand and they put him in Lorengau police station. This man has been on a hunger strike in the past few days," Mr. Boochani <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/04/03/manus-asylum-seeker-facing-deportation-begs-turnbull-for-help-in_a_22024751/">told</a> the media on April 4. <br />
 <br />
Sources who have spoken to us in the last fortnight said that on April 29 Mr. el Cheikh was declared medically unfit for travel. He has been denied pain killers and the conditions he endured at the Lorengau prison on Manus Island were horrific &#8212 he had no change of clothes, was denied a shower for about three weeks and his cell walls were smeared with feces.<br />
 <br />
To deport a person when they are physically and mentally exhausted and injured is cruel. Irrespective of whether or not the individual might face political persecution on return, it is morally reprehensible for a so-called civilized nation like Australia to force a person to travel when their health is fragile.<br />
 <br />
Unfortunately, Australia has a history when it comes to this form of cruelty. Back in 2007 a <a href="">report</a> from researchers at La Trobe University and the Hotham Mission in Melbourne found that "in some cases the Australian government has pursued removal outcomes with a serious disregard for the health and wellbeing of removes...In particular, there has been a lack of concern for the welfare of asylum seekers who are facing removal despite suffering a serious illness."<br />
 <br />
Forcible deportation of asylum seekers is a decision made by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, without regard to the individual's circumstances. There is no provision in the Migration Act, or any departmental rules or protocols, that ensure an independent assessment of the individual's current health or access to care and basic necessities in the country to which he or she is being deported. This was not always the case. As Glenn Nicholls from Swinburne University and the author of a 2007 book on Australia's deportation policy notes, the conservative government led by Prime Minister Robert Menzies in 1958 introduced such a protection. The Immigration Minister in that government noted at the time; "The deportation powers are formidable and capable of abuse. Therefore, it is the duty of the Department to inform the Minister as fully as it is reasonably possible about the facts, and related circumstances, of each case." Today the formidable powers remain, while this essential protection is gone.<br />
 <br />
Besides the moral issues at stake, there is also Australia's obligation under international law to consider. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention Against Torture (CAT) prohibit subjecting a person to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The Refugee Convention and the CAT further prevent the deportation of a person if they would be in danger of being persecuted or subjected to torture in the country they are deported to.<br />
 <br />
Australia might argue that it is PNG, not Australia, that has obligations in relation to the asylum seekers Australia has sent to Manus Island. This is clearly false. The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs recently <a href="http://apo.org.au/node/76077">found</a> in no uncertain terms that Australia is liable for the safety of asylum seekers in PNG (and Nauru). Australia cannot evade its responsibilities by tricky manipulation of international borders or contractual terms. Australia is calling the shots and Australia must adhere to the most fundamental moral obligation to treat sick people with dignity. Instead, however, it has ordered the deportation of a seriously ill man with no concern for his health or Australia's legal obligations toward him. In doing so, it is complicit in cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and likely breaching obligations under international law to ensure deportations do not give rise to a risk of persecution or torture.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Royal F. Oakes of discusses the recent firing of FBI Director James Comey and its implications for wider investigations into the Trump administration... </p>

                <p><strong>T</strong>he Comey affair is shaping up to be a brass knuckle, brazenly partisan showdown that could turn into a Trump administration Armageddon.</p>

                <p>The two sides couldn't be more different. The Trump perspective is: you've had a year, there is no smoking gun, let's move on. We've all put up with a dysfunctional FBI Director who tore up the rule book and is more concerned with his gastrointestinal upset than doing his job. On the other hand, the loyal opposition is convinced this is Watergate all over again, and is prepared to fight the war on numerous fronts:  ensuring that Comey's replacement won't be a Trump puppet; vigorous investigations by the Senate and House Intelligence Committees; continued aggressive pursuit of the FBI's look into possible collusion with Russia; and last but possibly not least, good old-fashioned litigation.</p>

                <p>The lesson of how powerful a well-placed lawsuit can be has not been lost on the Democrats in the first hundred days of the Trump administration. Time and again, Trump's executive regulations have been thwarted by litigation that led to federal judges <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/federal-appeals-court-declines-to-reinstate-immigration-order.php">issuing</a> <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/justice-department-appeals-court-injunction-on-travel-ban.php">national injunctions</a> against the travel ban, and more recently, <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/federal-judge-blocks-defunding-of-sanctuary-cities.php">sanctuary city rules</a>.</p>

                <p>What's all that have to do with the Comey affair, you ask? After all, the consensus emerged immediately that the FBI Director is an "at-will employee," subject to termination at the discretion of the President. Well, again, Democrats may take a page from the Watergate playbook. After President Nixon's administration fired Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox, that termination was challenged in court, by a congressman. Watergate judge Gerhard Gesell <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-02-21/news/9303183515_1_judge-gesell-iran-contra-pentagon-papers">ruled</a> the firing was illegal. Cox refused to try to step back into the job, but his successor, Leon Jaworski, was a burr under Nixon's saddle.</p>

                <p>It's true, the court found the termination of a Special Prosecutor required demonstration of cause, but don't be surprised if Democrats take the position that whereas the president has lots of discretion in terminating an at-will employee, there are some things you can't get away with, like obstructing justice. The charge will be that Trump was running scared, that he heard Comey recently wanted more money for the Russian investigation, that Comey's people had recently served subpoenas on Gen. Flynn's subordinates, and so the firing was motivated by a desire to prevent a lawful investigation.</p>

                <p>On the other hand, the president can point to the fact the FBI itself confirmed this week that Comey had <a href="https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2017/05/10/comeys-late-misstep-erroneous-testimony-about-huma-abedins-emails/">provided erroneous testimony</a> in his recent statements before a Senate panel about Hillary Clinton's aide Huma Abedin's handling of classified emails. On May 9, the FBI <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/fbi-issues-clarification-comey-testimony-huma-abedin-emails-n757071">sent a letter</a> to the Senate Judiciary Committee clarifying part of that testimony. Comey had said Abedin forwarded hundreds of thousands of emails to her husband. In fact, only a few chains of emails were involved.</p>

                <p>But the way Trump fired Comey didn't do the president any favors. His Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, was supposed to be out of the loop, having <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/sessions-recuses-himself-from-russia-hacking-probes.php">recused himself</a>, but he was involved in the process of delivering the Department of Justice message to the president that they recommended Comey's firing. And now, it appears Sessions will be involved in the process of selecting Comey's replacement. Plus, why the abrupt firing? Was it necessary for Comey to learn about his termination when a big screen behind his back during a talk in Los Angeles blared the announcement, leading to him <a href="http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/good-news/james-comey-thought-news-of-his-firing-was-a-joke/vi-BBAZp4z">comment</a> that this was a "pretty good" joke?</p>

                <p>And the coup de grace was the bizarre insertion by the president in the termination letter of <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/trump-fires-fbi-director-comey.php">the comment</a> that, I sure "appreciate the fact that you three times assured me I wasn't under investigation." Perhaps the president thought that without that line, people might say, "he fired the director because he was afraid of an investigation." Inserting the language only threw gasoline on the fire.</p>

                <p>Another example of cognitive dissonance is Trump's firing of somebody who, let's face it, did him two huge favors last year. The FBI rule is, we don't talk about investigations. But because Comey thought that his own Department of Justice couldn't be trusted to be fair and objective about the case against Hillary Clinton, he felt he had to break the rules and <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/fbi-will-not-recommend-hillary-clinton-be-charged-in-e-mail-scandal.php">give a lengthy lecture</a> about how guilty Hillary Clinton was - although at the end of the speech, it was, "nothing to see here, folks, return to your homes." Then, the second famous favor by Comey to Trump was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/apps/g/page/politics/oct-28-fbi-letter-to-congressional-leaders-on-clinton-email-investigation/2113/">the October 28 surprise</a>, the reopening of the investigation in, shall we say, a highly public way, only to be shut down days later, after irreparable damage had been done to the Clinton campaign.</p>

                <p>So given the fact that the president is perceived as being focused on one thing, namely, is somebody a friend of mine, it's pretty strange that he would fire this guy.</p>

                <p>So, the scene will soon shift to the investigations in the Congressional committees. The goal of Democrats will be to find someone in Trump-world who feels the screws tightening regarding allegations of collusion with Russia, who will flip, and point the finger at bigger fish up the food chain.</p>

                <p>But, the fact is, people have been poking around looking for smoking guns for nearly a year, and it hasn't happened. At the end of the day, evidence of a crime is either out there, or it isn't. Until the tip of the iceberg of alleged evidence of collusion can be seen above the surface of the political ocean, the Democrats' frustration will probably continue. It will be difficult to generate public support, much less congressional support, for aggressive investigations or creative litigation, without the American public having something to latch onto, in terms of concrete evidence of collusion.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Oday T. Mahmood, an S.J.D. candidate for 2019 at the <a href="http://law.pitt.edu/">University of Pittsburgh School of Law</a> discusses needed legal and constitutional reforms in Iraq post Islamic State... </j:header></p>

<p><strong>I</strong>n 2014, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) seized three large cities in Iraq which were Anbar, Salah al-Din and Mosul. In fact, the fall of these cities posed a threat to the entire territory of Iraq, prompting the U.S. to form an international coalition to support Iraqi forces and combat the militants. Currently, military reports in Iraq show that there has been noticeable progress toward the liberation of cities under the control of ISIS. Salah al-Din has been completely liberated, as well as almost 95% of Anbar in western Iraq. Furthermore, the military efforts have led to the liberation of 90% of Mosul in the north of Iraq. These Military achievements must be reinforced by legal reforms which will prevent the justification of an oppressive presence of any extremist force which will work to the detriment of the Iraqi people in future. These reforms should be conducted in two phases: the amendment of the constitution and the obtainment of support for the establishment of a strong constitutional court. These reforms are aimed towards achieving political, security and economic stability in Iraq. </p>

<p>The current <a href="http://www.iraqinationality.gov.iq/attach/iraqi_constitution.pdf">constitution</a> [PDF] was drafted in a rush over the course of less than five months because the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) wanted the transfer of power to the Iraqis as soon as possible after the fulfillment of the <a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/iraq/tal.htm">Transitional Administrative Law of 2004</a>. In addition, the political and religious groups insisted that this constitution should be drafted and developed by representatives of the Iraqi people. As a matter of national urgency, elections for the National Assembly of Iraq were held on January 30, 2005. Soon thereafter, in May 2005, a committee entrusted with the drafting of the constitution was formed, and a <a href="http://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3362&context=facpub">referendum</a> held in October 2005. In this process, the drafters detected several defects in the constitution which lead to the enactment of Article 142, which opened the door for future constitutional amendments. The draft of the constitution was rejected by the province of Salah al-Din and Anbar, and it was accepted in Mosul, but 55.08 percent of people <a href="http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4211&context=flr">did not approve</a> of the constitution. Subsequently, the constitution was signed anyway in accordance with the rules of the democratic game. As a result, the cycle of violence in Iraq is, in part, constitutional because it did not receive the consent of all major national communities. Ironically, the cities that rejected the constitution in 2005 are the same cities which were occupied by ISIS in 2014. Thus, we can recognize the importance of maintaining a balance between the popular legitimacy and the derived legal positions to ensure solidarity between the Iraqi government and Iraqi people.</p>

<p>Article 142 states that the Council of Representatives shall establish a committee from among its members which will reflect the diversity of the Iraqi population in order to provide the Council of Representatives with a report containing the suggestions for necessary amendments to the constitution. The circumstances in which the constitution was created, showed completely different attitude among the populace compared to the current situation, in terms of the desire of the liberated population to coordinate more closely with the central government, after confirming that this cooperation is an important step towards stability in Iraq. Therefore, the enactment of the amendments must be accelerated to take advantage of this momentum. Even if the Council of Representatives has reached an advanced stage of designing the amendments, it is necessary to move on to the process of their promulgation in order to guarantee the political, security and economic stability of Iraq. The process of amending the constitution must be carried out by a technical committee comprised of jurists specialized in constitutional law and political science, as well as members of the Iraqi Council of Representative. </p>

<p>The second important point in the process of legal reforms is to obtain support for and strengthen the Federal Supreme Court (FSC), which has the exclusive authority to interpret the constitution and to review the constitutionality of laws. Despite Article 89 of the constitution of 2005 which asserted the need for the enactment of a law regulating the work of the Federal Court, the Iraqi Parliament has not yet succeeded in the promulgation of such a law. In any case, the enactment of a law that is compatible with the spirit of the current constitution is necessary. Currently, the FSC applies a law which was enacted before the current constitution came into force. This is a clear stain on the legitimacy of the court, which operates under the provisions of a pre-constitution law. This will certainly affect the legal situation in Iraq, which will, in turn, affect other factors such as undermining legal status, various rights and freedoms of its people.</p>

<p>The activation of the constitution through the revival of its articles is an important step in the correct direction. Introducing constitutional amendments is an important step towards accommodating the people who initially opposed the constitution.  The more the rule of law is accepted by those subjected to the provisions of the constitution, the bigger the chances are of the successful implementation of any legislative act. In addition, the judiciary branch is a cornerstone of the democratic system which ensures the executive and legislative commitment to the constitution as well as the effectiveness of the law in line with ongoing developments within the country, which restrain political parties and ensure the sovereignty of law.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist, Roy S. Gutterman, of School of Public Communications at Syracuse University discusses the implications of late-night television political satire and the effect of FCC regulation on the First Amendment...</p><strong>S</strong>ince the election late-night TV show hosts have been making a killing at the expense of the Trump administration. But new <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) Chairman, <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/about/leadership/ajit-pai">Ajit Pai</a>, intimated recently that at least one host might have to actually pay, via a possible FCC fine.</p>

<p>	Chairman Pai recently went on the interview circuit, <a href="http://video.foxnews.com/v/5422150343001/?#sp=show-clips">responding to complaints</a> [video] about a series of jokes made by Stephen Colbert on the May 1, 2017 episode of <a href="http://www.cbs.com/shows/the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert/">"The Late Show."</a> CBS, which broadcasts the late-night show, bleeped the audio and blurred the comedian's mouth to obscure the profanity. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaHwlSTqA7s&feature=youtu.be">The jokes, which had sexual connotations</a> [video], may have been crude and offensive, perhaps even profane or indecent, to some viewers; others may have found them funny, political and highly partisan.<br />
 <br />
	Pai seemed to embrace the complaints of those who were offended. <a href="http://nyc.podcast.play.it/media/d0/d0/d1/dE/dT/d5/dO/1ET5O_3.MP3?show=The%20TJ%20Show&category=Music&callsign=WODSFM&market=Boston&awCollectionId=985&awEpisodeId=774040&listeningSessionID=590b0f47029abd5f_1135111_UmkkuCiE__0000000NFvd">He said the FCC will adhere to Supreme Court precedent</a> [audio] in the matter, but also said there may be an investigation. The FCC, within its regulatory powers, could eventually fine the network or affiliates for allowing the profanity to be broadcast.</p>

<p>However, even a cursory reading of Supreme Court precedent or FCC policies on broadcast indecency demonstrates that any action against CBS and Colbert would not only be inappropriate but would likely violate the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a>. The Supreme Court ruled on the government's authority to regulate television and radio broadcasters through licensing, which requires broadcasters to adhere to certain standards, especially with outright legal prohibitions on broadcasting legally obscene material. But there is more room for broadcasting indecent or profane content.  </p>

<p>The so-called "safe harbor hours," as articulated by the Supreme Court in <u><a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/438/726/case.html">FCC v. Pacifica</a></u> allow broadcasters to air more risqué content between 10 PM and 6 AM. Ostensibly these are hours when children will not be in front of televisions or radios. Pacifica involved the daytime radio broadcast of comedian George Carlin's "seven dirty words" routine--in other words, the "words you cannot say" on the air. Over the past 10 years, the Supreme Court has <a href="/forum/2012/06/roy-gutterman-fcc-fox.php">not done too much to clarify the standards for broadcasting</a> [JURIST report] offensive content, issuing two <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9187101700166207966&q=fcc+v.+fox&hl=en&as_sdt=6,31">murky judicial opinions</a> on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2103709062574873617&q=fcc+v.+fox&hl=en&as_sdt=6,31">spontaneous fleeting expletives</a>.</p>

<p>	There was nothing spontaneous about the Colbert jokes &#8212; they were part of a scripted comedic monologue at the beginning of a taped late-night show. The monologue was cleaned up in post-production and Colbert's comments were certainly fleeting.  Beyond that the show was broadcast after 11:30 PM on the east coast, which clearly puts it well within the safe harbor hours.</p>

<p>	When content offends viewers or listeners, there is often no shortage of complainants.  But some of the outrage is illusory, if not manufactured. Back when Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake had their wardrobe malfunction during the 2004 Super Bowl half-time show, the ensuing split-second of partial nudity generated 540,000 complaints. However, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3382567846299347859&q=CBS+CORP.+V+F.C.C&hl=en&as_sdt=6,31">85 percent of the complaints</a> were from forms generated by an interest group and 20 percent were duplicates, meaning outraged viewers complained multiple times.  It took <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2011/11/third-circuit-throws-out-fcc-fine-for-super-bowl-mishap.php">CBS almost eight years of litigation</a> [JURIST report] and appeals to get the $550,000 FCC fine overturned.</p>

<p>	Pai's perceived displeasure with Colbert gives the impression that the FCC exists to censor comedians, especially jokesters who have an agenda against the administration. At this stage it is unclear whether Pai is simply publicly acknowledging a vague group of potentially-aggrieved viewers, even though the law is firmly lined up to favor the broadcaster, or if he is publicly placating the president, who recently elevated him to chairman. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, other regulatory issues are also on the table for modification, including <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/appeals-court-declines-to-reconsider-net-neutrality-decision.php">revamping net neutrality and media conglomeration rules</a> [JURIST report]. There is an irony in this &#8212; as other FCC policy moves toward deregulation, Pai seems eager to expand the type of content that could get a broadcaster in trouble. The FCC is not America's censor and certainly does not exist to punish comedians or broadcasters who adopt anti-administration stances or tell jokes making fun of the president. The regulatory process should at least provide a level of protection, as will the courts. </p>

<p>But the message is clear. Simply investigating a late-night comedy show monologue is enough to chill speech &#8212; a particularly trenchant and important form of speech &#8212; political satire. And that is not funny.</p>

<p>"My decision is not a finding that crimes have been committed or that any prosecution is warranted. I have made no such determination. What I have determined is that based upon the unique circumstances the public interest requires me to place this investigation under the authority of a person who exercises a degree of independence from the normal chain of command,'' Rosenstein added.</p>

<p>Independent counsel Kenneth Starr thought he had <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/icreport/7grounds.htm">"substantial and credible" evidence</a> against President Bill Clinton in 1998. Starr turned over the results of his investigation to the House of Representatives, who then initiated impeachment proceedings. </p>

<p><strong>Evidence of a Cover-up by Trump</strong></p>

<p>As evidence of President Donald Trump's malfeasance emerges, the old adage that the cover-up is worse than the crime may once again prove true.</p>

<p>There is circumstantial evidence of improper contact between members of the Trump administration and Russian operatives during the presidential campaign. At this point, however, we have seen no concrete proof of criminal conduct. </p>

<p>But evidence of a cover-up continues to mount. Trump <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/i-was-going-to-fire-comey-anyway-trump-tells-lester-holt-in-interview-941538371971">has admitted</a> the Russia investigation motivated him to fire FBI director James Comey. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/us/politics/james-comey-trump-flynn-russia-investigation.html?_r=0">asked Comey to end the investigation</a> of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. Trump <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/12/politics/donald-trump-james-comey-threat/">made veiled threats to Comey</a> about possible tapes of their conversations. Trump demanded that Comey pledge loyalty to him, but Comey refused. And Trump defensively fixated on Comey telling him <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/may/10/did-james-comey-tell-donald-trump-three-times-he-i/">three times</a> that Trump was not an object of the investigation. </p>

<p>These acts constitute probable cause that Trump engaged in obstruction of justice and witness tampering. </p>

<p>Both of these crimes are felonies. They are "high crimes and misdemeanors," the constitutional standard for impeachment. </p>

<p>In addition, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-revealed-highly-classified-information-to-russian-foreign-minister-and-ambassador/2017/05/15/530c172a-3960-11e7-9e48-c4f199710b69_story.html?utm_term=.ecbaf6781a4a">according to the Washington Post</a>, Trump revealed "highly classified information" to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Russian ambassador to the US Sergei Kislyak, and Russian reporters. </p>

<p>Although this may not amount to criminal behavior, it could still constitute a high crime and misdemeanor for impeachment purposes.</p>

<p><strong>What are High Crimes and Misdemeanors?</strong></p>

<p>Alexander Hamilton <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed65.asp">wrote in The Federalist No. 65</a> that offenses are impeachable if they <br />
<blockquote>proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.</blockquote></p>

<p>When the president obstructs justice or tampers with a witness, that violates the public trust and injures society's right to the fair administration of justice.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/world/middleeast/israel-trump-classified-intelligence-russia.html">New York Times reported</a> that Trump revealed to Lavrov and Kislyak classified information he learned from Israel. The president does have the power to declassify classified information. But <a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2017/5/17/john_kiriakou_on_blowing_the_whistle">CIA whistleblower John Kiriakou told Democracy Now! </a>that the proper procedure for a president to declassify information is that </p>

<blockquote>it goes back to the CIA, to the originating office. The CIA will pull the relevant information out of the report, put it on a new blank sheet of paper and then type at the top, 'Secret releasable to Russia.' That way, nobody gets in trouble, no sources and methods are revealed, everybody's happy, and we can establish something of a liaison relationship to the Russians. That's not what the president did.</blockquote>

<p>Former CIA director Michael Hayden <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trump-proves-hes-russias-useful-fool/2017/05/16/e1c6b6cc-3a7e-11e7-a058-ddbb23c75d82_story.html?utm_term=.e025088afce4">cautioned in the Washington Post</a>:</p>

<blockquote>The information reportedly derived from another country's intelligence service, so its revelation would have violated the near-sacred third-party rule of intelligence: Information from one country cannot be shared with another without the agreement of the originator. Break that rule often enough and your intelligence begins to dry up.</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, US intelligence officials told the Post that the "disclosures jeopardized a critical source of intelligence on the Islamic State."</p>

<p>Moreover, Hayden noted, "Reportedly, National Security Council staffers were concerned enough about the revelations that they felt compelled to warn the CIA and the National Security Agency. Clearly, someone in government was concerned about potential damage."</p>

<p>Trump's revelation to the Russian officials endangers the future security relationship between the US and one of its allies, which is a significant purveyor of intelligence about the Middle East. That could injure US national security, and thereby, the society itself. Trump "revealed more information to the Russian ambassador than we have shared with our own allies," a US official told the Post.</p>

<p>The Judiciary Committee's impeachment inquiry staff during the Nixon impeachment wrote in 1974 that impeachment "is to be predicated only upon conduct seriously incompatible with . . . the proper performance of constitutional duties of the presidential office." Under the Constitution, the president has a duty to "take Care that the laws be faithfully executed."</p>

<p>There is strong evidence that Trump committed high crimes and misdemeanors to support an impeachment investigation. Mueller will undoubtedly uncover a great deal more. The new special counsel should send the results of his investigation to the House of Representatives, where impeachment proceedings take place. </p>

<p><strong>Obstruction of Justice</strong></p>

<p>The articles of impeachment in the cases of both Nixon and Clinton contained allegations of obstruction of justice.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1505">federal obstruction of justice statute</a> punishes anyone who "corruptly, or by threats or force, or by any threatening letter or communication influences, obstructs, or impedes or endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede . . . the due and proper exercise of the power of inquiry under which any inquiry or investigation is being had by either House, or any committee of either House or any joint committee of the Congress."</p>

<p>A conviction of obstruction of justice requires "acting with an improper purpose, personally or by influencing another." Trump asked Vice President Mike Pence and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/us/politics/james-comey-trump-flynn-russia-investigation.html"> step out of the Oval Office</a> before the president requested that Comey drop the investigation of Flynn. The president didn't want Pence or Sessions to hear what he had to say to Comey. This is evidence that Trump made the request to Comey for an improper purpose.</p>

<p>If Trump did fire Comey because the latter's investigation was getting too close to incriminating Trump, it would be a cover-up, and strong evidence of obstruction of justice.</p>

<p><strong>Witness Tampering </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1512">federal witness tampering statute </a> punishes anyone who "knowingly uses intimidation, threatens, or corruptly persuades another person, or attempts to do so, or engages in misleading conduct toward another person, with intent to influence, delay or prevent the testimony of any person in an official proceeding" </p>

<p>A person also engages in witness tampering if he "otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding, or attempts to do so" or "intentionally harasses another person and thereby hinders, delays, prevents, or dissuades any person from attending or testifying in an official proceeding."</p>

<p>Comey reported that Trump asked him for his loyalty. Although the FBI requires its officials to pledge fealty to the Constitution, not to any individual leader, Trump sought to elicit a personal loyalty oath from the FBI director. This may be evidence of intimidation to prevent Comey from testifying against Trump.</p>

<p>And Trump's veiled threats to Comey about tapes of their conversation, ostensibly to keep Comey quiet, may also amount to witness tampering.</p>

<p><strong>Regulations on Appointment of Special Counsel</strong></p>

<p>The attorney general (AG) has the authority to appoint and remove special counsel to investigate top government officials. The AG exercises power over indictments and other prosecutorial actions. The special counsel remains accountable to the AG, who can block "any investigative or prosecutorial step" he deems "inappropriate or unwarranted."</p>

<p>In March, Attorney General Jeff Sessions <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/us/politics/jeff-sessions-russia-trump-investigation-democrats.html">recused himself</a> from the Russia investigation because during his confirmation hearing, Sessions had failed to disclose contacts he had with Russian officials. Thus the authority to appoint a special independent counsel falls to Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/28/600.1">DOJ regulations</a> call for the appointment of an outside special counsel when (1) a criminal investigation of a person or matter is warranted, (2) the investigation or prosecution of that person or matter by a US Attorney's Office or litigating division of the DOJ would present a conflict of interest for the Department, and (3) under the circumstances it would be in the public interest to appoint an outside Special Counsel to assume responsibility for the matter. When these three conditions are satisfied, the AG must select a special counsel from outside the government.</p>

<p>Mueller, a former government official, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/us/politics/robert-mueller-special-counsel-russia-investigation.html">is expected to resign from his law firm</a> in order to serve as special counsel in this investigation.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist James P. Rudolph</a> discusses the consequences of waiting for North Korea to use its nuclear weapons ... </p>

                <p><strong>N</strong>orth Korea's ambition to acquire nuclear weapons is a threat not only to Asia but to the United States as well. Kim Jong-Un, the despotic and unstable leader of North Korea, appears hell-bent on <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/05/north-korea-missile-test-strains-unification-measures.php">testing, developing and ultimately using nuclear weapons</a> against his neighbors, including our allies Japan and South Korea. In addition, the North Korean leader has threatened to use his weapons against the United States itself. In other words, this appears to be a case in which a reliance on the law of self-defense, which was enshrined in the <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=56815#.WSN7e7Qgc1U">United Nations</a> (UN) Charter, would pass legal muster. Nevertheless, as a fact-driven analysis, certain elements must be present before any kind of anticipatory or preemptive attack occurs.<br />
                    <br />
                    So-called "strict constructionists" of self-defense argue that the law is clear: an attack must already have occurred for the right of self-defense to be triggered. In the case of Kim Jong-Un and North Korea, an attack has not occurred; thus, according to the strict constructionists, the United States would not be justified in relying on a theory of self-defense to attack Pyongyang's missile installations. But these weapons are nuclear weapons, and their destructive power is almost incomprehensible. Is the right of self-defense, and the UN Charter, a "suicide pact," as Abraham Lincoln once suggested of the Constitution during the Civil War? In other words, a strict interpretation of the law could lead us down the path to destruction. It is, therefore, too risky (and irrational) to wait for Kim Jong-Un to attack us or our allies.<br />
                    <br />
                    Anticipatory self-defense requires that the attack be "imminent." Daniel Webster, in the famous <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/11/496/case.html">Caroline case</a>, defined imminence as "instant, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation." With respect to North Korea, this threshold appears not to be met. In other words, unless things have changed radically in the last day or two, the United States appears to have enough time to deliberate, and we apparently are discussing the various means available to us to neutralize the threat. Thus, anticipatory self-defense doesn't seem to apply. This leaves us with one more option: a preemptive strike.<br />
                    <br />
                    According to the qualitative threat school, the legality of a preemptive strike depends on balancing three considerations: (1) the probability that an attack will occur; (2) the availability of non-forcible means; and (3) the magnitude of the harm.<br />
                    <br />
                    Here, in the case of President Trump and his consideration of the use of force against North Korea, the probability of an attack against our allies or the United States itself is in doubt. Certainly classified assessments are being presented to President Trump and his military advisers that spell out in detail what the consensus is within the intelligence community regarding the notion of probability. Obviously, the greater the probability, the greater the chance that a preemptive strike would occur.<br />
                    <br />
                    Second, the availability of non-forcible means is always to be considered &#8211; in all cases of the use of force. Can the United States effectively neutralize the threat of Pyongyang acquiring nuclear weapons by a reliance on diplomacy? Could sanctions and other measures short of war rein in North Korea's leader? US presidents over the years have tried many such measures, and almost all of them have failed. The puerile potentate from Pyongyang hasn't built an impregnable fortress; many of the sanctions that have been applied over the years have delivered an enduring sting. But these sanctions have not deterred Kim Jong-Un from pursuing his holy grail: a nuclearized weapon. In other words, this second consideration &#8211; non-forcible means &#8211; is not determinative.<br />
                    <br />
                    The magnitude of the harm, then, is the dispositive detail when it comes to considering our military options for a preemptive strike. Having Kim Jong-Un as the head of state is itself something that has to be considered. He has demonstrated over the years his immaturity and impetuosity. Allowing this mercurial and manic man to have access to one of the most destructive weapons in the history of the world would, it goes without saying, be destabilizing to our Asian allies and to the United States. This observation doesn't mean that we must, by necessity, take military action to "defang" Kim Jong-Un. But it does mean that the "magnitude of the harm" consideration appears at this point to trump all the other factors. Having a nuclear-armed North Korea is for the international community an unimaginable and understandably intolerable scenario.<br />
                    <br />
                    These considerations, however, are not the only constraints on the use of force. The use of force pursuant to the right of self-defense is, by definition, still a use of force. Thus, it must also satisfy the requirements of necessity and proportionality.  Necessity means that a state can use force for legitimate military objectives &#8211; e.g., securing the submission of the enemy. And proportionality means that a state must refrain from military action if the loss to civilians is excessive in relation to the military advantage. A surgical strike aimed at removing Pyongyang's nuclear weapons likely would pass muster under international law. The doctrine of double effect &#8211; according to which a bad outcome (loss of civilian life) is justified if the act itself is good; a good intent (removing the threat of nuclear weapons) is present; and the good outweighs the bad &#8211; could also conceivably be invoked to justify loss of civilian life in North Korea.<br />
                    <br />
                    But again, any decision regarding a preemptive strike based on self-defense must be predicated on what admittedly is an intensely fact-driven analysis. Our military leaders must be guided by the legal considerations listed here, but we as citizens must also understand that certain classified information to which we are not privy might be the determining factor on which this decision turns. As citizens living in a democratic system, this fact can be frustrating. But there is probably one fact around which consensus can be achieved: a nuclear-armed North Korea is something the world can and must not abide. Implementing this global consensus, however, is why we are between Scylla and Charybdis when it comes to our options, thus making a rock-ribbed reliance on principles is more important than ever.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.eli.org/bios/jay-austin">Jay Austin</a> of the Environmental Law Institute discusses President Trump's recent executive order concerning offshore drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf ... </p><br />
                <strong>E</strong>ven before this week's dramatic events, the topic of "presidential power" had already been trending. There's now an entire <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-100-days-law-school_us_5911cfcbe4b05e1ca201da54?sxq&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=HUFFPOST%20HILL%20050917&utm_content=HUFFPOST%20HILL%20050917+CID_a7fd797f1ad9ae0d8386bcd78460f5a9&utm_source=Email%20marke">law school course</a> devoted to the Trump Administration's first 100 days; the Washington Post produced a regular podcast series titled "<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/can-he-do-that-trump-podcast/">Can He Do That?</a>"; and my own organization, the <a href="https://www.eli.org">Environmental Law Institute</a> [official website], recently assessed the viability of current and proposed executive branch actions in the regulatory arena. Federal court cases on the travel ban and on defunding sanctuary cities have generated enormous attention, and are a reminder that executive orders can be swiftly reviewed where they bump up against constitutional or statutory limits.</p>

                <p>There have been few comparable fireworks so far on energy and environment. <a href="/documents/executiveorders/13771.php">Executive Order 13771</a>, which requires that two existing agency rules be repealed for each new one enacted, prompted an immediate constitutional challenge to its government-wide attempt to remake administrative law. <a href="/documents/executiveorders/13783.php">Executive Order 13783</a> on energy independence revoked some key Obama White House initiatives, including guidance on evaluating the impacts of greenhouse gases and calculating the social cost of carbon - decisions clearly within presidential prerogative, if debatable as policy. But most Trump directives in this area are on a delayed fuse, ordering agencies to "review" existing environmental rules and guidance and "take lawful action to suspend, revise, or rescind" them. Once these directives move beyond the Executive Office of the President, additional statutory layers - notably the <a href="http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/laws/apa.pdf">Administrative Procedure Act</a>[PDF] (APA) and <a href="https://www.fws.gov/r9esnepa/RelatedLegislativeAuthorities/nepa1969.PDF">National Environmental Policy Act</a> [PDF] (NEPA) - govern how (and how fast) the agencies can act, and how their actions can be contested.</p>

                <p>Signed on April 28, <a href="/documents/executiveorders/13795.php">Executive Order 13795</a> on "Implementing an America-First Offshore Energy Strategy" has both explosive and slow-burning aspects. One provision, Section 5, purports to immediately revoke President Obama's withdrawals of offshore Arctic and Atlantic areas from oil and gas leasing under the <a href="https://www.boem.gov/Outer-Continental-Shelf-Lands-Act/">Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act</a> (OCSLA)[PDF]; this unprecedented reversal has already been challenged in court. Other provisions direct the Secretary of the Interior to consider revising the leasing schedule to include annual lease sales in these and other offshore areas (Section 3); to review operating requirements on current lessees (Section 6); and to review, reconsider, and revise or rescind existing final rules on well control and on offshore Arctic drilling (Sections 7 and 11) and a proposed rule on offshore air quality (Section 8). The Order also directs the Secretary of Commerce to refrain from designating or expanding any National Marine Sanctuaries absent an accounting of the area's energy or mineral resource potential and to review all Marine Sanctuaries and Marine National Monuments designated or expanded within the past 10 years (Section 4).</p>

                <p>A coalition of ten environmental and indigenous groups <a href="http://earthjustice.org/sites/default/files/files/Complaint-arctic.pdf">brought suit</a> [PDF] in the District of Alaska to enjoin Section 5 of the Order and reinstate the Obama-era protections, which included 98% of US Arctic waters and a series of Atlantic canyons stretching from Massachusetts to Virginia. Seismic surveys are already moving forward in the Atlantic, making the case ripe for decision. The plaintiffs' legal position is straightforward: OCSLA Section 12(a) provides that the President "may, from time to time, withdraw from disposition any of the unleased lands of the outer Continental Shelf" but makes no provision for revoking a withdrawal. They <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/briefer-on-ocsla-withdrawal-authority_20161121_0.pdf">cite</a> [PDF] a fifty-year string of OCSLA withdrawals, by both Democratic and Republican presidents, that still stand today. Absent express statutory language, they argue, President Trump's action both violates OCSLA and intrudes on Congress' exclusive authority to regulate federal lands under the Constitution's Property Clause. </p>

                <p>This argument parallels the ongoing debate over the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/history/local-law/fhpl_antiact.pdf">Antiquities Act of 1906</a> [PDF], which delegates power to the president to designate national monuments. Presidents of both parties also have invoked this authority to preserve extensive areas, both land-based and marine, and likewise have never attempted to completely revoke a designation (though Congress has done so). National monuments are the subject of another Trump <a href="/documents/executiveorders/13792.php">executive order</a> that, for now, directs Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to conduct a thorough review of monuments created since 1996; any resulting presidential action to revoke or reduce them would almost certainly be litigated. Thus, for both OCSLA withdrawals and national monuments, the answer to the question "Can He Do That?" will likely be provided by a federal court.</p>

                <p>For the offshore energy Order's other provisions, the answer is a qualified "Yes, he can, but only with time, agency resources, public participation, Congressional oversight, and (again) court challenges." To be sure, these presidential directives carry some weight; for example Section 3's call to revise the offshore leasing schedule "to the maximum extent permitted by law" could conceivably lead to drilling in Mid- and South Atlantic areas that are currently off the table. But this would mean reopening the recently approved <a href="https://www.boem.gov/2017-2022-OCS-Oil-and-Gas-Leasing-PFP/">2017-2022 Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program</a> [PDF], a move that faces <a href="https://lowenthal.house.gov/uploadedfiles/ocs-5-11-17.pdf">bipartisan opposition</a> [PDF] in Congress and would require repeating the contentious, years-long public planning process.</p>

                <p>Similarly, Section 7 directs Secretary Zinke to review the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement's <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-04-29/pdf/2016-08921.pdf">2016 rule</a> [PDF] on blowout preventers and well control, a direct response to the disastrous Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and to propose a revised rule "if appropriate and as consistent with law." The oil industry immediately <a href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/us/politics/trump-orders-review-of-safety-rules-created-after-gulf-oil-spill.html?module=subsection_us.politics">applauded</a> this news. But under the APA, applicable requirements for revising this or any final rule include another full notice-and-comment rulemaking, which must produce a "reasoned analysis" - the Supreme Court's <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=759595841034114890">State Farm</a> [opinion] standard - to justify the changes. That could prove to be as arduous as signing the Executive Order was easy, given the long effort and industry input that went into crafting the existing rule. And of course, any revised rule will be subject to judicial review for compliance with procedure and consistency with the authorizing statute.</p>

                <p>Finally, several of the offshore Order's provisions share a characteristic in common with many other Administration actions (including the "two-for-one" and energy independence Orders mentioned above): they emphasize regulation's costs to industry with little or no consideration of the benefits to society as a whole. This is true of the Section 4 accounting of the value of Marine Sanctuaries and Marine National Monuments, which calls for analyzing the "costs of managing" and the "opportunity costs associated with" these protected areas, but not for any analysis of their offsetting benefits for fisheries, recreation, or other ocean services. It's present in the Section 6 mandate to modify operator regulations and financial assurance policies to "minimiz[e] unnecessary regulatory burdens," without any corresponding mention of increased environmental or safety risks. And it's evident in the offhand dismissal, in Sections 9 and 10, of well-documented concerns about the effects of seismic surveying on marine mammal populations. But each of these measures too will ultimately be judged against their respective governing statutes, leaving future litigants room to play plenty more rounds of "Can He Do That?"</p>

		<title>A Darkened Age&#8212;The Rule of Law in Protecting Morality and Humanity</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist, David M. Crane, of Syracuse University School of Law discusses the importance of the rule of law in restoring the ideals of humanity and morality on a global scale...</p><strong>T</strong>here is a growling of a discontent, an unrest, just below the surface, festering ready to erupt into a boil of frustration. The salve of the rule of law diluted or unavailable. The world today shifts to the right or spins helpless, struggling to find an anchor, a safe harbor in which to balance itself. </p>

<p>There is no light towards which we can step towards, hopeful that mankind is moving in a direction that is right and proper. Our kaleidoscopic future looms, where tried and true customs and norms shrink from this new thinking of looking inward and away from a global village that was beginning to change the world stage.</p>

<p>In another context we have been here before. For 50 years we saw a stasis that saw the rise of the dictator. The <a href="https://www2.gwu.edu/~erpapers/teachinger/glossary/cold-war.cfm">Cold War</a> was a desperate time trying to maintain a balance that would avoid Armageddon. Death and destruction by heads of state against their own citizens was rampant, with little checks against internal struggles. Mankind simply looked the other way as long as loyalty towards one side or the other was maintained. Tens of millions perished, disappearing into the sands of time forgotten as if they never existed.</p>

<p>As the Cold War ended there was a sense of optimism that we had changed for the better, the rule of law began to take hold, <a href="http://www.un.org/en/index.html">the UN</a> taking its intended position of <a href="http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/documents/capstone_eng.pdf">guiding the international community</a> [PDF] towards a real peace and security never attained before. Tyranny shrank before this blinding light and dictators faced accountability. The new millennium held promise, more so than any other millennial event. </p>

<p>It all came crashing down with <a href="http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtid=2&psid=3379">the towers on September 11, 2001</a>. A fundamental shift took place, at the time seemingly correct, wrapped in a ragged cloth of righteous fury. But the pain of that day stripped away our innocence, our hope, our desire to build a global village where all mankind would benefit. America turned into itself, seemingly trying to lead, to fight against a new and elusive adversary, yet chasing its tail against itself. American civil liberties were challenged. The world watched and stepped away, subtly looking for other leadership and other ways to survive in a world of struggle with a weakened America, the loss of a land that was a bright and shining light that dimmed, barely visible in the storm of extremism that blew across the world.</p>

<p>To survive nation-states began to look for their own solutions seeking new directions. Major international institutions such as the UN, the <a href="http://www.nato.int/nato-welcome/index.html">North American Treaty Organization</a> (NATO), the <a href="https://europa.eu/european-union/index_en">European Union</a> (EU) and the I<a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/">nternational Criminal Court</a> (ICC) shrank in influence against the onslaught of that extremism. There seemed to be no solutions that were viable. The world wobbling, citizens looked to new political leaders who promised to restore greatness, an elusive idea that cannot be attained alone in this new century. The rise of the nationalistic right a desperate attempt to grasp hold of the fog of this new kaleidoscopic world.</p>

<p>The world is heading into a new darkened age, perhaps to an inevitable conflict of unimaginable dimension. There is little to counter this slide into the dark. Certainly America is no longer that counterweight. An insecure Europe, no longer a meaningful geopolitical entity, cannot step up.  The rule of law is lost in the muddle of hate and the there is a loss of any moral compass, particularly in America. "Nothing matters" replaces "from many one" as America's national motto. In the short and medium term there appears to be no solution. It is hoped that the world will not dissolve while this new global society seeks a new path. </p>

<p>The rule of law must be that path upon which mankind must tread in the long term or we will surely slide down the path into a new darkened age. One has to wonder rhetorically whether <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/binladen/who/bio.html">Osama Bin Laden</a> actually achieved what he set out to do&#8212;see a weakened America fade while western civilization fed upon itself in the moral vacuum left by that America, seeing extremism wrapped in the cloak of Islam causing doubt and fear about the viability of international norms. It remains to be seen. As the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-trump">new American president</a> stumbles about the world, the future does not augur well.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href=https://mckinneylaw.iu.edu/faculty-staff/profile.cfm?Id=541>Mohamed Arafa</a> of Indiana University discusses the new French president, Emmanuel Macron's foreign policy in Muslim and Middle Eastern world ... </p>

<p><strong>E</strong>mmanuel Macron, a 39-year-old and the ex-minister of economics, is now the France's new president after crushing his bitter rival the far-right wing Marine Le Pen in the fight for the presidency and real democracy. This election represents the major win in the entire West of 2017, especially after the win of the United States' current President, Donald Trump. Macron won by around 66% of the polls in France's presidential runoff meaning that the politics of brazen, explicit and unhinged Islamophobia, xenophobia should be soundly defeated. He said that <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/2017/02/frances-long-stalemate-is-on-the-verge-of-a-complete-breakdown/#">France had occasionally made mistakes</a> in unethically targeting Muslims, signifying the country could be less rigorous in applying its values on secularism. In the <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/10/19/french-presidental-hopeful-macron-changes-tone-islam-drops-hard-secularism/">same vein</a>, he said "no religion is a problem in France . . . If the state should be neutral, which is at the heart of secularism, we have a duty to let everybody practice their religion with dignity." </p>

<p>The world observing eagerly after the results of the elections given their consequences on the future of the European Union ("EU") and France's foreign policy in the Arab Muslim World. During his campaign, he emphasized some hints on the policy he might adopt regarding the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, Syria civil war, security and combating terrorism and jihadism internally and externally, especially with major alteration within the relation with Qatar and Saudi Arabia as his agenda seemed like preceding policies but with <a href="http://nypost.com/2017/05/07/frances-next-president-must-first-fight-terrorism/">some adjustments</a>. It is generally well-known that the French President enjoys an essential position in designing the <a href="https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/France_2008.pdf?lang=en">defensive and foreign policy</a>. This is why <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2017/05/08/macrons-foreign-policy-claiming-the-tradition/">some argued</a> that the identity of the Eighth president of the republic will have a conclusive outcome on Paris political and diplomatic choices, specifically that Macron lacks experience in the field of international relations. On the Syrian status quo, Macron wants to "arrange the priorities" and the top one of them is battling the Islamic State ("ISIS/da'esh"). Concerning the Arab-Israeli conflict, Macron's attitude differs from the others since he considers that a rapid acknowledgement of Palestine as a state is unsuccessful. Also, on Turkey, he felt deeply upset and totally disprove the route that Turkey is taking, as he affirmed that he will protect democrats everywhere once he enters Élysée Palace.  President Macron situated himself as a "centrist" endorsing himself as "neither left nor right" after forming his own political movement: <a href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2017/01/31/en-marche-who-is-emmanuel-macron/">En Marche (Forward)</a>! While Le Pen positioned herself as anti-Islam, anti-immigration, anti-European Union, he has taken a faithfully different view. With France's historic and sustained contribution through the Arab world, Macron's perception bears substantial weight on regional issues. In this regard, the <a href="http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/how-did-middle-east-react-macrons-win-998335021">Arab leaders have taken to social media to praise and congratulate Macron</a> for winning France's presidential election. For instance, the Moroccan King, Mohammed VI said this was the "high-point" of Macron's political task. Egyptian President, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, congratulated Macron on his win and spoke of "strong French-Egyptian relations and that he looked forward to working with [him] on "enhancing and developing the close and existing co-operation of the two nations." Also, Macron has previously called France's colonial history in Algeria as a "crime against humanity" and promised to apologize to the country and President Bouteflika, praised his comments and said that this "pioneering attitude" would permit for a reconciliation between France and Algeria. Also, the Tunisian leader congratulated him and said, "the victory reflected the sincerity of the French to its traditional values: liberty, equality, fraternity." A deep look at where Macron stands on the vital matters and strategies relevant to the MENA will be helpful at the current political and historic moment.</p>

<p>On Islam - as the second-largest religion in France today - and recently the troublesome issue of France's brand of secularism, <em>laïcité</em>, is debated. Macron explained that there is no need to amend the law of 1905 which lays down the French secularism basics, even its interpretation is argumentative, the practices are much more peaceful. In this regard, <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/02/emmanuel-macron-struggles-impress-french-muslims-170218192439532.html">he added</a> that "The Republic must allow citizens to fully uphold their convictions, so long as they do not interfere with the beliefs of others or with the rules to which everyone is bound."  He will never ever call for shutting down Muslims from entering France or mosques (other Islamic institutions) to fight what President Trump called "radical Islamic terrorism", as he mentioned during his campaign that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/opinion/i-think-islam-hates-us.html">"Islam hates us"</a> and he <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/12/07/donald-trump-calls-for-total-and-complete-shutdown-of-muslims-entering-the-united-states/?utm_term=.66f588f45a3d">"called for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States . . ."</a> So, probably Macron will adopt the same path adopted by the same young leader of Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, as he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2017/jan/30/justin-trudeau-muslims-quebec-mosque-attack-video">always saying</a> that we are standing for all Muslims [Canadians or not] as an essential part of the Canadian community. Two courses of action Macron will take place on that: first to train <em>imams</em> (religious leaders) in France according to values reliable with the Republic, and within the flexible [moderate] interpretation of Islamic law (<em>Sharie'a</em> spirit) and the main <em>maqasid</em> (objectives) and secondly to fight against the spread of any extreme ideology whether "<em>jihadist</em>" or other, comprising by closing down any worship's place which promotes it. For example, he said on banning of flashy religious symbols in school, given ". . . the law should be maintained, . . . it should not, however, be extended . . . students are adults who are responsible for their actions." On another sensitive issue, which is the <em>burkini</em> prohibition, he argued that it may be justified in some places, for public order's values, as it is important to carry out a political and ideological fights, by expressing that this piece of cloth is opposing the western notion of civility and gender equality, but it is critical to stand up for personal freedoms, especially on freedom of religion if some people select to dress in a certain way, as a sign of tolerance as well of all divine faiths. Macron <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/french-elections-marine-le-pen-emmanuel-macron-burkini-fillon-waste-time-a7641811.html">said</a>, "It's a terrible failure to see police officers on a beach asking a woman, in the name of secularism, to stop wearing a <em>burkini</em>." </p>

<p>Regarding immigration policies and refugee's crisis, Macron underscored that closing national borders would not advance European security or stability. However, he does believe that border security should be increased and intelligence standards should be prioritized and making sure that immigration laws are balanced and well-framed. Moreover, he sees immigration, particularly the welcoming of foreign scholars and students from the MENA region among others, as "a source of good fortune and pride," as he makes no indication of amending the current legislation and anticipates endorsing better settings for integrating foreigners. On admitting refugees, he claimed that France needs to bear its responsibility and places the issue at the heart of a collective European effort and calls for "tighter and more efficient border controls" along with "the combatting of terrorist organizations and criminal networks", [with a] balance and sensible allocation of refugees among the EU countries, as asylum reform - on his agenda - is intended to "speeding up" the process. He <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/772288/Emmanuel-Macron-Europe-faces-unstoppable-mass-migration-says-French-PM-hopeful">praised Germany's open arms policy toward refugees</a>, as it kept Europe's joint and united dignity, as he strongly defended Chancellor Angela Merkel - who he met recently in Berlin as a first official visit after his inauguration - against criticism echoing, "Nothing is more wrong than (the) abject simplifications" made by folks who say that "by opening the borders to migrants, the chancellor exposed Europe to severe dangers."  </p>

<p>On terrorism, and the fight against the radical network organizations, Macron said that ISIS and <em>al-Q'aeda</em> represent the strategic challenge for France. Thus, it is important to understand why there are 'breeding grounds' in France, and why we are responsible for them." Therefore, the query of terrorism is placed at the crossroads of a political, economic, social, cultural, and religious fight. Terrorism hence is not only seen as an external threat but as an issue imposing the country to confront the fact that our community, our economy has produced <a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2017/05/08/france-macrons-election-victory-will-discrimination-against-the-muslims-continue/">anomie</a>, a sense of segregation, individual fates that have pushed certain individuals to commit those atrocities, and that Islamist fanatical ideology would not have such a hold on young French people if the Republic had not left some of its young behind. In other words, focusing on the problem's roots instead of its symptoms (security and policy failures). </p>

<p>On the Syrian conflict, and after the alleged chemical attack in Syria, Macron called for international military intervention against Syrian dictator al-Assad, if it is proven that his government was responsible for that attack and that intrusion should be under the auspices of the United Nations - where Russia holds the <em>Veto</em> power. He affirms that "the veto right must be framed with precision for cases concerning verified risks of mass crimes." Generally, he believes that ousting the Assad's regime should not be "a prerequisite for every decision," and totally refusing to allow America and Russia, which are deeply polarized on the issue, decide the Syrian's fate, so his middle-of-the-road policy would suddenly contrast with Hollande's open support of the rebellion as well as the call for national dialogue. On the collaboration with the Gulf Cooperation Council ("GCC"), one possibility is that Macron's pro-business and pro-globalization plans will benefit GCC countries. His presidency questions the French and Saudi relations, unlike the foreign policy of his predecessors, as he states that France should involve talks with [both] Iran and Saudi Arabia without interfering in their power games. Neglecting Iran's national policies would be "an error" which would destabilize France's power, so it would be a mistake to show unnecessary support by advocating thoughtful dialogue with the two regional powers. Of course, this comprise taking a rough stand on Iran's nuclear non-proliferation and Iran should respect the 2015 nuclear agreement and guarantees regional stability. Also, when it comes to Saudi Arabia, which should be accountable, sanction's strategies should be imposed if violence and terrorist attacks endorsed by the kingdom. Also, he says France will continue supporting Lebanon, as a historic protectorate of France. He said nothing about Egypt, but within colonialism and Algeria, he called France's - as a defender of humanism - that colonial actions in Algeria "genuinely barbaric and constitute a part of France's past, that needs to be confronted and apologized for." </p>

<p>Concerning Turkey, Macron pointed out that within the current situation, the basics for Turkey to join the EU have noticeably not been met, and current changes in the country do not stand well for positive consequences, without shutting the door on Turkey. As for Libya, he will work on fixing the refugee crisis, with Europe, and to curb the human, drug, and weapon trafficking that is triggering such intolerable catastrophes throughout the Mediterranean. On Israel-Palestine's dispute, mostly he will stick to the principle of a two-state solution, and would not unilaterally recognize Palestine as a state, as this may cause harm and instability to the French Israeli relations and would serve nothing. So, his government and diplomatic efforts will focus on that Israel's security is a fixed principle as is the legitimacy of the Palestinian state and will look for conditions for a permanent peace and stability to allow the two states to exist in a peaceful manner. President Macron's explicit foreign policy views are still largely unidentified, but his realism, pragmatism and pro-European and globalization attitudes would result in a productive, constructive, and responsible Middle Eastern policy. It is not too far, let's watch and see!</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Surya Rajkumar of <a href="https://www.jgu.edu.in/">O.P. Jindal Global University</a>, discusses the prospects of relief for victims of violence in the Kashmir dispute ...</j:header></p>

<p><strong>O</strong>n the 1st of May 2017, the <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-mutilates-bodies-of-two-indian-soldiers-army-vows-revenge/story-MuI5fTZdmRyavJNnAqwlPI.html">mutilated bodies</a> of two personnel of the Indian Border Security Force were found in the disputed Line of Control (LoC) area in Jammu and Kashmir, India.  In a press release, the Indian Army <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/indian-soldiers-mutilated-pakistan-army-attackers-crossed-loc-army-chief-reaches-srinagar-as-india-vows-response-4636308/">held</a> the Border Action Team of the Pakistani Army responsible for the mutilation. The statement promised an "appropriate" response to such a "despicable act." Further, the defense minister said "such attacks don't even take place during war, let alone peace...the sacrifice of these soldiers will not go in vain." While acts such as these have been responded to through demarch&eacutes, military aggression or even war, justice is never gained for the families of the victims of such acts through the Indian government's recourse. Thus, an approach to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) was <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/168/19442.pdf">considered</a> but, India invoking this option would pave the way for the internationalization of the Kashmir dispute.  In this light, this article seeks to explain why India cannot take this matter to the International Court of Justice and even if it does, the ICJ can afford no relief.</p>

<p><strong>Instances of Mutilation and Suspected Perpetrators</strong></p>

<p>Mutilation is not new to the conflict along the LoC. In May 1999, six soldiers were <a href="http://www.news18.com/news/india/pak-brutality-again-when-bodies-of-indian-soldiers-were-mutilated-1388553.html">held captive</a> by the Pakistani Army, tortured for weeks and, finally, killed and handed over to India. In a conspicuous and outrageous violation of the Geneva Convention, the soldiers' ear drums were pierced with hot iron rods, eyes punctured and genitals cut off. The autopsy of the bodies also revealed that they were burned with cigarettes butts, their limbs were chopped off, teeth broken and skulls fractured during the torture. Even their nose and lips were cut off. However, the Indian Government refused to move the ICJ on this matter. In June 2008, a soldier who lost his way was captured by a Pakistani Border Action Team (BAT) and his body was <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pakistan-mutilates-two-bodies-of-indian-soldiers-despicable-act-says-army/article18346667.ece">found</a> beheaded a few days later. Additionally, in January 2013 and October 2016, mutilated bodies of Indian soldiers were <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pakistan-mutilates-two-bodies-of-indian-soldiers-despicable-act-says-army/article18346667.ece">found</a> along the LoC. Pakistan's governmental response has been uniform in such instances - they "categorically" deny any involvement. Whilst the claim that Pakistani troop's involvement in such incidents comes from the Indian government as well as the Indian media, no international media house has held <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-39776074">Pakistan accountable</a> or even <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-pakistan-idUSKBN17X1L9">acknowledged</a> the involvement of Pakistan in such incidents of mutilation. Thus, it becomes critical to examine the evidence to indentify the perpetrators of such attacks. The Indian government has not presented any concrete evidence as regards Pakistani involvement vis-&agrave-vis the latest incident. However, previous instances of mutilation suggest likely Pakistani involvement. </p>

<p>The 1999 incident saw the Pakistani army giving the mutilated bodies of the Indian soldiers, clearly indicating some involvement. Subsequent incidents have had autopsy reports to prove mutilation. As regards the perpetrators in such attacks, there exist two possibilities: one is the Pakistani Army and the other is militants in the Kashmir valley. In the latest instance of mutilation, the act took place <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/indian-soldiers-mutilated-pakistan-army-attackers-crossed-loc-army-chief-reaches-srinagar-as-india-vows-response-4636308/">during shelling</a> and exchanges of fire between Indian and Pakistani forces. As such, only Pakistani troops were present at the time of this latest barbaric act. Similar patterns of events exist in all of these instances of mutilation. It might be argued that the evidence required to prove Pakistani involvement needs to be stronger, which lies at the root of the demand for the intervention of the ICJ. The ICJ could provide a credible and unbiased investigation and gathering evidence to determine the perpetrators and accord justice to the deceased. Moreover, ICJ intervention seems desirable because it is unlikely that the outcome would prove anything contradictory to India's claims. However, even if an investigation is conducted and the Pakistan Army held accountable, the perpetrators cannot be brought to justice. </p>

<p><strong>International Law and Applicability</strong></p>

<p>Both India and Pakistan are state parties to the Geneva conventions. As per Article 2 of the <a href="https://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/publications/icrc-002-0173.pdf">Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War</a>, the convention is applicable because there is an armed conflict between two High Contracting parties which are India and Pakistan. Since all instances of mutilations have seen Indian soldiers as victims in the Pakistan Army's hands, as per Article 4A(1) of the same convention, those mutilated can be classified as prisoners of war. Most importantly, Article 13 of the convention mandates the humane treatment of prisoners. It states "no prisoner of war may be subjected to physical mutilation" and doing so will be a serious breach of the conventions. With respect to the May 1999 mutilation, the Pakistani Army has blatantly violated the aforementioned articles by mutilating the bodies of soldiers.</p>

<p>However, even if Pakistani involvement were proven in the International Court of Justice, the conduct could not be prosecuted. This is because the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/jurisdiction/?p1=5&p2=1&p3=3&code=PK">jurisdiction of the ICJ</a> does not apply to Pakistan in cases of armed conflict. This indemnity for armed conflicts also <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/jurisdiction/?p1=5&p2=1&p3=3&code=IN">applies to India</a>. The indemnity is offered by the optional jurisdiction declarations signed by the two countries respectively. Thus even the grossest form of violation of international humanitarian law is beyond the jurisdiction of the ICJ in cases of armed conflicts between India and Pakistan. Further, even if India approaches the ICJ at the cost of internationalizing the Kashmir issue, the exercise would be futile because of the optional jurisdiction clause. The Indian government invoked this jurisdictional immunity in the Atlantique incident, <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?sum=585&p1=3&p2=3&case=119&p3=5"><span class="casename">Case Concerning the Aerial Incident of 10 August 1999 (Pakistan v. India)</span></a>, in which the Indian Air Force shot down an unarmed Pakistani military patrol aircraft carrying 16 young trainee cadets near the international border at Kutch. The ICJ upheld the Commonwealth reservation and dismissed the case brought by Pakistan against India. </p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>The demand for taking cases of mutilation accelerated after India was able to stay the execution of its national Kulbhushan Jadhav, <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/168/19442.pdf"><span class="casename">Jadhav Case (India v. Pakistan)</span></a>, through an order from the ICJ. This cannot apply to the cases of mutilation for two reasons: 1) whereas the Jadhav case involved questions on the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, the mutilation cases relate to the Geneva Convention and 2) whereas there was no armed conflict in the Jadhav case, all mutilations happened in the course of an armed conflict. The third Geneva Convention only applies to cases of war and armed conflict, both of which are exceptions to India and Pakistan through the optional jurisdiction declarations of the ICJ signed by the two countries respectively. The optional jurisdiction declarations legitimize the violation of the third Geneva Convention. Thus, for true justice to be done for the members of the families of those who were martyred through mutilation, India and Pakistan will have to withdraw their optional jurisdiction of the ICJ and comply with original jurisdiction with ex post facto effect. This, however, seems a utopian idea and unlikely to occur in the foreseeable future.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href=http://law.pitt.edu/academics/foreign-lawyers/sjd-degree>Ohud Ali. Alzahrani</a> of the University of Pittsburgh discusses the overdue abolition of a long held guardianship system for the women in Saudi Arabia ... </j:header> </p>

<p><strong>W</strong>omen have recently gained some rights in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (referred to hereafter as KSA). Currently, the women of Saudi Arabia do not have full independent freedom from the guardianship requirement. However, in a great step forward, the king Salman ibn Abdul-Aziz has approved several documents that provide conditions under which <a href="http://www.alarabiya.net/ar/saudi-today/2017/05/04/الملك-سلمان-يوجه-بإتاحة-الخدمات-للمرأة-دون-موافقة-ولي-الأمر.html">adult women do not need a man as a guardian</a> [in Arabic] in accordance with a royal decree passed in April 2017. These are provisions not specifically designated under Islamic law. It should be noted that the abolished provisions were not under Islamic law, but rather they were accumulated via previous tribes' generations. This represents a significant step towards the independence of women.</p>

<p>To fully understand the problems posed by the guardianship system as it currently stands in KSA, it is imperative that the practices of the guardianship system are understood. In the most basic form, the guardianship system employed in KSA relies on the consent of a guardian for decisions in relation to various life events for a woman. In this regard, <em>Wali</em> is the term referring to the man who acts as a guardian for a woman. Accordingly, who may be eligible to hold a guardianship? <a href="https://islamqa.info/ar/150788">The succession of common guardianship</a> for an unmarried woman in KSA would start with her father, and default to her brothers, sons, uncles, or grandfathers respectively in the event that a relationship previously in the chain does not exist. Once a woman is married, the guardianship is transferred to a woman's husband. In the event of a divorce or widow, a once-married woman's guardianship would refer back to the original chain of succession, with primary guardianship determined by a <a href="http://www.alriyadh.com/822961">judge based on her best interests</a> [in Arabic]. In some cases, a woman may have the right to <a href="http://okaz.com.sa/article/573316/">transfer the guardianship to a judge</a> [in Arabic] if her guardian prevents her from marriage by refusing to sign her marriage contract. As the marriage contract is an obligation under Islamic law, without it, the marriage will be null and void. Marriage is an important issue in regards to the debate on guardianship of women because this is a condition that is included under Islamic provisions.</p>

<p>The recent developments made by the king's resolution have now created a <a href="http://okaz.com.sa/article/1544591/محليات/تمكين-المرأة-السعودية-من-الخدمات-دون-موافقة-ولي-الأمر">series of conditions</a> [in Arabic] under which a woman does not need a guardian: enrolling in higher education for some universities, receiving treatment at hospitals, procuring jobs, conducting bank processes, renting homes and apartments, receiving issuance of a commercial register, managing financial transactions such as the purchase and sale of real estate, receiving issuance and renewal of national identification documents, interacting with government departments, and raising cases in court.  </p>

<p>However, for some other procedures, a woman still has to have her guardian sign off to provide permission for issues such as the following: matters relating issuance and renewal of passports, receipt of travel permits outside the country including for scholarships (study abroad), marriage, and release from prison. Notably, the king has already brought these conditions to the <a href="https://arabic.cnn.com/middle-east/2017/05/04/saudi-king-salman-women-human-rights">Council of Ministers</a> [in Arabic] for review to seek approval for a waiver. This decision is still in process, as the cabinet considers how this may affect tribal communities.</p>

<p>One important point should be clearly understood: Some women are significantly suffering from tribulations due to their male guardianship, since not all male guardians are truly fit to hold this responsibility. One such common instance of this would be guardians who are addicted to drugs or likewise. Other circumstances can also arise with guardians that further threaten the deprivation of women's freedom and rights. Such circumstances might be where a brother takes the guardianship of his sister and mother after his father's death. Under such a case, severe repercussions could follow if the new guardian is inclined to extort the women at issue. This may take the form of a guardian forcing a woman to forfeit her salary or inheritance to him, threatening that if she does not, he will deny her permission for continued employment, travel, or marriage. This clearly acts against human rights and creates an obstacle for women's full freedom.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.hrw.org/ar/news/2016/07/16/292083">Saudi women activists</a> present many exemplary cases to further advocate for women's freedom. One such example consists of an older woman waiting extensively for her guardian to pick her up or drop her off somewhere. In other cases, (e.g. especially in tribal communities), women may be forbidden from going outside alone, even just to be seen in public without a guardian, due to the belief that women traveling alone invite shame. Also, in cases where a woman's son becomes her guardian due to divorce or widowing, it is considered dishonorable for a woman to beg for permission from her son. Beyond these cases, there are others, remaining unseen. In response, a new campaign has come up with a hashtag used on social media, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-37469860">#Iammyownguardian</a>, accompanied by narratives of oppressed women sharing stories of the miserable circumstances created by their unfit guardians. Thus, the campaign argues that many men are not worthy of the power required of a guardian.</p>

<p>Given the conservatory society in KSA, the new resolving procedures are of course facing multiple challenges. In light of that, is it possible to have these rights for women in the near future? This answer is complicated due to issues presented by tribal communities, where chieftains of various tribes may oppose these rights, alleging that the guardianship right of a man is traditional and therefore cannot be relinquished. This situation is reminiscent of a situation with the former King Abdullah, where he agreed to change the restrictions for woman and driving, but <a href="http://www.alriyadh.com/118992">traditional families and tribes held out</a> [in Arabic]. There is a risk of a similar result happening with the current decision, as it hinges on public approval.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the rights of women from all walks of life in KSA are affected by tribal arguments in favor of guardianships, alleging that it must be followed as under Islamic rules. This is despite the fact that in actuality Islam gives women the same rights and equal status with men. Indeed, the rights of women are outlined in the <a href="http://www.alukah.net/social/0/7093/"><em>Quran</em> and <em>Sunna</em></a> [in Arabic], including mention of education, the right to choose a husband, the right of managing finances, such that a woman can rent, buy, and sell property, as well as many other rights that allow women to exercise their freedoms.</p>

<p>To conclude, women in KSA are glad for the new resolutions that have been issued by King Salman and to be at least working step-by-step to find a way to support women's independence from the oppression created by the guardianship requirement. However, the remaining conditions still under review are at odds with women's rights because they affect many aspects of their lives. Whether women will receive the full rights designated to them in Islam will be determined soon by council decision, with tribal communities opposing based on tradition.</p>

<p>In response to these issues, appropriate measures can and should be taken to combat abuses inherent in the current system. One such proposed action might be in the form of allowing women older than 25 to have a waiver for the guardianship conditions that are not stated under Islamic law. This would include waivers for all of the conditions shared above, except for marriage, which is addressed under Islamic law. This would allow women to be more independent and able to take care of their responsibilities without need for guardianship approval.</p>

<p>Obviously, the KSA has a history of being a conservative country, making efforts to preserve its traditions. During <a href="http://www.alriyadh.com/869870">King Saud's era</a> [in Arabic], when schools for women were first opened, the change was regarded as threatening for families and tribes. Indeed, women's education is not forbidden in Islam, but at that time, women seeking education experienced shame. Yet, once people coexisted with the change for a while, it came to be accepted. As with this example, the issue of guardianship will take some time to change and be fully accepted.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://law.uark.edu/directory/directory-faculty/uid/mkillenb/name/Mark-Killenbeck/">Mark R. Killenbeck</a> of the University of Arkansas School of Law discusses <correction num=1>Alabama's</correction> HB 24 which allows adoption agencies to refuse to place foster children with same-sex couples according to religious beliefs ... </p>
<strong>I</strong>n March 1967, a three-judge district court in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15924296537379594766">Lee v. Macon County Board of Education</a> condemned Alabama's "relentless opposition" to the elimination of its "dual public school system such as that condemned by Brown v. Board of Education." In particular, it rejected a thinly disguised attempt to shift the responsibility for evasion to individual parents, declaring that "[i]t is . . . axiomatic that a state may not induce, encourage or promote private persons to accomplish what it is constitutionally forbidden to accomplish."</p>

<p>	Fifty years later, Alabama is once again trying to "induce, encourage and promote" private acts of discrimination, this time on the basis of sexual orientation and/or gender identification.  The <a href="https://legiscan.com/AL/text/HB24/id/1436343">Alabama Child Placing Agency Inclusion Act </a>(H.B. 24) does not mention these traits.  Nor does it invoke a central tenet in the law of child custody and care in Alabama, the "best interests of the child."  Rather, it speaks simply and repeatedly of the need to protect "sincerely held religious beliefs," invoking as its central legal premise "the inherent, fundamental, and inalienable right to free exercise of religion protected by the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> to the United States Constitution." </p>

<p>	Statutes of this sort have become increasingly popular in response to recent decisions by the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a>, variants on what the late Justice Antonin Scalia characterized as "modest attempt[s] by seemingly tolerant [citizens] to preserve traditional sexual mores against the efforts of a politically powerful minority to revise those mores through the use of laws."  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17758055891258118781">Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 636 (1996) (Scalia, J., dissenting)</a>.  In each instance, religion and religious beliefs were part of the debate.  In <em>Romer</em>, in which the Court invalidated a state constitutional amendment that altered "the legal status of gays and lesbians in the private sphere," the state argued that the contested provision was grounded in "respect" for "the liberties of landlords or employers who have personal or religious objections to homosexuality." In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15714610278411834284">Lawrence v. Texas</a>, which protected the right of same sex adults to engage in private, consensual intimate sexual conduct, the Court noted that religion had been one of the "powerful voices" that "for centuries" had "condemned homosexual conduct as immoral." And in<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf"> Obergefell v. Hodges</a>, Justice Kennedy acknowledged the power and pervasiveness of religious objections to same-sex marriage, declaring that "religions, and those who adhere to religious doctrines, may continue to advocate with utmost, sincere conviction that, by divine precepts, same-sex marriage should not be condoned."</p>

<p>	None of the religious claims prevailed.  That may have reflected how the cases were litigated.  More likely, it tracked an historical reluctance to sanction religious justifications for invidious discrimination. <em>See</em> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5103666188878568597">Loving v. Virginia</a>, (noting the trial judge declaration that "Almighty God created the races" and "placed them on separate continents," a "fact" that "shows he did not intend for the races to mix"); <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16098434127441351570">Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises</a>, (rejecting as "patently frivolous" the contention that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 "was invalid because it 'contravenes the will of God' and constitutes an interference with 'the free exercise of religion'"); <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17236416104696308723">Bob Jones University v. United States</a>, (an institution whose "sponsors genuinely believe that the Bible forbids interracial dating and marriage" could not qualify for federal tax-exempt status).  I'm confident H.B. 24's champions will object, vehemently, to the suggestion that their deep seated hostility toward LGBT individuals is comparable to their State's past embrace of "the fundamental principles of segregation," at the heart of which was the belief that "[i]ntegration of all human life . . . would destroy humanity."  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15924296537379594766">Lee</a>, n. 16.  Rather, they believe they are promoting an incontrovertible moral good, a reading of the Christian Bible that twice elected - and now twice ejected - Chief Justice Roy Moore characterized as "the principles that right conscience demands," a "steadfast view of homosexuality as an intolerable evil."  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11985948524856605899">Ex parte H.H.</a> (Moore, C.J., concurring).    </p>

<p>	H.B. 24's constitutional legitimacy must then turn on the premise that its embrace of "religious liberty" makes it different.  But it is no accident that Obergefell is carefully couched in terms of "convictions" and "advocacy," as opposed to positive acts of discrimination.  That reflects a largely unknown (at least in the body politic) but doctrinally powerful qualification on the "free exercise of religion":  the belief/conduct dichotomy.  Originally articulated in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1104642225155375579">Reynolds v. United States</a>, belief/conduct was reaffirmed in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10098593029363815472">Employment Division v. Smith</a>, which rejected the notion that free exercise claims would be assessed within the rigors of "strict scrutiny," under which government interest must be "compelling" and the means selected to attain that goal be "the least restrictive available."  The Court has "never held," Justice Scalia stressed, that "an individual's religious beliefs excuse him from compliance with an otherwise valid law prohibiting conduct that the State is free to regulate." That risked "'mak[ing] the professed doctrines of religious belief superior to the law of the land, and in effect to permit every citizen to become a law unto himself.'"</p>

<p>	H.B. 24 accordingly hedges its bets, giving the Free Exercise Clause first billing even as it adds a state-based layer of protection, the <a href="http://law.justia.com/constitution/alabama/CA-170364.html">Alabama Religious Freedom Amendment</a>, which "protects the free exercise of religious rights of Alabama citizens by prohibiting the government from burdening the freedom of religion of a person unless the burden is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and is done in the least restrictive means."  H.B. 24, § 2(8) (citing Ala. Const. of 1901 amend. 622).  That arguably mimics the holding in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5322529599500468186">Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.</a>, in which two companies asserting the "sincere religious belief that life begins at conception" were allowed to "object on religious grounds to providing health insurance that covers methods of birth control that . . . may result in the destruction of an embryo."</p>

<p>	Burwell was not a Free Exercise case.  Rather, it was premised on the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/chapter-21B">Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993</a>, a Congressional decision to limit its own authority by applying "strict scrutiny" to any federal action imposing a "substantial burden on a person's exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability."  <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000bb-1">42 U.S.C. §§ 2000bb-1(a) & (b)</a>.  "By enacting RFRA, Congress went far beyond what this Court has held is constitutionally required."  <em>Burwell</em>, 134 S. Ct. at 2767.  The two companies that brought the case were closely held corporations whose corporate identity (their "personhood," for constitutional purposes) reflected their sincerely held religious beliefs.  H.B. 24 sweeps more broadly, extending its protection to any "individuals [or] organizations" that engage in such activities. Nevertheless, it is difficult to envision a court in Alabama denying protection to an individual or entity professing that their "sincere religious beliefs" bar placements with an LGBT family, given that the only live issue will be whether the belief is sincerely held.  As Justice Alito explained in <em>Burwell</em>, the proper judicial inquiry is whether a government action "imposes a substantial burden on the ability of the objecting parties to conduct business in accordance with their religious beliefs." It is not, he emphasized, the job of the courts, or of government in general, to tell individuals "that their beliefs are flawed."</p>

<p>	All of this assumes that "[t]here is no compelling reason to require a child placing agency to violate its sincerely held religious beliefs in providing any service, since alternative access to the services is equally available."  H.B. 24, § 2(14). But is that, or should it be, the law?  Let's assume the Alabama Supreme Court is willing to let the Alabama legislature tell it what are and are not compelling interests, separating itself from the United States Supreme Court, <em>see</em> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8746804851760570747">City of Boerne v. Flores</a>, and quite likely virtually every other state court of last resort.  Can it possibly be true that the availability of an alternate source of service relieves a business of the obligation to conduct its affairs in compliance with the law?  </p>

<p>	That might be the case if the sole frame of reference is Alabama state law, adjudicated in an Alabama state court.  The people of that state have refused to bar discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in each of the areas tracked by LGBT advocates. But that was certainly not the case for another Alabama entity, the now-closed Ollie's Barbecue, which was unable to resist the strictures of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 under the theory that African Americans could work and eat at other venues.  <em>See</em> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3963649278944272593">Katzenbach v. McClung</a>.  </p>

<p>	The parallel is not an exact one.  <em>Katzenbach</em> involved a statutory claim and my assumption for the limited purposes of this commentary is that the LGBT community now enjoys robust constitutional protection, grounded in "principles of liberty and equality" that "define and protect the rights of gays and lesbians."  <em>Obergefell</em>, 135 S. Ct. at 2604.  Any such claim requires both intent and a state actor.  Which brings us back full circle, to the battle against school segregation.  The intent to discriminate is obvious: H.B. 24's entire purpose is to offer a "religious liberty" shield to individuals and entities who wish to do so.  The involvement of the state, in turn, lies in its role in making that possible.  For these purposes, "[t]he crucial factor is the interplay of governmental and private action, for it is only after the initial exertion of state power . . . that private action takes hold."  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4515566352758049665">NAACP v. Alabama</a>.  And, as I noted at the outset, "'[i]t is . . . axiomatic that a state may not induce, encourage or promote private persons to accomplish what it is constitutionally forbidden to accomplish.'" <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8625683047515139433">Norwood v. Harrison</a>, (quoting <em>Lee</em>).	</p>

<p>	I am not a great fan of <em>Employment Division</em>.  The Free Exercise Clause protects exercise, not simply belief.  The religious liberty statute epidemic of recent years has, however, made me rethink these matters.  I find it impossible to believe that one's sexual orientation or gender identity is pertinent in the vast majority of instances in which such judgments are made, situations when personal moral revulsion about certain types of conduct are invoked as the justifications for denying basic civil rights and liberties to a broad class of people.  These types of claims are especially troubling when "followers of a particular sect enter into a commercial activity as a matter of choice."  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15551538265464303476">United States v. Lee</a>.  In such situations, the logic of belief/conduct is especially compelling: "the limits accept[ed] on . . . conduct as a matter of conscience and faith are not to be superimposed on the statutory schemes which are binding on others in that activity." Individuals whose religions tell them that homosexuality is an abomination are free to believe this.  What they cannot do is enlist the support of the government, via either the federal Free Exercise Clause or its state equivalent, to accomplish what Thomas Jefferson condemned in his <a href="https://www.au.org/files/images/page_photos/jeffersons-letter-to-the.pdf">Letter to the Danbury Baptists</a>: placing their presumed "natural rights in opposition to [their] social duties."   </p>

		<title>Why The NCAA Must Pay Its Student Athletes</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://mbksports.com/team/">Eugene Lee</a> of MBK Sports Management discusses whether NCAA student-athletes should be paid ... </p><br />
                <strong>W</strong>ith the proliferation of billion-dollar television contracts and customized branding opportunities in the age of social media, college athletes are receiving more media exposure and generating more revenues for their programs than ever before.  However, a dichotomy does exist.  While these student-athletes generate millions of dollars for their respective programs, many of them struggle to enjoy the true college experience because they lack the financial means to do so.</p>

                <p>Contrary to popular belief, a full-ride athletic scholarship does not cover the true cost of attending college.  While tuition, room and board and meals are covered, the cost of clothing, travel to and from school and spending money for the weekends are not.  As a result, many of these student-athletes cannot even afford to go to dinner and a movie on a Saturday night.  Further, the time demands of their sport (including practices, after-hours studying of the playbook and travel to and from away games) prevent these student-athletes from picking up part-time jobs for supplemental income.  The stark reality is that a Division I athlete in a high revenue producing sport is employed in a full-time job.  The word &#8220;amateur&#8221; is a hollow misnomer.</p>

                <p>While there is tremendous value in a free education and investment in human capital, due to the extreme disparity between revenues generated for these academic institutions and the bleak financial condition of these student-athletes, payment of a stipend is more than justified.  Universities are making millions of dollars in revenues off these student-athletes not only from television contracts, but from licensing, merchandising and selling jerseys, calendars and photographs containing their numbers, likenesses and names.  It is unconscionable for a university to profit off a player without compensating him or her in some way, shape or form for his or her grant of rights.  While the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4815820716156527385">recent EA Sports ruling</a> [opinion] has prompted the <a href="http://www.ncaa.com">National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)</a> to create trusts for Power 5 conference athletes (including the <a href="http://www.theacc.com">ACC</a>, <a href="http://www.bigten.org">Big Ten</a>, <a href="http://www.secsports.com">SEC</a>, <a href="http://pac-12.com">PAC-12</a>, and <a href="http://www.big12sports.com">Big-12</a> Conferences). This would allow each athlete access to approximately $25,000 once his or her college playing career is over, this measure provides somewhat of an anti-climactic response.  Releasing the escrowed funds after a college athlete&#8217;s playing career does not satisfactorily address the need for financial assistance while he or she is enrolled in school.  It is analogous to throwing a life preserver to a drowning victim after he has gone under.  The student-athlete stipend would provide a real-time solution to these financial concerns.</p>

                <p>In addition to improving the quality of life of these student-athletes, another peripheral benefit of the student-athlete stipend would be to limit or negate the influence of unscrupulous characters and agents.   These underhanded individuals are notorious for preying on student-athletes in need of financial assistance by offering inducements which would ultimately jeopardize that student-athlete&#8217;s eligibility.</p>

                <p>Enactment of the student-athlete stipend would not be without obstacles to implementation.  The primary consideration would be related to equal treatment.  Do universities pay larger stipends to athletes with greater &#8220;star power&#8221; and more prominent jersey sales?  Do universities pay larger stipends to athletes from high revenue generating sports such as football and basketball?  Will universities from larger Power 5 conferences be able to &#8220;outbid&#8221; smaller programs by offering larger stipends to five-star recruits?  Finally, how do universities reconcile the student-athlete stipend with <a href="https://www.dol.gov/oasam/regs/statutes/titleix.htm">Title IX</a> considerations that require equal treatment of male and female student-athletes?  How difficult will it be for the NCAA to police schools and enforce compliance once the student-athlete stipend is enacted and regulations promulgated among member schools?</p>

                <p>	In light of the aforementioned concerns, my proposal would be to pool all revenues generated by a university&#8217;s sports programs into one pot and calculate an equal stipend to be paid across the board to all student-athletes irrespective of the revenues generated by his or her sport.  The goal should be to find a happy medium with the stipend not significant enough to be considered income from a job, but sufficient enough to allow a student-athlete the financial comfort to enjoy the true college experience.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Roy Lee discusses the applications of principles from the Star Wars film series to contemporary issues in international relations...</p>

                <p>In the ever-popular Star Wars series, the Jedi and the Rebel Alliance are pitted against the Sith and the Galactic Empire, <a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/emperor-palpatine-darth-sidious">a dictatorship based on</a> "tyranny, xenophobic hatred of non-humans, power projection through brutal and lethal force, and above all else, constant fear," pretending to be the good guys half the time.</p>

                <p>We intuitively recognize the Rebel Alliance as the good guys and root for them against the Galactic Empire. In the battle between good and evil, most of us would choose good any day, any time.</p>

                <p>Sadly, in the conduct of international relations between democratic states in the 'the West' or the Western Alliance and the not-so-democratic states in the rest of the world, the governments that purport to represent us appear to choose evil much of the time.</p>

                <p>Our governments support and arm dictators until they cease to be convenient, then we overthrow them (e.g. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/26/world/us-secretly-gave-aid-to-iraq-early-in-its-war-against-iran.html?pagewanted=all">Saddam Hussein</a> ). Our governments support democracy and democratic elections until it throws up a party that stands against our short-term interests (<a href="/paperchase/2006/02/international-brief-israel-imposes.php">Hamas in the Palestinian Occupied Territories</a> ). In living memory, our governments provided lists of suspected Communists to an Indonesian dictatorship known to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_mass_killings_of_1965%E2%80%931966.">'disappear' and execute</a> suspected communists without due process. Our governments sell arms to dodgy regimes known to intentionally or recklessly inflict civilian deaths and genocide in armed conflict or foreign occupation (currently Saudi Arabia in Yemen, most recently a reported $100B of arms sales (US); and UK arms sales during the Indonesian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/sep/09/indonesia#E">occupation of and genocide in East Timor</a>). Our governments <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/22/uk-arms-sales-turkey-rights-abuse">license millions of pounds worth of arms sales</a> to Turkey in the midst of a purge of 150,000 civil servants, academics, judges, police and military personnel, <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/erdogan-extends-state-of-emergency-in-turkey.php">most without due process</a> and the arrest of another 50,000 people on the pretext of an attempted coup. No blinking now, even after Erdogan <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/turkey-voters-approve-referendum-to-increase-presidential-powers.php">has engineered a referendum</a> to make himself the new Sultan of Turkey.</p>

                <p>Our governments support and turn a blind eye to regimes that massacre their own citizens or boil them alive because it is in our short-term military and strategic interests to do so (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/09/uzbekistan-british-universities-human-rights-karimov">Uzbekistan</a>). For decades our governments have been actively encouraging our corporations (through Bilateral Investment Agreements, trade deals, trade and investment delegations) to invest and reap profits in pseudo-democracies like Russia and China and definitely-not-democracies <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/22/cooperation-british-spies-gaddafi-libya-revealed-official-papers">like Gaddafi's Libya </a>(including intelligence cooperation and handing over known dissidents ), knowing full well that their citizens face repression and oppression, arbitrary detention, torture and often extra-judicial execution. We now reap the fruits of those policies. All three countries pose strategic and military threats to the West (in the case of Russia, what may be a rebirth of the Cold War).</p>

                <p>What is wrong with investing in countries like Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Australia and New Zealand? Strong, stable democracies that by and large respect human rights. Profits there do not yield enough to keep our shareholders, investors and pension funds sated: no easy money to be gained in those countries. Far more money to be gained in investing in the Wild, Wild East, where weak governance keeps labor and environmental standards and wages, in check, and deals can be done with the elite at the expense of the masses.</p>

                <p>Rex Tillerson, the US Secretary of State, embodies this best, recently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/03/rex-tillerson-america-first-speech-trump-policy">stating that</a> US values are one thing, and its foreign policy another. This was apparently greeted with howls of dismay from State Department officials and many US commentators, but is really nothing new: he simply stated what is at the heart of many Western countries' foreign policies. Whilst we may insist on democratic values, free and fair and elections and basic human rights for ourselves, we selectively choose which countries and which peoples are entitled to the same, depending on convenience, our perceived realpolitik and strategic needs.  In 2004, Anna Politkovskaya wrote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putin%27s_Russia">Putin's Russia</a> documenting war crimes, child rapes and murders committed with impunity by senior Russian army officers in Chechnya, and numerous other abuses committed by state agents in Russia. In 2013, nine years after the book was published, the amount of foreign direct investment into Russia had more <a href="https://www.economic-policy-forum.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Regional-Dimensions-of-FDI-in-Russia.pdf">than quadrupled</a>, much of it originating from EU member states. Sadly, Ms. Politkovskaya was not around in 2014 to chastise Russia for intervening in the Crimea to separate the region from the Ukraine. She was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Anna_Politkovskaya">assassinated </a>in a contract killing ordered by persons unknown two years after she wrote the book. On Putin's birthday. </p>

                <p>These days, I watch with trepidation and a sinking heart moves to hold corporates responsible for human rights breaches. The same trepidation I had in my heart when more than 20 years ago, after writing a mini-book on perestroika and the numerous ills of the Soviet Union, I read all about Western corporations and Western government-led trade delegations rushing to invest in Russia and China, without insisting on any systemic or grassroots changes to establish or strengthen democracy and the rule of law. Any Western aid provided to reform democratic institutions and mechanisms must have failed dismally as in 2013, Russia and China <a href="http://www.eiu.com/Handlers/WhitepaperHandler.ashx?fi=Democracy-index-2014.pdf&mode=wp&campaignid=Democracy0115">sat at </a>132nd and 144th place respectively out of 167 countries worldwide in the Democracy Index.</p>

                <p>Corporate liability for human rights breaches in the Wild, Wild East will keep an army of corporate lawyers, academics, investigators, insurance assessors and public relations advisers employed and busy for decades to come. But what makes people think they can regulate corporate actions taken in far-flung countries where the rule of law is weak, corruption endemic and institutions and witnesses easily corruptible, when countries in the West can barely regulate corporate actions taken in their own jurisdictions (e.g. banking crisis and subprime securities, 2009)?</p>

                <p>And how would holding corporations liable for their actions (or those of their subsidiaries) improve governance in those countries where individuals are purged, imprisoned, tortured or killed by police or State agents for trying to hold their government accountable or simply having and expressing an opinion different from their government's? Here's an uncomfortable home truth: every dollar or pound of foreign direct investment into a repressive country is a dollar of investment in repression and oppression, in the torture and imprisonment of those whose only crime is to exercise their universally recognized human rights, or to be on the wrong side of power. Corporate responsibility for corporate human rights breaches is a fig leaf to lend respectability to funding torture and oppression in despotic countries. The Emperor is naked. Giving him two silk threads to drape around his waist might assuage your conscience, but it sure ain't going to cover him up.</p>

                <p>Who is the Emperor?  In the good old days this was easy: He was the Soviet Union, Communism and sometimes Iran and North Korea, forming the Axis of Evil. These days, Iran and North Korea are still around, but the Soviet Empire and Communism is no more. You have to look a bit harder. But you can still figure it out.  The Emperor is the one who oppresses his people, demonizes minorities, stifles dissent, rigs elections and referenda, imprisons, tortures and 'disappears' dissidents and human rights lawyers and bombs civilians.  The Emperor despises, neuters and dismantles democratic institutions such as a free and independent media, an independent judiciary, and NGOs that do not toe the party line. The Emperor sacrifices the common good (such as preventing human-induced climate change) at the altar of personal revenge or political gain.</p>

                <p>These days there are reputable <a href="https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=DemocracyIndex2016;">international standards</a>, <a href="https://worldjusticeproject.org/our-work/wjp-rule-law-index/wjp-rule-law-index-2016;">indices </a>and <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FH_FITW_Report_2016.pdf">reports</a> that you can use to finger the Emperors and their Galactic Empires. If experts from governments and international NGOs advocating for democracy and human rights got together, I am sure they could come up with universal standards to determine the countries in or to which investments and arms sales should be forbidden (or at least not encouraged). Off-hand, apart from the usual suspects, Iran and North Korea, I would venture that the Galactic Empires are currently Xi's China, Putin's Russia, Erdogan's Turkey, Sisi's Egypt, the King's Saudi Arabia, Duterte's Philippines, and lately, Trump's America, to name but a few.</p>

                <p>How should we in the Rebel Alliance oppose these Galactic Empires? Human rights lawyers and publishers (not to mention dissidents) are disappearing, abused and tortured with impunity in China.  Sanctions against China, anyone?  Once we had courage, and roundly sanctioned South Africa for its apartheid regime. Now we have consumer electronics and only impose sanctions that don't interfere with the supply chain.</p>

                <p>Will we all eventually sing One Belt, One Road (and One Whip), in a Mandarin falsetto? Certainly, I haven't heard many lawyers speak up against OBOR (think of the billions that will flow into law firms from international arbitration, bilateral investment agreements, and trade agreements). Even the proud and snooty EU, champion of democracy and human rights, appears to have omitted any mention of human rights when explaining why it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/15/eu-china-summit-bejing-xi-jinping-belt-and-road">would not endorse</a> China's OBOR. It's as if human rights dropped off a cliff entirely in the face of China's colossal trade surpluses and bank balance. One almost longs for the days of the Soviet Union: we were morally superior because we respected human rights and they did not. Back then we knew who was the Rebel Alliance and who the Galactic Empire; these days I can hardly tell the difference.</p>

                <p>There is a form of willful blindness in constantly cracking down on so-called tax havens, money laundering and corporations that breach human rights abroad. These are all ways of averting our eyes from the elephant in the room. The elephant in the room is that countries in the Wild Wild East (and quite often the Wondrous, Wondrous West) need to strengthen their governance systems, enact good laws and enforce these laws properly. Yet we in the West frequently choose to turn a blind eye to appalling governance, corruption at the highest levels of government, and widespread and well-known abuses of human rights, in the Wild Wild East.  When it suits us. In fact we frequently reward it by encouraging our corporations to invest billions in these countries. The more corrupt, the higher the profit margins. Put a peg on your nose and invest, is the general mantra.</p>

                <p>Can you imagine the Rebel Alliance striking a deal with the Galactic Empire? "We will sell you arms, sign a bilateral investment agreement with you, and encourage our corporations to invest in you, as long as you oppress and attack other settlements and your citizens, but not us." Sounds like the Molotov-Ribbentrop non-aggression pact between Russia and Germany in the Second World War, and we all know how that went.</p>

                <p>UK Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn (the trans-Atlantic equivalent of Bernie Sanders) is right to state that the UK has rubbish foreign policy. I concur and would go one step further. The answer is not simply to leave the Wild, Wild East to sort itself out. It is a principled foreign policy: to forbid or discourage investments, arms sales and non-essential aid to countries that do not meet universally accepted standards of democracy and human rights; to take concrete and well-resourced steps (short of armed intervention or interfering with elections) to foster strong, stable human-rights respecting democratic neighbors all over the word, to make for a safer world. Terrorism festers in and emanates from troubled unstable countries, in oppressive places ruled by naked Emperors, and in Galactic Empires (with no real outlets for democratic expression) often fueled by Western military and <a href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2014/12/15/providing-aid-to-repressive-terrorist-source-countries-does-not-make-the-u-s-any-safer/">other aid</a>. Ponder that fact, and review our policies on trade, investment, aid and arms sales for despotic countries.</p>

                <p>In the language of social media: "This is Luke Skywalker. Be like Luke. Don't be like Darth Vader. Or worse, Jabba the Hutt."</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.utoledo.edu/law/faculty/fulltime/BDavis.html">Benjamin G. Davis</a> of <a href="http://www.utoledo.edu/law/">University of Toledo College of Law</a> discusses the effect the Supreme Court's recent decision to stay parts of President Trump's "Muslim ban" will have on vulnerable refugees...</p><strong>O</strong>n June 26, 2017, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-1436_l6hc.pdf">per curiam opinion</a> granted the US Government's application to stay the "Muslim ban or not" injunctions to the extent that the injunctions prevent enforcement of Section 2(c), effectively barring foreign nationals from seven Muslim majority countries who lack any bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States. What that means, for now, is that if you are just a desperate refugee from one of the seven Muslim majority countries named in the Executive Order who is not physically in the United States &#8212; say a little boy or girl on a boat sinking in the Mediterranean &#8212; you are free to drop dead because the United States through its President's Executive Order and through its highest court has told you that it does not want you here for ninety days (an order I fully expect will be renewed before it expires later this year and before the next term).</p>

<p>The Court's view was that the injunction barred enforcement of the Executive Order against foreign nationals who have no connection to the United States at all. In those cases, denying entry to such a foreign national was said to not burden any American party by reason of that party's relationship with the foreign national. Moreover, they went on to note that the courts below did not conclude that exclusion in such circumstances would impose any legally relevant hardship on the foreign national himself, citing "[a]n unadmitted and nonresident...alien ha[s] no constitutional right of entry to this country." The Court was of the view that whatever burdens may result from enforcement of Section 2(c) against a foreign national who lacks any connection to this country, they are, at a minimum, a good deal less concrete than the hardships identified by the courts below.</p>

<p>If the refugee has no American tie, the Court reasons, their hardships are a good deal less concrete than those resulting from denial of admission when one has a family tie, school admission or job offer for employment.</p>

<p>As an American watching the desperation of the refugees, I find the Court's limitation of the cognizable burden to only those with certain types of relationships problematic. I do not have family, I have not admitted a student, nor have I given a job offer for employment to any of those boys and girls on a boat sinking in the Mediterranean. Yet their distress and that of their families burdens this American significantly. It burdens me as I know the history of the past 14 years at least from the second Iraq War started by the United States <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/18/world/struggle-for-iraq-white-house-memo-remember-weapons-mass-destruction-for-bush.html">under false pretenses</a> and its consequences.</p>

<p>Apparently my relationships with Americans or residents who fear for their families there who are internally displaced persons or refugees would not be enough for this Court. More broadly, reminding us of <a href="https://web.cs.dal.ca/~johnston/poetry/island.html">John Donne's poem</a> (No man is an island...), my relationship with those desperate people through my prayers and faith &#8212; which happens to be Christian but could be any of a series of other religions or humanism &#8212; which calls me to carry their cross is apparently a form of burden on my religious faith that would not be enough for this Court.</p>

<p>What trumps these relationships is the incantation of the national security shibboleth and the Constitutional grant of powers to the President and Congress in a space where the Supreme Court tends to show great deference.</p>

<p>Now some may see the fact that there is a bona fide relationship limitation on the Executive Order as a step away from lockstep deference to the Executive that the concurring justices would have pronounced if they had been the majority. This decision certainly does not give a blank check to the Executive. But, by dismissing the burdens on Americans' other relationships with these desperate people, the decision seems to say that only some types of American relationships with foreigners are good enough. Those other relationships are just some form of insufficient funds, and the Supreme Court has chosen to close the accounts. </p>

<p>Some may say that we should not worry and look forward to this fall. My thought is with the persons who over this period will die who might have been helped if our law would have the kind of compassion that at so many times we have lacked as a country. Might I remind readers of the European Jews <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/us-government-turned-away-thousands-jewish-refugees-fearing-they-were-nazi-spies-180957324/">turned away before World War II</a>, of the Japanese-American internments, of the Muslims brutalized since 9/11, of black lives matter, of the 69 country torture regimes put in place by the United States after 9/11 for which no high-level organizers have been held accountable while low-level soldiers were court-martialed or disciplined, or of death and destruction of Americans and foreigners in the Second War in Iraq started on false pretenses.</p>

<p>After all, the Supreme Court's decision was in equity, and the minimization of the equities with respect to these other relationships of Americans by the Court speaks volumes about what is considered important enough. And, given the hardships these foreign nationals suffer, to dismiss those hardships as not legally relevant does suggest a minimization of the grandeur of the law that does not do justice to American values. Just sayin'.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.law.ua.edu/directory/People/view/Julie_A._Hill">Julie A. Hill</a> of <a href="https://www.law.ua.edu/">The University of Alabama School of Law,</a> discusses the Financial Choice Act and duplicative enforcement of financial regulations ...</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>fter the L.A. Times revealed that <a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/">Wells Fargo</a> employees opened millions of <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-wells-fargo-sale-pressure-20131222-story.html">unauthorized consumer accounts</a>, the bank faced multiple investigations and fines. The <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> (CFPB) fined Wells Fargo a record <a href="http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/092016_cfpb_WFBconsentorder.pdf">$100 million</a>. The <a href="http://www.occ.gov/">Office of the Comptroller of the Currency</a> (OCC) assessed a <a href="https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2016/nr-occ-2016-106a.pdf">$35 million</a> penalty. Wells Fargo paid <a href="http://freepdfhosting.com/29677883a9.pdf">$50 million</a> to the City and County of Los Angeles. All of these penalties are on top of the <a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/about/press/2017/class-action_0421/">$3.2 million</a> Wells Fargo refunded customers and a <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/filelibrary/3034/Settlement-agreement.pdf">$142 million</a> class action settlement. Wells Fargo's <a href="https://www08.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/pdf/about/investor-relations/sec-filings/2017/first-quarter-10q.pdf">SEC filings</a> indicate that it is still facing investigations from "Federal, state and local government agencies, including the United States Department of Justice, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and the United States Department of Labor, and state attorneys general and prosecutors' offices."</p>

<p>While it may be hard to summon much sympathy for a bank that made more than <a href="https://www08.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/pdf/about/press/2016/fourth-quarter-earnings.pdf">$21 billion</a> in 2016 and <a href="http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/092016_cfpb_WFBconsentorder.pdf">incentivized</a> its employees to open phony accounts, Well Fargo's experience illustrates the overlapping structure of banking regulation. Because multiple regulators have jurisdiction over the same conduct, banks can face multiple investigations and multiple punishments for the same conduct.  Federal regulators like the CFPB, the OCC, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the SEC operate independently from one another. Thus, each regulator can make its own evaluation of the bank's conduct and assess its own penalty. </p>

<p>The benefit of overlapping regulatory authority is that a bank's troubling conduct is less likely to escape scrutiny. Even if one regulator is asleep at the switch, other regulators are likely to notice and take corrective action. Indeed, Congress's passage of <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ203/html/PLAW-111publ203.htm">Dodd-Frank Act</a> and creation of the CFPB was <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/the-bureau/creatingthebureau/">motivated in part</a> by a belief that consumer protection had fallen through the regulatory cracks.</p>

<p>But overlapping regulatory authority is not without costs. For regulators, duplicative enforcement efforts drain government resources. For banks, parallel investigations are expensive.  Banks must devote resources to responding to each regulator's request for documents and information.  When regulators discover wrongdoing, it is not uncommon for each to assess its own monetary penalty. Especially in the wake of a financial crisis, no regulator wants to be seen as lax. When each regulator piles on sanctions without regard for punishments imposed by other regulators, banks might be over punished.</p>

<p>Regulators can lessen the cost of overlapping jurisdiction through cooperation and coordination. Dodd-Frank itself instructs the CFPB to <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/5515">coordinate</a> the supervision and examination of very large financial institutions with other banking regulators. The CFPB, OCC, Federal Reserve, and FDIC have <a href="http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201206_CFPB_MOU_Supervisory_Coordination.pdf">entered</a> a memorandum of understanding covering examinations of very large financial institutions. In essence, the regulators agreed to cooperate when monitoring banks for compliance with consumer protection laws.</p>

<p>Curiously once regulators turn their attention from examination to enforcement, the mandate to coordinate and cooperate becomes less clear. The <a href="http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201206_CFPB_MOU_Supervisory_Coordination.pdf">memorandum of understanding</a> does not "limit or modify in any way the CFPB's or any Prudential Regulator's authority to engage in, or bring, supervisory, enforcement, or other actions, under applicable laws or to interpret those laws." </p>

<p>A recent <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Documents/A Financial System.pdf">report</a> by Department of the Treasury recommends that regulators "consider coordinating enforcement actions such that only one regulator leads enforcement related to a single incident or set of facts." However in an administrative environment where authority and independence often equal funding, regulators sometimes have little incentive to cooperate. </p>

<p>Of course, Congress could require that regulators coordinate and cooperate during enforcement matters. Treasury has <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Documents/A Financial System.pdf">recommended</a> "that Congress expand [the <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/Pages/home.aspx">Financial Stability Oversight Counsel's</a> (FSOC)] authority[.]" In particular, Congress could give FSOC "the authority to appoint a lead regulator on any issue on which multiple agencies may have conflicting and overlapping regulatory jurisdiction." </p>

<p>Congressional Republicans have also identified regulatory coordination of enforcement efforts as a priority for reform.  On June 8, 2017, the House of Representatives passed a bill containing a provision requiring regulator cooperation and coordination in enforcement. <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/10/text/eh#toc-H3DCF9913708E44A19B9F36BC96921110">Section 391</a> of the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/10/text/eh">Financial Choice Act of 2017</a> instructs banking regulators to establish "policies and procedures" to "minimize duplication of efforts with other Federal or State authorities when bringing an administrative or judicial action against an individual or entity." It instructs that when more than one regulator has authority to bring an enforcement action, the regulators should "establish a lead agency to avoid duplication of efforts and unnecessary burdens and to ensure consistent enforcement, as necessary and appropriate and in the public interest."</p>

<p>Most commentators (see <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/06/us-house-votes-to-lift-wall-street-constraints.php">here</a>, <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/finance/337004-house-passes-sweeping-bill-to-strip-post-recession-banking-rules">here</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-finance-202/2017/06/07/the-finance-202-democrats-make-choice-not-to-pile-on-big-banks/5936e131e9b69b2fb981dc75/?utm_term=.3506c30ff336">here</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/08/business/dealbook/house-financial-regulations-dodd-frank.html">here</a>, and <a href="http://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2017/06/22/hobsons-choice-the-financial-choice-act-of-2017-and-the-future-of-sec-administrative-enforcement/">here</a>), however, give the Financial Choice Act little chance of passing the Senate. The lengthy legislation, billed by Republicans as the repeal of Dodd-Frank, contains many provisions that are unlikely to gain support from Senate Democrats. Instead, the legislation may be the opening statement in a renewed debate about optimal financial regulation.</p>

<p>While many debates about financial regulation will be politically charged, some reforms should gather bi-partisan support. Regulatory cooperation and coordination in enforcement actions is one of them. Regulators already coordinate examination and monitoring of banks. Regulators also sometime coordinate enforcement efforts. For example, the CFPB, OCC, and Los Angeles officials were all parties to same <a href="http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/092016_cfpb_WFBconsentorder.pdf">consent order</a> covering Wells Fargo's unauthorized accounts. There is little harm then in Congress clarifying that regulatory coordination and cooperation is expected in all bank enforcement actions.</p>

		<title>Disciplining Lawyers for Harassment and Discrimination: A Time for Change</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/profiles/khan-ali.html">L. Ali Khan</a> of the<a href="http://www.washburnlaw.edu/"> Washburn University School of Law</a> discusses the rationale behind some proposed changes to the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct... </p>

<p><strong>T</strong>he American Bar Association (ABA) has <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/publications/youraba/2016/september-2016/aba-adopts-anti-discrimination-rule-8-4-g--at-annual-meeting-in-.html">proposed </a>a model rule to discipline lawyers who in the practice of law harass or discriminate, by speech or conduct, on the basis of race, sex, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status or socioeconomic status. This proposed rule constitutes <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/model_rules_of_professional_conduct_table_of_contents.html">Rule 8.4(g)</a> of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct (the Rule). Since each state drafts its own rules of professional conduct for lawyers, each state is free to adopt with or without amendments, or not to adopt any proposed rule.</p>

<p>This commentary urges state legislatures, state bars, and state supreme courts to seriously consider the adoption of the Rule and reject the misguiding assertions that the proposed rule violates the lawyers' First Amendment rights of free speech, free exercise of religion, and freedom of association. The Nevada Supreme Court has scheduled a public hearing on July 17, 2017 to determine whether Nevada should adopt the Rule.<br />
<strong><br />
Rule's Rationale</strong><br />
As a matter of policy, the Rule assures that the legal profession functions for all participants, including vulnerable groups, such as racial and sexual minorities and persons with disabilities. Inclusion and accountability, rather than exclusion and immunity, are the core values the Rule seeks to protect. </p>

<p>The Rule democratizes access to all persons involved in the legal profession to play their assigned roles without fear of harassment and discrimination. No lawyer --partner or associate, renowned or unknown -- has any constitutional or statutory right in the practice of law to harass clients, witnesses, judges, court officials, support staff at the law firm, or colleagues on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, gender, or any other unlawful classification. Nor does a lawyer have any constitutional or statutory right to engage in unlawful discrimination in the employment of new lawyers and staff. </p>

<p>Furthermore, the Rule affirms that no lawyer is immune from the reach of law and ethics. While a lawyer is responsible for criminal and civil liability arising from harassment and discrimination, the lawyer must also face professional discipline, just as a lawyer faces discipline with respect to other unlawful acts. It is a well-established rule in American jurisprudence that lawyers surrender some (not all) of their First Amendment rights when they choose to practice law. The Rule does not diminish anymore the First Amendment rights of speech, religion, and association as some <a href="http://joshblackman.com/blog/2017/06/22/nevada-should-not-adopt-aba-model-rule-8-4g/">mistakenly argue</a> as they urge states not to adopt the Rule. <br />
<strong><br />
Opposition to the Rule</strong><br />
Although the Rule is drafted with circumspection, and provides the necessary exceptions, some lawyers and lawmakers do not support the rule. Some lawyers fear the Rule is too broad, reaching private speech and conduct. Some argue that conservative lawyers who believe in conventional morality will be accused of discriminating against gays. Some fear potential ethical violations of the Rule if their law firm lacks diversity. Some contend that the Rule promotes political correctness. </p>

<p>According to <a href="http://leg.mt.gov/bills/2017/billhtml/SJ0015.htm">a resolution</a> of the Montana State Legislature, the Rule is "a cultural shift" that must be rejected. It is unclear what Montana lawmakers mean by a cultural shift. Does the Montana Legislature wish to retain the "old culture" under which women, minorities, gays, and persons with disability were excluded from law practice and faced discrimination and harassment in courts and at law firms without legal recourse? Does the Legislature wish to retain the old culture under which senior partners, armed with power and privilege, could without fear of punishment sexually harass young female lawyers at social gatherings and in happy hours after a "tough day" at the firm or in the court? </p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/opinions/opinions/51paxton/op/2016/kp0123.pdf">an opinion</a> [PDF] written in response to a state senator's query, the Attorney General of Texas has falsely concluded that the Rule presents serious constitutional concerns. Texas has already adopted a rule of professional conduct that disciplines lawyers who manifest "bias and prejudice based on race, color, national origin, religion, disability, age, sex, or sexual orientation towards any person involved in (an adjudicatory proceeding) in any capacity." </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Texas Attorney General's opinion is a regretful piece of lawyering. Invoking legal truisms, the Attorney General claims that the Rule is overly broad. However, he does not point out which part of the Rule is over;y broad. Most certainly, "harassment and discrimination" are not as overly broad as "bias and prejudice" found in the Texas rule. If the Attorney General is referring to the "the practice of law" as an overbroad term in the Rule, he should know that <a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/rules/jointappellate/ny-rules-prof-conduct-1200.pdf">a comparable rule</a> in New York, a state with hundreds of thousands lawyers, uses precisely the same term. Other states, which have already adopted anti-harassment and anti-discrimination rule, find no unconstitutionality in using the term "the practice of law." California, another state with hundreds of thousands lawyers, goes even further and prohibits unlawful discrimination in "<a href="https://www.calbar.ca.gov/Portals/0/documents/rules/2015_CaliforniaRulesofProfessionalConduct.pdf">management or operation of a law practice</a>," a much broader term than "the practice of law." The ABA President has correctly <a href="http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/model_rule_defining_harassment_as_professional_misconduct_violates_free_spe">pointed out</a> that the Texas Attorney General is misleading the public and legal community.</p>

<p><strong>Endorsement of the Rule</strong><br />
The Rule is by no means an ABA invention out of the blue. Over the years, many states, both Red and Blue on the political landscape, have adopted tougher comparable rules long before the ABA approved the Rule in 2016. For example, <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/ACO/CourtRulesChapter/12-31-2012.32.pdf">Iowa </a>disciplines its lawyers for sexual harassment and discrimination in "the practice of law." <a href="https://www.in.gov/judiciary/rules/prof_conduct/">Indiana </a>defines misconduct in terms of bias and prejudice in a (lawyer's) "professional capacity" aimed at persons on the basis of "race, gender, religion, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, age, socioeconomic status, or similar factors." <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/ethics/mi/code/MI_CODE.HTM">Michigan</a> disciplines lawyers for "discourteous and disrespectful treatment" in the "legal process." These formulations are much wider in scope and throw a much broader net of misconduct as compared to the ABA Rule. None of these capacious state rules has been declared unconstitutional under the First Amendment. </p>

<p>Note that the ABA <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/publications/youraba/2016/september-2016/aba-adopts-anti-discrimination-rule-8-4-g--at-annual-meeting-in-.html">unanimously approved</a> the Rule after due deliberation, discussion, and scholarly feedback by constitutional experts and ethicists.  The Commission on Disability Rights, Commission on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, Commission on Women in the Profession, and others co-sponsored the Rule. Likewise, numerous ABA committees, including the Standing Committee on Professional Discipline, the Standing Committee on Client Protection, the Standing Committee on Professionalism, and the Center for Professional Responsibility Diversity Committee, and others have endorsed the Rule.</p>

<p>The Rule reaffirms an existing notion that lawyers are not obligated to accept <a href="http://https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_16_declining_or_terminating_representation.html">certain cases</a>. Nor can they be disciplined under the Rule if the alleged harassment or discrimination is unintentional, accidental, or even negligent. A judicial finding of any discriminatory peremptory challenges in the selection of a jury is also exempt from the Rule. There are other safeguards provided in the Rule and Comments so that the practice of law is not divested of vitality.</p>

<p>Under the Rule, lawyers remain free to represent Klansmen, misogynists, gay-bashers, Shariah-critics, religious bigots, and harassers involved in criminal or civil cases, just as lawyers are free to represent murderers, drug dealers, arsonists, terrorists, and Wall Street movers and shakers who commit securities fraud. Access to courts and legal justice is the right of all persons. Lawyers, as the guardians of law, provide the necessary representation to all individuals and businesses regardless of the clients' history, ideology, bias, or prejudice. The Rule does not diminish legitimate advice or advocacy. </p>

<p>In preserving integrity of the legal profession, however, the Rule <a href="http://www.thelegalintelligencer.com/id=1202791379291/Proposed-Amendment-to-Rule-84-How-Will-It-Impact-Diversity-and-Inclusion?slreturn=20170610220329">simply demands</a> that in the practice of law lawyers refrain in their own conduct from harassment and discrimination of women, minorities, persons with disabilities, and other vulnerable persons in the role of clients, witnesses, opposing attorneys, court officials, associates in the law firm, paralegals, and others. Admittedly, the Rule may reach lawyers outside the courtroom including law firm gatherings, ABA meetings, and other law-related functions. This extension of the Rule infuriates a small section of lawyers who believe that the ethics of professional conduct should remain confined to adjudication or dealings with clients. This indignation wrongly believes that being a lawyer is merely wearing a transient cloak in a court of law, and no more. </p>

Maxine Waters </a>of California as to the responsibility of the Opposition in playing a constructive part at this critical moment. The whole of America has a grave responsibility at this moment; for, after all, it is America itself that is on trial in this new form of war. If we lose this war, it is not this or that ephemeral Government but America's institutions that will be condemned, for good and all. I fully realize that this is not an easy Debate. There is much that ought to be said which cannot well be said in public. After watching the G20 these days and not least the closing rebuke of Chancellor Merkel and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/06/us/politics/walter-shaub-office-of-government-ethics-resign.html">the impressive commentary of Mr. Walter Shaub</a>, it seems to me that the whole of recent events--not only in Hamburg, but the <a href="http://time.com/4851412/trump-putin-syria-ceasefire-assad-truce/">whole conduct of the war in Syria</a> and <a href="https://www.carnegie.org/news/articles/negative-sum-destabilization-ukraine/">in the Ukraine</a> as well as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/09/us/politics/trump-russia-kushner-manafort.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=span-ab-top-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news">the Russian sabotage of the American elections</a> right up to date--calls for searching inquiry, not for one stray private sitting, but for a series of private sittings in which all that Americans can contribute of their private knowledge should be put into the common stock and frankly discussed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, even to-day there is plenty that can be said, that ought to be said, and that must be said frankly; for there are no loyalties to-day except to the common cause. Yesterday, as a few days ago, Secretary of State Tillerson gave us <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/07/07/tillerson-says-trump-pressed-putin-on-russian-hacking-but-the-evidence-suggests-not-so-much/?utm_term=.cb0f2e80c762">a reasoned, argumentative case</a> for the President's meeting with the Russian President. President Trump <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/07/09/536291725/trump-says-he-pressed-putin-while-casting-more-doubt-on-election-meddling">demonstrated again a clear failure </a>of will at a crucial moment. It is always possible to see such weakness in a leader after every failure. Spinning what happened in a meeting and leading America at war are not the same thing. Wars are won, not by explanations after the event but by foresight, by clear decision and by swift action. I confess that I did not feel there was one sentence in Secretary of State Tillerson's briefing after the Trump-Putin meeting which suggested that the US Government either foresaw what Russia meant to do, or came to a clear decision when it knew what Russia had done, or acted swiftly or consistently throughout the whole of this lamentable affair. I am not going to discuss the reasons for the actual evasions. They may well have been conclusive in the circumstances. But the circumstances should never have arisen; and it is the story of those events--of the decisions, of the absence of decisions, of the changes of decisions which brought about those circumstances--which call for our inquiry and raise many questions which have yet to be answered.</p>

<p>We were told by Secretary Tillerson that the two Presidents agreed to disagree on the past and looked toward the future. Why was this done? For months we had been aware that the Russians had been cyberhacking the United States elections, destabilizing Ukraine, and acting against some of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/01/us/politics/us-baltic-russia.html">our Eastern European allies like Estonia</a>. It is perfectly true that they spun their story better than we could sort it out. But was there any reason which would make us believe the story that they spun? Obviously the danger was there and develops into actuality at any moment. The President suggests that we could not know which of many sources of the hacking it might be. Surely we had some good reasons for suspecting which one it might be. The DNC e-mails had focused the interest of the whole world on Julian Assange and Wikileaks. A month prior to the election, President Obama's intelligence services <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/10/07/joint-statement-department-homeland-security-and-office-director-national">declared</a>, speaking of the ongoing elections, that the danger to America--from Russia--proverbially "stands upon their very doorstep". The Hillary campaign e-mails affair had before that showed clearly the illegal uses which Russia was prepared to make to tilt our election. What is more, within a few days of that statement Hillary Clinton in a debate decided deliberately to <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/12/12/505261053/13-times-russian-hacking-came-up-in-the-presidential-campaign">challenge Trump over his use of the Russian hacked documents</a>. All the world knew that that was the main theme of her attacks on Trump in the days up to the election. After the elections with the sanctions deliberations of the National Security Council which met, I think, on 29th December, we went on to make t<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/29/us/politics/russia-election-hacking-sanctions.html">he American position perfectly clear</a> to the whole world, including Russia. Then President Obama laid out several sanctions and assured all that we have not yet reached the limit of our effective operations in cyberspace close to the Russians. That was sufficient warning. On that day the sanctions were put in place.</p>

<p>What did we expect to follow? Did we know Putin and his merry men so little as to think that their rejoinder would be slow or half-hearted, or that it would follow the lines of "too little and too late" with which we have been so familiar here? However, it was not a question of a Russian rejoinder at all, but of Russia making our half-hearted intervention an excuse for measures far greater in scope and far more daring than we seem even to have envisaged.</p>

<p>I understand that information as to this reached the Trump transition team as they entered the White House early in January 2017. Was that aspect of the strategic situation considered? Again, it was known everywhere that Putin had designs on Eastern Europe. Was it not obvious that the first stroke must be directed against Ukraine, not only because they were weaker, but because once Putin had seized Crimea, the east of Ukraine was automatically within his power without the need for conquest? I would ask another question: Is it not a fact that the most direct warnings of Russia's designs against Ukraine were sent from both Kiev and during the Ukrainian President's<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/06/20/donald-trump-petro-poroshenko-mike-pence-ukraine/103032910/"> hurried visit to the White House in June</a>? I am afraid that what really happened was that, while he thought he was taking the initiative in the Minsk accords to help save Ukraine, the initiative, such as it was, only coincided with a far more formidable and far better planned initiative of Russia to bring Ukraine into a Russian sphere of influence with American acquiescence. </p>

<p>I remember that many years ago in East Africa a young friend of mine went lion hunting. He secured a sleeping car on the railway and had it detached from the train at a siding near where he expected to find a certain man-eating lion. He went to rest and dream of hunting his lion in the morning. Unfortunately, the lion was out man-hunting that night. He clambered on to the rear of the car, scrabbled open the sliding door, and ate my friend. That is in brief the story of our position in the Minsk accords after the G20. In any case, even if we did not realize that the Russians were acting at the same time, why were we not prepared to meet their inevitable counter-stroke? We had only this weak President Trump, without preparation, with no clear agenda for the meeting with President Putin according to what the National Security Advisor McMaster<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/06/29/mcmaster-trump-to-meet-with-putin-at-the-g-20-summit/?utm_term=.cdf27a3c0695"> has told us</a> with no readiness to counter the Russian backed efforts against Eastern Ukraine. There was no plan to meet the contingency that Russia might seize Eastern Ukraine as well or to meet any really serious attack by Russia on Ukraine or other Eastern European countries. As we know now, the Russian backed forces are active in the Donetsk, and are in readiness for the zero hour when all the Russian forces under guise of the Minsk accords are to strike to regain control of all the Ukraine and afterward Eastern Europe.</p>

<p>In this setting, we have President Trump demonstrating a callow and supine subjugation to his Russian counterpart. Whether in Syria, in the hacking, or in Eastern Europe Trump acquiesced to Putin's strategic initiative with little care for its impact on the US and our democratic allies.</p>

<p>What I would say, however, is this: Just as our peace-time system is unsuitable for war conditions, so does it tend to breed peace-time statesmen who are not too well fitted for the conduct of war. Facility in debate, ability to state a case, caution in advancing an unpopular view, compromise and procrastination are the natural qualities--I might almost say, virtues--of a political leader in time of peace. They are fatal qualities in war. Vision, daring, swiftness and consistency of decision are the very essence of victory. In our normal politics, it is true, the conflict of party did encourage a certain combative spirit. In the last election we found that the most perniciously aggressive of our candidates, candidate Trump, was not only aggressive in words, but was a man of action but action toward what vision? America First or America Alone as we see after the G20. Or America beholden to Putin's schemes.</p>

<p>In recent years the normal weakness of our political life has been accentuated by a coalition based upon no clear political principles. It was in fact begotten of a false alarm as to the disastrous results of Obamacare. It is a coalition which has been living ever since in a twilight atmosphere between Repeal and Replace and between unprepared collective security and unprepared isolation. Surely, for the last 10 years to have bred a band of warrior statesmen would have been little short of a miracle. We have waited for six months watching this new Trump Administration dismantle US leadership and the miracle has not come to pass. Can we afford to wait any longer?</p>

<p>Somehow or other we must get into the Government men and women who can match our enemies in fighting spirit, in daring, in resolution and in thirst for victory. Some 370 years ago, when the United Kingdom House of Parliament found that its troops were being beaten again and again by the dash and daring of the Cavaliers, by Prince Rupert's Cavalry, Oliver Cromwell spoke to John Hampden. In one of his speeches he recounted what he said. It was this: I said to him, 'Your troops are most of them old, decayed serving men and tapsters and such kind of fellows.'...You must get men of a spirit that are likely to go as far as they will go, or you will be beaten still. It may not be easy to find these men. They can be found only by trial and by ruthlessly discarding all who fail and have their failings discovered. We are fighting to-day for our life, for our liberty, for our all; we cannot go on being led as we are by President Trump with his incoherent vision and weakness of spirit in facing the challenges that confront us. I have quoted certain words of Oliver Cromwell. I will quote certain other words. I do it with great reluctance, because I am speaking of a President elected by my fellow Americans many of whom are old friends and associates of mine, but they are words which, I think, are applicable to the present situation. This is what Cromwell said to the Long Parliament when he thought it was no longer fit to conduct the affairs of the nation: You have sat too long here for any good you have been doing. Depart, I say, and let us have done with you. In the name of God, go.</p>

<p>President Trump, In the name of God, Go.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Dhruv Sharma of National Law University, Delhi discusses the tense relationship between India and Pakistan magnified due to recent events ... </p>

                <p><strong>O</strong>n May 8 2017, the President of the International Court of Justice (&#8220;ICJ&#8221;), exercising his powers under Rule of the Court 74(4), forwarded a <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/en/case/168/press-releases">request</a> to the government of Pakistan to &#8220;act in such a way as will enable any order the court may make on this request to have had its appropriate effects.&#8221; This request was made pursuant to India&#8217;s petition before the court to institute proceedings against Pakistan and pass provisional measures to suspend the execution of Mr. Kulbhushan Jadhav, an Indian national, who was captured, tried and sentenced to death by Pakistan on charges of espionage and terrorism.</p>

                <p>India moved to The Hague under Article I of the <a href="http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_2_1963_disputes.pdf">Optional Protocol to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes</a> (&#8220;Optional Protocol&#8221;) which grants compulsory jurisdiction to the ICJ in matters of interpretation of the <a href="http://www.fuech.eu/pdf/viennaconvention.pdf">Vienna Convention on Consular Relations</a> (&#8220;VCCR&#8221; or &#8220;Convention&#8221;). The matter was heard on May 15, 2017, wherein the ICJ was pleased to grant provisional measures in favor of India.</p>

                <p><strong>Background</strong></p>

                <p>Like every other India-Pakistan exchange, two narratives have arisen from the arrest of Mr. Jadhav, with each side preferring one that posits them in good light.</p>

                <p>As per the Indian version of events, Kulbhushan Jadhav is an Indian businessman who retired from the Indian Navy in 2002. He ran his business from Iran and was arrested on the Iran-Pakistan border. Thereafter, he was framed for committing espionage and terror related activities in Balochistan based upon a tutored and doctored confessional video wherein Mr. Jadhav accepted the charges framed against him under immense mental and physical torture. India claims that it has been denied consular access to Mr. Jadhav since his arrest despite numerous requests. India has argued that the continued denial of access to Mr. Jadhav is in breach of Pakistan&#8217;s obligations under the VCCR and India&#8217;s rights under Article 36 of the Convention.</p>

                <p>According to the Pakistani version of events, Kulbhushan Jadhav, a commander-rank navy officer, was arrested by the Pakistan Police in March 2016 on charges of fomenting unrest in Karachi and Balochistan as an agent of the Indian intelligence agency (the Research and Analysis Wing). He was tried and found guilty under section 59 of Pakistan Army Act, 1952 and Section 3 of the Official Secret Act, 1923 by the Field General Court Martial (&#8220;FGCM&#8221;) which consequently awarded him the death penalty on April 10, 2017. To buttress its arguments Pakistan also released a video of Mr. Jadhav&#8217;s confession wherein he admitted to carrying out terror activities in Balochistan. As per Pakistan&#8217;s case, Mr. Jadhav&#8217;s acts preclude any right to consular access to him or his host state.</p>

                <p>The two versions therefore align on the point of lack of consular access. This lack of consular access and the consequent alleged violation of the VCCR was the primary reason for India&#8217;s application before the ICJ against Pakistan.</p>

                <p><strong>Institution of Legal Proceedings</strong></p>

                <p>Failing access to Mr. Jadhav, India moved for an application to the institution of proceedings relying upon the Optional Protocol under Article 36(1) of the<a href="http://legal.un.org/avl/pdf/ha/sicj/icj_statute_e.pdf"> ICJ Statute</a>. An application under Article 36(1) grants jurisdiction to the court based on referral by a state or through specific provision for grant of jurisdiction under the UN Charter or other treaties in force. The application under Article 36(1), instead of Article 36(2), of the ICJ Statute means that India has considerably limited the final scope of its application as it can only realize remedies for lack of access to Mr. Jadhav.  This precludes relief as to validity of the sentence imposed or the eventual release of Mr. Jadhav under international human rights law. However, the application also astutely goes around any objections to compulsory jurisdiction that Pakistan could raise based on its declaration to the court dated March 29, 2017 that limited the scope of the compulsory jurisdiction of the court under Article 36(2).</p>

                <p>In the present case the application for exercise of jurisdiction relies on the violation of Article 36(1) of the VCCR.</p>

                <p>The VCCR, under Article 36(1)(b), provides the arrested person of a foreign state with the right to communicate with his/her consular post without delay. The receiving state is further under a duty to inform the arrested person of the aforesaid right immediately upon his/her arrest. Similarly under Article 36(1)(c) the consular officers of the sending state have the right to visit the arrested national to converse, correspond and arrange for his legal representation. This right continues even after a judgment is passed against such person.</p>

                <p>While we cannot presume Mr. Jadhav knows of his rights Article 36 (1)(b) or the communication of the same by Pakistan to him, India&#8217;s continued attempts and Pakistan&#8217;s express and admitted denial to such access is in violation of at least Article 36(1)(c) of the VCCR.</p>

                <p>Now the violations of the VCCR may be adjudicated by the ICJ in accordance with Article 1 of the Optional Protocol that provides it with jurisdiction over the interpretation of its parent treaty, the VCCR. India and Pakistan ratified the Optional Protocol in 1977 and 1976 respectively and thereby conferred jurisdiction upon the ICJ to interpret their rights and obligations flowing from the VCCR. Put simply, the impending death sentence awarded to Mr. Jadhav combined with alleged violation of rights under Article 36(1) and the conferment of jurisdiction upon the ICJ by both the parties involved could establish a <em>prima facie</em> case for jurisdiction, institution of proceedings against Pakistan and the passing of provisional measures in favor of India.</p>

                <p><strong>Application for Provisional Measures</strong></p>

                <p>Since his arrest in March 2016, India has made numerous failed attempts at gaining consular access to Mr. Jadhav. The continued diplomatic failure combined with growing concerns regarding the well-being of Mr. Jadhav compelled India to move an application before a forum it has not used since 1971. India&#8217;s application for institution of proceedings was interestingly accompanied by a request for grant of provisional measures. The application for provisional measures relied on the &#8220;egregious violations of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations&#8221; through the delayed information regarding Mr. Jadhav&#8217;s incarceration and the subsequent lack of access to him despite repeated requests.</p>

                <p>The grant of provisional measures, while not the court&#8217;s final say in a matter, may still provide time to India to pursue all means to ensure the release of Mr. Jadhav. However the same does not imply final jurisdiction in the matter as was observed by the court in the <em>LaGrand</em> case (Germany v. United States) wherein the court passed an order to stay the impending execution of a Walter LaGrand (the United States, though, never complied with the order). In paragraph 13 of that order, the court specifically observed that:</p>

                <p>&#8220;Whereas, on a request for the indication of provisional measures the court need not, before deciding whether or not to indicate them, finally satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction on the merits of the case, but whereas it may not indicate them unless the provisions invoked by the Applicant appear, <em>prima facie</em>, to afford a basis on which the jurisdiction of the court might be founded.&#8221;</p>

                <p><strong>The Proceedings</strong></p>

                <p>The provisional measures hearings in the Jadhav case were conducted on 15 May 2017.</p>

                <p>India began by reiterating its reliance on Article I of the Optional Protocol to the VCCR and not on Article 36(2) of the ICJ Statute. It relied on the precedent set by the World Court in the case of <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/99/099-19980409-ORD-02-00-EN.pdf"><em>Paraguay v. United States of America</em></a>, the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/104/104-19990303-ORD-01-00-EN.pdf"><em>LaGrand</em> case</a> and the case of <a href="http://http://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/128/128-20030205-ORD-02-00-EN.pdf"><em>Avena and Other Mexican Nationals</em></a> to argue for provisional relief in the form of suspension of death sentence till the pendency of the court proceedings. India argued that despite 17 attempts it was precluded access to Mr. Jadhav in contravention of Article 36(1) of the VCCR. The Indian contingent acknowledged that India and Pakistan had entered into a <a href="https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/No%20Volume/54471/Part/I-54471-08000002804b7dde.pdf">Bilateral Agreement on Consular Access</a> in 2008, however, denied that the same limited the application of the VCCR and argued that it simply supplemented the Convention. India, therefore focused on the immediacy of the request, arguing that considering the impending death sentence awarded to Mr. Jadhav, irreparable injury would be caused to India&#8217;s rights were he to be executed during the pendency of the proceedings.</p>

                <p>Pakistan initiated its arguments with a touch of drama, by attempting to play a video of Mr. Jadhav confessing to his crimes. However, the video was disallowed by the court. Arguments first focused on the lack of jurisdiction enjoyed by the court in the matter considering Pakistan&#8217;s declaration under Article 36(2) of the ICJ Statute and the subsequent bilateral agreement between India and Pakistan that made the VCCR inapplicable in the present case. Pakistan further argued that the Vienna Convention did not apply to individuals involved in espionage and terrorist activities. Finally, Pakistan argued that India had failed to establish that Mr. Jadhav was an Indian national and therefore India lacked any locus in the matter despite the fact that it has in the past claimed that Mr. Jadhav is an Indian spy captured in the Baloch region of Pakistan, and has used the video confession to show his admission of being Indian.</p>

                <p><strong>Order of the Court</strong></p>

                <p>The <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/168/168-20170518-ORD-01-00-EN.pdf">order</a> of the court was delivered on 18 May 2017 wherein the court, as expected, granted provisional measures in favor of India. The court, finding <em>prima facie</em> jurisdiction, found merit in India&#8217;s arguments that the application for provisional measures had been moved under Article I of the Optional Protocol along with Article 36(1) of the ICJ Statute and therefore reservations/declarations made with respect to Article 36(2) were irrelevant. The court similarly satisfied itself of having jurisdiction <em>ratione materiae</em> through the ostensible violation of India&#8217;s right to communicate and have access to Mr. Jadhav as per Article 36(1) of the VCCR. The court found that the VCCR did not exclude its application to individuals suspected of espionage or terrorism and that the 2008 Bilateral Agreement also did not expressly prohibit such right of access.</p>

                <p>Finally as regards the urgency of the proceedings, the court held that despite the opportunities available to Mr. Jadhav to petition or appeal his conviction and sentence, &#8220;the mere fact that Mr. Jadhav is under a death sentence and might be executed is sufficient to demonstrate the urgency.&#8221;</p>

                <p><strong>The Road Ahead</strong></p>

                <p>Since the order on provisional measures, the court has set a timeline for the filing of initial pleadings by India and Pakistan, Pakistan has rejected India&#8217;s 18th attempt at gaining consular access to Mr. Jadhav and, in Pakistan, Mr. Jadhav has allegedly petitioned for clemency.</p>

                <p>While the provisional measures granted in favor of India, based purely on a <em>prima facie</em> establishment of jurisdiction, is a substantial victory in delaying the death sentence, the same does not in any way preclude Pakistan from raising questions of jurisdiction, admissibility and merits of the case in the advanced proceedings.</p>

                <p>Going forward it is likely that the Bilateral Agreement between India and Pakistan on consular access would play a substantial role in ascertaining any violation of India&#8217;s rights. During the time of the arguments for provisional measures, the Bilateral Agreement had not been registered with the Secretariat of the United Nations and technically it could not have been relied upon by Pakistan. However the agreement has since been registered with Registration ID 54471 on May 17, 2017. The subsequent registration raises interesting questions regarding the effect of the delay of around nine years on the registration of Treaties with the Secretariat and whether the court can look into an agreement whose violation has not been argued by the complainant state.</p>

                <p>In a scenario that the court allows for the application of the Bilateral Agreement it will then have to satisfy itself whether an agreement between two countries can in fact limit the application of the VCCR in light of Article 73 that only allows for other agreements &#8220;confirming or supplementing or extending or amplifying the provisions&#8221; of the Convention. Subsequently another inquiry would have to be done on Article VI of the Bilateral Agreement which allows each state to examine an arrest made on political or security grounds on its own merits and therefore potentially deny consular access.</p>

                <p>In conclusion, regardless of the temporary nature of the provisional measures, what transpired on May 15, 2017 would potentially have a long-standing effect on not only the progression of the present case, but also the relationship shared between the countries. For while India has historically attempted to keep the strained relations between the two countries at a bilateral level, this internationalizing of the dispute reflects a definitive break from the past.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Abhishek Trivedi, LLM Faculty of Studies, at South Asian University - New Delhi discusses the implications of the International Court of Justice decision in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case...</j:header> <strong>O</strong>n May 18, 2017 the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/168/168-20170518-ORD-01-00-EN.pdf">order of provisional measures</a> [PDF] was given by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in favor of India in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case between India and Pakistan. Some scholars <a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/kulbhushan-jadhav-case-markandey-katju-criticises-indias-move-to-icj-calls-it-pandoras-box/677718/">have expressed their concerns</a> over the repercussions that India might have to face due to its actions of involving the ICJ in this case. Their concerns are that India has played into Pakistan's hands, and given it a handle to open up many other issues. These critics are confident that Pakistan will be approaching the ICJ to decide the Kashmir issue and it will then hardly lie in India's mouth to object to the jurisdiction of ICJ since India cannot blow hot and cold together.</p>

<p>India's traditional stance has been that all issues with<a href="https://thewire.in/137345/kulbhushan-jadhav-icj-pakistan-media-reaction/"> Pakistan would be resolved bilaterally</a> and the change could give an opening to Pakistan to internationalize the Kashmir issue. Criticizing India's move to the ICJ in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case, Congress said, "the best resolution [to issues] is bilateral at all times, no matter how recalcitrant Pakistan is." Senior CPI member D. Raja said, "This decision has vindicated India's stand in the international community. Pakistan will now have to reconsider its actions and decisions." According to some Pakistani columnists, the case, however, would benefit Pakistan more in the long run, since it is the smaller party. "India had now used a multilateral forum and it can't back away from it tomorrow on similar grounds." </p>

<p>Sushma Swaraj, Minister of External Affairs in India, <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/newsK/politics-and-nation/pakistan-cant-take-kashmir-to-icj-sushma-swaraj/articleshow/59000629.cms">assured that Pakistan</a> could not take the Kashmir issue to the ICJ and asserted that the matter must be resolved bilaterally as the Shimla Agreement and Lahore Declaration on Kashmir are very clear that Kashmir is a bilateral issue, which would only be settled by the two countries. However, it is important to consider the possibilities of ICJ's jurisdiction in the future if Pakistan takes the Kashmir issue to the ICJ. </p>

<p><u>Statute of ICJ and UN Charter: Possibilities of Jurisdiction</u></p>

<p>There are two ways in the <a href="http://">ICJ statute</a> [PDF] under which Pakistan can take the Kashmir issue to the ICJ; one is Article 36 (1) and second is Article 36 (2). As far as Article 36 (2) is concerned, it will be difficult or nearly impossible for Pakistan to bring India before the ICJ on the Kashmir issue, as India has made a declaration on September 18,1974 in which it exempted itself from ICJ jurisdiction in two instances. The first is cases involving two members of the Commonwealth and the second is its multilateral treaty reservation. </p>

<p>Under Article 36 (2) of the statute, Pakistan will also not repeat the same mistakes which it made in <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/119/119-19991119-ORD-01-00-EN.pdf">1999, in the Aerial incident case</a> [PDF] in which the Court found that it had no jurisdiction to entertain the Application of Pakistan under Article 36, paragraph 2, of the statute since Pakistan "is . . . a member of the Commonwealth of Nations," and recently in 2017, in Kulbhushan Jadhav on the issue of provisional measures where the Court rejected Pakistan's arguments relating to jurisdiction based on Article 36 (2) because India did not base this Court's jurisdiction under Article 36 (2) but under Article 36 (1). Pakistan might go to ICJ on the Kashmir issue under Article 36 (1) which reads as follows: "The jurisdiction of the Court comprises all cases which the parties refer to it and all matters specially provided for in the Charter of the United Nations or in treaties and conventions in force." The compulsory jurisdiction of the Court under Article 36 (1) has three dimensions. Jurisdiction exists: (a) In respect of all cases which parties refer to it, (b) In terms of all matters specially provided for in the Charter of the United Nations, or (c) In terms of all matters specially provided for in treaties and conventions in force.</p>

<p>So Pakistan may well approach ICJ jurisdiction under Article 36 (1) if either there is any treaty and convention in force exist between India and Pakistan on the Kashmir issue or otherwise dealing with the issue, or under the provision of the UN Charter. The<a href="http://people.unica.it/annamariabaldussi/files/2015/04/Simla-Agreement-July-2-1972.pdf"> Shimla Agreement</a> [PDF] between India and Pakistan on July 2, 1972 restricts the two countries, pending the final settlement of any of the problems between the two countries, neither side shall unilaterally alter the situation, and more particularly in the case of Jammu and Kashmir, neither side shall seek to alter it unilaterally, irrespective of mutual differences and legal interpretations.</p>

<p>Under <a href="http://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/IN%20PK_990221_The%20Lahore%20Declaration.pdf">Lahore declaration</a> [PDF] on February 21, 1999 , in its operative paragraph, the two countries agreed to intensify their efforts to resolve all issues, including the issue of Jammu and Kashmir, and intensify their composite and integrated dialogue process for an early and positive outcome of the agreed bilateral agenda . Therefore, if the jurisdiction of the Court is founded on particular "treaties and conventions in force" or under the UN Charter, under Article 36, paragraph 1, of its statute, it becomes irrelevant for the Court to consider the objections to other possible bases of jurisdiction.</p>

<p>If Pakistan goes to ICJ against India's violation of the principles and purposes of the Charter, as also envisaged and reiterated under Shimla agreement, pursuant to Article 36 (1) of the ICJ Statute, the Court still will have no jurisdiction to entertain the Application on the basis of Article 36 (1) of the Statute as the UN Charter contains no specific provision conferring compulsory jurisdiction on the Court.  </p>

<p><u>Kulbhushan Jadhav Case: The Test of Bilateralism</u></p>

<p><a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/168/19434.pdf">Pakistan argued </a> in the Kulbhushan case that the alleged activities of commander Jadhav are well dealt with under Article VI, "in case of arrest, detention or sentence made on political or security grounds, each side may examine the case on its merits", of the <a href="https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/No%20Volume/54471/Part/I-54471-08000002804b7dde.pdf">Agreement on Consular Access</a> [PDF] ("2008 Agreement") signed on May 21, 2008 by and between India and Pakistan.</p>

<p>Pakistan also argued that the jurisdiction under the <a href="http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_2_1963.pdf">Vienna Convention on Consular Relations 1963</a> [PDF] (Vienna Convention) is limited, and indeed it is further limited and qualified or supplemented by the 2008 agreement. </p>

<p>India acknowledges that the parties have signed the 2008 Agreement, but it maintains that this instrument does not restrict the parties' rights and obligations under Article 36, paragraph 1, of the Vienna Convention. In respect to the 2008 Agreement, the Court concluded that it does not need to decide at this stage of the proceedings whether Article 73 of the Vienna Convention would permit a bilateral agreement to limit the rights contained in Article 36 of the Vienna Convention. It is sufficient at this point to note that the provisions of the 2008 Agreement do not impose expressly such a limitation. </p>

<p>Article 73 (2) of the Vienna Convention says that "Nothing in the present Convention shall preclude States from concluding international agreements confirming or supplementing or extending or amplifying the provisions thereof." This means the 2008 agreement can only confirm, supplement, extend or expand the Vienna convention but cannot limit it. On the other hand, the Shimla agreement and the Lahore declaration, prima facie, preclude any bilateral issue between India and Pakistan, including Jammu and Kashmir, to be decided outside bilateral understandings or at the multinational forum.</p>

<p>Last but not least, it is as if India has opened Pandora's Box to Pakistan by making the Jadhav issue multilateral, Pakistan is sure not to hesitate to take India to the ICJ not only on the Kashmir issue but =on many matters such as Kishan-Ganga power project under the <a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTSOUTHASIA/Resources/223497-1105737253588/IndusWatersTreaty1960.pdf">Indus Water Treaty 1960</a> [PDF].   </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnists, <a href="http://law.syr.edu/profile/david-crane1">David M. Crane</a>, of <a href="http://law.syr.edu/">Syracuse University School of Law</a>, and <a href="http://law.fordham.edu/10595.htm">Richard Goldstone</a>, former Justice of the <a href="http://www.constitutionalcourt.org.za/">Constitutional Court of South Africa</a>, discuss the widespread implications of the US decision to close the Office of Global Criminal Justice...</p><strong>W</strong>ith the raspy barking of a US President in the background trying to "Make America Great Again," the world shrinks away in surprise and confusion. As the light begins to wane on that <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=85199">bright and shining experiment on the hill</a> called "America", the international community faces the yawning maw of a retrenching America, once again looking inward, shrinking away from a leadership position it has held since World War II. Unprepared for any of this, the West is losing its way uncertain and weakened. They look for any indication of someone to lead.</p>

<p>It will not be America. From the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/climate/trump-paris-climate-agreement.html">environment</a> to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/14/business/trans-pacific-partnership-trade-japan-china-globalization.html">trade</a>, the US has chosen to step away from not only legal but also moral obligations. This past week another indication of further retrenchment was manifest when US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson announced that he was <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/trump-war-crimes-torture-tillerson-638404">closing the Office of Global Criminal Justice</a> (OGCJ), the office where the US asserts leadership and support for international justice and holding accountable those who feed upon their own citizens. Like much else this new US administration has done, this is wrong!</p>

<p>The United States has been the cornerstone for the creation of modern international criminal law. It played the leading role at the <a href="https://www.ushmm.org/outreach/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007722">International Criminal Tribunal at Nuremberg</a> in 1945, the subsequent Council 10 trials, up to and including the establishment of the tribunals and courts for Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and Cambodia, as well as the International Criminal Court. BUT FOR the support of the United States, most of these justice mechanisms would not have come into existence or would have had existential and overwhelming challenges at the beginning. The United States has always been at the forefront in creating justice mechanisms. </p>

<p>Past administrations have had policy differences with the world community on the administration of international justice, but, at the end of the day, they did not waiver in the perception that the rule of law is important for a more stable world. This administration, a newly forming kleptocracy, is facing the rule of law with almost a blatant disregard, certainly a jaw-dropping disrespect not seen in the history of the republic. Ruefully, commentators have said that in Washington "nothing matters."</p>

<p>The reasons for the closure of the OGCJ appears to be couched in the devastating cuts that must come from a 30% reduction in the State Department's budget this fiscal year causing necessary cuts throughout the department. Efficiencies need to be made, but closure of the OGCJ will actually bring greater cost in the end. A small office with no operating budget other than the few personnel costs and the like, really does not cost the department much at all. Yet their global footprint is much larger than the numbers assigned to the OGCJ, almost equal to the more expensive bureaus.  </p>

<p>The office travels the world, sits at all of the key meetings, conferences and other efforts putting the moral force of the world's leading liberal democracy forcefully on the table of justice to ensure that reasonable outcomes and solutions are had as the world deals with unprecedented challenges related to atrocity, unrest and instability around the world.</p>

<p>Closing the OGCJ removes the United States from efforts to take on these challenges resulting in further insecurities that will challenge the national security of the United States. The small cost savings in closing this influential office will cost much more as the State Department, as well as other national security agencies, like the Department of Defense are drawn into future unrest because we no longer have the ability to prevent the destabilizing effects of atrocity, civil war and conflict. The OGCJ helped through dialog to settle disputes, unrest and the like before they developed into threats to our national security. If there were atrocities to prevent, the OGCJ contributed in the establishment of mechanisms to hold accountable those who commit those atrocities. In closing we would use the analogy that the United States built the house that we now call international criminal justice. With the closure of the OGCJ, the United States is walking out the front door and throwing the keys to the dictators, thugs and warlords who kill their own citizens.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.cla.purdue.edu/polsci/directory/?p=Louis_Beres">Louis René Beres</a> of Purdue University, in part one of this two part series, discusses how Higher Law supports the prospective impeachment of President Trump...</p>

<p>"The legality of the Constitution, its supremacy, and its claim to be worshipped alike find common standing ground on the belief in a law superior to the will of human governors." &#8212 E.S. Corwin, Th<u>e "Higher Law" Background of American Constitutional Law</u></p>

<p>"The Natural Law (Higher Law) is absolutely binding, and overrules all other laws." &#8212 A.P. d'Entreves, <u>Natural Law</u><br />
<strong><br />
Introduction</strong></p>

<p>Soon, because of his increasingly obvious debilities and wrongdoings, US President Donald Trump could face more-or-less authoritative calls for impeachment. Should this happen, virtually all corresponding legal focus would doubtlessly be directed toward the US Constitution, its expressly pertinent provisions, and also to certain allegedly relevant US Congressional deliberations, Supreme Court decisions, and historical records. Nonetheless, as the United States was unambiguously established upon a core jurisprudential architecture of Natural Law, or "Higher Law," this critical foundation could then also merit close scrutiny as an "auxiliary" impeachment standard.</p>

<p>Such scrutiny and corollary elucidations are prospectively useful if (as should be expected) certain or even all Congressional anti-impeachment elements should choose to rely upon narrowly legalistic interpretations of Article II, Section IV, presidential removal guidelines. As things now stand, the specifically codified criteria for any considered presidential impeachment ("...Treason, Bribery, or other High Crimes and Misdemeanors....") are exceedingly brief and manifestly "terse." It follows that the provision of a significantly broader jurisprudential background proposed here could sometime prove markedly helpful.</p>

<p><strong>I.</strong></p>

<p>To begin, the underlying principle of a Higher Law is not just "any principle." It is, rather, one of the <a href="1. https://www.jstor.org/stable/1285645?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents;">most enduring </a>and utterly canonic principles in the legal development of the United States. Revealed in both the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript">Declaration of Independence</a> and in the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/overview">Constitution</a>, it rests squarely upon the willing acceptance of certain notions of right and justice that obtain because of their own intrinsic merit. </p>

<p>Such basic notions, as the widely celebrated Blackstone himself <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/blackstone.asp">declared</a>, are nothing less than "the eternal, immutable laws of good and evil, to which the creator himself in all his dispensations conforms; and which he has enabled human reason to discover so far as they are necessary for the conduct of human actions." <br />
	<br />
When Jefferson set to work on drafting the actual Declaration, he drew freely upon Aristotle, Cicero, Grotius, Vattel, Pufendorf, Burlamaqui, and Locke <a href="http://lonang.com/library/reference/locke-two-treatises-government/">(<u>Second Treatise of Government</u>)</a>. Asserting the right of revolution whenever government becomes destructive of "certain unalienable rights," the Declaration of Independence posits a natural order in the world whose immutable laws are external to all human will and which are discoverable through <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20631465?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">disciplined applications of human reason</a>.   </p>

<p>Although, by the eighteenth century, God had "withdrawn" from any immediate contact with humankind, and been transformed into Final Cause or Prime Mover of the universe, "Nature" was still conveniently available to provide for an apt substitute.    <br />
	<br />
Reflecting the uniquely decisive influence of Isaac Newton, whose <u>Principia</u> was first published in 1686, all of creation could now be <a href="https://archive.org/stream/newtonspmathema00newtrich#page/n0/mode/2up">taken as an expression of divine will</a>. Reciprocally, the only true way to know God's will was to first discover the Law of Nature. In essence, Locke and Jefferson had deified nature and "denatured" God.</p>

<p>What, exactly, was this always underlying "Law of Nature"? It was, as Jefferson learned from Locke, a source of Reason: according to Locke's <u>Second Treatise:</u></p>

<blockquote>The state of nature has a law to govern it, which obliges every one: and reason, which is that law, teaches all mankind, who will but consult it, that being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions...

<p>In transgressing the law of nature, the offender declares himself to live by another rule than that of reason and common equity, which is that measure God has set to the actions of men...</p>

<p>A criminal, who having renounced reason, the common rule and measure God hath given to mankind, hath, by the unjust violence and slaughter he hath committed on one, declared war against all mankind.</blockquote></p>

<p>As Reason is the only sure guide to what God has given to humankind, it then becomes the only credible foundation of true law. This Lockean and Jeffersonian idea of a transcendent or Higher Law is manifest not only in the Declaration of Independence but also in the Constitution. The <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/ninth_amendment">Ninth Amendment</a>, in stipulating that "the enumeration of certain rights in this Constitution shall not prejudice other rights not so enumerated," reflects the belief in a law absolutely superior to any will of human governance.</p>

<p>This vital conviction runs continuously from ancient times, especially traditional Jewish Law, up to the present moment.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Fragments_of_Heraclitus">Fragments of Heraclitus</a> attest to the antiquity of a Higher Law: "For all human laws are nourished by one, which is divine. For it governs as far as it will, and is sufficient for all, and more than enough." Such Heraclitean dicta, offered somewhere around 500 B.C.E., entered into later Stoic philosophy, and described a genuinely universal and expectedly rational law.</p>

<p>In 442 B.C.E., Sophocles <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/rhetoric.html">explained</a> the idea of true law as an act of discovery, thus challenging the superiority of human rule-making in <u>Antigone</u>. Exploring the essential conflict between claims of the state and those of the individual conscience, this drama has since been taken to represent the incontestable supremacy of a Higher Law over all man-made law. Later, in the nineteenth century, Henry David Thoreau, noting that men live with "too passive a regard for the moral laws," <a href="http://xroads.virginia.edu/~hyper2/thoreau/civil.html">explicitly cited</a> <u>Antigone</u> as a suitably stirring example of civil disobedience.</p>

<p>Building upon Plato's theory of Ideas, which sought to elevate "nature" from the transient sphere of contingent facts to the "higher" realm of immutable archetypes or Forms, Aristotle advanced in his <u>Ethics</u> the concept of "natural justice." Quoting the <u>Antigone</u>, he argued importantly that "an unjust law is not a law." This idealistic position, of course, stands in stark contrast to the instrumental opinion of the Sophists that justice is never anything more than an expression of supremacy, that it is merely what Thrasymachus cynically calls, <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.html">in Plato's <u>Republic</u></a>, "the interest of the stronger." </p>

<p>Apropos of President Donald Trump's current presidency, this crude brand of <em>Realpolitik</em> is now also the acknowledged philosophic underpinning of present-day US foreign policy.</p>

<p>Much earlier, the Stoics, whose legal philosophies arose on the threshold of the Greek and Roman worlds, regarded nature itself as the supreme legislator. Applying Platonic and Aristotelian thought to the hopefully emerging cosmopolis, they had defined this nascent order as one wherein humankind, by means of its established capacity to reason, can commune directly with the gods. And since this definition required further expansion of Plato's and Aristotle's developing notions of universalism, the Stoics effectively articulated a further division between <em>lex aeterna</em>, <em>ius natural</em>, and <em>ius humanum</em>. </p>

<p><em>Lex aeterna</em> is the law of reason of the cosmos, the <em>logos</em> which rules the universe. As an emanation of cosmic reason, human reason rules the lives of men. It follows that natural law partakes of eternal law, though it has a more limited range of application. Unlike the more elitist conception of Plato (and, to a certain extent, even Aristotle), the Stoic idea of an innate "right reason" presumed no divisions between peoples.    </p>

<p>Instead, in linking all persons with the cosmic order, it established the essential foundations of an authentic universality.</p>

<p>Cicero, in <u>De Republica</u>, <a href="http://assets.cambridge.org/97805214/53448/sample/9780521453448wsc00.pdf">defined</a> the state as a "coming together of a considerable number of men who are united by a common agreement about law and rights and by the desire to participate in mutual advantages." This definition <a href="http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1043&context=yjlh">sheds light </a>on the problems surrounding positivist jurisprudence, a legal philosophy that values a state's edicts as intrinsically just and obligatory. In a justly famous passage of <u>De Republica</u>, one well known to Jefferson and other Founders, Cicero set forth the still classic articulation of Natural Law:</p>

<blockquote>True law is right reason, harmonious with nature, diffused among all, constant, eternal; a law which calls to duty by its commands and restrains from evil by its prohibitions...It is a sacred obligation not to attempt to legislate in contradiction to this law; nor may it be derogated from nor abrogated. Indeed, by neither the Senate nor the people can we be released from this law; nor does it require any but oneself to be its expositor or interpreter. Nor is it one law at Rome and another at Athens; one now and another at a late time; but one eternal and unchangeable law binding all nations through all time...</blockquote>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.cla.purdue.edu/polsci/directory/?p=Louis_Beres">Louis René Beres</a> of Purdue University, in part two of this two part series, <a href="https://www.jurist.org/forum/2017/07/Beres-president-trump-impeachment1.php">continues his discussion</a> on how Higher Law supports the prospective impeachment of President Trump...</p>

<p><strong>II.</strong></p>

<p>What is to be done when positive law (which now includes US Constitutional law) is at variance with true law? The Romans had proposed a remedy. They incorporated into their statutes a contingency clause that man-made law could never abrogate those obligations that are inherently right or even sacred. On several occasions, Cicero and others invoked this clause, or <em>jus</em>, against one statute or another. </p>

<p>In this way, the written law of the moment, never more than an artifact of the extant civic community, always remained correctly subject to "right reason."</p>

<p>Later, St. Augustine reaffirmed that temporal law must conform to the unchangeable eternal law, which he defined as "the reason or will of God (<em><a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Human_Law_and_Human_Justice.html?id=TP-jAAAAIAAJ">ratio divina vel voluntas Dei</a></em>)." Aquinas continued this tradition of denying the status of law to prescriptions that are inherently unjust (<em>lex iniusta non est lex</em>). "Human law," he wrote meaningfully in the <u>Summae</u>, "has the quality of law only insofar as it proceeds according to right reason; and in this respect it is clear that it derives from the eternal law. Insofar as it deviates from reason it is called an unjust law, and has the quality not of law, but of <em>violence</em>." </p>

<p>The concept of a Higher Law, later to figure so importantly in the jurisprudential development of the United States of America, was widely integrated into medieval thought. According to John of Salisbury's <u>Policraticus</u>, "There are certain precepts of the law which have perpetual necessity, having the force of law among all nations and which absolutely cannot be broken." Recognizing the idea that all political authority must be intrinsically limited, John noted that the prince "may not lawfully have any will of his own apart from that which the law or equity enjoins, or the calculation of the common interest requires."    </p>

<p>Viewed against the pertinent backdrop of the current US president - now, correctly analogous to the medieval "prince" discussed by John of Salisbury - such "perpetual law" must necessarily prohibit any presidential executive placement of personal interest over the discernibly "common interest" of the United States. Natural Law, <em>inter alia</em>, exists to frustrate political injustice, a vital function that could soon become material to any authoritative launch of impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Natural Law doctrine was reaffirmed and secularized by Grotius. Reviving the Ciceronian idea of Natural Law and its underlying optimism about human nature, Grotius is credited with liberating this idea from any remaining dependence on ecclesiastical or Papal interpretation. Building upon the prior speculations of the Dominican Francisco de Vitoria, who had proclaimed a natural community of humankind and the universal validity of human rights, Grotius fashioned a conceptual "bridge" from the Christian Commonwealth of the Middle Ages to a brand new interstate society.   </p>

<p>In this connection, he strengthened the idea of a universally valid Natural Law transcending in obligation all human law, including the cumulative law of any single sovereign state. </p>

<p>Unlike Machiavelli and Hobbes, Grotius consciously did not reduce law to any presumed will of a prince or of a separate state. Rather, while recognizing such will as a properly constitutive element within the wider international legal order, he also understood that the binding quality of human edicts must always be derived from an overriding totality of "natural" imperatives. Hence, he proceeded to <a href="http://dl4a.org/uploads/pdf/LawofNationsVattel.pdf">reject <em>raison </em><em>d'etat</em> as a just cause for war</a>, a purposeful rejection that may soon no longer resonate helpfully in President Donald Trump's United States.</p>

<p>This brings us directly to the conveyance of Natural Law ideas into American political theory, a transmittal that was preeminently the work of Locke's <a href="http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/locke1689a.pdf"><u>Second Treatise on Civil Government</u></a> (1690). The specified American "duty" to revolt whenever governments commit "a long train of abuses and usurpations" flows from Locke's seminal notion that civil authority can never extend beyond the securing of humankind's natural rights. Regarding any considered excursions into US presidential impeachment, the particular motto that Jefferson chose for his seal was, "Rebellion to Tyrants Is Obedience to God." As for the right to pursue <em>happiness</em>, which Jefferson drew directly from <a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=q1FHAAAAYAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA55&dq=J.J.+Burlamaqui+PRINCIPES+DU+DROIT+DE+LA+NATURE+ET+DES+GENS+&ots=8ksp_03Gh6&sig=zjMkRa7t9MeXxoT2VJ13SDQ--ok#v=onepage&q=J.J.%20Burlamaqui%20PRINCIPES%20DU%20DROIT%20DE%20LA%20NATURE%20ET%20DES%20GENS&f=false">Burlamaqui's incorporation into natural law</a>, it had literally nothing whatever to do with today's contemporary celebrations of materialism. </p>

<p>Nor could this right have any bearing on any currently contemplated US presidential impeachment proceedings. Though happiness was viewed by Jefferson (in deference to Pufendorf and Locke) as a welcome condition to be achieved as a direct result of humankind's overriding commitment to Reason, left unspecified were any corresponding or expressly corollary presidential obligations.</p>

<p>Above all else, the <a href="http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/">Declaration of Independence</a> implemented a social contract that sets limits on the power of any government. Its central purpose, therefore, was to articulate a set of universally valid constraints upon all secular political authority. Moreover, as justice, which is based on natural law, binds all human society, the rights described by the Declaration of Independence could never be reserved only to Americans. </p>

<p>Instead, by ready deduction, these rights must perpetually extend to all human societies, and can never be abrogated by any positive law.</p>

<p>This applicable theory of a Higher Law, which could assume have its useful place in any forthcoming impeachment proceedings that would concern evident Trump Administration disregard for worldwide human rights, is based on clarity, self-evidence, and coherence. Its validity, therefore, can never be shaken by any presumed imperatives of geopolitics, or even by partisan domestic politics. As noted by the Swiss scholar Emmerich de Vattel in the 1758 edition of <u>The Law of Nations</u> (a work in which several American fathers of independence discovered important maxims of political liberty): "No agreement can bind, or even authorize, a man to violate the natural law."   </p>

<p>Vattel had prudently cautioned that only a strict obedience to higher legal obligations can ever produce a virtuous and thereby safe and prosperous state: "One would have to be very ignorant of political affairs not to perceive how much more capable a virtuous Nation is of forming a happy, peaceful, flourishing and secure state, respected by its neighbors and formidable to its enemies." Going forward with any US House of Representatives impeachment proceeding, even Vattel's earlier wisdom could sometimes have its proper philosophic place.</p>

<p><strong>III.</strong></p>

<p>In the end, Higher Law expectations of the American political tradition are never self-enforcing. Defied again and again by transient political elites, they can only be sustained where individual citizens act (as does Antigone before Creon) according to conscience. "Why has every man a conscience," asks Thoreau in his foundational<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=nO8kDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=thoreau+civil+disobedience&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjqo7b-7Z_VAhWMPj4KHUrxDwEQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&q=thoreau%20civil%20disobedience&f=false"> American essay on <u>Civil Disobedience</u></a>.</p>

<blockquote>I think that we should be men first, and subjects afterwards. It is not desirable to cultivate a respect for the law, so much as for the right. The only obligation which I have a right to assume is to do at any time what I think right. It is truly enough said that a corporation has no conscience; but a corporation of conscientious men is a corporation with a conscience. </blockquote>

<p>Where are such "conscientious men" (and women) to be found? Certainly not, says Thoreau insightfully, among the "commonly esteemed good citizens." These mass men and women serve the state "not as men mainly, but as machines, with their bodies."</p>

<p>Placing themselves "on a level with wood and earth and stones," they are frequently incapable of making any essential moral distinctions. This incapacity is easily enough recognized today, where so many of our citizens remain unable to recognize the brutally stark differences between conspicuous US presidential wrongdoing and legally correct presidential behavior.</p>

<p>Could the United States still create the conditions for a conscientious "corporation" though the enhanced education of an informed citizenry? From Rousseau to the present, this has been the preferred path of virtually all democratic theory. Rousseau believed that law and liberty could best exist in a city-state of properly educated voters like Geneva. As he stipulates in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=iOzBAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Book+III+of+the+Social+Contract+rousseau&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwio1uT37p_VAhUBSD4KHRbWBmwQ6AEIMTAB#v=onepage&q=Book%20III%20of%20the%20Social%20Contract%20rousseau&f=false">Book III of the <u>Social Contract</u></a>:</p>

<blockquote>First, a very small state where the people can be readily got together and where each citizen can with ease know all the rest; secondly, great simplicity of manners, to prevent business from multiplying and raising thorny problems; next, a large measure of equality in rank and fortune, without which equality of rights and authority cannot long subsist; lastly, little or no luxury - for luxury either comes of riches or makes them necessary.</blockquote>

<p>But the contemporary United States is not at all like Geneva, and Rousseau's idea that (even under very specified conditions) a majority can be trusted with what is really best for "The People" is too-often mistaken. Now, the dangers of the "general will" have been made particularly manifest not only in the exploits of Robespierre and Napoleon, but also in the stunningly inauspicious selection of US President Donald Trump. Whether this selection shall soon lead to proper efforts at essential removal is still unclear.</p>

<p>In any event, Rousseau's deification of The People actually points toward the very opposite of our own Higher Law tradition. The Genevan made "The People" sovereign; for us, ultimately, sovereignty must come to reside in The Citizen. As Thoreau had understood, apathy, complacency passivity and moral cowardice are the inevitable qualities of the mass of men and women. Hope, therefore, lies only in those still-thoughtful individuals whose primary allegiance is directed toward properly overriding and universal laws; that is, not in the presumptive "good citizen," but rather in the indispensable "wise minority."</p>

<p>What is the real task of this body of enlightened persons, one which could in fact represent a true and distinct <em>majority</em>? Thoreau speaks truthfully of civil disobedience, one still possible act of "counter-friction." Now confronted with an American president who might bring unparalleled harms to the United States - today, such harms could even include the onset of a catastrophic nuclear war - he would urge, as he once did about other policy deformations (see <u>Civil Disobedience</u>),: "Let your life be a counter-friction to stop the machine. What I have to do is to see, at any rate, that I do not lend myself to the wrong which I condemn."</p>

<p>Here, however, we have been exploring more particularly jurisprudential remedies to the Trump Presidency; specifically, Constitutionally-based impeachment proceedings. Should this species of remediation soon be selected and undertaken (structurally, there could be no other proper legal remedies, as the Supreme Court has made plain that presidential impeachment is always a non-justiciable question), those identifiable Members of Congress most closely involved with drafting and refining the pertinent Articles of Impeachment might usefully avail themselves of these now examined "Higher Law" arguments. This is the case because (1) the Constitution of the United States is firmly constructed upon certain antecedent principles of Natural Law; and because (2) these core legal principles are ultimately made binding upon all citizens and government officials as a fully authoritative Higher Law.</p>

		<title>The Need for Remedies to Combat Fraud in Ballot Initiatives</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Jessica George of St. John's University discusses the need for a cause of action to remedy fraudulent voting processes ... </j:header><br />
<strong>E</strong>qual opportunity initiatives will always remain a hotly contested issue that incites passionate political action - so much so that it even inspires wealthy businessmen to lead a political crusade against affirmative action policies.  People decide their stance on these issues based on their own principles and experiences because the initiatives impact citizens' lives in large ways.  However, when a state takes a stance on affirmative action by making it easier to ban, there is a risk that minority voices will get drowned out by amplified majority voices.  Thus, when this contentious issue is decided by a ballot initiative specifically, the government must protect both majority and minority citizens' right to be heard.  Most importantly, the government must ensure that the ballot initiative process is untainted by fraud or deception that could lead to results contrary to the intent of the people.</p>

<p>In 2006, the citizens of Michigan used a ballot initiative to place a particular issue on the ballot: whether to ban equal opportunity programs in public housing, public education, and public contracting.  A wealthy California businessman named Ward Connerly sought to end affirmative action programs by amending the <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/mcl/pdf/mcl-chap1.pdf">Michigan state constitution</a> [PDF], an arduous task.  Connerly launched a campaign with the <a href="http://www.adversity.net/michigan/mcri_mainframe.htm">Michigan Civil Rights Initiative</a> ("MCRI") [official website] to amend the constitution by garnering signatures to put the proposal on the general election ballot.  Initially, the ballot initiative seemed like a fair measure.  To place this contentious issue on the ballot, MCRI first had to gather 317,757 signatures in support of the proposal.  By requiring proponents to gather enough signatures to place a proposal on the ballot, the state ensures that this is an issue that the citizens want to consider.</p>

<p>However, MCRI obtained the necessary signatures by training approximately 1,000 petition circulators, 600 of whom were paid independent contractors, to deceive voters into thinking that they were signing a proposal in support of affirmative action, instead of one that aimed to abolish equal opportunity initiatives.  Virtually every one of the approximately 125,000 black Michigan voters who signed the ballot petition to ban affirmative action was deceived into signing it.  White voters were also told that they were signing a proposal that promoted equal opportunity.  Even the ballot petitioners themselves were deceived into believing they were actually circulating a petition that supported affirmative action.  </p>

<p>Michigan citizens were outraged when they learned about the fraud used to gather their signatures.  The proposal made its way onto the ballot anyway.  A majority vote inevitably silenced the voices of the minority citizens at the polls, and Michigan amended its state constitution to ban all equal opportunity policies in public housing, public education, and public contracting. </p>

<p>Though citizens sought relief in federal courts, they did not have any relief under their only remedy:  the <a href="http://library.clerk.house.gov/reference-files/PPL_VotingRightsAct_1965.pdf">Voting Rights Act of 1965</a> ("VRA") [PDF].  Congress enacted the VRA to abolish prevalent illegal barriers that prevented African Americans from casting their votes.  However, in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13410429958289015906">Operation King's Dream v. Connerly</a>, the Michigan federal court held that minority voters did not have a remedy under the VRA.  The court could not and did not dispute that the Michigan minority voters established that there was voter fraud in the electoral process.  However, the court could not find a VRA violation because the minority voters participated in the electoral process on the same terms as non-minority voters.</p>

<p>In other words, both minority and non-minority voters were equally defrauded in the electoral process, so the minority voters were not treated any differently.  The court found it "distressing" that its finding of a lack of discrimination was based on the fact that minority and non-minority voters had equal access to a deceptive political process. However, it reasoned that the Voting Rights Act is not a general anti-fraud statute and required a finding of unequal access.</p>

<p>Furthermore, fraudulent ballot initiatives allow a majority of voters' fears and prejudices to be expressed in policies that target minorities and restrict minority rights. When issues and initiatives that impact minority rights reach the ballot, fraudulent direct democracy campaigns allow decisions about minority rights to be based on negative group effect, negative stereotypes about the targeted group, and animus toward general counter-majoritarian elements of democracy.</p>

<p>Lastly, ballot initiatives that are used to decide issues like affirmative action set back minority communities in some of the most important facets of life.  After Michigan amended its constitution to ban equal opportunity initiatives, the percentage of black students among those attaining bachelor's degrees in 2014 was 4.4 percent, the lowest since 1991; the percentage of black students among those attaining master's degrees was 5.1 percent, the lowest since 1989; the percentage of black students among those attaining doctoral degrees was 3.9 percent, the lowest since 1993; and the percentage of black students among those attaining professional school degrees was 3.5 percent, the lowest since the mid-1970's.</p>

<p>To protect ballot initiatives and, specifically, minority rights in ballot initiatives, there must be a federal cause of action that provides protection for voters who receive materially false information about the content and implications of proposals on ballot initiatives.  I propose a cause of action for citizens when state authorities are unresponsive to fraudulent and deceptive practices during ballot initiatives, including during the signature-gathering process.  When any voter or group of voters is denied relief by their state courts to remedy a fraudulent and deceptive practice, voters may institute a civil action for preventive relief, including an application in a United States district court for a permanent or temporary injunction or restraining order.  This protects citizens' right to decide controversial issues through ballot initiatives and simultaneously ensures that process is fair.  </p>

<p>Michigan voters still pay for the consequences of an unprotected ballot initiative today.  When ballot initiatives are used to crusade against contentious issues that materially alter peoples' lives, the government must take all measures necessary to ensure all voices are heard.</p>

		<title>Why &#034;Palestine&#034; Would be a Dangerous Fiction</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.cla.purdue.edu/polsci/directory/?p=Louis_Beres">Louis René Beres</a> of Purdue University,  discusses the implications of Palestinian statehood under the rubric of International Law...</p>
<em>"The first general law, which is to be found in the very end of the society of Nations, is that each Nation should contribute as far as it can to the  happiness and advancement of  other Nations."</em><br />
<p align= "right"; padding-right= "50pt">Emmerich de Vattel, The Law of Nations (1758)</p><br />
	<br />
<strong>I</strong>n candor, few if any states can ever claim to meet the high standard established by Emmerich de Vattel, one of the great founders of modern international law, back in the eighteenth century. Nonetheless, any such lofty jurisprudential expectation would be especially ironic in the prospective case of  "Palestine." This is the case because of the complete absence of any expressly cooperative or collaborative ethos in the Palestine Authority (PA). <br />
	<br />
There are both legal and practical problems associated with ongoing Palestinian demands for enhanced formal statehood. To begin with the first set of problems, even if an expanding number of existing states should argue tenaciously for recognition of a 23rd Arab state, these actions would have no properly authoritative effect. <em>Inter alia</em>, the governing treaty on statehood - <a href="https://www.ilsa.org/jessup/jessup15/Montevideo Convention.pdf">the Convention on the Rights and Duties of States</a> (1934) - stipulates a number of distinctly explicit criteria that must always be satisfied, irrespective of recognition.  <br />
	<br />
Other substantial problems must be acknowledged. In principle, at least, further declarations of support for Palestinian "self-determination"  might not be <em>per se</em> <a href="https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/348/90/IMG/NR034890.pdf?OpenElement">unreasonable</a> if the Palestinian side were more authentically committed to a "Two-State Solution."  Yet, both Palestinian Authority (PA) and rival Hamas, even as they periodically struggle against each other, still manage to agree on one overriding point. This is the ritualized and unchanging annihilatory mantra that: (1) Israel represents an irremediably intolerable abomination of the <em>Dar al-Islam</em> (the world of Islam) on fundamental religious grounds, and: (2) Israel is nothing more than "Occupied Palestine."<br />
	<br />
Bearing in mind Emmerich de Vattel's generic expectation for statehood - an incontrovertibly reasonable expectation, to be sure -  all states searching more-or-less seriously for Middle East peace are effectively urging the creation of another pro-terror state. Earlier, this destabilizing advocacy position had stemmed from a diplomatic framework then known generally as The Road Map for Implementation of a Permanent Solution for Two States in the Israel-Palestinian Dispute. Together with an openly insistent Palestinian refusal to reject the "Phased Plan" (Cairo) of June 1974, and an associated no-compromise Jihad  to "liberate" all of "Occupied Palestine" in increments,  the Road Map revealed another largely unforeseen or deliberately unacknowledged "cartographic" danger. <br />
	<br />
It is this. Perhaps lacking full understanding of pertinent international law, and also of antecedent Natural Law,   certain states favoring "Palestine" that are plausibly well-intentioned are still being misled by overly-optimistic hopes  concerning Palestinian "demilitarization."<br />
	<br />
On June 14, 2009, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu first agreed to accept a Palestinian state, but at that time also made any such agreement contingent upon prior Palestinian "demilitarization." More precisely, said the Prime Minister: "In any peace agreement, the territory under Palestinian control must be disarmed, with solid security guarantees for Israel." <br />
	<br />
Although, at the time, this formal Israeli position represented a considerable concession, one arguably intended to contribute to the generalized "happiness" and "advancement,"  it never really had any tangible chance of success. Oddly, therefore, the Prime Minister repeated this profoundly unrealistic expectation in his UN General Assembly speech on September 27, 2012, and also on several subsequent occasions.<br />
	<br />
Under the very best assumptions for Israel, basic security could be suitably maintained if Palestine were actually demilitarized. But, in view of expected Palestinian manipulations of all relevant international law ("law fare") -manipulations deducible from all major policy statements and codified platforms -  these assumptions remain unpersuasive. Conveniently for the PA, it could always be made to appear  that such law does not necessarily require Palestinian compliance with "pre-state" agreements concerning the use of armed force. <br />
	<br />
In this regard, the seemingly recalcitrant Palestine position on proposed demilitarization could actually prove correct.<br />
	<br />
In essence, as a now presumptively independent state, pre-independence compacts might not legally bind Palestine, even if the particular agreements in question had included expressly relevant UN and/or US assurances to the contrary. This is the most likely argument, even though unrestricted Palestinian claims of statehood would never have actually satisfied the four very plainly codified expectations of "Montevideo." Moreover, this would be the predictable Palestinian argument even though Palestine would have earned no proper legal entitlement to invoke any such authentically sovereign rights of abrogation.<br />
	<br />
There are some antecedent legal problems here. Because true treaties can be binding only upon states,  an agreement between a still non-state Palestinian Authority (PA), and an authentic sovereign state (Israel),   would have little real or tangible effectiveness. <br />
	<br />
What if the government of Palestine were in fact willingly adhering to Emmerich de Vattel's core expectations for states, that is, prepared to consider itself properly bound by the pre-state, non-treaty agreement? Even in these relatively favorable circumstances, the new Arab government of Palestine would still retain ample legal pretext to identify grounds for lawful "treaty" termination.  It could, for example, withdraw from the "treaty" because of what it would then regard as a "material breach," an alleged violation by Israel that credibly undermined the object and/or purpose of the agreement.  <br />
	<br />
Alternatively, it could point toward what international law calls a "fundamental change of circumstances" (<em>rebus sic stantibus</em>).   In this connection, if a Palestinian state were to declare itself vulnerable to previously unforeseen dangers, perhaps even from the forces of other Arab armies, it could lawfully end its previously sworn commitment to remain demilitarized.<br />
	<br />
There is another method by which a treaty-like arrangement obligating a new Palestinian state to accept demilitarization could quickly and legally be invalidated after independence. The usual grounds that may be invoked under domestic law to invalidate contracts also apply under international law to treaties. This means that the new state of Palestine could point to alleged errors of fact, or to duress, as perfectly appropriate grounds for terminating the problematic agreement.<br />
	<br />
There is more. Any treaty or treaty-like agreement is void if, at the time it was entered into, it conflicts with a "peremptory" rule of general international law (jus cogens) - a rule accepted and recognized by the international community of states as one from which "no derogation is permitted."   Because the right of all sovereign states to maintain military forces essential to <a href="http://legal.un.org/repertory/art51.shtml">"self-defense"</a> is certainly such a peremptory <a "href="http://www.jus.uio.no/lm/un.law.of.treaties.convention.1969/28.html">rule</a>,  Palestine, depending upon its particular form of selected authority, could seemingly be within its right to abrogate any arrangement that had earlier compelled its demilitarization.<br />
	<br />
Thomas Jefferson, an American President who likely read Epicurus, Cicero and Seneca, as well as Voltaire, Montesquieu, Holbach, Helvetius and Beccaria, <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/jeffop2.asp">wrote</a> interestingly about obligation and international law. While affirming that "Compacts between nation and nation are obligatory upon them by the same moral law which obliges individuals to observe their compacts...," he also acknowledged the following: "There are circumstances which sometimes excuse the nonperformance of contracts between man and man; so are there also between nation and nation." Very specifically, Jefferson continued, if performance of contractual obligation becomes "self-destructive" to a party, "...the law of self-preservation overrules the law of obligation to others." <br />
	<br />
Here it must be remembered that, at least historically, demilitarization is a principle applied to various "<a href="https://cil.nus.edu.sg/1977/1977-protocol-additional-to-the-geneva-conventions-of-12-august-1949-and-relating-to-the-protection-of-victims-of-international-armed-conflicts-protocol-i/">zones,</a>" and not to the entirety of emergent states.  Hence, a new state of Palestine might have yet another legal ground upon which to permissibly evade compliance with pre-independence commitments to demilitarization. It could be alleged, <em>inter alia</em>, that these commitments are inconsistent with traditional or <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/17th_century/westphal.asp">Westphalian</a> bases of authoritative international law - rudiments found in treaties and conventions, <a href="http://lawofwar.org/nicaraugua_v_us.htm">international custom</a>, and the general principles of law recognized by "<a href="http://www.refworld.org/docid/3deb4b9c0.html">civilized nations</a>."  <br />
	<br />
These commitments would therefore display no binding character.<br />
	<br />
Israel should draw no compensatory comfort from the purportedly legal promise of Palestinian demilitarization.  Indeed, should the government of a new state of Palestine choose to invite foreign armies and/or <a href="http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_4_1973.pdf">terrorists</a> onto its territory (possibly after the original government authority is displaced or overthrown by even more militantly Islamic, anti-Israel forces), it could do so without any practical difficulties, and without violating international law.  <br />
	<br />
Strangely, the still-prevailing plan for Palestinian statehood is built upon the patently moribund <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/foreignpolicy/peace/guide/pages/the%20israeli-palestinian%20interim%20agreement.aspx">Oslo Accords</a>, ill-founded agreements now unambiguously destroyed by persistent and egregious Arab-state violations. By now, the basic problem with the Oslo Accords that underlies these violations should be obvious. On the Arab side, Oslo-mandated expectations were really never anything more than an optimally cost-effective method of dismantling Israel. On the Israeli side, these expectations were taken, more or less, as an unavoidable way of averting further Palestinian terrorism,  and, as corollary, of preventing catastrophic Arab aggression.    <br />
	<br />
The resultant asymmetry in expectations, never acknowledged by the UN, has generally enhanced Arab power, while it has systematically weakened and degraded Israel.  Even now, even after "Operation Iraqi Freedom" and the endless war in Afghanistan - even after the rise of ISIS, and the ongoing Syrian genocide  -  undisguised Palestinian calls to "Slaughter the Jews"  have generally failed to dampen international enthusiasm for what amounts to another irredentist terrorist state. Even now, when much of the "international community" plans to midwife the birth of such a prospectively refractory state, its multiple representatives refuse to understand that only a lascivious gravedigger could wield the forceps.   <br />
	<br />
What does all of this mean, for any alleged Palestinian demilitarization "remedy," and for Israeli security?  Above all, it demands that Israel make rapid and far-reaching changes in the manner in which it conceptualizes the critical continuum of cooperation and conflict. Israel, ridding itself of injurious wishful thinking, of always hoping, of hoping too much, should recognize the relentlessly zero-sum calculations of its enemies. Accordingly, Jerusalem must finally begin to acknowledge that this doctrinally-based struggle in the Middle East - a Palestinian doctrine of Islamic supremacy and "purity" - must inevitably be fought at the conflict end of the range.   <br />
	<br />
The enemy-sustained struggle, in other words, must generally be conducted, however reluctantly and painfully, in starkly zero-sum terms. Understood in terms of international law and world order,   this could mean, among other things, a recurrent willingness in Jerusalem to accept the right  and corresponding obligation of "anticipatory self-defense."  <br />
	<br />
Unambiguously, the Arab world and <a href="https://www.memri.org/reports/qods-day-iran-tehran-calls-annihilation-israel-and-arming-west-bank">Iran</a> still have only a "One-State Solution" for the Middle East. It is a "solution" that ultimately eliminates Israel altogether, a physical solution, a "<a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/imtconst.asp">Final Solution</a>."   The official PA maps of "Palestine" still show the new Arab state comprising all of the West Bank (Judea/Samaria), all of Gaza, and all of the State of Israel.  <br />
	<br />
These maps also exclude any references to an indigenous  Jewish population, and list the holy sites of only Christians and Muslims. One official cartographer, Khalil Tufakji, was commissioned by the Palestine National Authority to design and to locate a proposed Palestinian Capitol Building. This was drawn to be located on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem, directly on top of an ancient Jewish cemetery.<br />
	<br />
On September 1, 1993, Yasser Arafat loudly reaffirmed that the then new Oslo Accords would remain an intrinsic part of the PLO's 1974 Phased Plan for Israel's destruction:  "The agreement will be a basis for an independent Palestinian State, in accordance with the Palestinian National Council Resolution issued in 1974.This PNC Resolution calls for "the establishment of a national authority on any part of Palestinian soil from which Israel withdraws or is liberated."  Later, on May 29, 1994, Rashid Abu Shbak, then a senior PA security official, remarked ominously: "The light which has shone over Gaza and Jericho will also reach the Negev and the Galilee." <br />
	<br />
Since these declarations, which bear little resemblance to Emmerich de Vattel's classic cornerstone expectations of statehood, nothing has changed in the Palestinian definitions of Israel and "Palestine." This is true for the current leadership of both Hamas and PA. Significantly, it may make no palpable difference whether one terror group or the other is more-or-less in power.  <br />
	<br />
In his <a href="http://www.palwatch.org/main.aspx?fi=157&doc_id=13442">sermon</a>, presented on official PA Television on December 12, 2014 - and in the presence of PA President Mahmoud Abbas -  Mahmoud- Al-Habbash, the PA Supreme Shari'ah Judge, and President Abbas' Advisor on Religious and Islamic Affairs, stated candidly: "All of this land will return to us, all our occupied land, all our rights in Palestine -  our state, our peoples' heritage, our ancestors' legacy -  all of it will return to us, even if it takes time."<br />
	<br />
Earlier, on October 22, 2014, Al-Habbash had already reaffirmed that any acceptance of Israel's physical existence is firmly forbidden under Islamic law: "The entire land of Palestine (i.e., territory that includes all of Israel) is waqf (an inalienable religious endowment under Islamic law), and is a blessed land. It is prohibited to sell, bestow ownership, or facilitate the occupation of even a millimeter of it." <br />
	<br />
Those who are concerned with Palestinian demilitarization and Israeli security ought to also consider the following: The Arab world is presently comprised of 22 states of nearly five million square miles and substantially more than 150,000,000 people.  The Islamic world generally contains 50 states with more than one billion people.  The Islamic states comprise an area 672 times the size of Israel. Israel, with a population of more than six million Jews, is, together with Judea/Samaria, less than half the size of San Bernardino County in California. The Sinai Desert alone, which Israel transferred to Egypt in the 1979 Treaty, is three times larger than the entire State of Israel. <br />
	<br />
A presumptively sovereign Palestinian state could lawfully abrogate its pre-independence commitments to demilitarize.  In the past, the Palestine Authority has been guilty of multiple material <a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl/WebART/380-600033">breaches</a> of Oslo, and also of certain "grave breaches" of the law of war.   Further, both PA and Hamas remain determinedly unwilling to rescind expressly genocidal  calls for Israel's annihilation.  <br />
	<br />
Any plan for accepting Palestinian demilitarization on grounds of comity ("happiness" and "advancement" in the world community) would be built upon sand. It follows that Israel should never base its geo-strategic assessments of Palestinian statehood upon any such illusory jurisprudential foundations. <br />
	<br />
No doubt, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, by his earlier announced acceptance of a Palestinian state that had formally agreed upon its own demilitarization, believed that he had just taken a concessionary step toward reconciliation - one that would "contribute as far as it can to the happiness and advancement" of both Israel and "the other nations."  Yet, as we have just seen, the Palestinian leadership will never accept or even consider any Israel-proposed idea of "limited" statehood, particularly of a state lacking even the utterly core prerogatives of national self-defense. Whether Jerusalem likes it or not, this means that if Israel should ever be willing to accept a genuinely sovereign Palestinian state, it would have to base this reluctant acceptance upon an expectedly intransigent enemy state endowed with all normal and unhindered military rights.<br />
	<br />
At the "bottom line," this effectively unassailable conclusion does not suggest or imply any future Israeli surrenders or capitulation to "Palestine," but only that Jerusalem fashion its own indispensable security policies at preeminently pragmatic rather than wishfully jurisprudential levels.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://law.fiu.edu/faculty/directory/megan-fairlie/">Megan A. Fairlie</a> of the <a href="https://law.fiu.edu/">Florida International University College of Law</a> discusses the value of preserving an important, unsung hero of the State Department...</p>

<p>Earlier this month, former State Department Deputy Beth van Schaack <a href="https://www.justsecuraity.org/43213/u-s-office-global-criminal-justice-chopping-block/">first reported </a>on the planned closure of the State Department's <a href="https://www.state.gov/j/gcj/">Office of Global Criminal Justice</a> ("GCJ"). The GCJ, historically led by an Ambassador-at-Large, is tasked with advising the Secretary of State and "and other elements of the United States government" on how to prevent and respond to atrocity crimes. </p>

<p>The potential elimination of the GCJ has been widely criticized by, among others, three of the office's prior leaders. Notably, former Ambassadors-at-Large Scheffer, Williamson, and Rapp--appointed by Presidents Clinton, (G.W.) Bush, and Obama, respectively--issued a joint contribution shortly after the plan was disclosed. The piece <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/342705-the-state-departments-retreat-in-the-fight-against">describes</a> the seemingly imminent demise of the GCJ as "good news for the leaders of the Islamic State and other perpetrators of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity." </p>

<p>Since the creation of the GCJ, traditional head of state immunity has given way to instances of criminal liability for state-orchestrated atrocities. This change is thanks in large part to the work of recently formed international institutions, spearheaded by the United States, and specifically supported by the work of the GCJ. Notably, this assistance has not been purely benevolent. As Clint Williamson, one of President Bush's Ambassadors-at-Large for War Crimes Issues <a href="http://elibrary.law.psu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1707&context=psilr">explained</a> in 2007, "holding persons accountable for large-scale crimes [has] an important role in stabilizing countries or regions emerging from war. So there is a national security interest in doing this."<br />
  <br />
If it indeed it is true that Secretary of State Tillerson <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/18/world/americas/state-department-war-crimes-office-closing.html">has not</a> made a final decisions about the future of the GCJ, this is precisely the topic of commentary that he ought to now carefully contemplate. Tillerson's May 2017<a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2017/05/270620.htm"> speech</a> to State Department employees may have downgraded the role of human rights in U.S foreign policy, but it repeatedly emphasized the importance of US national security. </p>

<p>Retaining the GCJ would also leave Tillerson better positioned to advise an administration that appears to have, at best, limited knowledge about the ever-evolving landscape of international criminal justice and related policymaking. For example, prior to Tillerson's confirmation, it produced a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/us/politics/united-nations-trump-administration.html">draft order</a> that called for an examination into US funding of the International Criminal Court ("ICC"). Yet, as media outlets were quick to point out--under unforgiving headlines such as <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/01/25/trump_might_be_trying_to_defund_organizations_we_re_not_even_funding.html">"Trump Might Be Trying to Defund Organizations We're Not Even Funding"</a>--U.S financial support for the ICC is not only non-existent but <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-106publ113/pdf/PLAW-106publ113.pdf">illegal</a>. </p>

<p>Other aspects of the draft order suggest that, without proper guidance, the current administration stands poised to reinstate policies that have already proven profoundly self-defeating, such as slashing development funding to states that "oppose important United States policies." As GCJ staff would have advised, such an endeavor <a href="http://http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/12/politics/us-rethinks-its-cutoff-of-military-aid-to-latin-american-nations.html">failed conspicuously</a> when attempted by the Bush administration, negatively impacting upon key US interests including security. In fact, the withdrawal of financial support ended up undermining important efforts, such as combatting terrorism and drug trafficking; it also drove some of the funding deprived countries--<a href="http://www.caribbean360.com/news/barbados-turns-to-china-for-military-assistance">including</a> those in the US's own backyard--to turn to other powers, such as China, to replace the support no longer coming from the United States. </p>

<p>Finally, while others have rightly stressed the impact that closing the GCJ is likely to have on<a href="https://www.jurist.org/forum/2017/07/Crane-Goldstone-a-step-backward.php"> "dictators, thugs and warlords</a>," Tillerson also needs to think about how the move is apt to affect the conduct of other countries vis-à-vis the United States.  Here, a key frame of reference lies in the cloud that loomed over Trump's first foreign trip, when it was <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39946478">revealed</a>  that Sudan's Omar al-Bashir--currently wanted by the ICC for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity--intended to participate in the Saudi Summit where Trump was a planned guest of honor. </p>

<p>US leaders have long avoided meeting with al-Bashir, who presided over what former Secretary-of-State Colin Powel <a href="https://2001-2009.state.gov/secretary/former/powell/remarks/36042.htm">concluded</a> was a government-orchestrated genocide. Indeed, given this history and consistent US support for al-Bashir's prosecution, it would have been unthinkable for another state to have invited the fugitive genocidaire to attend an event alongside either of the current president's predecessors. </p>

<p>The Saudi decision to extend the invitation, then, appears influenced by more recent events,<a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/trump-onslaught-international-law-and-institutions"> in particular</a> Trump's onslaught on international law and institutions. In effect, <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/sudan-president-bashir-goes-to-riyadh-no-word-on-trump-meetingminister-says/3854091.html">it was </a>the "we're in a different world with the Trump administration" message that nearly caused the US President to appear complicit in al-Bashir's impunity-infused globetrotting.</p>

<p>The plan to include al-Bashir, of course, amounted to a <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-escaping-chaos-washington-turmoil-abroad-022124410.html">miscalculation </a>on Saudi Arabia's part (behind the scenes, Saudi officials eventually <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sudanese-president-cancels-trip-to-summit-with-trump-1495201575">succumbed</a> to US pressure and asked al-Bashir not to attend). But the experience itself ought to inform Tillerson's decision-making regarding the GCJ. Eliminating the office could well invite state conduct that makes the recent al-Bashir fiasco look mild by comparison. <br />
   <br />
A far superior alternative would be to retain the relatively inexpensive GCJ and to appoint an experienced Ambassador to lead it. This would preserve important institutional knowledge regarding prior practices that have proved harmful, as well as the ways in which working to assist in international criminal justice efforts have worked for the United States.  This information, in turn, could help to formulate a policy with elements already proven effective in advancing US interests. A well-informed, designated policy would also put other states on notice regarding the administration's position on key issues, a vast improvement over the current state of affairs, which encourages them to test the limits of US commitment to atrocity prevention.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.adflegal.org/detailspages/biography-details/bradley-abramson">Bradley Abramson</a> of <a href="http://www.adflegal.org/">Alliance Defending Freedom</a>, discusses the new ABA Model Rules and potential first amendment concerns ...</p>

<p><strong>T</strong>he new <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_8_4_misconduct.html">ABA Model Rule 8.4(g)</a> prohibits attorneys from <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_8_4_misconduct/comment_on_rule_8_4.html">engaging</a> in "harmful," "derogatory," or "demeaning" speech in any activity "related to the practice of law," including "bar association, business or social activities."</p>

<p>Proponents of the rule have <a href="/forum/2017/07/ali-kahn-aba-rule-change.php">advanced</a> several arguments in its favor and raised several <a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=044090101066109118065071087005084088034056090036079024023025123111066006108029083075060056032028047044115026106029014083099123112075028080092085020123106028003116048014009070017027121101083092087024028072001084006091122102089003102029031031065101008&EXT=pdf">defenses</a> in answer to its critics. But these arguments and defenses are unconvincing because they're based on factual misrepresentations or on mischaracterizations of the rule.</p>

<p><strong><em>Proponents of the rule summarily dismiss the many claims that it is unconstitutional</em></strong></p>

<p>Many legal authorities point out that the new rule is unconstitutional. Proponents of the rule simply ignore this ever-increasing chorus of constitutional criticism.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/12/20/texas-ag-lawyer-speech-code-proposed-by-american-bar-association-would-violate-the-first-amendment/?utm_term=.7804e46dcdea">Texas</a> and <a href="http://www.scag.gov/archives/31861">South Carolina</a> attorneys general - the only attorneys general to have thus far opined on the rule - have both issued official opinions that it would likely violate the free speech, free association, and free exercise rights of attorneys. Indeed, the South Carolina Supreme Court recently <a href="http://www.sccourts.org/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2017-06-20-01">rejected</a> the rule after the South Carolina attorney general issued his opinion against it.</p>

<p>The ABA's own Standing Committee on Attorney Discipline, as well as the Professional Responsibility Committee of the ABA Business Law Section, <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/professional_responsibility/aba_model_rule%208_4_comments/20160310%20Rosenfeld-Lynk%20SCPD%20Proposed%20MRPC%208-4%20g%20Comments%20FINAL%20Protected.authcheckdam.pdf">warned</a> the ABA that the new Rule may violate attorneys' First Amendment speech rights.</p>

<p>And prominent legal scholars - such as UCLA constitutional law professor <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/08/10/a-speech-code-for-lawyers-banning-viewpoints-that-express-bias-including-in-law-related-social-activities-2/?utm_term=.7dd3ebf3a69c">Eugene Volokh</a>, Chapman University constitutional law and legal ethics professor <https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-aba-overrules-the-first-amendment-1471388418>Ronald Rotunda</a> [By Subscription], and former U.S. Attorney General <a href="http://firstliberty.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ABA-Letter_08.08.16.pdf">Edwin Meese</a>, III - have all opined that the new rule is constitutionally infirm.</p>

<p>In addition, the authors of at least four law review articles have concluded that Model Rule 8.4(g) - and other rules like it - may violate attorneys' First Amendment rights. For example, in <a href="https://www.swlaw.com/assets/pdf/news/2017/05/22/41JLegalProf201_100percent_20.pdf"><em>New Model Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(g): Legislative History, Enforceability Questions, and a Call For Scholarship</em></a>, Andrew F. Halaby and Brianna L. Long, 41 J. Legal Prof. 201, 2016-2017, the authors contend that the new rule has due process and First Amendment free expression infirmities. In <em>Reply: A Pause for State Courts Considering Model Rule 8.4(g), The First Amendment and "Conduct Related to the Practice of Law,"</em> Josh Blackman, 30 Geo. J. Legal Ethics 241 (2017), the author argues that the rule constitutes an unjustified incursion into constitutionally protected speech. In <em>Lawyers Lack Liberty: State Codification of Comment 3 of Rule 8.4 Impinge On Lawyers' First Amendment Rights</em>, Lindsey Keiser, 28 Geo. J. Legal Ethics 629 (Summer 2015) the author states that these sorts of rules violate attorneys' Free Speech rights. And in <em>Attorney Association: Balancing Autonomy and Anti-Discrimination</em>, Dorothy Williams, 40 J. Leg. Prof. 271 (Spring 2016), the author shows that such rules violate attorneys' Free Association rights.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the National Lawyers Association's Commission for the Protection of Constitutional Rights has issued a <a href="http://www.nla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/NLA-Model-Rule-8.4g-Statement.pdf">statement</a> that ABA Model Rule 8.4(g) would violate an attorney's free speech, free association, and free exercise rights.</p>

<p>And the Montana Legislature has <a href="http://leg.mt.gov/bills/2017/billhtml/SJ0015.htm">adopted</a> a Joint Resolution declaring that it would be an unconstitutional act of legislation and violate the First Amendment rights of Montana citizens for the Supreme Court of Montana to enact ABA Model Rule 8.4(g).</p>

<p>Following the lead of the ABA, however, the rule's proponents continue to summarily dismiss these serious constitutional criticisms, without substantively addressing them. It is telling that the rule's proponents do not even try to mount a convincing constitutional defense &#8212 most likely because they cannot.</p>

<p><strong><em>Proponents of the rule erroneously argue that lawyers abandon their constitutional rights when they enter the legal profession</strong></em></p>

<p>When proponents of the rule provide any response to claims that it is unconstitutional, they often contend that, even if the rule does encroach upon lawyers' free speech and other constitutional rights, such is merely the cost attorneys must pay to participate in a regulated profession.</p>

<p>But that is, of course, nonsense. Citizens do not surrender their First Amendment speech rights when they become lawyers.</p>

<p>Indeed, the ABA itself recently acknowledged this in an <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/amicus/Filed%20ABA%20-%20Wollschlaeger%20-%20En%20Banc%20Brief%20as%20Amicus%20Curiae%20(as-filed).authcheckdam.pdf">amicus brief</a> it filed in the case of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2529847211888045190&q=Wollschlaeger,+et+al.+v.+Governor+of+the+State+of+Florida,+et+al.&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39"><span class="casename">Wollschlaeger, et al. v. Governor of the State of Florida, et al.</span></a> (11th Circuit). In its brief, the ABA denied that a law regulating speech should receive less scrutiny merely because it regulates professional speech. "On the contrary," the ABA stated, "much speech by . . . a lawyer . . . falls at the core of the First Amendment. The government should not, under the guise of regulating the profession, be permitted to silence a perceived 'political agenda' of which it disapproves. That is the central evil against which the First Amendment is designed to protect."</p>

<p>"Simply put," the ABA stated, "states should not be permitted to suppress ideas of which they disapprove simply because those ideas are expressed by licensed professionals in the course of practicing their profession . . . Indeed, the Supreme Court has never recognized 'professional speech' as a category of lesser protected expression, and has repeatedly admonished that no new such classifications be created."</p>

<p>In support of its position, the ABA cited NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415 (1963) for the proposition that "notwithstanding the State's 'interest in the regulation of the legal profession,' a State may not, under the guise of prohibiting professional misconduct, ignore constitutional rights."</p>

<p>In short, lawyers do not surrender their constitutional rights when they enter the legal profession. And the state may not ignore attorneys' constitutionally protected freedoms under the guise of professional regulation.</p>

<p><strong><em>Proponents of the rule deny that the new rule is an historical departure from earlier attorney misconduct rules</strong></em></p>

<p>Opponents of the rule point out that &#8212 in creating what is essentially a free-standing speech code for attorneys &#8212 the new rule represents a significant departure from past attorney misconduct rules, which historically have been limited to prohibiting conduct that either prejudices the administration of justice or renders the attorney unfit to practice law.</p>

<p>In response, proponents often argue that the new rule is nothing unusual and merely follows the lead of the many states that have already adopted similar black-letter nondiscrimination provisions in their rules of professional conduct.</p>

<p>But contrary to these contentions, the majority of states have not seen fit to adopt any black-letter anti-discrimination rules. And of those states that do have such provisions (other than Vermont, which is the only state that has adopted the new Model Rule), none of those anti-discrimination rules are comparable to the new Model Rule.</p>

<p>For example, other than Vermont, none of those jurisdictions extends its rule to "conduct related to the practice of law." Seven of those jurisdictions limit their coverage to conduct "in the representation of a client" or "in the course of employment" after having been retained; eight states limit the applicability of their non-discrimination rules to conduct toward other counsel, litigants, court personnel, witnesses, judges, and others involved in the legal process; California limits its provision to the management and operation of a law practice; Massachusetts limits its rule to conduct before a tribunal; and D.C. limits its rule to employment discrimination.</p>

<p>And very importantly, other than Vermont, no state rule prohibits - as the new model rule does - "harmful," "derogatory," or "demeaning" speech or conduct, probably because, as noted above, such a rule would raise serious constitutional concerns.</p>

<p>Further, eight states limit their anti-discrimination rules to "unlawful" discrimination or discrimination "prohibited by law." Indeed, of those eight states, half of them go even further, requiring that, before any disciplinary claim can even be filed, a tribunal of competent jurisdiction other than a disciplinary tribunal must first have found that the attorney has actually violated a federal, state, or local anti-discrimination statute or ordinance.</p>

<p>And unlike the new model rule, eight of the states with black letter anti-discrimination rules require that the alleged discrimination actually either prejudice the administration of justice or render the attorney unfit to practice law.</p>

<p>Finally, the model rule has a "know or reasonably should know" standard, whereas four of the states with black-letter anti-discrimination rules require the discriminatory conduct to be "knowing," "intentional" or "willful."</p>

<p>So the argument that the new ABA Rule is not unusual and simply follows the lead of what many states have already enacted is simply not true. The new rule represents an alarming departure from previous attorney misconduct rules.</p>

<p><strong><em>Proponents of the rule deny that the rule will require attorneys to accept clients and cases they don't want to accept</strong></em></p>

<p>The rule's opponents have rightly pointed out that it will, in practice, require attorneys to accept clients and cases that attorneys, for a variety of very good reasons, do not want to accept - invading attorneys' professional autonomy, forcing attorneys into unwanted fiduciary attorney-client relationships, and exposing attorneys to discrimination claims merely for exercising their professional judgment as to which clients to represent.</p>

<p>In response, proponents of the rule repeatedly state that it will not require lawyers to accept clients and cases they don't want to accept. But that is simply not true.</p>

<p>The entire purpose of the new rule is to prohibit attorneys from discriminating against anyone - including clients - in conduct related to the practice of law. Without more, that would clearly include an attorney's decision to decline a case or client for a reason that could be considered discriminatory. The only provision in the rule that purports to address this issue - and the provision upon which proponents of the rule rest their contention that it will not interfere with an attorney's client selection decisions - reads: "This paragraph does not limit the ability of a lawyer to accept, decline or withdraw from a representation in accordance with Rule 1.16."</p>

<p>But <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_16_declining_or_terminating_representation.html">Rule 1.16</a> does not even address the question of what clients or cases an attorney may decline. It only addresses the question of which clients and cases an attorney must decline. Rule 1.16 addresses three circumstances in which an attorney is prohibited from representing a client, namely: (a) if the lawyer's physical or mental condition materially impairs the lawyer's ability to represent the client, (b) the lawyer is discharged, or (c) the representation will result in violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct or other law. None of these prohibitions has anything whatever to do with an attorney's decision not to represent a client because the attorney does not want to represent the client. It only addresses the opposite situation - namely, in what circumstances an attorney who otherwise wants to represent a client may not do so.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is clear from Vermont's recent adoption of the new rule that it will, in fact, reach a lawyer's client selection decisions. In the Reporter's Notes appended to Vermont's new rule, the <a href="https://www.vermontjudiciary.org/sites/default/files/documents/PROPOSEDVRPrC8.4.pdf">Vermont Supreme Court</a> expressly states that "Rule 1.16 must also be understood in light of Rule 8.4(g)" and that an attorney's client selection or withdrawal decisions "cannot be based on discriminatory or harassing intent without violating the rule."</p>

<p>The lesson from Vermont is that - contrary to the representations of the rule's proponents -a regime governed by the new Model Rule will, in fact, require attorneys to represent clients they do not want to represent, and will subject them to possible discrimination claims from anyone whose representation the attorney declines. In this regard as well, the new rule represents a stunning departure from the deference historically given to attorneys to choose which clients and cases to accept and which to decline.</p>

<p><strong><em>A bad deal for lawyers</strong></em></p>

<p>In an attempt to convince lawyers to buy into the new ABA Model Rule, its proponents are mischaracterizing the rule and ignoring its obvious flaws. They're hoping attorneys are not paying attention. But lawyers need only read the rule for themselves to see that its proponents are peddling a bad product. Lawyers shouldn't buy what the rule's proponents are selling, because the rule is an extremely bad deal for lawyers.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Matt Belenky of the <a href="http://law.pitt.edu">University of Pittsburgh School of Law</a> discusses Amazon's sales tax policy... </j:header><strong>A</strong>s of April 1, 2017, Amazon, once a leader in pushing for online purchases to be tax free, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/29/technology/amazon-sales-tax/index.html">announced</a> it would collect sales taxes on purchases in the final four states it hadn't yet collected from: Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, and New Mexico. Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon include states that have no sales tax at all, while Alaska only has a municipal sales tax where individual municipalities have power to set their own taxation rates. Amazon's move to offer more expedient delivery services has come with an expansion of its distribution centers throughout the United States. Hence, Amazon's interest in collecting sales taxes from states where its distribution centers, that help offer same day or next day delivery, are located. In an attempt to get sellers to pay a sales tax, many states across the United States are now <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/internet-sales-taxes-to-kill-or-not-to-kill-quill/article/2619704">involved</a> with enacting legislation, in what's known as the "kill <u>Quill</u>" movement. Referring to the 1992 <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/91-0194.ZO.html">Quill v. North Dakota</a> case, sellers would be required to pay a sales tax once their sales in the state reach a certain value. In addition, in late May, Sen. Tim Kaine (Va.) reintroduced a bill, the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/976?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22marketplace+fairness+act+of+2017%22%5D%7D&r=1">Marketplace Fairness Act</a> [PDF], which would allow states to tax across their borders and businesses would become tax collectors indebted to the states. This bill <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/states-adopting-aggressive-online-sales-tax-laws/">could</a> cut pricey compliance requirements for businesses while allowing the states to collect taxes from online consumers.</p>

<p><strong>Amazon and <u>Quill</u></strong></p>

<p>Amazon's sales tax has long been a topic of conversation. In 2016, researchers at Ohio State studied household spending data in 19 states in which the sales tax was in effect and <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2422403">found tha</a>t shoppers spent 8.3% less on products after the tax was put into effect. The biggest decline came from big-ticket items (e.g. $250 or higher) where sales declined by 11.4%. States have had varying relationships with Amazon over the years. In South Carolina, for example, the state legislature <a href="https://blog.taxjar.com/states-where-amazon-com-collects-sales-tax/">gave Amazon</a> a break on their sales tax collection in exchange for creating jobs for the states' citizens. This break was going on despite the fact that Amazon had a huge fulfillment center in South Carolina, which would be sufficient enough to grant them nexus to the state. In addition, New Mexico <a href="http://kunm.org/post/apd-presses-ahead-reforms-gov-says-meaningless-bills-may-force-special-session">expects</a> to collect tens of millions of dollars in revenues generated by Amazon's collections in the state. The money will be distributed among the state's general fund and to the cities where the item was bought. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, the physical nexus tax loophole cost states $17.2 billion in 2016. </p>

<p>There has also been a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2016/01/13/the-true-cost-to-amazon-of-the-amazon-tax/?utm_term=.5bff7247199f">long history</a> of retailers opposing tax laws that would allow Amazon and other online companies to avoid charging customers, depending on the state, a sales tax on their purchases. Before Amazon even existed, the ruling that companies are only allowed to collect sales tax if they have a physical location in the states comes from a 1992 case--<u>Quill Corp v. North Dakota</u>. Hence, the lack of a physical nexus in a state is sufficient to exempt a corporation from having to pay sales taxes to that state. This may explain Amazon's desire to expand its distribution center outreach to every possible state that it can collect sales taxes from. In 2015, Supreme Court Justice Kennedy <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/03/03/justice-kennedys-opinion-supporting-states-collecting-taxes-on-internetmail-order-transactions/?utm_term=.f7bdcd89c8d3">stated</a> that changes in technology and consumer sophistication warrant a reversal of <u>Quill</u>, since a "business may be present in a State in a meaningful way, without that presence being physical in the traditional sense of the term." Justice Kennedy is correct in saying that technology now is far more advanced and complex than it was in 1992 and reversing <u>Quill</u> based on the current e-commerce structure holds merit. The Internet was in its infancy and corporations made little to no revenues off of their online businesses. For present day corporations involved in the retail space, however, the exact opposite is true. Online business is king. In March 2017, a group of online <a href="https://www.bna.com/online-sales-tax-n57982086318/">retailers sued</a> South Dakota for a March 2016 law that was passed requiring all online stores with sales in the state of more than $100,000 or 200 separate transactions to collect sales taxes. The issue is now before the South Dakota Supreme Court, and the next step would be the Supreme Court. Alabama, Tennessee and South Dakota are the three states currently involved in litigation battles over similar economic nexus related issues. These three states have responded to changes in the digital marketplace as part of "kill <u>Quill</u>" movement, and 20 more states are expected to join them through statute or administrative rule in 2017. </p>

<p><strong>Federal Solutions to Amazon </strong></p>

<p>Contrary to President Trump's July 24th tweet stating that Amazon is a "no-tax monopoly," Amazon does in fact<a href="https://www.bna.com/mnuchins-digital-tax-n73014462405/"> collect</a> a sales tax in 45 states. It doesn't collect tax in one specific instance, which deals with third-party sales organized through its marketplace platform. Minnesota and Washington have already enacted laws requiring marketplace distributors like Amazon and Etsy to collect tax on third-party transactions. Amazon's decision to increase its sales tax outreach is timely given the company's recent Whole Foods acquisition, which will inevitably increase their physical foothold across the country. Last week, testimony to help codify <u>Quill</u> took place, as the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust law held a hearing regarding <a href="https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr2887/BILLS-115hr2887ih.pdf">H.R. 287</a> [PDF], --the No Regulation without Representation Act (NRRA) This bill is intended to solve the issue of states taxing remote sellers name by (1) telling out-of-state businesses how to make or dispose of their products and (2) by imposing income tax or sales tax collection burdens on remote businesses.</p>

<p>In April, the Remote Transactions Parity Act, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr2193/BILLS-115hr2193ih.pdf">H.R. 2193</a> [PDF], and the Marketplace Fairness Act (MFA), <a href="http://src.bna.com/o6d">S. 976</a> [PDF], were introduced with the common goal of expanding states' taxing authority over remote retailers. Both Acts do a good job of limiting the compliance costs for out-of-state sellers, which has been a huge problem for states faced with sales tax issues. The Marketplace Fairness Act passed in the Senate in 2013 before stalling in the House. Not only would passing the MFA levy the sales on the federal level, but according to Pennsylvania Democratic Rep. Eddie Day Pashinski, it would provide an <a href="http://wesa.fm/post/closing-online-sales-loopholes-could-net-pa-revenue#stream/0">additional source</a> of revenue for a state that ended 2 percent below its projected revenue in 2016. Despite the fact that President Trump himself has trouble comprehending the fundamentals of Amazon's sales tax, it did not stop Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin from testifying before a Senate panel last week to say that the White House is "looking very closely at this issue." Collecting online sales taxes, per Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), for rural states could<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/07/26/trumps-treasury-secretary-is-looking-closely-at-online-sales-taxes/?utm_term=.8a7e8b57f547"> prove cumbersome</a> if not impossible because of the lack of resources to track down all these internet sales transactions. Even though there would be fewer transactions with a state like West Virginia than say Pennsylvania, Manchin's concern remains valid.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>President Trump's tweets will not deter Amazon from collecting a sales tax across 45 states. The NRRA and MFA bills put forth before the Senate, however, hold significance in determining whether Quill will be overturned after 25 years. The physical presence requirement of Quill will continue to stir controversy as companies generate large sums of revenue from their online sales. Behemoths like Amazon hold the advantage over remote retailers--who the two bills in front of the Senate could hurt the most. As Sen. Manchin mentioned, smaller retailers may lack the resources of a bigger corporation. What is certain is that Quill and Amazon's sales tax policies will continue to get opposition amongst legislative bodies and stakeholders alike. Trump's tweets notwithstanding.</p>

		<title>O.J.: What a Long Strange Trip It&#039;s Been, Keep the Cameras Rolling</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Royal Oakes discusses the newest chapter in O.J. Simpson's legal drama, and what it portends for the future...</p>

                <p>In a word association game you might not connect O.J. Simpson with the legendary group The Grateful Dead, but the group's signature lyric, "What A Long Strange Trip It's Been" seems an apt description of the fallen star's life - and that's just so far.  <br />
                    <br />
                    Fourteen million people <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-simpson-parole-ratings-20170721-story.html">tuned in </a>to watch Simpson's recent Nevada parole hearing.  That figure may be small potatoes compared to the 150 million who briefly put their lives on pause to watch the murder trial verdict in 1995, or the 95 million who watched the previous year's low-speed Bronco chase.  But, it's a testament to the continuing hold the Simpson saga has on the nation. <br />
                    <br />
                    As predicted, the parole board <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/20/us/oj-simpson-parole-hearing/index.html">agreed to release</a> Simpson, so he'll be walking the streets &#8212 probably in the Sunshine State &#8212 in October.  It's anybody's guess whether Simpson's future will be "conflict-free," as he characterized the first seventy years of his life (not sure how to spell the sound made by a loud guffaw, so let's just go with "guffaw").  But, it's reasonable to step back and deduce some takeaways from his checkered journey so far.<br />
                    <br />
                    1 - Simpson is a killer.  This is important to focus on, not just for the obvious reason fact that it's important to know if somebody who is in the public eye is actually responsible for the deaths of two people.  In addition, it's especially important because there are two Americas:  the America consisting of people over 35 who lived through Simpson trial and know exactly what happened; and, millennials, who lack such personal knowledge.  So just to set the record straight, O.J.'s and his victims' blood was all over the murder scene, his car, and his home; he wore size 12 Bruno Magli shoes and footprints matching that shoe style and size were at the murder scene; he had a gaping cut on his left hand and abrasions all over his body suggesting he'd been in a fight; he'd beaten his wife repeatedly, to the point where she called 911 and said she was convinced he was going to kill her; and finally, when the police called Simpson to tell him his ex-wife had been killed, Simpson (a) didn't ask how it happened (b) didn't ask if his two small kids were okay (he knew they lived with Nicole).<br />
                    <br />
                    2-- We need to toughen up parole rules.  I get that you have to incentivize the prison population to behave behind bars, with the possible reward of early release.  But, to the extent every state has its own laundry list of factors, and Nevada's list does not include looking at the fact the guy was a serial wife abuser, and then a double killer, well, to quote Al Pacino's character in his film "And Justice For All," there's something really wrong here.<br />
                    <br />
                    3-- We need to reexamine our priorities. Just because somebody is famous doesn't mean they should get a free pass, which is exactly what we provide in our society.  We worship the famous.  The concept of "liberty justice" isn't a myth, it's alive and well.  If somebody is famous for inventing the polio vaccine, I can see giving them a little break.  Maybe Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin Salk deserve a get out of jail free card. But because somebody has a nice singing voice, or makes you laugh in a sitcom, or was a really good running back, aren't reasons to treat them differently or better in the legal system. We pride ourselves on being dedicated to the idea that nobody is above the law.  <br />
                    <br />
                    So, when you see O.J. on Wilshire Boulevard or Miami Beach, I'm not saying you have to start screaming at him. But don't go for the selfie. Don't shake his hand. Don't ask for his autograph. Take a stand.  Shun the guy.  I realize it's not easy enforcing these moral standards. Most people probably think Michael Jackson was a child molester, but does anybody turn off "Thriller" when it comes on the radio? <br />
                    <br />
                    4-- Don't turn off the courtroom camera just because the Simpson murder trial was a circus. We're entitled to see our justice system at work. Sunlight is the best disinfectant. People behave better when they know they're being watched. <br />
                    <br />
                    <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/litigation/materials/sac2013/sac_2013/54_%20cameras_are_in_the_courts.authcheckdam.pdf">Studies regularly show</a> [PDF] the image of the judiciary improves when the cameras roll and people see the excellent job done by judicial officers.  The possibility that witnesses will be intimidated, or jurors will cheat and watch the evening news, or lawyers will play to the cameras, doesn't justify turning off the cameras and keeping the public in the dark.<br />
                    <br />
                    People learn from following high-profile trials.  In a society where a shocking percentage of the population couldn't name the three branches of the government if their lives depended on it, and couldn't pick the Vice President out of a lineup, at least by following celebrities in trouble they know the difference between the burdens of proof in criminal versus civil trials.  They understand there can be a civil trial following a not guilty verdict in a criminal trial, as in Simpson's situation.  In the Cosby case, people learned about how letting multiple victims testify turns on a judge's view of whether that would prove a "pattern and practice," as opposed to it being cumulative and prejudicial.  People learn about the double jeopardy rule, as in the Rodney King drama, where acquittals of police on state law brutality charges don't prevent a federal trial on civil rights violations.<br />
                    <br />
                    Simpson may still be playing the fourth quarter of his life, but we can learn a lot from the scoreboard as it stands right now. </p>

                <p><em>Royal Oakes, an acclaimed attorney and media expert was on the front lines of the O.J. Simpson trial, and among a select group of professionals brought before Judge Lance Ito to argue in support of placing cameras in the courtroom. As a result of his testimony, the trial was allowed in the open, and became the historic proceeding that continues to captivate people around the world today. He has frequently spoken on the case and its importance, as well as the legal implications the trial has left on society.</em></p>

President Trump's <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/25/presidential-executive-order-enhancing-public-safety-interior-united">January 25 executive order</a> threatening to deprive sanctuary cities of federal funding raised the stakes around this issue to an all-time high, with San Francisco and other cities <a href="https://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/california/candce/4:2017cv00485/307351/1">now suing the Trump administration</a> [PDF] over the constitutionality of the order.  </p>

                <p>The term "sanctuary city" typically refers to any local jurisdiction that has ordinances in place that limit their cooperation with federal authorities, such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), on immigration matters or limit the ability of local police to inquire about the immigration status of arrestees. <a href="https://cis.org/Map-Sanctuary-Cities-Counties-and-States">Such jurisdictions</a> include New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. </p>

                <p>In the wake of Trump's executive order, a series of questions has emerged relating to the rights of these localities and the resulting jurisdictional conflicts. In a recent example, U.S. District Judge William Orrick<a href="http://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000015d-6242-deb9-af7d-6b7644dd0000"> declined a request</a> [PDF] by the Justice Department to remove <a href="http://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000015b-a6d5-de92-a17b-aed55e780001">an earlier injunction</a> barring federal officials from cutting off grants from sanctuary cities. The focus of DOJ&#8217;s request was a <a href="http://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000015c-31f7-d476-abdf-7df76f8a0001">memo by Attorney General Jeff Sessions</a> [PDF] that purported to narrow the scope of the initial Executive Order; however, Judge Orrick ruled that the Attorney General's implementation guidance did not alter the analysis informing the court's initial decision to impose the injunction.</p>

                <p>More recently, Attorney General Sessions <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/984346/download">issued a requirement</a> [PDF] that cities receiving <a href="https://www.bja.gov/jag/">Byrne JAG grants</a> will have federal funding withheld if they don't cooperate with federal immigration authorities. However, many are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/26/us/politics/sessions-sanctuary-cities.html">openly questioning</a> the Justice Department's authority to impose such conditions.</p>

                <p>While these issues of jurisdiction and authority have played out amidst high public interest, there is another issue that has received far less attention in this debate: whether sanctuary cities could face civil liabilities when undocumented immigrants commit crimes within their jurisdictions.</p>

                <p>The now-famous <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/08/us/san-francisco-murder-case-exposes-lapses-in-immigration-enforcement.html">case involving Kate Steinle</a> illustrates the basic question: In 2015, a San Francisco woman named Kate Steinle was killed by a ricocheting bullet. The bullet was shot by Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, an undocumented immigrant who had been deported five times. Prior to Steinle's murder, Lopez-Sanchez was released from San Francisco County Jail despite a detention order from ICE for possible deportation, in part because there were no outstanding warrants for his arrest - as a sanctuary city, San Francisco limits cooperation with ICE in cases where there are no active charges against an immigrant.</p>

                <p>Kate Steinle's family filed a civil lawsuit against the City of San Francisco for negligence in the death of their daughter on grounds that the city should have heeded ICE's request to detain Lopez-Sanchez pursuant to federal statute, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1373">8 U.S. Code § 1373(a)</a>. A recent <a href="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2017/images/01/10/steinledecision.pdf">ruling</a> [PDF] dismissed the family&#8217;s claims.</p>

                <p>In other lawsuits challenging Trump's executive order threatening funding to sanctuary cities, this same issue is at play: whether 8 U.S. Code § 1373(a) creates a mandatory duty for local governments to cooperate with ICE and other federal immigration authorities. </p>

                <p>The question of whether local governments have a mandatory duty to cooperate with ICE is likely headed to higher courts in some form, and the outcome on this question may be dispositive for a range of legal issues from constitutional law to civil liability.</p>

                <p>If the courts determine that there is no mandatory requirement for sanctuary localities to cooperate with ICE, civil suits such as Steinle's may be estopped from separately litigating the issue of liability. However, even where a mandatory obligation is found, civil litigants will still face an uphill battle; plaintiffs would have to prove a causal link between disobeying federal immigration authorities and subsequent events leading to a crime.</p>

                <p>Negligence liability incurred by current sanctuary cities might impact other cities' consideration of taking on that status, perhaps creating a chilling effect that prevents localities from limiting their cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Local jurisdictions will need to weigh the value of fighting for (and potentially gaining) clearer independence from the federal government around how they define and protect their immigrant populations against the negative consequences associated with exposing themselves to newly clarified liabilities.</p>

                <p>The discussion around sanctuary cities highlights a larger debate on how much autonomy local governments, such as cities, have on shaping their own policies, even where those policies intersect with federal powers such as immigration. Sentiments brought to the surface within numerous forums vary widely, with walls built across political and geographic lines. Caught in the tension are nothing less than the rights of immigrants and citizens, concerns about safety and community relations, and competing visions of society. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnists <a href="https://apps.law.asu.edu/Apps/Faculty/Faculty.aspx?individual_id=65847">James G. Hodge, Jr.</a> of the <a href="https://law.asu.edu">Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law</a>, Arizona State University and Sarah A. Noe of the <a href="https://www.law.upenn.edu">University of Pennsylvania Law School</a> discuss the recent national call for a Presidential state of emergency in response to the opioid epidemic gripping the nation...</p><strong>O</strong>n July 31, 2017 President Donald J. Trump's <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/presidents-commission">White House Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis</a> issued its <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/ondcp/commission-interim-report.pdf">interim report</a> calling for the President to immediately declare a national state of emergency in response to an epidemic that is devastating individuals and communities across the country. </p>

<p>Led by <a href="http://nj.gov/governor/">New Jersey Governor Chris Christie</a>, the Commissioners (including Governors from North Carolina and Massachusetts) see no other viable legal option to better implement existing and innovative public health approaches to control this epidemic. Like many law- and policy-makers, we agree.</p>

<p><strong>The Spiraling Opioid Crisis</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/194042/opioids-viewed-serious-local-drug-problem.aspx">2016 Gallup poll</a>, approximately 43% of Americans believed overuse of opiates constitutes a crisis (or a very serious problem) in their local communities. From 1999 (largely considered the inception of the modern epidemic) to 2016, approximately <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/ondcp/commission-interim-report.pdf">600,000 lives</a> have been lost to abuse and misuse of these drugs in <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/opioids">prescription </a>(e.g. oxycodone, morphine, methadone, codeine) and <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/opioids">illicit</a> (e.g. heroin, furanyl fentanyl) forms. </p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/index.html">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC), 1,000 abusers are admitted to emergency departments across the US each day. Nearly <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/ondcp/commission-interim-report.pdf">150 Americans</a> die per day (or about 1,000 each week) from opiate addiction. Many of these persons never make it to hospitals or receive meaningful treatments. With a US health care system that fails to provide access for thousands to essential substance abuse services, some are denied care altogether.</p>

<p>The high profile death of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/17/arts/music/prince-opioid-death.html">Prince</a> in 2016 reflects the magnitude of this public health crisis. Absent major upgrades and resources to support efficacious public health interventions, it will only get worse. Millions of current users (and their family members and friends) will continue to be plagued by physical and mental injuries and the constant threat of lost lives. The next generation of users is already at risk. In 2015 nearly <a href="https://www.asam.org/docs/default-source/advocacy/opioid-addiction-disease-facts-figures.pdf">300,000 adolescents and teens</a> ages 12-17 used prescription pain relievers for non-medical purposes, as well as illicit opiates. Overseas shipments of street drugs, including direct mail-orders of the killer designer drug, <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2017/03/31/dea-made-in-china-lethal-opioid-fueling-u-s-drug-epidemic.html">furanyl fentanyl</a>, are arriving from China and elsewhere. </p>

<p>In addition to mega-societal costs in terms of lost productivity, externalities of widespread opiate abuse include additional negative health impacts and disabilities. Repeated uses of addictive opiates over time carry <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3466038/">long-term impacts on physical and mental health</a> even well after patients are clean. </p>

<p>Spread of serious infectious diseases is also tied to opiate use. In 2015, for example, elderly persons' sharing of prescription opiates with younger persons in rural <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1507252?rss=searchAndBrowse#t=article">Scott County, Indiana</a> contributed to dozens of HIV infections via injecting drug use. Then Governor and current Vice President Mike Pence was forced declare a state-based public health emergency to facilitate access to needle exchange programs for area residents. </p>

<p><strong>Insufficient Public and Private Sector Responses</strong></p>

<p>Unlike other types of health emergencies, such as <a href="http://www.ct.gov/dph/cwp/view.asp?a=3115&q=554740">Ebola</a> in 2015 or <a href="http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2016/02/020416-zika-declaration-public-health-emergency.html">Zika</a> in 2016, the opioid epidemic has not snuck up on an unsuspecting public. Americans have been experiencing this train wreck for over 18 years through four Presidential administrations. Fueled by <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_167496.html">rampant over-prescribing practices</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/lacking-treatment-options-opioid-addicts-turn-to-black-market-1498132803">black markets for illicit drugs</a>, opiate use proliferates. Everyone knows someone at risk; many have felt losses among their families or friends. </p>

<p>Governmental authorities have responded in kind. Multiple federal, state, and tribal agencies are already conducting or supporting significant treatment, screening, and surveillance efforts. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is urging private sector development of alternatives to existing opiate-based painkillers. CDC is pleading with doctors to cease over-prescribing. Customs and Border Control agents are making busts to stem the flow of opiates. Law enforcers have shifted from prosecuting minor offenses to targeting dealers and unscrupulous doctors engaged in massive schemes to share these drugs with persons who do not need them for pain management. Emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and lay persons are using life-saving naloxone without fear of potential liability.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.networkforphl.org/_asset/0h6mx4/Fact-Sheet---Declarations-of-Emergencies---Opioid-Crisis.pdf">Governors in 6 states </a> [PDF] (AK, AZ, FL, MA, MD, and VA) and <a href="https://www.networkforphl.org/_asset/0h6mx4/Fact-Sheet---Declarations-of-Emergencies---Opioid-Crisis.pdf">multiple tribal leaders</a> [PDF] have already declared states of emergency specifically to quell the epidemic. Larger cities like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Phoenix are spending millions of federal, state, and municipal dollars to combat the daily carnage. By comparison <a href="https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2017/03/daily-chart-3">rural areas</a> can only devote fractions of these amounts to address opiate use in their communities despite considerably higher rates of lives lost per capita in small towns.</p>

<p><strong>Time for a Declaration of National Emergency</strong> </p>

<p>Although public and private efforts are purposeful, they remain insufficient. Widespread opiate access is already one of the deadliest threats to the public's health in modern history. It is time for President Trump to label this crisis what it really is: <em>a public health emergency with <a href="https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column/expert-view/opioid-crisis-becomes-national-security-threat">national security implications</a> and devastating impacts for Americans</em>. As <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/ondcp/commission-interim-report.pdf">recommended by the Commission</a>, a national emergency declaration can positively change the legal and policy landscape to: </p>

<blockquote></blockquote>•	reimburse state Medicaid programs to cover treatment facilities, opening up access to care to tens of thousands in existing facilities across the country;

<blockquote></blockquote>•	instruct doctors in proper practices in pain management for prescribing opiates;

<blockquote></blockquote>•	expand access to, and funding for, existing and new medication-assisted treatment (MAT) through the National Institutes of Health (NIH);

<blockquote></blockquote>•	generate model legislation for states to facilitate law enforcement officials' access to life-saving naloxone for affected individuals;

<blockquote></blockquote>•	couple naloxone with high-risk opioid prescriptions for patients seeking remedies for their pain; and

<blockquote></blockquote>•	waive existing provisions of federal law that inhibit effective responses, including privacy laws derailing providers from reviewing public health data across states on fraudulent prescription practices and opioid abusers.

<p>These recommendations are an excellent start, but a national emergency raises additional opportunities. As per prior declarations, it compels public and private sectors to coordinate essential preventive measures. National emergencies are often a catalyst for substantial infusions of funding desperately needed by <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/04/health/opioid-emergency-declaration-importance/index.html">state, tribal, and local governments</a> to implement proven measures and try new ones. Hospitals, clinics, EMTs, and health care workers require more training, treatments, universal safety equipment, and expertise to immediately improve outcomes for patients. </p>

<p>Americans already hooked on opiates need assurances that government is seeking proven and emerging paths to improve their health and save their lives. A declaration may also serve as a national alert for millions more to avoid the scourge of opiate addiction altogether.   </p>

<p>Conversely, civil libertarians and others may be concerned about the potential for a national emergency to usher in overly <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/04/health/opioid-emergency-declaration-importance/index.html">paternalistic interventions</a> via government. This is always possible. Who can forget Governor Christie's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/nyregion/nurse-in-newark-to-be-allowed-to-finish-ebola-quarantine-at-home-christie-says.html">reckless administration of quarantine powers in New Jersey</a> during the Ebola outbreak in October 2015, or his promise to consider the <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2016/02/06/christie-quarantine-zika-patients/">quarantine of Zika patients</a> in 2016 despite a lack of public health efficacy for either measure? What President Trump may actually endorse or authorize to combat opiates is a sobering question. Heavy-handed public health interventions may predictably be pursued by a federal administration seeking rapid results following its recent failures to reform national health care. </p>

<p>Still, the current circumstances are too dire to ignore a national plea for emergency interventions. In 2015 more than <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/04/health/opioid-emergency-declaration-importance/index.html">38% of Americans used prescribed opioids</a>. Given the strong correlation of persons engaged in <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/cdc-opiate-addiction-572498">prolonged use of opioids becoming addicted</a>, millions more are at risk. Within constitutional constraints, President Trump is empowered to positively improve the health and security of millions of Americans through a timely declaration and resulting, bipartisan uses of emergency powers and resources. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.syr.edu/profile/david-crane1">David M. Crane</a> of the <a href="http://law.syr.edu">Syracuse University College of Law</a> discusses how President Trump is using the conflict with North Korea to divert attention from his own shortcomings...</p><strong>T</strong>yrants need a war. Looking back over the past hundred years one finds that tyrants come to power in conflict and remains in power largely due to conflict. It centers the populace, distracting them from other societal challenges to include their civil liberties.</p>

<p>Politically weak or insecure leaders also need a distraction. I call those distractions boogeymen--nations, a peoples, or culture that the leader perceives to be a threat to the national security. This boogeyman also distracts from the political challenges both real and imagined that leader faces. Hitler had the Jews; Stalin capitalism; the Ayatollah the "Great Satin," and Assad "terrorists" by way of a few examples.</p>

<p>Dictators and other leaders need a populace that is afraid. Fear is a powerful psychological tool to govern with and leaders use it for various reasons. A populace that is afraid of "something" looks to its leader for security and a solution. This is where the shadow of a boogeyman is useful. Fear can bring a society together in common cause.</p>

<p>Historically these conflicts created by a tyrant, dictator or insecure leader rarely succeed. The immediate result may be a distraction, but in the long term that nation, and its leader, end up weakened and in some cases worse off than they were before the conflict. Various circumstances intervene that were unintended consequences. History shows that these unintended consequences rarely benefit a leader.</p>

<p>Only the citizens of that country suffer those consequences. Simply put some of their loved ones do not come home. Tens of thousands perish their nation weakened politically and economically by the conflict. The nation itself loses stature internationally. Weakened trade through sanctions and other action only bring more unrest and insecurity.</p>

<p>The result is a country in worse shape than before the conflict. It all blows up in the tyrant's face, with more unrest and division a result. In this information age, conflict is bad for global trade and business, unlike the industrial age where conflict was good for business. The world suffers from this type of threat and conflict as well.</p>

<p>As our President, politically weak, deeply insecure and challenged on all fronts looks for a distraction and a boogeyman, he conveniently has been handed one in the guise of Kim Jong-un and North Korea. From the President's point of view, he has a "twofer," a threat worthy of a conflict and a boogeyman. To maintain his political relevancy (and to silence whatever demons whisper to him) a looming crisis with nuclear implications is just what the doctor ordered. Words such as "<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/10/politics/trump-north-korea/index.html">fire and fury</a>" ring true to him.</p>

<p>Suddenly the Russia scandal is off the front page. No one is talking about collusion, conspiracy, perjury or obstruction of justice. Attention is diverted across the Pacific Ocean to a hermit kingdom led by a crafty leader who uses just this type of tension to maintain his own power. </p>

<p>Kim Jong-un is a dictator, he needs a looming conflict, and he needs that boogeyman, as well, to distract his citizenry away from daily famine towards an impending attack by their boogeyman, the United States. The President has handed him politically a reason to lead his nation and consolidate power on a silver platter.</p>

<p>We have an insecure and an unstable leader in our President now in a possible "dance of death" with a brutal tyrant who is "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/opinion/trump-crazy-like-a-fox-or-just-crazy.html">crazy like a fox</a>."  In my mind, this does not auger well for our national security or international peace and security. To these leaders all this is necessary for political power reasons. Without this tension and possible apocalyptic conflict, their relevancy is threatened. Even if we do not jump into the abyss toward war on the Korean Peninsula, it shows that our President is willing to put our populace in jeopardy for his own political gain.</p>

<p>The actual boogeyman in all this is our own President. Willing to sacrifice it all for personal gain and power. Where are the "the Generals" who actually control the national security apparatus, the White House Chief of Staff, the Secretary of Defense and the National Security Advisor? Are they going to let this happen? They know the true consequences of war.  The President does not. Beware the boogeyman! </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.cla.purdue.edu/polsci/directory/?p=Louis_Beres">Louis René Beres</a> of the <a href="https://www.cla.purdue.edu/">Purdue University College of Liberal Arts</a> discusses President Donald Trump's recent antics and how they will affect the potential for nuclear action...</p><strong>I</strong>ncreasingly, Donald Trump is showing palpable signs of debility. Most worrisome, in this sobering display, is the president's conspicuously proud disregard for science, history, diplomacy, intelligence, and jurisprudence. Less easily documented, perhaps, but still worth noting, is Mr. Trump's blithely disjointed and generally incoherent approach to affairs of state.</p>

<p>In just one hyperbolic talk dealing with North Korea on August 11, he managed to repeatedly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/10/donald-trump-russia-diplomats-north-korea">thank Russian President Putin</a> for helping to save US federal dollars (by his expulsion of many American diplomats) and also to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/11/donald-trump-venezuela-crisis-military-intervention">announce a possible use of US military force against Venezuela.</a> <em>Venezuela</em>?</p>

<p>In candor, these intellectual and emotional debilities are seriously concerning, especially when they are: (1) frequently intersecting and mutually reinforcing; (2) considered together with this President's persistently willing subservience to his more experienced Russian counterpart; and (3) assessed within the relevant statutory and Constitutional parameters of US nuclear command authority.</p>

<p>In principle, at least, such alarming personal traits are not distinctive to President Donald Trump. At a more expressly generic level, they represent certain continuously complex matters about which I have been lecturing and publishing for almost half a century. If I might now be allowed to share some closely related insights, they might help us better understand just how irremediably perilous the Trump presidency could rapidly become.</p>

<p>In essence, the cumulative security risks we face as a nation are potentially immediate and prospectively existential. Most obvious, in this regard, is the stubbornly bewildering problem of North Korea. Here, the president's indiscriminate confusion of belligerent rhetoric with actual power can only lead us further away from indispensable national security. To be sure, even as quixotic an adversary as Kim Jung Un can tell the critical difference between meaningful military capacity and utterly shallow bombast.</p>

<p>Again, it is high time for candor. We live at a moment when certain "minuscule" escalatory misjudgments in Washington or Pyongyang could sometime create staggering and irreversible harms. Mr. Trump must finally understand that world politics are not analogous to commercial real estate, and that authentic national security is not generally subject to linguistic contrivance or artful deal making. </p>

<p>More urgently than any other specific hazard, the President must make himself suitably informed about all pertinent nuclear conflict matters. Correspondingly, both the Congress and the citizenry must keep a much closer watch on Mr. Trump's discernible willingness to take nuclear war seriously. In this connection, he will likely need to be reminded that no scientifically accurate estimates of nuclear war probability are logically possible. This is because true probabilities must always be based upon a determinable frequency of past events, and because there has never been a nuclear war event. Never.</p>

<p>The American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 "don't count" as nuclear war examples. It follows that in any upcoming nuclear crisis situations, a casually dismissive presidential stance on expected outcomes could produce unexpected and intolerable results. Quickly.</p>

<p>I have been studying nuclear warfare issues for a long time. After four years at Princeton in the late 1960s, long an intellectual center of American nuclear strategic thought, I first began to think about adding a modest personal contribution to the growing literatures of first-generation nuclear thinkers. Accordingly, by the late 1970s, I was busily preparing <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apocalypse-Nuclear-Catastrophe-World-Politics/dp/0226043606">an original manuscript on U.S. nuclear strategy</a>, and on certain corollary risks of nuclear war. At that time, moreover, I was already specifically interested in questions of presidential authority to order the use of American nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>Among other things, I learned that reliable safeguards had been carefully built into all American nuclear command/control decisions, but also that these reassuring safeguards would not apply at the presidential level. To a young scholar, this ironic disjunction didn't make any obvious sense, especially in a world where national leadership irrationality was assuredly not without precedent. For needed clarifications, I then reached out to retired General Maxwell D. Taylor, a distinguished former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In rapid response to my query, General Taylor sent me a detailed handwritten reply. Dated 14 March 1976, the General's informed letter concluded presciently: "As to those dangers arising from an irrational American president, the only protection is not to elect one."</p>

<p>Until now, I had never really given any extended thought to this disturbingly truthful but authoritative response. Instead, I had assumed that somehow "the system" would always operate precisely according to plan. Today, with the discordant presidency of Donald Trump coinciding with a North Korean nuclear standoff, General Taylor's 1976 warning must take on greater and more compelling meaning. Now, however reluctantly, we must realistically assume that if President Trump were ever to exhibit profound emotional instability, irrationality, or patently delusional behavior, he could nonetheless order the use of American nuclear weapons, and do so without any calculable expectations of any official "disobedience."</p>

<p>At this point, a core question should come immediately to mind. What should be done by the National Command Authority (Secretary of Defense, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, National Security Advisor, and presumptively several others) if it should ever decide to oppose a determinably inappropriate presidential order to launch American nuclear weapons? Could the National Command Authority reliably "save the day" by acting in an impromptu or creatively ad hoc fashion? Or should there already be in place aptly credible and effective statutory measures to (1) meaningfully assess the ordering president's reason and judgment; and (2) promptly countermand the wrongful order?</p>

<p>In law, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei">Article 1</a> (Congressional) war-declaring expectations of the Constitution notwithstanding, any presidential order to use nuclear weapons, whether issued by an apparently irrational president, or by an otherwise incapacitated one, should be obeyed. To do otherwise in such dire circumstances would be prima facie illegal; that is, impermissible on its face. Additionally, President Trump could order the first use of American nuclear weapons even if this country were not under a specifically nuclear attack.</p>

<p>Here, too, a further strategic and legal distinction must be made between first use and first strike. There exists an elementary but vitally important difference, significantly one that candidate Donald Trump had completely failed to understand during his 2016 campaign debates. This core difference has to do with distinguishing essential self-defense from aggression. <a href="http://www.internationalcrimesdatabase.org/Crimes/CrimeOfAggression">Aggression is a codified crime under international law</a>. It is, therefore, reciprocally prohibited by US law.</p>

<p>Where should American nuclear policy go from here? To begin, a coherent and comprehensive answer will need to be prepared for the following genuinely basic question: If faced with any presidential order to use nuclear weapons, and not offered sufficiently appropriate corroborative evidence of any actually impending existential threat, would the  National Command Authority be: (1) willing to disobey?, and (2) capable of enforcing such seemingly well-founded expressions of disobedience?</p>

<p>In such unprecedented nuclear crisis circumstances, all authoritative decisions could have to be made in a compressively time-urgent matter of minutes. Needless to say, such chronological constraints could quickly become overriding.</p>

<p>The only time to prepare for such incontestably vital national security questions is now. This is the case whether or not President Donald Trump should incrementally prove himself to be a more-or-less stable and capable crisis decision-maker. Though we might all draw a huge sigh of relief when the current North Korean nuclear crisis subsides, there will inevitably arise other similar or even more portentous atomic emergencies. To then respond purposefully, as needed, this country will require more than a purely stream-of-consciousness or seat-of-the-pants prescription from the White House. Much more.</p>

<p>There is one last but still important point. Whether it is in reference to a proposed military intervention in Venezuela, or to a considered military action against North Korea, the American president is bound not only by US law, but also by international law. The latter, which is discoverable, inter alia, in various customary norms as well as in bilateral and multilateral treaties, is always an integral part of American law. Such "incorporation" is most prominently expressed at <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">Article 6 of the US Constitution</a> (the "Supremacy Clause") and also at various major US Supreme Court decisions.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, Donald Trump's policies for dealing with North Korean nuclear threats must always be consistent with American military requirements and with US jurisprudential obligations. Striking the necessary and optimal balance between both coincident imperatives will inevitably confront this president with intellectual and ethical challenges of the highest order. For the moment, at least, it does not appear likely that he will be able to meet such bewildering and overlapping challenges. Not at all.</p>

<p>If there is to be any residual hope for effectively meeting these complex expectations, it will have to lie in substantially greater presidential familiarity with both American and North Korean military capabilities. Following ancient Chinese strategist Sun/Tzu in <a href="https://suntzusaid.com/artofwar.pdf">The Art of War</a>: "One who knows the enemy and knows himself will not be endangered in a hundred engagements." In the precipitous nuclear age, this sage advice has become more demanding and also more valuable than ever before. Should it be overlooked or disregarded in Washington, President Donald Trump could suddenly find himself committing an irrevocable and potentially catastrophic miscalculation.</p>

<p>This risk would be especially high during foreseeable circumstances of competitive risk-taking with Kim Jung Un, that is, in deliberative moments when each side is desperately seeking "escalation dominance."</p>

<p>Like many other branches of international law, International Humanitarian Law (IHL) grew exponentially after World War II, with a view toward expanding the scope of the protection of the victims of armed conflict, which  ultimately resulted in the adoption of the four Geneva Conventions of 1949. <br />
 <br />
Although the four Geneva Conventions were comprehensive and universally accepted by all states, they did not address the emerging problems and changing character of armed conflicts. Immediately following the Geneva Conventions, the 1950s and 1960s were an era of decolonization in Asia and Africa, and were the decades in which several additional international human rights instruments were adopted, such as the 1951 Refugee Convention, the 1966 Human Rights Covenants, and regional human rights treaties.  Along with these developments, the need to revise the law governing the means and methods of warfare was also felt, as it had not been revised since the Hague Regulations of 1907.  To remedy these shortcomings, two Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions were adopted in 1977 to make international humanitarian law more effective, comprehensive, and universal, so as to adapt to modern problems and conflicts.<br />
 <br />
<a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl/intro/470">Additional Protocol I</a> (AP I) deals with international armed conflicts (IAC) whereas <a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl/INTRO/475?OpenDocument">Additional Protocol II</a> (AP II) deals with non-international armed conflicts (NIAC). Although powerful countries like the United States and India vehemently participated in the negotiation of these two protocols, they have not ratified them.  Four decades later, this writing explores whether the reasons then advanced by India for non-ratification still hold up.<br />
<strong><br />
India's Position during Negotiation of Additional Protocol I: A Critical Evaluation. </strong></p>

<p>Additional Protocol I, which deals with IAC, brought four major developments in IHL as compared to four Geneva Conventions of 1949: (1) the expansion of definition of International Armed Conflicts; (2) Means and methods of Warfare; (3) Modification of conditions for combatant status; and (4) establishment of International fact finding commission. </p>

<p>The first crucial development brought by AP I was the significant change to the definition of IAC. Prior to this, IAC was basically understood as to be taking place between two or more states having recourse to armed forces. Article 1 (4) of AP I says:</p>

<blockquote>The situations referred to in the preceding paragraph include armed conflicts in which peoples are fighting against colonial domination and alien occupation and against racist regimes in the exercise of their right of self-determination, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.</blockquote>

<p>In the sixth meeting of the First Session, Mr. Haskar, Indian representative, <a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/RC-records_Vol-14.pdf">said</a> [PDF] that many delegations, including his own, were agreed on the principle that the struggle of national liberation movements should clearly come within the framework of international armed conflicts and consequently within the scope of AP I.  Accordingly, India not only supported the participation of national liberation movements in the negotiation of AP I but expressed its consent to Article 1(4).  Therefore Article 1(4) of AP I cannot be considered as hurdle for India to become party to it as there is still no major change in the material circumstances.</p>

<p>The second significant development brought by AP I was relating to Means and Methods of warfare.  Article 35 of AP I (draft article 33) deals with the basic rules of part III on method and means of warfare, and Article 36 (draft article 34) deals with "new weapons" as adopted by consensus.  AP I Article 48 (Draft article 43), which deals with basic rules for the protection of civilian population, was also adopted by consensus.  The consensual adoption of these significant provisions dealing with the means and methods of warfare is testimony to India's consent on the inclusion of these provisions in AP I. </p>

<p>There are a plethora of weapons treaties to which India is a party and therefore it can be argued that India's position during the negotiations, and its later practice, would become inconsistent if it considers the provisions dealing with the means and methods of warfare as a hurdle in ratifying APs.</p>

<p>The third important change brought by AP I is the modification of combatant status as provided in Article 44(3), applicable only in situations of occupation or situations falling under Article 1(4).  India, along with other third world countries, supported the participation of national liberation movements within the definition of armed conflicts under Article 1(4).  Therefore, it can be argued that modification of combatant status under Article 44 (3), which primarily suits the situation defined in Article 1(4), cannot be a ground for India's refusal to ratify AP I.</p>

<p>The fourth novel contribution of AP I is the establishment of an International Fact -Finding Commission to inquire into any facts alleged to be a grave breach as defined in the Conventions and AP I.  India objected to this idea and supported relying on existing institutional mechanisms to resolve disputes.  India believed that the proposed commission might be used for political propaganda, which may result into non-co-operation between the parties.  But if we carefully peruse Article  90(2)(a), it explicitly says that a state does not automatically recognize commission's competence by signing or ratifying the Protocol I, but has to separately consent to the formation of the Commission.  Therefore even if India had problems with the establishment of a fact-finding commission, it may still become party to the protocol since the obligation under Article 90 is optional and non-binding.</p>

<p><strong>India's Position during Negotiation of Additional Protocol II: A Critical Evaluation.</strong></p>

<p>From the inception of the diplomatic conferences leading up to AP I and AP II, India persistently objected to the Draft Protocol II, which covered NIAC.  In the 39th Plenary Meeting, the Indian delegation raised strong objections to the very idea of AP II on the grounds that once the national liberation movements had been included in AP I and given the status of international conflicts, AP II would be redundant and unnecessary.  Indian representatives argued that the situation was entirely different with NIAC because these were essentially law and order problems within the exclusive domestic jurisdiction of each state.  The Indian delegation was of the view that Article 3 of AP II was designed to address the situations of struggle for national independence and sovereignty, despite their incorporation in Article 1(4) of AP I.  Therefore, the Indian delegation believed that the draft AP II, which was supposed to be based on common article 3 was pointless.  When draft Article 1 of AP II dealing with the material field of application was put to voting during the plenary meeting, India voted against it. Nevertheless, India participated during the negotiation on various provisions of AP II.</p>

<p>India's position that with the exception of national liberation movements, any other conflicts taking place wholly within the territory of a state should be resolved through domestic legal frameworks can be challenged on at least two grounds.  First, it is factually incorrect and conceptually narrow to limit the existence of NIAC only to national liberation movements.  NIAC may take place for various reasons other than anti-colonial struggles, such as ethnic conflict or civil wars, ideology based movements (like Maoist movements in south Asia), and movement based on issues related to natural resources.  Second, the primary criteria that governs the application of IHL is gravity of conflict on the territory of a state and its humanitarian consequences.  The national liberation movements were included in the category of IAC out of concern for the conflict's gravity and humanitarian considerations.  Accordingly, the same analogy can be applied to NIAC without going into their reasons and consequences. Therefore India's refusal to accept the existence of NIAC goes against the factual and conceptual reality of the existence of different forms of NIAC and also against the fundamental criteria on which IHL is premised.</p>

<p>In the light of above discussion, it is time for India to ratify the Additional Protocols of 1977 so as to ensure greater respect and protection to the rights of its own citizens. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Louis Rene Beres of Purdue University discusses President Trump's potentially problematic access to and control over America's nuclear arsenal, an issue relatively unaddressed amidst the constant discussion of Trump-related scandal...</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, insanity is not a proper medical or psychiatric term, but rather a more-or-less acceptable legal description. Nonetheless, as a convenient shorthand for exploring mental illness or emotional debility in current presidential decision-making circumstances, the term is apt and useful. In essence, at an historical moment when there are increasingly serious and legitimate grounds for questioning Donald J. Trump's mental stability, it is high-time for a qualified analytic look at presidential authority within an up-till-now obscured area of decision.</p>

<p>This normally opaque area concerns the capacity to launch American nuclear weapons.<br />
	<br />
In 1976, then just five years out of Princeton as a newly-minted Ph.D., I began work on an original book, <em>Apocalypse: Nuclear Catastrophe in World Politics</em>, published in 1980, about nuclear war and nuclear terrorism. From the start, I was especially centered on US presidential prerogatives to order the firing of nuclear weapons. More precisely, I was interested in the always more-or-less plausible prospect of presidential irrationality. </p>

<p>In pertinent technical terms, this did not mean a US president who was "clinically insane" (potentially the most worrisome sort of concern), but "only" one who might sometime value a specific preference or combination of preferences more highly than American national survival. Today, of course, we worry about leadership irrationality in certain other states, most conspicuously <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/un-security-council-passes-sanctions-against-individuals-and-groups-to-north-korea-sanctions-list---.php">North Korea</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/senate-introduces-bill-to-expand-iran-sanctions.php">Iran</a>.</p>

<p>Back then, with already an expressly American  focus in mind, I telephoned former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, General Maxwell Taylor, who promptly responded with a letter on March 14, 1976. Worth indicating at the outset is a noteworthy linguistic twist or nuance. As the General's letter explicitly referenced the dangers of an "irrational American president," there can be no properly automatic extrapolation of his diagnosis or recommendations to a US Chief Executive who is seemingly more than irrational -  that is, one who is "crazy," "mad," or "insane." </p>

<p>At the same time, it is hard to imagine that General Taylor would in any way hesitate to include these characterizations of an even more advanced decisional "pathology" within the subject-matter scope of his original warning. This is the case, moreover, even though such characterizations are not truly scientific, and are more plainly directed toward ordinary layperson forms of discourse.</p>

<p>There could, after all, be no convincing or even conceivable reason to warn soberly against US presidential "irrationality," but not against out and out presidential "insanity." Either way, our present concern must be with any emotionally or mentally debilitated president, whether "merely" irrational, or more distressingly, "insane."   Whichever seemingly applies,  the vital questions going forward will have to do with Constitutional, statutory and various other sources of war-making authority, especially the corollary right to order the use of nuclear weapons. </p>

<p>Some of the most urgent questions here should relate to assorted and sometimes subtle intersections of international law and U.S. law. From the beginning of the United States, international law has been part of its national law. Early on, Chief Justice John Marshall, among others, asserted and reasserted that all international law - whatever its source - had been<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5818762505482150880"> fully incorporated</a> into the law of the United States.</p>

<p>Under current U.S. law, whatever its particular jurisprudential origins, a president may correctly use force once Congress has declared a war, or after the US (and/or its citizens) has already been attacked. As to permissible kinds of force, or corresponding levels of force, these operational decisions would be determinable according to the longstanding laws of war of international law (the comprehensive law of armed conflict or humanitarian international law), and also the pertinent municipal law of the United States. Notably, in any such foreseeable circumstances, there would exist no clearly identifiable prohibitions against nuclear force <em>per se</em>.</p>

<p>Instead, all non-weapon-specific prohibitions would apply broadly, that is, to the extent that <em>any</em> U.S. retaliation or counter-retaliation could sometime violate the incontrovertible expectations of <em>discrimination</em> (sometimes also called "distinction"), <em>proportionality</em>, and/or <em>military necessity</em>.</p>

<p>Both the U.S. Constitution and the War Powers Act place strict limits on any president's authority to initiate hostilities with a foreign power, whether by conventional or nuclear means. A relevant grey area has to do with the Commander-in- Chief's right to strike first preemptively; that is, as an expression of "anticipatory" self-defense. Here, the authorizing component of permissibility is perception of any sufficiently grave danger that is "imminent in point of time." Logically, the relevant criteria of "imminence" cannot be the same today as they were back in 1837. </p>

<p>That was the year of <em><a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/br-1842d.asp">the Caroline</a></em>, the classic but also pre-nuclear case setting the legal standard for all subsequent preemptive national action, meaning that a state could undertake a preemptive strike against a danger posed if such danger was "instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation."<br />
	<br />
Now, what should we expect from President Donald Trump if he should sometime reason that a nuclear attack on the United States or its allies is "imminent in point of time?" Shall we stay comfortable with leaving such a profoundly existential judgment to his own personal authoritative decision of the moment? Or should this eleventh-hour option more plainly be a matter of shared or "concurrent authority" <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/669">with the Congress</a>? </p>

<p>In actual practice, applicable questions of law are apt to be subordinated to an overarching and ubiquitous assumption  that the president's final authority in defending the United States must never be challenged during any still-impending or already-ongoing crisis, especially where an enemy nuclear attack might be contemplated. In brief, this means that an American president, even if authentically irrational or insane, would likely have his military commands obeyed, up to and including any order to use nuclear weapons, and whether employed preemptively, in retaliation, or in counter-retaliation. It also means that while a wide variety of redundant safeguards already exists to prevent any unauthorized use of American nuclear weapons up and down the nuclear chain of command, no parallel safeguards exist at the very top or apex of the critical decisional pyramid.</p>

<p>It remains possible, of course, and even potentially desirable in certain circumstances, that a presidential order to use nuclear weapons would be disobeyed at one or another critical level of implementation. Strictly speaking, however, as any such expression of disobedience would presumptively be "illegal," it is assuredly not sufficiently probable in <em>extremis atomicum</em>. In this connection, the staggering irony of our actually having to hope for at least certain high-level instances of disobedience or chain-of-command failures ought not to be lost. <em>Prima facie</em>, it reveals that our extant nuclear-decision safeguards are overwhelmingly inadequate.</p>

<p>Also worth mentioning is that there could be nothing meaningfully scientific about ascertaining accurate probabilities in such matters. This is because (1) mathematical probability must always be determined according to the discernible frequency of past events;  and because (2) there haven't been any pertinent past events (unless we were willing to "count" the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962).<br />
	<br />
Is the US nuclear authority dilemma remediable in any still-promising way? "The best protection," I first learned from General Maxwell Taylor forty-one years ago, "is not to elect" an irrational president. But now, as such straightforward advice cannot be acted upon retroactively, the residually "best protection" must inevitably lie in appropriately vigilant oversight by the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  the National Security Advisor, and certain select others. This includes their predictably reliable willingness - either singly, or in collaboration with each other - to disobey a presumptively irrational or insane presidential nuclear order. Paradoxically, such willingness could still be defended as law-enforcing under those universally binding Nuremberg Principles (1946) that obligate all persons (especially senior government officials, everywhere) to resist "crimes of state."</p>

<p>Because war and crimes against humanity are not mutually exclusive, compliance with overriding Nuremberg Principles could be necessary not only to limit aggression, but also to prevent genocide. <br />
	<br />
Ultimately, the most serious threat posed by the Trump presidency is the heightened risk of a nuclear war, whether by deliberateness, miscalculation or by accident.<br />
	<br />
Ultimately, our very best chance of avoiding or surviving this grievous threat could depend less upon tangible law and institutions than upon the last-minute courage of a tiny handful of senior officials.<br />
	<br />
Ultimately, and ideally buttressed by both national and international law, such recognizable virtue could become the best or perhaps only way to compensate for the longstanding <em>de facto</em> American failure to heed General Taylor's 1976 warning. This dispassionate earlier alarm, which had simply cautioned "not to elect" a potentially "irrational" American president, should now be extended to include a potentially "insane" Commander-in-Chief. This sharply pointed advice is not gratuitously disrespectful to President Donald Trump; it is rather, only reasonable and prudent.<br />
	<br />
"The safety of the people," says Cicero for all time in <em>De Legibus</em> ("On The Laws") "shall be the highest law."</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Sarah Silverhardt of St. John's University discusses the implications of continued ignorance of serial rapists on college campuses...</j:header> <strong>U</strong>nlike your Sunday marathon of <a href="https://www.nbc.com/law-and-order-special-victims-unit">Law & Order: Special Victims Unit</a>, this heinous crime was real. Two Virginia students both abducted and murdered, and both body remains were found five miles apart on a rural farm. Coincidence? Definitely not. During the fall of 2009, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/apps/g/page/local/timeline-the-case-of-morgan-harrington/1347/">Morgan Harrington</a>, a Virginia Tech University student, disappeared after she left a concert. Fast-forward five years later, on September 13, 2014, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/24/us/virginia-hannah-graham-remains-identified/index.html">Hannah Graham</a>, a sophomore at the University of Virginia, went missing from the downtown area of Charlottesville, Virginia. Thirty-five days later, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/30/justice/virginia-missing-women/index.html">DNA evidence connected</a> Morgan Harrington, Hannah Graham, and an anonymous 2005 rape victim to one perpetrator: <a href="http://wtvr.com/2016/03/03/the-disturbing-timeline-of-jesse-matthews-sexual-violence-and-murder/">Jesse L. Matthew</a>.  </p>

<p>Officials soon discovered that Matthew's crimes dated back even earlier.  In 2002, Matthew played football for Liberty University in Virginia, where he was kicked off the team after an alleged sexual assault. No criminal charges were filed but he was suspended before leaving the university. After transferring to Christopher Newport University, Matthew was again accused of sexual assault. As allegations were pending there, Matthew left before any charges were filed and an investigation could commence. </p>

<p>The Jesse Matthew story epitomizes the campus serial rapist who moves from campus to campus raping and sexually assaulting women without ever getting caught under the flawed <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1681">Title IX</a> system. As horrific as his record is, Matthew's commission of numerous rapes on or about college campuses is not at all exceptional. Unfortunately, serial sexual perpetrators are all too common in our colleges and universities. In a <a href="http://www.davidlisak.com/wp-content/uploads/pdf/RepeatRapeinUndetectedRapists.pdf">2002 study</a> [PDF] conducted by David Lasiak and Paul M. Miller, two clinical psychologists known for their research on campus sexual violence, 1,882 male students from a mid-sized university participated in a questionnaire about "childhood experiences and adult functioning." To be classified as a "rapist," the participant had to respond in the affirmative to particular behavioral questions that described sexual acts, without using words such as "rape" or "assault." A series of questions followed regarding the participant's age, number of victims and number of times the conduct happened. The results revealed that 6.4% of participants admitted to campus rape or attempted rape. Of admitted rapists, 63.3% confessed that they had committed multiple offenses against multiple victims or the same victim, totaling to approximately six rapes each. Thus, out of the entire sample of men in the study, a mere 76 men were responsible for an estimated 439 rapes and attempted rapes.</p>

<p>This continued ignorance of serial rape on educational campuses is dangerous and harmful. Under Title IX, two particular flaws significantly contribute to the continuous serial rape problem. The first is non-existent information sharing between post-secondary campuses.  Currently, if a student transfers at the end or during their Title IX proceedings for sexual violence charges, there is no systematic mechanism by which a new prospective college can learn about those alleged charges, proceedings or outcomes.  At best, the student may self-report the pending allegations to an open-ended question on an application, but that is highly unlikely due to the student's self-interest. Thus, the victimization continues elsewhere as the student becomes a potential danger to an entirely new student body and campus.  </p>

<p>Another flaw is the lenient punishment implemented by the schools for Title IX violations. Title IX gives post-secondary institutions the discretion to impose their own disciplinary procedures on responsible students. <a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/221153.pdf">The Campus Sexual Assault Study</a> [PDF] surveyed 5,446 undergraduate women and found that of the reported rape and sexual assault claims on college and university campuses, less than 1% of responsible perpetrators received disciplinary punishment or sanctions from the university. Implemented lenient punishments such as sensitivity training, book report assignments or probation from extracurricular activities are merely "slaps on the wrist" and have no significant deterring measure. The most severe punishment is expulsion, which is uncommon and at some schools, nonexistent. For example, since its foundation in 1819, the University of Virginia has <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/06/us/uva-sexual-assault-investigation/index.html">never expelled a single student for rape or sexual assault</a>, even in the case where the accused admitted to the crime. This failure to impose severe punishment and disciplinary actions amounts to tacit approval and contributes to the serial sexual violence epidemic on campus.  </p>

<p>Recently in 2015, <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+ful+HB1930ER2">Virginia</a> and <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2015/s5965">New York</a> passed legislation in efforts to strictly hold sexually violent perpetrators accountable on college and university campuses. Both state laws dictate that colleges and universities are required to mark a student's transcript if a student has been suspended or dismissed for sexual violence, or withdrawn from the school with pending allegations of sexual violence. The problem is that even though all schools within the states of Virginia and New York are bound to follow these procedures, the educational institutions in the rest of the country are not. </p>

<p>Title IX entitles students to an education absent of discrimination; campuses rife with sexual violence deprive students of this. Transcript notations can provide a strong and effective message to perpetrators as well as victims only if all states choose to adopt this policy. Transcript notations must therefore be implemented as a federal action, as an extended component of Title IX, binding all colleges and universities across America. Colleges and universities need an efficient way to track students who have been found responsible for rape or sexual assault under Title IX. Thus, compelling schools to mark transcripts will solve information sharing because prospective schools will be put on notice about student's disciplinary history, accept more liability, and in response, take more preventative measures. Moreover, the transcript notation itself will serve as a form of punishment that will impact the students' academic future and act as a powerful deterrent on serial perpetrators. </p>

<p>Transcript notions alone will not completely resolve the issue of campus sexual violence, however, it will make large strides in eliminating serial rapists and slapping a red flag on student perpetrators who are found responsible on college and university campuses. Nothing can be done for Hannah Graham or Morgan Harrington, but there are thousands of other women in need of saving on educational campuses.</p>

		<title>Nine Things You Need to Know about Texas’ New Cyberbullying Law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br />
                <p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Attorney <a href="https://www.versustexas.com/benson-varghese/">Benson Varghese</a> of <a href="https://www.versustexas.com/">Varghese Summersett</a>, discusses Texas' new cyberbullying law ...</p>

                <p>Back in the day, a schoolyard bully was a student&#8217;s worst nightmare. Now, it&#8217;s cyberbullies that teens fear the most.</p>

                <p>Not only can cyberbullies remain anonymous, but they can strike at all hours of the day and night. With just a few keystrokes, they can threaten, taunt, harass and humiliate their target, causing severe emotional distress that, in some instances, has even led to suicide. According to the Center for Disease Control, suicide is the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/injury/images/lc-charts/leading_causes_of_death_age_group_2014_1050w760h.gif">second leading cause</a> of death for American teenagers and young adults. </p>

                <p>In the past, there was little law enforcement and school districts in Texas could do to deter cyberbullying. That&#8217;s about to change. Come September 1, student cyberbullying will officially be illegal in Texas and school districts will have more power to intervene in cyberbullying cases.</p>

                <p>Here&#8217;s what every parent, student, educator and lawyer needs to know about the <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlodocs/85R/billtext/pdf/SB00179F.pdf#navpanes=0">new cyberbullying law</a> in Texas. </p>

                <p><strong>1. The new law is referred to as &#8220;David&#8217;s Law&#8221; in honor of a teenager who committed suicide.</strong><br />
                    The legislation is named in honor of David Molak, a San Antonio teenager who committed suicide in January 2016 in the backyard of his parents&#8217; home after enduring extreme and prolonged cyberbullying. His death was the result of cyberbullying that began at one school and continued even after he transferred to another school. No charges were ever filed due to the fact that the bullying was not physical and there was insufficient evidence to meet the elements of the online harassment statute. The Molak family sought change through legislation, specifically Senate Bill 179, which now makes cyberbullying a punishable offense.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Cyberbullying is the high-tech version of bullying.</strong><br />
                    Cyberbullying is basically the electronic version of bullying. It occurs when an individual engages in bullying through the use of any electronic communication device, including a phone, computer, camera, e-mail, instant message, text message, social media or website. Some examples of cyberbullying could include: <ul style="list-style-type:disc"><li>Sending viscous text messages, emails or instant messages about a student</li><li>Spreading rumors or gossip by posting it to social networking sites</li><li>Taking and sending embarrassing pictures or videos without permission</li><li>Creating a fake profile and pretending to be another student</li></ul></p>

                <p><strong>3. The definition of &#8220;bullying&#8221; is found in the Texas Education Code.</strong><br />
                    Under Section 37.0832 of the Education Code, &#8220;bullying&#8221; is defined as an act or pattern of acts by one or more students directed at another student that exploits an imbalance of power and involves written or verbal expression, expression through electronic means, or physical conduct, that:<ol><li>will physically harm another student, damage a student&#8217;s property, or place a student in fear of harm;</li><li>is severe, persistent, or pervasive enough to create an intimidating, threatening or abusive educational environment for the student;</li><li>disrupts the educational process or orderly operation of a class room or school; or</li><li>infringes on the rights of the victim.</li></ol></p>

                <p><strong>4. The new law applies to bullying that is school-related.</strong><br />
                    It&#8217;s important to point out that David&#8217;s law doesn&#8217;t apply to workplace bullying. It pertains to student bullying that occurs:<ul style="list-style-type:disc"><li>on school property;</li><li>during school sponsored or school-related activities on or off school property;</li><li>on a school bus or vehicle used to transport students to or from school or a school-sponsored or school-related activities.</li></ul><br />
                David&#8217;s law also applies to cyberbullying that occurs off campus and outside a school related activity if:</p>

                <ul style="list-style-type:disc"><li>it interferes with a student&#8217;s educational opportunities; or</li><li>substantially disrupts the orderly operation of a classroom, school, or school-sponsored or school-related activity.</li></ul>

                <p><strong>5. School districts must beef up their bullying policies.</strong> <br />
                    The law requires school districts to include cyberbullying in their district policies and to adopt districtwide policies and procedures that:<ul style="list-style-type:disc"><li>prohibit bullying of a student;</li><li>prohibit retaliation against anyone who provides information about a bullying incident;</li><li>establish a procedure for notifying parents and guardians about bullying incidents;</li><li>establish actions students should take to obtain assistance and intervention in response to bullying;</li><li>set out available counseling options for victims, perpetrators, and witnesses of bullying;</li><li>establish a way for students to anonymously report bullying; establish procedures for investigating and verifying reported incidents of bullying;</li><li>prohibit disciplinary measures on a student who is a victim of bullying and used reasonable self-defense in response to the bullying;</li><li>ensures that discipline for bullying a student with disabilities complies with federal law, including the Individual with Disabilities Education Act.</li></ul></p>

                <p><strong>6. Parents must be notified if their child is a victim or perpetrator of bullying.</strong><br />
                    David&#8217;s law requires school officials to notify a victim&#8217;s parent or guardian within three business days after a bullying incident. School officials must also notify the parent or guardian of the alleged bully within a reasonable amount of time. </p>

                <p><strong>7. The new law allows individuals to get a restraining order to stop the cyberbullying.</strong><br />
                    Cyberbullying victims may seek quick relief against the cyberbully from the courts, which could issue a temporary restraining order, temporary injunction or permanent injunction to prevent further cyberbullying. The order can also compel a parent or guardian to take action to stop the perpetrators from cyberbullying.</p>

                <p><strong>8. Cyberbullies can face fine, jail time and expulsion.</strong><br />
                    The new legislation amends Texas Penal Code 42.07, making cyberbullying a Class B misdemeanor punishable by up 180 days in jail and a maximum $2,000 fine. The offense becomes a Class A misdemeanor if the offender has a previous conviction for cyberbullying or if the victim was under 18 years old and targeted with the intent to make the victim commit suicide or hurt themselves. A Class A misdemeanor is punishable by up to a year in jail and a maximum $4,000 fine. Cyberbullies can also face expulsion or be sent to alternative school. </p>

                <p>Prior to the passage of this law, cyberbullying did not carry any criminal penalties. In 2011, lawmakers added the term &#8220;cyberbullying&#8221; to the Texas Education Code under the bullying umbrella, but the provision did not make the act illegal. Instead, it required school districts to develop policies to prevent and intervene in bullying and cyberbullying. Now that this law has been passed, individuals face potential fines and jail time for cyberbullying.</p>

                <p><strong>9. The new law goes into effect on September 1, 2017.</strong><br />
                    On June 9, 2016, Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott signed Senate Bill 179 into law, criminalizing cyberbullying. This law, along with all of the other recently passed legislation, goes into effect on September 1, 2017.</p>

<p align="center">"The existence of `system' in the world is at once obvious to every observer of nature....Each element of the cosmos is positively woven from all the others."</p>

<p align="right">&#8212 Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, <u>The Phenomenon of Man</u></p><br />

The cumulative jurisprudential assets and liabilities of U.S. foreign policy can best be determined from the standpoint of system. Accordingly, the divergence of such policy from much broader interests of the world as a whole represents a conspicuous harbinger of failure. It follows, further, that any posture of "America First" must signal a lose-lose prescription for the United States, one minimizing both national power and world law.

<p>There is more. This noteworthy conclusion is most plausible wherever such a self-defeating U.S. posture deteriorates to the lowest possible level of implementation. Tangibly, this means a moment when "America First" has managed to become both starkly retrograde and viscerally primal. In these plainly bitter circumstances, there could no longer exist any meaningful hopes for gainful cooperation or general human progress. </p>

<p>At that point, this country would be guided only by increasingly corrosive commitments to competition and conflict, what the philosophers prefer to call a <em>bellum omnium contra omnes</em>, a "war of all against all."</p>

<p>For the president and his counselors, currently fashioning incoherent policies toward North Korea, coping with multiple intersecting perils will require more than noisy belligerence or  rancorous bravado. Ultimately, however counter-intuitive, Donald Trump's national security policies will need to be based upon verifiably sound principles of systematic investigation, intellect, and "mind." In acknowledgment of this assessment, a derivative "next question" must be quickly raised and correctly answered: <em>What might such a suitably thoughtful American foreign policy actually look like?</em></p>

<p>To be sure, the answers here will be less than plain. They will depend, after all, upon what can first be uncovered about myriad individual human needs and expectations. Both intellectually and operationally, this demonstrably global elucidation will be sorely complex and hideously multilayered. </p>

<p>In other words, these "revelations" will not be readily decipherable by mere "common sense," or by any simplistic analogy from the microcosmic worlds of real estate and raw commerce.</p>

<p>Like most conditions here on earth, national security must begin at the beginning, that is, with the individual human being. More than anything else -  except for a sometimes corollary apprehension of "aloneness, or of not conspicuously "belonging" to a valued tribe, nation, or faith - the expressly primal fear of simply "not being" is determinative. When considered together with the understanding that individual human death fear often creates more-or-less irresistible inclinations toward collective violence, this oddly difficult insight may nonetheless reveal a long overlooked foreign policy opportunity. </p>

<p>It is that the universal apprehension of death, as an unambiguously common human anguish, could help prevent war and terror. More specifically, it could productively invite a steadily expanding ambit of human empathy and <a href="http://archive.org/stream/tragicsenseoflif14636gut/14636.txt">worldwide compassion</a>. Such an expansion, by definition, would represent the conceptual and jurisprudential opposite of "American First."</p>

<p>Although generally overlooked, only this basic human universality and commonality can eventually lift us above a frightfully lawless future; that is, beyond an accumulating sequence of endlessly destructive and self-perpetuating planetary fragmentations. Worth noting, too, is that the looming portent of increasingly explosive disunities could sometime prove to be <em>sui generis</em>.  Quite literally, should we experience a nuclear war with North Korea <em>in absolutely any form</em>, it would be unprecedented and law-shattering.</p>

<p>In the final analysis, only a serious attempt to understand an imperative global "oneness" can save the United States from irremediable national and international hazards. Significantly, however, we are now moving in exactly the opposite direction. To wit, President Trump's "America First" orientation represents the literal antithesis of a badly needed global effort. It could, therefore, decisively undermine any of our still-remaining chances for meaningful legal order on planet earth.</p>

<p>As this American president must no doubt struggle to recognize, the United States can never be saved by narrowly political solutions fashioned in public relations firms or in career marketing boardrooms. American national security is never just about branding, making the "best deal," or ensuring that others "pay their fair share." In the end, law and security are never about the money. At some point, Mr. Trump must finally be made aware that U.S. foreign policy is far more than just another mundane calculation of monetary exchange. </p>

<p><em>Inter alia</em>, our national security policy must always be about an overarching commitment to international law enforcement and whole species survival. Only then, together with all others, could America become truly "first." It's not really a new or difficult idea to grasp. Already in 1758, Swiss legal scholar Emmerich de Vattel noted, in his classic <em>The Law of Nations</em> (<em>Or the Principles of Natural Law</em>): "Nations, being no less subject to the laws of nature than individuals, what one man owes to other men, one Nation, in its turn, owes to other Nations." </p>

<p>Later, in the same vein, the great eighteenth-century jurist continues: "The first general law, which is to be found in the very end of the society of Nations, is that each Nation should contribute as far as it can to the happiness and advancement of other Nations."</p>

<p>Fittingly, Vattel's legal work was well-known to Thomas Jefferson, who consulted it closely in fashioning the US Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p>There is more. In global politics, durable remediations will expect a more sincere and penetrating depth of analytic thought. At the outset, this president will have to accept a fully imaginative and broadly global set of legal policy understandings. This challenging set expresses the subtle but indispensable awareness that outer worlds of politics and statecraft are in fact a more-or-less mirrored reflection of our innermost private selves. </p>

<p>These outer worlds, in short, are merely "epiphenomenal."</p>

<p>More precisely, as Mr. Trump will sometime need to fathom, it is deeply within the opaque mysteries of individual human mortality -  mysteries focused on the genuinely timeless and universal preoccupation with <a href="https://archive.org/stream/ThePhenomenonOfMan/phenomenon-of-man-pierre-teilhard-de-chardin_djvu.txt">power over death</a> &#8212 that we must ultimately seek to discover the largely reciprocal truths of human interdependence and American national security. Whether we might prefer to look toward better legal management of terrorism, war, or genocide, any foolishly declared posture of "America First" will mean "America Alone" and, subsequently, "America Last."</p>

<p>In looking more purposefully behind the daily news, as this president must soon learn to appreciate, power over death will become discernible as the single most eagerly sought after form of power in world politics. Always, it has been this way. Indeed, it has been this way since "time immemorial." </p>

<p>But what to actually do about it?</p>

<p><em>That is the question.</em></p>

<p>In this very challenging regard, there is much more for the White House to learn. At a minimum, President Trump ought not draw any credible hopes for creating an improved and lawful U.S. national security policy by clinging to well-worn and hackneyed examples of American "exceptionalism."  In this connection, though gleefully unacknowledged even in our best schools and universities, there remains a noteworthy gap between humankind's advancing technical understanding, and its persistently uncontrollable passions. Today, in virtually all human communities, including these United States, Dostoyevsky, Kierkegaard, Freud and Jung could suggest far more promising policy ideas to the American president than Bacon, Newton, Descartes, Galileo or even Einstein. </p>

<p>Ancient Greek tragedies had already <a href="http://abs.kafkas.edu.tr/upload/225/The_Orestia.pdf">recorded</a> an incredulous query: "Where will it end? When will it all be lulled back into sleep, and cease, the bloody hatred, the destruction?"</p>

<p>To add, we must now inquire, what about the revealing ironies and compounding absurdities of human life on earth? </p>

<p><em>Credo quia absurdum</em>. "I believe because it is absurd."</p>

<p>Thus far, more perhaps than we might care to admit, education and enlightenment have had precious little tangible bearing on the "human condition." <em>Prima facie</em>, too, steadily expanding technologies of mega-destruction have done little or nothing to make us more responsible stewards of this endangered planet. Instead, and with an observably unhindered arrogance, whole nations and peoples continue to revel in virtually every conceivable form of mass violence and self-propelled barbarism. Could it possibly get any worse?</p>

<p>Most of the time, in world politics, this ominously primal immersion is described with an air of inevitability, as some sort of immutably zero-sum or us-versus-them struggle for global domination.</p>

<p>Regarding the planet's physical environment, President Trump displays nary a scintilla of any serious or prudent foresight. This absence, of course, is most glaringly underscored by his unhidden indifference to climate change studies and the global ecology. By his still-planned withdrawal from the Paris Climate Change accord, a recalcitrant and law-undermining abrogation that will harm both US and global interests by its stunningly anti-science commitment to America First, President Trump will literally place billions of people on a largely accelerating trajectory of human declension.</p>

<p>Where shall we go from here? <em>Exeunt omnes</em>? Our American president seems to have demonstrably few original ideas, and, correspondingly, a never-ending panoply of bewilderingly backward and law-violating notions. Among the latter are manifestly unhelpful distortions of global trade policies, and also a curiously counter-productive interference with badly needed immigration.</p>

<p>What other basic questions will need to be asked?</p>

<p>One fundamental query is especially obvious and inescapable: <em>What precisely is wrong with us, not as Americans in particular, but as humans, as a wider species?</em> Somehow, shameless human bloodletting not only persists, but remains geographically almost worldwide, and ritually de rigueur. This is the relentlessly unsettling case, moreover, even while the most predatory of other animals are seemingly able to coexist in substantially less murderous habitats. </p>

<p>What, then, we desperately need to inquire, is most fundamentally wrong with us as humans, living irrevocably in an interconnected and presumptively lawful global system?</p>

<p>Leaving aside certain incontestable intellectual advantages, we are not the same as other species. There is rampant killing among the "lower" animals, of course, but it is not usually willful or gratuitous. Mostly, it is survival driven. Such killing may simply be "natural." Biologically, at least, it can "make sense."</p>

<p>What sort of species, we will then need to inquire, can tolerate or even venerate such a hideous source of gratification? To what extent, if any, is this markedly venal quality related to our steadily-diminishing prospects for building modern civilizations upon aptly resurrected premises of human oneness? And once more, to what extent, if any, does this murderous trait derive from a primary and ubiquitous human death fear?</p>

<p>This last question is more important than it is obvious, even for the consciously rational formulation of American foreign policy and for certain corollary obligations of global consciousness and world law.</p>

<p>"Our unconscious," wrote Freud, "does not believe in its own death; it behaves as if it were immortal." What we ordinarily describe as heroism may in some cases actually be nothing more than denial. Still, however widely disregarded, an expanded acceptance of personal mortality may effectively represent the very last best chance we still have to endure as an enviable American nation.</p>

<p>Representing the very opposite of America First, this is because we could otherwise continue to associate a still-wished for immortality with inflicting grave harms upon others. Tangible examples of such deleterious associations abound in both war and terrorism, most recognizably, perhaps, in today's growing cadre of suicide-terrorists. Significantly, the martyrdom-seeking suicide terrorist kills himself or herself in order to avoid death.</p>

<p>Already back during the Trojan War, as we may learn from Homer, Achilles led his Greek warriors to battle against Troy with the incomparable rallying cry: "Onward, for immortality."</p>

<p>Can President Trump and his advisors learn something here that might benefit both the nation, and thereby also the wider global community, something that could move us gainfully beyond <em>Schadenfreude</em>, and encouragingly toward certain viable forms of wider legal cooperation? To be sure, the latter represents the only credible path to the former. Again, these core orientations are not mutually exclusive, but rather mutually reinforcing.</p>

<p>Death "happens" to us all, but our potentially useful awareness of this expectation is normally blunted by deception. To accept forthrightly that we are all authentically flesh and blood creatures of biology is basically more than most humans can bear. "Normally," there is even a peculiar embarrassment felt by the living in the presence of the dead and dying. </p>

<p>It is almost as if death and dying had somehow been reserved exclusively for "others."</p>

<p>It is, further, as if death were an "affliction" that can never expectedly darken our own personal and presumptively "eternal" lives. Judged by a now near-universal obsession with social media, and with being recognizably "connected," this view may be rooted, at least in part, in the potent idea of personal death as the last and most insufferable extremity of being left "alone" in a disconcertingly pointless universe.</p>

<p>That we, as individuals, should still cleave so desperately to various allegedly sacred promises of redemption and immortality is not, by itself, a global-survival or national-survival issue. It becomes a genuinely existential problem, and one that we may thus convincingly associate with war, terrorism, or genocide, only when these various promises are forcibly reserved to certain selected segments of humanity, and are then openly denied to other "less-worthy" segments. </p>

<p>In the end, as President Trump must still learn to understand, all national and global politics are epiphenomenal, a thinly symptomatic reflection of more deeply underlying and compellingly troublesome private needs. Undoubtedly, the most pressing of all these accumulated needs is the avoidance of personal death. </p>

<p><em>In all global politics, it is now worth repeating, there is no greater form of power than power over death.</em></p>

<p>For the most part, it is not for us to choose when we should die.  Instead, our words, our faces, and even our irrepressible human countenance will sometime lie immeasurably far beyond any discernible considerations of conscious decision or individual choice. Still, we can choose to recognize our shared common fate, and thereby our derivative and unbreakable interdependence. This uniquely powerful intellectual recognition could carry with it an equally significant global promise, one that remains distressingly distant and unacknowledged in the White House. </p>

<p>Much as we might prefer to comfort ourselves with various qualitative presumptions of societal hierarchy and national differentiation, we humans are really all pretty much the same. This globalizing attribute is already manifest to all capable scientists and physicians. Our single most important similarity, and the one least subject to any reasonable hint of counter-argument, is that we all die. </p>

<p>Ironically, whatever our more-or-less divergent views on what might actually happen to us after personal death, the basic mortality that we share could still represent the very last best chance we have for global coexistence and more viable world law. This is the case, however, only if we can first accomplish the astoundingly difficult leap from acknowledging a shared common fate, to actually "operationalizing" more expressly generalized feelings of empathy and caring.</p>

<p>Across an entire planet, we can care for one another as humans, but only after we have first accepted that the indisputable judgment of a resolutely common fate will not be waived by any palpable harms that are deliberately inflicted upon "others," that is, upon the ritually "unworthy." While starkly inconspicuous, modern crimes of war, terror, and genocide are often "just" conveniently sanitized or intentionally disguised expressions of religious sacrifice. In the most egregious and predictable instances, it is also worth noting, corresponding violence would represent a consummately irrepressible human hope of overcoming private mortality through the organized mass killing of certain specific "outsiders." </p>

<p>It's not a new thought. Consider psychologist Ernest Becker's paraphrase of Nobel Laureate Elias Canetti in <em>Escape From Evil</em>: "....each organism raises its head over a field of corpses, smiles into the sun, and declares life good."</p>

<p>Americans and even other residents of a legally interconnected planet have an evident right to expect that any president of the United States should at least attempt to understand these vital and complex linkages, especially with reference to better human controls over war, terrorism, and genocide. Here, as in so many other crucial sectors of jurisprudential concern, our national policies must build upon more genuinely intellectual sorts of understanding. Always, our just wars, counter-terrorism conflicts, and anti-genocide programs must be fought or conducted as intricate contests of mind over mind, and not just narrowly tactical struggles of mind over matter.</p>

<p>Ultimately, only a dual awareness of our common human destination, which is death, and the associated futility of sacrificial violence, can offer an accessible "medicine" against North Korea, ISIS, Russia, Iran, and certain other foreseeable adversaries in the global "state of nature."  This "natural" or structural condition of anarchy was already well known to the Founding Fathers (most of whom had read Locke, Rousseau, Grotius, Vattel, and Hobbes). Only this difficult awareness can now relieve an otherwise incessant and still-ascending Hobbesian war of "all against all."</p>

<p>History deserves a reasonable pride of place. America, President Trump should recall, was expressly founded upon the philosophy of Hobbes, and the religion of Calvin. But this means something quite different in 2017, than it did in 1787.</p>

<p>What should this particular history now signify for White House foreign policy preparation and world law? This is not an insignificant query, but it does presuppose an American democracy founded upon some authentic learning, and not on flippantly corrosive clichés, or abundantly empty witticisms.</p>

<p>Human death fear has much to do with a better understanding of America's current enemies, both national and sub-national (terrorist).  Reciprocally, only a people who can feel deeply within itself the unalterable fate and suffering of a broader global population will ever be able to lawfully embrace genuine compassion, and thereby to "rationally" reject collective violence. To be sure, this president should finally prepare to understand what all this implies, both with specific reference to the United States, and also to America's various state and sub-state adversaries.</p>

<p>President Trump, please consider this: <em>America First means America Alone means America Last</em>. Looking ahead, America must lead together with others in fixing what really matters. America can never  be truly "first" so long as its president insists upon achieving such misconceived status at the unavoidable expense of several or all others. Inevitably, President Trump must recognize, American and global survival remain not only bewilderingly complicated, but also mutually interdependent and lawfully intertwined. </p>

<p>The existence of system in the world is both obvious and fundamental. To try to deny or circumvent this core reality via "America First" is a law-defying position that is destined to fail.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Susan Farooqi of St. John's University School of Law discusses the regression in womens' rights in Afghanistan in recent decades...</j:header></p>

<p>When we think of women in Afghanistan, we often assume that they are oppressed, and recall images of women in burqas and stories of women being brutalized. Although there is a lot of truth to these perceptions, the situation has been different in the past, and could be different in the future. Efforts to improve women's rights do not need to resist centuries of tradition; they need to merely reverse recent developments, which are themselves ahistorical.</p>

<p>Although women in Afghanistan were indeed historically oppressed by patriarchy, just as women in medieval Europe were often treated more as property than as individuals, this process began to change during the nineteenth century, as liberalism became an increasingly global philosophy. In particular, during the 1920s, just as women in the United States experienced new freedoms, including the right of suffrage, women in Afghanistan were also able to extend their rights and achieve what was essentially a modern status. It was not until the 1980s that this trend was reversed. </p>

<p>Today, even though the <a href="http://www.afghanembassy.com.pl/afg/images/pliki/TheConstitution.pdf">2004 Afghan Constitution</a> [PDF] calls for equal rights for women in compliance with international human rights law, gender inequality pervades all aspects of life for Afghan women. Therefore, implementing real change will require the constitutional guarantee of equal rights to have the force of law. To do so and reverse recent developments, Afghanistan should implement a Civil Rights Act, similar to the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/civil-rights-act">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> in the United States. A Civil Rights Act in Afghanistan would go beyond the Constitution's mere assertion of equal rights for women, and would help to ensure that in practice, those rights are respected and upheld. Specifically, a Civil Rights Act in Afghanistan will hinder discriminatory policies that restrict women's free movement and access to employment, education, healthcare, and freedom of expression.</p>

<p>Increasing the number of women in the workforce, combined with improving educational opportunities for women, would have a spillover effect into the political sphere. The more independent and educated women there are in Afghanistan, the more active women can become in changing the political landscape. This is exactly what happened in the United States. As women became important fixtures in the workforce, they began to rise up in industries and became decision makers. Consequently, the United States started to have a culture that was much more favorable to women. Similar outcomes could happen in Afghanistan with a Civil Rights Act that prohibits employers from discriminating, making it easier for women to join the workforce.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, due to a lack of written records, we know little about the early feminists in Afghanistan who must have struggled to obtain respect. However, we do know that <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?bioId=17370">Emir Amanullah Khan</a> made genuine strides to establish gender equality. Following the First World War, Amanullah consolidated his power by resisting British imperialism, and after a lengthy stalemate managed to achieve the independence for his nation that even India would not obtain for thirty more years.<br />
 <br />
Certainly something inspired Amanullah to grant greater status to women in the newly independent nation. We know that he was strongly influenced by Mahmud Tarzi, often described as the father of Afghan journalism. Tarzi had become familiar with western liberalism after prolonged visits to Turkey, France, and India, and within his newspaper, Seraj-al-Akhbar, Tarzi often wrote that Afghanistan needed to create a modern civilization that accorded women the same rights and equality seen in developed nations. </p>

<p>Although Tarzi served Emir Amanullah as foreign minister, he played an important role in the formulation of domestic policy, criticizing the medieval madrasah and demanding that women be given full access to schools and that dress and clothing restrictions be lifted. These demands were met, and consequently women of the 1920s in Afghanistan were often indistinguishable in attire from their European and American counterparts. As seen in the picture, they were allowed to wear dresses and even relatively short skirts, revealing their faces and lower legs even while in public. </p>

<p>Of course, the story of this development cannot and should not be focused solely on men granting rights to women. Fortunately, we do know of at least one woman who also participated in this social revolution. Tarzi's daughter, Soraya, appears to be the central figure in this story; she married Amanullah. Consequently, it appears likely that the Emir was swayed by his love for the daughter of a liberal philosopher, and she used her status as "queen" of Afghanistan to openly advocate for women's rights. </p>

<p>As Amanullah established a new constitutional framework for Afghanistan, polygamy was abolished (or at least strongly discouraged), women were allowed to attend schools even in rural areas, and they were no longer required to hide their faces in public. As Amanullah announced these reforms before a crowd in Kabul, Soraya dramatically tore off her veil as the crowd cheered. Afterward, she oversaw a program to finance scholarships for young women to attend universities in Turkey, and she also established the nation's first magazine for women: Ershad-I-Niswan. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, after the royal family visited Europe during 1928, during which Soraya was granted an honorary degree from Oxford University, they returned to Afghanistan only to find that fundamentalist Muslims were outraged by images of Soraya that had been disseminated by European media. These images had been spread widely throughout Afghanistan, showing the Empress dining with young men, dressing in a modern fashion, and even allowing her hand to be kissed by the leaders of England and Germany. Facing revolt, Amanullah was forced to abdicate, and the royal family fled to Switzerland, leaving much of their legacy to be undone.<br />
         		<br />
Ultimately, we must realize that when we speak of the need today for women to have civil rights and access to education in Afghanistan, we are not proposing some new idea that must replace centuries of fundamentalist Islamic thought. Instead, we are simply asking that the people of Afghanistan be allowed to return to the liberties they briefly enjoyed during the reign of Amanullah and Soraya. For most of the twentieth century, women in Afghanistan were not oppressed by Islamic radicalism, and we should denounce the oppression of the Taliban as a new phenomenon, which should not be considered to represent the historical sentiments of the Afghan people. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Shannon Riordan of St. John's University, discusses domestic violence in the NFL ...</j:header></p>

<p><strong>O</strong>n February 15, 2014, Ray Rice, a top National Football League (NFL) player for the Baltimore Ravens, was <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2014/5/23/5744964/ray-rice-arrest-assault-statement-apology-ravens">arrested</a> on assault charges, after he engaged in a physical altercation inside an elevator with his now-wife, Janay Palmer, at the Revel Casino in Atlantic City.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OETH5brfTi4">Video surveillance</a> revealed Rice dragging his fiancée out of an elevator unconscious after Rice punched her in the face, causing her to fall into the elevator wall and hit her head against the metal rail.  Rice ultimately pleaded not guilty and was accepted into a pretrial intervention program, which was <a href="http://www.espn.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/11514871/judicial-figures-show-ray-rice-deal-offered-rarely">offered</a> in less than one percent of all domestic violence cases in New Jersey from 2010 to 2013.</p>

<p>About four months after the domestic abuse case, the NFL held a disciplinary hearing. Following the hearing, the NFL's Commissioner, Rodger Goodell, <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2014/7/24/5824682/ray-rice-suspension-assault-ravens">announced</a> that Rice would receive only a two game suspension for violating the <a href="https://nfllabor.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/personal-conduct-policy.pdf">Personal Conduct Policy</a>. With all of the uproar and outrage surrounding the lenient punishment, Goodell soon realized his mistake. After a <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/nfl/video-1118515/NFL-player-Ray-Rice-punches-fiancee-Janay-Palmer-face.html">second video</a> was released, revealing footage from inside the elevator where Rice is seen punching Palmer, the Baltimore Ravens <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2014/9/8/6121917/ray-rice-cut-ravens-suspension">terminated</a> Rice's contract and Goodell <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000391538/article/ray-rice-released-by-ravens-indefinitely-suspended">announced</a> that Rice would now be suspended from the NFL indefinitely.</p>

<p>Rice <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2014/11/28/7171719/ray-rice-reinstated-nfl-appeal">appealed</a> the suspension under the Personal Conduct Policy and, on November 28, 2014, Rice's indefinite suspension was overturned &#8#8212 making him immediately authorized to sign with a team and resume playing.  As of 2016, no team has picked up Rice, and thus, has not played in an NFL game since his arrest.  It appears that most NFL teams believe that the negative attention that would accompany signing Rice, is not worth the talent he would bring to the team.</p>

<p>This episode made it astonishingly clear that a major flaw in the previous Personal Conduct Policy existed: domestic violence cases.  After public outrage surrounding Rice's domestic abuse incident, Goodell quickly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/20/sports/football/in-domestic-violence-cases-nfl-has-a-history-of-lenience.html">acknowledged</a> the huge blind spot and stated that the Personal Conduct Policy had failed and would be revamped.  In December 2014, Goodell delivered a <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000441758/article/nfl-owners-endorse-new-personal-conduct-policy">revised</a> Personal Conduct Policy.  Now, any first time offender who engages in domestic violence that involves physical force will be suspended without pay for six games.  Goodell <a href="http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2014/12/15/0ap3000000444539.pdf">announced</a> that consideration will be given to any aggravating or mitigating factors. For second time offenders, the punishment is more severe. Second time offenders will be banished from the league for at least one year, and given the option of reinstatement after petitioning the league, but there is no presumption or assurance that the petition will be granted.</p>

<p>Despite Goodell's tougher stance towards domestic violence, there have been several NFL employees arrested on domestic violence charges, including Joseph Randle.  In February 2015, Randle was <a href="https://www.axs.com/news/dallas-cowboys-joseph-randle-accused-of-domestic-abuse-39845">arrested</a> after police received a call from the mother of Randle's son, who told police that Randle broke a car window during an argument and threatened her and her son with a gun.  Despite the domestic violence charges being <a href="http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/04/29/joseph-randle-wont-be-charged-in-domestic-violence-case/">dropped</a> in April, the NFL met with Randle over the summer to discuss whether he violated the new Personal Conduct Policy.  In November, the NFL <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/14099547/joseph-randle-formerly-dallas-cowboys-gets-4-game-suspension-nfl">announced</a> that Randle would receive a four game suspension, two less than the Personal Conduct Policy suggests for first time offenders.  The NFL never released a statement explaining their decision.</p>

<p>From the first incident till March, 2016, Randle was <a href="http://http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/report-ex-cowboy-joseph-randle-arrested-for-6th-time-in-17-months/">arrested</a> multiple times, including another incident that occurred between him and his ex-girlfriend. Around 3 a.m. on February 1, 2016, Randle <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/former-cowboy-joseph-randle-arrested-for-fourth-time-in-17-months">showed up</a> at his ex-girlfriend's residence, looking for a place to sleep before driving to Kansas. After Randle rang the doorbell, he was informed that he was not welcome there. The mother of the ex-girlfriend called the police who arrived to find Randle sitting in his car. After running a standard warrant check, the police learned that Randle was wanted on a speeding charge in Texas. Other arrests included causing disruptions in a Kansas casino and shoplifting.</p>

<p>The NFL should once again alter their Personal Conduct Policy regarding domestic violence incidents. The NFL needs to start truly abiding by the game suspension punishments listed in the Personal Conduct Policy: six games for first time offenders and one-year suspensions for second time offenders. Without consistent results, the threat of suspension without will not properly deter NFL employees from committing acts of violence. </p>

<p>Further, stiff penalties create the opportunity to reduce those penalties through counseling or reparation.  If an NFL employee successfully enters into an intervention program or therapy, the NFL could consider lessening the suspension period, post facto. The ultimate goal is to punish those that commit domestic violence, while also preventing acts of domestic violence in the future through counseling and therapy. </p>

<p>Concentrating on the NFL is important because in various ways, the NFL's history with domestic violence mirrors society's progressing views on the problem.  Over the past 40 years, domestic violence has gone from being a private issue, only within the home, to an issue on top of law enforcement and policy makers lists.  Due to its national presence, there is hope that the NFL's revised Personal Conduct Policy, with strict penalties and an emphasis on rehabilitation, will reduce incidents of domestic violence in the NFL community and beyond. </p>

		<title>Investigating the Third Term Related Crimes in Burundi</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://commonlaw.uottawa.ca/en/people/manirakiza-pacifique">Professor Pacifique Manirakiza</a> of the University of Ottawa discusses the complexities behind investigations into the atrocities in Burundi and the need for a special tribunal to prosecute the crimes ... </p> <strong>I</strong>n April 2016, the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/about/otp">International Criminal Court (ICC) Prosecutor</a> Fatou Bensouda opened a preliminary examination focusing on the third term related atrocities in Burundi following President Pierre Nkurunziza's decision to run for a third term. On October 27, 2016, Burundi notified the <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en">UN Secretary General</a> of its intention to withdraw from the ICC. On October 27, 2017, Burundi will be the first Member State to effectively withdraw from the Rome treaty. As the deadline draws nearer, tension is rising among Burundians, including within the human rights community. On the Burundian government side, fingers are crossed hoping that the deadline arrives quickly so that they won't be bound by any consented obligations towards the ICC. Within the human rights community, the Independent National Human Rights Commission (INHRC) issued, on July 28th 2017, a statement deploring the ICC undue interference and calling the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) to halt the preliminary examination in favor of Burundian courts which, it suggested, are competent and capable to deal with the alleged crimes. Alternatively, the INHRC calls upon the UN Security Council to request a deferral of the situation in accordance with <a href="http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm">Article 16 of the ICC Statute</a> in order for the East African Community-led peace process to conclude easily and also to give a chance to Government's efforts towards peace consolidation and reconciliation. </p>

<p>The INHRC statement was fiercely criticized by the mainstream civil society organizations (CSOs), most of them now deregistered in Burundi. In a common statement signed by 10 organizations, it is stated that the INHRC's move aims at simply shielding perpetrators of the worst crimes from prosecution. Denouncing partisanship and lack of credibility of the INHRC, they instead call on the OTP to speed up the process and formally request a criminal investigation into the alleged crimes committed in Burundi beginning in April 2015.  Additionally, they call upon the Security Council not to be distracted by the INHRC and simply ignore its deferral request. This frontal collision is deplorable because CSOs and the INHRC are supposed to be partners and to share a collective responsibility to promote and protect human rights. This in itself is indicative of the malaise and the complexity of the Burundian crisis. On the other hand, it is worth recalling that the same CSOs began, on 17 July 2017, a 100 days campaign under the hashtag #Justice4Burundi. The campaign aims at drawing the attention of the OTP on the serious nature of the third term related atrocities. On top of this, additional actions are planned, such as upcoming demonstrations at the seat of the Court in The Hague. </p>

<p>What emerges from this background is that the INHRC and CSOs diverge on how the alleged third term related crimes should be dealt with. For the INHRC, domestic courts are competent and capable of investigating and prosecuting the alleged crimes. In theory, I agree that Burundian courts are competent and capable to investigate and prosecute human rights violations, including those amounting to international crimes, especially given the fact that they retain the primary jurisdiction on them. I doubt, however, that they can do it without a declared and sustained level of political will in this regard, along with some technical assistance. For the time being, the Government's preferred accountability mechanism is the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (<a href="https://cvrburundi.bi/en/">TRC</a>) at work today. Unfortunately, the alleged crimes under examination by the OTP fall out of the temporal jurisdiction of the TRC, unless its commissioners constructively interpret their mandate broad enough to include them. CSOs on the other hand only swear by the ICC, viewed as the only way to prevent further human rights violations and the ensuing impunity. While I do not disagree with them that ICC can contribute towards ending impunity of the worst crimes committed in Burundi, I posit that the ICC's narrow focus on third term related crimes will seriously limit its deterrent impact and possibly undermine the legitimacy of its selective intervention in a country marred with endemic impunity for past atrocities. For this reason, in her move to take a decision on the fate of the preliminary examination, the OTP needs to factor in some constraints and challenges in relation to the context of her intervention (1), evidence-gathering (2), her independence (3) and the possible lack of cooperation from Burundian Government (4). </p>

<p>1. Context Matters: Impunity of Past Massive Atrocities</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://peaceaccords.nd.edu/sites/default/files/accords/Arusha_Peace_Accord____.pdf">Arusha Peace Agreement</a> [PDF], Burundian politicians agreed that worst crimes of international law have been committed in Burundi. For instance, every April 29 of each year, victims and survivors of the 1972 Hutu genocide and other mass atrocities organize commemorative and other remembrance events and activities all over the world, including in Burundi. Each time, they call upon the international community to set up a tribunal to prosecute and try alleged perpetrators. Similarly, on October 21 of each year, Tutsi organizations of survivors and victims of the 1993 massacres meet regularly in Kibimba where a remembrance monument has been erected. They also make the same call for justice. Curiously, both calls have remained unanswered up until today.</p>

<p>Third term related crimes are intimately connected to past atrocities such as the mass and state-sponsored killings and other massive human rights abuses committed since the independence of the country. In fact, they are a continuation of unpunished past mass criminality. Addressing the present atrocities is a laudable initiative. At the preliminary examinations stage, the situation can satisfy the jurisdiction and admissibility criteria but, the thorny question would be whether or not context matters in the determination of the "interest of justice" test. The answer being affirmative, then the next question would be how to assess the context. Will the interest of justice be appreciated only in relation to the current situation of alleged crimes or, will it be determined in consideration of the overall context of impunity as described above along with the historical and political situation?  For sure, ICC partial justice focusing only on third term related crimes will come as shock to survivors, victims and families of victims of past atrocities, many of whom are now controlling the reigns of political power in Burundi or otherwise related to the ruling party and who are still longing for justice. Of course, legally speaking, no one can blame the ICC for not addressing all the crimes committed in Burundi. The Court simply has no jurisdiction on crimes committed in 1965, 1969, 1972, 1988, 1993 and beyond. However, the contextual element is an important aspect for the OTP to consider.</p>

<p> 2. Evidence-Gathering Constraints </p>

<p>Since the withdrawal notification date, the OTP was left with only 12 months to gather evidence to support a request for a criminal investigation. Given the complexity of Burundian situation and that of ICC cases, this time period is neither adequate nor reasonable for such task. Moreover, the OTP has to work in untenable conditions because the Government became uncooperative despite its legal obligations. Burundian CSOs stepped in to feed the OTP with information and documents. For the OTP to receive information and documents from different sources, including from CSOs is not problematic as such. This is in fact a standard practice and it is provided for in <a href="http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm"> Article 15 of the ICC Statute</a>. However, caution is necessary when the information and documents mainly come from an activist party, rather than a neutral party. In fact, some organizations have been caught manipulating information, especially images and videos from other contexts and countries, just for the sake of building a strong ICC case. The information and documents provided are certainly not conclusive; they must be evaluated against all other information and materials available before the OTP. </p>

<p>But problems lie ahead at a later stage if the authorization to investigate is granted and subsequent prosecutions carried out. If second hand information and documents referred to above can satisfy the lower evidentiary test for opening an investigation, they may not be sufficient to convince the Court of the suspects' culpability beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore, more time would be needed for OTP officers to collect substantial, credible and reliable evidence to build and support the case. It is well-known that preliminary examinations take years to conclude. Unfortunately, the OTP does not have that option as her time for action is constrained by the withdrawal deadline. </p>

<p>3. Securing and Protecting OTP's Independence</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm">Article 42(1) of the Statute</a>, the OTP shall act independently and shall not seek or act on instructions from any external source. <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/OTP-Policy_Paper_Preliminary_Examinations_2013-ENG.pdf">The Policy on Preliminary Examinations</a> [PDF] explains that independence goes beyond not seeking or acting on instructions: it means that decisions shall not be influenced or altered by the presumed or known wishes of any party, or in connection with efforts to secure cooperation. The independence of the OTP will stem from her capacity to decide on the course of a situation or a case without interference or undue pressure from not only States but also other partners from the international community and civil society as well. For instance, in the Burundian situation, international efforts and actions, including sanctions, have proved inadequate or inefficient to improve the human rights situation. People are now eyeing the OTP. This organ should however avoid to be perceived as the last bullet the international community is using to achieve its political goals. Moreover, I am not sure whether CSOs' actions and initiatives I alluded to earlier (sharing information and documents, regular visits to the OTP, upcoming demonstrations in The Hague, the 100 day campaign, etc) are simply legitimate lobbying initiatives or constitute a disguised pressure on ICC Prosecutor to launch the criminal investigation process before the withdrawal decision becomes legally effective on October 27th. In any event, given a general perception, mainly in Hutu milieu, that those CSOs are politically and ethnically motivated, caution is advised. The OTP must shield itself from the criticism that she has acted upon or ceded to the demands of the CSOs. The latter are also under a duty to refrain from any action that can be perceived as an undue pressure on the OTP; this can even have unintended consequences. Securing the OTP independence, both from political but also from special interests groups is critical in a politically and ethnically polarized situation. A perception of lack of independence may damage its reputation and its credibility.</p>

<p>4.  The Challenge to Secure State cooperation</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, soon after the announcement of the launching of the preliminary examination in Burundi, the OTP, Burundian people and the entire ICC community were caught by surprise by the Government's decision to withdraw from the ICC. In accordance with <a href="http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm">Article 127(1) of the Statute</a>, Burundi's obligations will still be valid until October 27, 2017 when the withdrawal becomes effective. In this withdrawal mood, along with the Government entrenched resentment against the international community, it would be naive for the OTP to expect cooperation once an investigation is formally launched. Given the anticipated lack of cooperation of Burundi, collecting credible and reliable evidence may prove tedious. It will be impossible for OTP officers to conduct on-site visits, access victims and other potential sources in Burundi. Even if a decision to prosecute some alleged perpetrators is made, cooperation in the arrest and transfer of potential suspects may prove difficult. Moreover, in a climate of anti-ICC position at the African Union level, it is unlikely the The Hague based court will receive necessary assistance from African States. Also, given the political context of the alleged crimes, some countries may not be convinced that Burundi meets the threshold of a typical ICC case. They would fear a precedent-setting as many governments like in Cameroon, Togo, DRC, Nigeria, etc. are facing resistance movements claiming their rights either through the streets or the bush. Furthermore, it remains to be seen whether the AU will remain silent and tolerate another African Head of State or Government to be transferred to The Hague for his trial.</p>

<p>5. Conclusion: Revisiting the Idea of a Special Court for Burundi</p>

<p>While the jurisdiction and admissibility criteria may be met in this case, the "interest of justice" test requires a holistic approach to tackle impunity of mass atrocities committed in Burundi, regardless of the time period. The third term related criminality cannot be addressed alone if the international community is serious about justice for the worst atrocity crimes. Since the ICC is not competent to investigate and prosecute the most part of the mass criminality that occurred in Burundi, the international community and Burundians should revisit the idea of a Special Court for Burundi put forward in the <a href="https://www.un.org/ruleoflaw/files/Burundi%20S2005158.pdf">2005 Kalomoh UN Report</a> [PDF]. Only this Court can ensure justice for all victims of all atrocious episodes. Its temporal and material jurisdiction can be extended to cover past, present and future atrocity crimes, what the ICC cannot do. The international community, the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/CoIBurundi/Pages/CoIBurundi.aspx">Commission of Inquiry on Burundi</a> in particular, the Arusha II peace process and the Burundian TRC should come up with such a recommendation couched in the strongest terms and ensure its actual implementation. In this way, justice would then be seen as a reconciliatory and not divisive tool. It will not be a problem for the ICC to cohabit with the Special Court, and both institutions will complement one another. </p>

		<title>Comparing the Federalist vs. Intergovernmentalist View of the EU</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Sedef Asli Topal of the <a href="http://www.u-szeged.hu/english">University of Szeged</a> discusses the EU's institutional framework using two popular approaches...</j:header><strong>T</strong>he transformation of the European Union into "an ever closer union" in terms of political space is a topic of which has been widely discussed for the last three or four decades in the discipline of International Relations, but there are two distinguished approaches that are usually focused on: (i) the federalist approach and (ii) the intergovernmentalist approach. These are opposing each other as enemies in terms of whether the EU should transform into a federation.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="http://www.untag-smd.ac.id/files/Perpustakaan_Digital_1/FEDERALISM%20Federalism%20and%20European%20union%20the%20building%20of%20Europe,%201950-2000.pdf">contemporary federalists</a>, the EU has already fulfilled the most important conditions of having a federal government. The EU legislation has an irreversible direct effect on domestic legal systems of Member States (MSs) as long as they remain a part of the union. The founding treaties (primary law) and regulations (secondary law) do not need to be transposed to the national legislations to be valid. Furthermore, according to the final decision of the European Court of Justice in <a href="http://www.asi.is/media/312986/c-06-1964-costa-enel.pdf">"Costa-Enel" case (1964)</a>, EU law is superior to the national law (principle of supremacy) where a contradiction occurs between these two legislations unless the opposite is decided or determined in an exceptional situation by the MSs or the EU.</p>

<p>Correspondingly, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) - now termed <a href="https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/institutions-bodies/court-justice_en">Court of Justice of the European Union</a> (CJEU, post-Lisbon) - as the sole coercive power enforcing EU law, protects the personal freedoms and rights of European citizens at the union level (on the initiative of the Commission). <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/files/chathamhouse/public/Research/Europe/borzel.pdf">EU law also enables</a> the citizens to file an action against the MSs in case their individual rights are violated by arbitrary actions of a member state. Thus, the decisions taken by the CJEU bind the national courts as an outcome of infringement procedures and of referrals to the preliminary ruling (by national courts). Obviously, the EU's judicial system is highly similar to the judicial system that works in federal states. </p>

<p>Furthermore, another important factor in strengthening the EU's federal character is undoubtedly 'the principle of subsidiarity' embedded in <a href="http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-european-union-and-comments/title-1-common-provisions/9-article-5.html">Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union</a> (TEU). Subsidiarity refers to the EU's application of a particular policy where it does not have the exclusive competence or, in other words, it shares this competence with the individual member states. More clearly, the EU may engage in a specific action if the action cannot effectively be taken by the local or regional governments of a member state (closest to the issue), or when it will be more effective if the EU takes the action in their place, although it is not exclusively authorized to act freely in this policy area. This shows that the environment of solidarity in federations between the state and the federal government is likely to exist between the EU and its MSs when necessary.</p>

<p>In contrast to a federalist, <a href="http://s-space.snu.ac.kr/bitstream/10371/96494/1/4.Democratic-Deficit-European-Constitution-and-a-Vision-of-the-Federal-Europe-the-EU%E2%80%99s-Path-after-the-Lisbon-Treaty-Kim-and-Jung.pdf">an intergovernmentalist claims</a> that the EU is more similar to a confederacy because the nation states are still major drivers in decision-making. Confederacy is a legally formed entity that has a central government which is competent to enforce laws binding all of its MSs. It is not only the unity of one people or nations but also unity established by states. In a federation, the central government far more meets the purposes of the government of a single people, while in a confederacy it is strictly speaking only for a government of governments. All EU institutions, except the Parliament, consist of elected or appointed government officials of the MSs. Also, it is worth repeating that the union itself is constituted on the confederate basis thanks to its multi-level governance (decentralization of power between the different levels of territorial governments). The <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0013:0045:en:PDF">TEU</a> and the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT&from=en">Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU, 2007)</a> have decentralized the power within the EU. "They make clear distinctions regarding the distribution of powers between the EU and MSs by classifying their competencies to carry out support, coordinate or supplement the actions of the MSs." Moreover, the TFEU has strengthened the role of Parliament so as to create a balance between it and the Council in terms of legislative power.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Parliament has still a relatively limited authority in comparison to the Council despite all the achievements gained via the TFEU, even though it is directly elected by the EU citizens through democratic elections renewed every five years. As distinct from the Parliament, the Council is entitled to apply the <a href="https://eeas.europa.eu/topics/common-foreign-security-policy-cfsp_en">Common Foreign and Security Policy</a> (CFSP) in cooperation with the European Council and to sign the international treaties with third parties. Whereas the European Commission, which is the only politically independent organ of the union, serves as an executive branch; it also initiates the legislative process by proposing new acts. However, these acts cannot be adopted unless the Parliament and the Council compromise on their enforcement. Under the circumstances, the EU accommodates both federal and confederate components, but it is neither completely one nor the other.</p>

<p>Today, what is disputable is whether the EU will become a political unity in the near future. With its present form, it could be assumed that the EU is somewhere between a confederacy and federation, and if it can become a political unity in the near future, it will most probably be too far away from the US model of federal systems. It may have to find another alternative form of a political integration due to the unwillingness of its MSs for a far less limited sovereignty transfer. Most of the MSs intend to prioritize their national interests at the supranational level. <a href="http://www.unep.org/about/cpr/">The Committee of Permanent Representatives </a>(COREPER) deployed in the Council of European Union is one of the most significant state intentions in this tendency. It is obvious that if the EU cannot be able to deal with this rigidity over the long term, it may not even take one step further in its integration process and will continue to be wide of the mark of a proper political unity.</p>

		<title>Giving a Voice to the 32,000: Why Immigrant Detainees Must Have First Amendment Rights</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Samantha Chasworth of the <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/law">St. John's University School of Law</a> discusses the harsh punishments inflicted upon immigrants in detention facilities...</j:header></p>

<p><strong>I</strong>n <a href="http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14476">Pineda Cruz v. Thompson</a>, the women of Karnes County Civil Detention Center in Texas protested the awful treatment they experienced during their stay. Approximately eighty mothers circulated a petition and announced a hunger strike during Holy Week, consuming only liquids. As a result, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and detention center employees were angered, and the treatment of the women got worse, leading to a class action law suit filed on behalf of the women in the detention center alleging violations of First Amendment free speech rights. In its motion to dismiss the action, the government argued the immigrant women did not have First Amendment rights. Although the <a href="https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/8088734/Pineda_Cruz_et_al_v_Thompson_et_al">Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed</a> their claim, putting an end to this specific case, this does not put an end to the abuse and terrible conditions experienced by many immigrants across the country. <br />
	<br />
Across the country, there are approximately <a href="https://immigrationforum.org/blog/themathofimmigrationdetention/">257 immigration detention facilities</a> housing approximately 32,00 people. Although ICE details <a href="https://www.ice.gov/factsheets/facilities-pbnds">standards</a> that all detention centers must comply with, in practice, the detainees are suffering. They experience arbitrary solitary confinement, windowless rooms, inadequate recreational time, and poor nutrition during meals. Further, detainees are given inadequate or no health care, not only for chronic conditions but also for contagious infections and diseases that cause others to become ill. Additionally, there are many allegations of abuse, including sexual abuse, and a lack of proper methods to protect detainees and report these incidents. This persists even though the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced plans to implement reporting measures as early as 2012. And tragically, according to ICE, between October 2003 and October 2013, there have been <a href="https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/detaineedeaths2003-present.pdf">141 in-custody deaths</a> within these detention centers, many tied to medical neglect or mistreatment. This is unacceptable; immigrants need a way to make their voices heard and protect themselves.<br />
	<br />
If prisoners retain certain fundamental rights while incarcerated, so should detained immigrants. In 1987, the Supreme Court decided <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/482/78/case.html">Turner v. Safley</a> and declared that "[p]rison walls do not form a barrier separating inmates from the protections of the Constitution." Prisoners have the right to the protections guaranteed by the First Amendment. The immigration system is civil, not criminal, and detainees are given fewer rights and are treated horribly, as if they were criminals. Why is it that criminals have the ability to speak freely but detainees in a civil system are told they are not allowed to protest? For example, in Pineda Cruz v. Thompson, guards and ICE went so far as to punish those who protested their treatment with solitary confinement, telling them they were "<a href="http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14476">mentally unfit to care for their children</a>" and "they should agree to be deported if they want to leave so badly."  Because detainees are deterred from protesting, their treatment will not improve; they will only continue to suffer in these detention centers without anyone to protect them.  <br />
	<br />
Immigrants need a way to protect themselves. They need to be able to speak freely about their concerns and treatment while in detention centers. Because noncitizens are already entitled to other fundamental rights, they ought to be entitled to First Amendment rights protected as well. Noncitizens are currently entitled to (1) equal protection under the law; (2) due process of law before deprivation of life, liberty or property; (3) basic rights in a criminal prosecution; and (4) freedom from slavery and involuntary servitude. The government and the Supreme Court cannot arbitrarily pick and choose which rights noncitizens are entitled to, especially when the stakes are extremely high. Without First Amendment rights and protections, noncitizens are suffering tremendously in detention centers because their voices are chilled; they are not allowed to speak. They need to voice their concerns without fear of further punishment. </p>

<p>Protesting is an appropriate and essential way for noncitizens to confront the harsh treatment they are experiencing in detention centers, bring awareness to the issue, and seek to change it. With the alarming number of in-custody deaths, physical and sexual abuses, and general mistreatment occurring within the walls of detention centers, detainees are hopeless. After asking a detainee at T. Don Hutto Detention center why she resorted to protesting, her <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/11/why-are-hundreds-detained-immigrants-going-hunger-strike">response</a> was, "I cannot take more of this punishment. I am dying of desperation from this injustice, from this cruelty." </p>

<p>The treatment and inability to freely protest in the Karnes County Civil Detention Center caused the women in Pineda Cruz v. Thompson to file a class action lawsuit. This treatment is occurring across the United States where there are approximately 257 detention centers and nearly 32,000 detainees who need to and should be able to speak freely. There are 32,000 detainees experiencing unreasonably harsh treatment, inadequate medical care, and punishment for even the slightest reason.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Julie R. Colton of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law discusses how the newfound legalization of same-sex marriage can raise more questions than it answers, particularly with respect to common law marriage...</p>

<p>Even though the U.S. Supreme Court <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2938242242591208349&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">ruled in</a> <u>Obergefell </u>that bans on same-sex marriage are unconstitutional back in 2015, important issues surrounding same-sex marriage are still unsettled.  For example, the Supreme Court had <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17574779299286033070">to address</a> the fact that lesbian married parents were not receiving the same parentage recognition as opposite-sex married parents in Arkansas.  A federal Court of Appeals <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-appeals-court-upholds-north-carolina-same-sex-marriage-recusal-law.php">upheld</a> a North Carolina law that would allow magistrate judges to refuse to perform same-sex marriages. </p>

<p>As marriage rights continue to settle in, their effects on same-sex divorce are beginning to surface.  Determining the date of marriage is a crucial element for divorce.  The date of marriage helps set the marital estate to be divided and is considered when determining alimony.  A date of marriage may help determine parentage, which could be game changing in custody proceedings.  Determining a date of marriage is rarely disputed because a marriage certificate usually exists and common law marriage was rescinded in 2005.  But in a same-sex marriage, what is the date of marriage?</p>

<p>Is it the day that the Obergefell opinion was issued?  Is it the day that it was legalized in the couple's home state?  Is it the day the couple married, even if that's before same-sex marriage was legal?  Is it the date that a civil union was entered into?  What about common law marriage?  Could same-sex couples have been common law married in a state that had a same-sex marriage ban while the ban was in effect?  </p>

<p>In Pennsylvania, the Superior Court <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12358282200060066188">took up</a> that question in <u>In re: Estate of Stephen Carter</u>.  Mr. Carter died in 2013 and his partner, Mr. Hunter, petitioned for a declaration of marriage in 2016 as part of processing the estate.  Same-sex marriage did not <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/federal-judge-strikes-down-pennsylvania-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">become legal </a>in Pennsylvania until 2014, while common law marriage had been outlawed since 2005.  How was Mr. Hunter asking the court to determine that he and Mr. Carter had been married?  He wanted the court to recognize his relationship as a same-sex common law marriage.  </p>

<p>First, let's dispel a myth: common law marriage is not established by living together for seven years. Each state that recognizes common law marriage has a definition of common law marriage that has to be met.  In Pennsylvania, there are two tests: one test for if both parties are living, and a second test in the case where one of the potential spouses has died.  There is one test for divorce or marriage cases where both parties are alive and therefore available to testify.  There is a second test in estate cases where the only part available to confirm or deny the allegation of a common law marriage is not available because of death.  In the <u>Carter</u> case, the court applied the estate test where there is a rebuttable presumption of a common law marriage if evidence shows cohabitation and reputation of marriage.  Had this been a divorce case where both parties were available to testify, Mr. Carter and Mr. Hunter would have had to prove a present tense exchange of vows of marriage.</p>

<p>Mr. Hunter was able to meet all the requirements of cohabitation and reputation to prove the parties had been living as spouses.  That leaves one last hurdle, marriage was banned at the time the men exchanged rings and it was not legalized until after the unfortunate death of Mr. Carter.  The Pennsylvania and federal bans on same sex marriage had both been ruled unconstitutional.  When a statute is ruled on constitutional it is as if it never existed in the first place, unless the court that determines the unconstitutionality specifically states otherwise.  So, the Pennsylvania Superior Court determined that Mr. Carter and Mr. Hunter were married at the time of Mr. Hunter's death.</p>

<p>Even post-mortem determinations of marriage are important, which was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000003765330/how-a-love-story-triumphed-in-court.html">evidenced </a>by the many people involved in the Obergefell case.  </p>

<p>Also, the recognition of common law marriage in divorces will increase the time period where the marital estate accumulated.  It may also increase the number of same-sex marriages.</p>

<p>The reconciliation of common law marriage also affects federal benefits.  A couple must be married at least ten years to be eligible for the spousal benefit in social security after divorce.  It also affects the income tax filing status and the percent of inheritance tax assessed at the time of death.  A common law marriage may also play a role in the outcome of personal injury cases, opening up more cases to a loss of consortium claim. </p>

<p>Common law marriage also pops up in the employment law realm.  Is a partner a spouse when the pension pays out?  Is the person a spouse for the purpose of worker's compensation death benefits?  </p>

<p>The recognition of common law same sex marriage also benefits children.  It will protect the inheritance rights of children of same-sex couples.  It will protect the parent-child relations for children of same-sex couples whose parents utilize the court system for custody.  It may also prevent third parties from claiming parentage based on the legal fictions of parentage in the state of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>If the ban on same-sex marriage is unconstitutional, and pre-2005 same-sex common law marriage exist in Pennsylvania, how far back should we look?  At what point should employers be able to breathe easy and no longer be subject to lawsuits about spousal benefits?  How long should the government be free from requests to adjust past income tax or inheritance tax returns?  Does the statute of limitations run from the date of the incident?  Or does it run from the date where people knew or should have known that they were legally married?</p>

<p>Can a civil union be seen as evidence of a common law marriage?  Once again, in Pennsylvania, the Superior Court <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1767733516885744728">has allowed</a> a civil union to be considered a marriage when the state in which the civil union was performed specifically stated the purpose of civil unions was to grant rights identical to the rights available to opposite-sex couples through marriage. Since Vermont was trying to create marriage equality, Pennsylvania recognizes Vermont civil unions as marriages.  This may provide some clarity about a date of marriage if the couple had earlier entered in to a civil union. If the civil union was not legislatively converted to a marriage, could it be a common law marriage? Is a civil union a marriage?  Did it grant the same rights?  Clearly PA is allowing some civil unions to be considered marriages for the purpose of divorce, but left the door open for this matter to be challenged when the state of ceremony has different laws.  <br />
	<br />
The intersection of same-sex marriage and common law marriage will have many benefits for couples.  It will also create some sticky situations.  </p>

		<title>What&amp;apos;s up, DACA? (Legally, at least...)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.cwsl.edu/faculty-staff-and-campus-directories/faculty-and-staff-directory/g/glenn-c-smith">Glenn C. Smith</a> of the <a href="https://www.cwsl.edu">California Western School of Law</a> discusses the legal issues surrounding DACA...</p>

<p>In explaining why President Trump was rescinding his predecessor's DACA ("<a href="https://www.uscis.gov/archive/consideration-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca">Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals</a>") program &#8212; which provided two-year renewable protection from deportation, and rights to work and access limited social services, to 800,000-plus undocumented "dreamers" brought to America as children &#8212; Attorney General Sessions called DACA "an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch." </p>

<p>By contrast, in his social-media <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/05/politics/obama-daca/index.html">lambast</a> of the Administration's decision, President Obama said it was a "political decision" not "required legally." </p>

<p>So, who's right on DACA's legality? As is typical, the truth is complicated. And it depends upon how the question is framed.</p>

<p>No American court has opined about the legal merits of DACA itself, and there are persuasive arguments for and against it.  But if the reasons three out of four lower-court judges rejected a later-adopted sibling (DAPA, the "<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/keywords/deferred-action-parents-americans-and-lawful-permanent-residents">Deferred Action for Parents of Americans</a>" program) would have appealed to a current majority on the Supreme Court, then a continued DACA order would have been cruising for an eventual legal bruising.</p>

<p>Yet, the "if" in the above sentence is precisely the problem.  How DACA would have ultimately fared in the current Court is difficult to predict.  This is true because the Court failed to send clear signals (or even rule) in the DAPA case, because good arguments for and against DAPA and DACA exist, and because it is not definitively clear how a majority of the current Court (including new Justice Neil Gorsuch) would have ruled on DACA itself.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the lesson to be learned from DACA's demise may be less about legal merits and more about the impacts of congressional inaction.</p>

<p><strong>No Legal Ruling on "Original DACA"</strong></p>

<p>To start at the beginning: no American court has opined about the legal merits of DACA itself. The much-publicized legal challenge to Obama-era immigration orders by Texas and 25 other States instead focused on DAPA, the broader followup order issued a 17 months later by the Obama Administration. DAPA would have provided similar renewal protection against deportation to several million parents and children of the dreamers covered by DACA. I say "would have" because DAPA never really got much traction. </p>

<p>On administrative-process grounds &#8212; but not before gratuitously opining about DAPA's substantive legitimacy &#8212; a federal-district court in southern Texas issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against program implementation. A Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals panel split 2-1 in upholding the district-court injunction, finding DAPA "manifestly contrary" to the substance of applicable immigration statutes. (Caveat: Although the prime focus of this litigation was DAPA, the district-court order sustained by the intermediate appellate panel also stopped in their tracks three DACA expansions the Administration announced at the same time it unveiled DAPA.)</p>

<p><strong>But Was DACA Likely to be Invalidated?</strong></p>

<p>By November 2015, then, the original DACA program had gone into effect; by the time it was rescinded, it had granted deferrals to more than 785,000 dreamers. Yet, two levels of federal courts had invalidated DACA's sibling and halted DACA's expansion on legal theories quite applicable to DACA itself. So, does this mean that DACA itself was heading for a judicial rejection?</p>

<p>That's a hard question to answer. First, the Supreme Court ended up providing no definitive ruling on lower-court rejection of DAPA. The eight-justice Court ultimately split 4-4 in June 2016. (I profiled the dynamics of this split, and the issues it left on the table, in an earlier JURIST column, <a href="https://www.jurist.org/forum/2016/08/glenn-smith-dapa-decision.php">The DAPA Non-Decision: The Meaning of Missed Opportunities</a>.)</p>

<p>Second, this split among judges and justices reflects at least in part the strong legal arguments for and against DAPA (and by extension its older sibling, DACA).</p>

<p>DACA, like DAPA, is arguably a valid exercise of the wide authority Congress has given the president to set immigration-enforcement priorities and determine how scarce enforcement resources will be used. In this light, supporters can persuasively frame DACA as a valid exercise of the president's <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii">constitutional power</a> to "faithfully Execute" the laws of the United States. Presidents arguably have discretion to decide that "dreamers" are a low enforcement priority and that the economic, social, and humanitarian costs they face in living under a deportation cloud are unacceptable; past presidents have exercised comparable authority (although not on as large a scale) to forestall deportation of groups of non-citizens not able to be naturalized under current legal rules.</p>

<p>To the contrary, if one views DACA as granting new substantive rights (including work authorization), then the legal landscape looks very different. Congress never intended that presidents would use their discretion over enforcement priorities to in essence change the law about the immigration status of millions of people. The president's "faithful execution" power is not the power to make up a new presidential policy and execute it. Past presidential orders forestalling deportation of groups are arguably not remotely comparable in size or effect.</p>

<p>Finally, other than through a simplistic political calculation &#8212; in which the current Republican-appointed majority would rule against an Obama-originated policy even though continued by a Republican president &#8212; it is less than certain which set of DACA arguments would have won out in the now-reconstituted nine-member Supreme Court. To begin with, it is not even clear that a majority would have been willing to reach the merits. As my earlier column indicated, the bases on which Texas and the other states claimed individualized injury to have "standing" to challenge DAPA raised serious issues under well-established doctrines seeking to promote judicial restraint. New Justice Gorsuch, for example, might have been given pause.  </p>

<p>Even if the justices would have been willing to reach the merits, predicting how they would have resolved the complicated statutory-construction arguments is a challenge. (Significantly, federal statutes give the president substantially more discretion over initial entry into the country than conditions of naturalization for persons already present. Thus, it presumably is not probative that in June 2017 Justice Gorsuch joined a minority of justices who would have let the Trump travel ban go fully into effect pending Court review.) Further, the statutory arguments about DACA would have unfolded under still-uncertain cross currents in the constitutional doctrines governing presidential-power assertions.  Finally, it is difficult to predict how the equitable differences between DACA and DAPA would have played out. (Although the legal arguments against DACA and DAPA significantly dovetail, the fairness arguments for protecting the dreamers themselves might have been significantly more appealing than the arguments for protecting their relatives.)</p>

<p><strong>The Ultimate Lesson?</strong></p>

<p>Perhaps the source of DACA's ultimate legal uncertainty is the main lesson here. Congress clearly had &#8212; and has &#8212; the authority to legislate a DACA-type renewable deferral program. But Congress did not act, making the resonant legal question whether DACA could be imposed by unilateral executive action.</p>

<p>Indeed, President Trump may face a return of this uncertainty -- depending upon what he meant by a September 5th tweet promising to "revisit" DACA if Congress fails to act in six months.</p>

<p>Regardless, if Congress continues to be gripped by dysfunctional partisan gridlock, both Trump and successor presidents may face DACA-like legal exposure when they act unilaterally on an even broader range of issues.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Victoria Drake of the <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/law">St. John's University School of Law</a> discusses Fourth Amendment rights amidst advancements in cloud technology...</j:header><strong>I</strong> am a millennial, and technology is a major part of my life. When I discovered "the cloud," it completely changed the way I store my electronic data. The pictures I took from my European vacation, my tax returns, and even my notes, papers, and documents from law school are all stored in my cloud account. The amount of storage, and ease of access were what enticed me to create a cloud account. I feared that my computer will crash, and that I might lose everything I have stored on the hard drive; but now that I have a cloud account, that fear is no longer a reality. As long as I have an Internet connection, my files are always available to me on any device. </p>

<p>As much as I want instant access to all my data, I equally do not want the government having any access to it. In light of the current <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/18/technology/explaining-apples-fight-with-the-fbi.html">battle between Apple and the FBI</a>, it appears that other U.S. citizens are just as concerned as I am about preserving a balance between privacy, and what the government can and cannot gain access to. In particular, I am concerned with keeping the data that I store in my cloud account private, and keeping law enforcement out. It is implausible that a judge would approve a warrant to seize all the letters I have ever mailed in my lifetime through USPS, so why should a judge approve a warrant for all content stored in my cloud account? Just because my data is digitized, and I can save an immense amount of it in a single account, does not mean that that data is less deserving of <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> protections.</p>

<p>When the founding fathers drafted the <a href="https://www.billofrightsinstitute.org/founding-documents/bill-of-rights/">Bill of Rights</a>, more specifically, the Fourth Amendment, they would have never imagined the vast breakthroughs in technology that we see today. In drafting the Fourth Amendment, James Madison guaranteed a "right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects;" an umbrella of protections. The Fourth Amendment should continue to be read with such broadness, especially in the age of the cloud. There is a need for law enforcement to gain access to cloud accounts through warrants, but the rights of U.S. citizens cannot be ignored. </p>

<p>The current federal law that addresses how law enforcement can obtain warrants for electronic data stored in the cloud is known as the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-121">Stored Communications Act </a>(SCA), which was passed as part of the <a href="https://it.ojp.gov/PrivacyLiberty/authorities/statutes/1285">Electronic Communication Privacy Act of 1986</a>. 1986 was more than thirty years ago, and technology has tremendously changed since then. Today, Congress seeks to amend the SCA with the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/512/text">Law Enforcement Access to Data Stored Abroad Act </a>(LEADS). What LEADS intends to do is limit warrants for electronic data to only U.S. persons or businesses incorporated in the U.S. However, LEADS fails to stipulate a time frame that government actors can access a cloud account, and it also fails to particularize the type of data to be seized. LEADS is a good start to updating the old SCA, but it has serious gaps and we should not squander the legislative attention being paid by leaving the gap unfilled. More importantly, LEADS should not become law unless it is amended to comply with the Fourth Amendment. </p>

<p>Under the SCA and LEADS, there are no sections stipulating what Fourth Amendment guidelines law enforcement should abide by when applying for a warrant to search your cloud account. For me, the solution is simple: recognition of a reasonable expectation of privacy in data stored in the cloud. Unfortunately, no court has recognized a reasonable expectation of privacy in data stored in the cloud, but I feel that the courts are approaching the subject. In 2010, the Sixth Circuit, in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1170760837547673255&q=U.S.+v.+Warshak&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">U.S. v. Warshak</a>, was the first circuit to recognize a reasonable expectation of privacy in the content of e-mails stored on third party servers. The Sixth Circuit stated that the content of e-mails are subject to Fourth Amendment protections. Furthermore, in 2014, the Supreme Court, in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9647156672357738355&q=Riley+v.+California&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Riley v. California</a>, held that the warrantless search and seizure of digital content of a cell phone during an arrest is unconstitutional. Chief Justice Roberts explained that since cellphones can take advantage of cloud technology, Fourth Amendment safeguards should exist. And even today, several courts are divided on the issue plaguing the FBI and Apple, and whether Apple should have to comply with the FBI's demand to unlock the phone that belonged to the San Bernardino killer. Even though these cases have not directly recognized a reasonable expectation of privacy in data stored in the cloud, I believe that the holdings from these cases are laying the groundwork that will help to achieve that privacy right.  </p>

<p>In order for a reasonable expectation of privacy to exist, there is a two-fold test that must be adhered to. The first step is to determine whether a person has exhibited an actual expectation of privacy. The second step is to determine whether that expectation of privacy is one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable. I believe that when it comes to data stored in the cloud, a reasonable expectation of privacy should exist. First, I keep my cloud account private by utilizing password protection. I also do not share my password or any of the content within my cloud account. Second, I am not the only individual who takes advantage of cloud technology; therefore, I feel that society is ready to recognize an expectation of privacy in data stored in the cloud. Millions of Americans utilize cloud technology, and also safeguard their accounts through password protection or encryption services. I firmly believe that society is ready to recognize a privacy right in data stored in the cloud, especially since so many Americans vocalized distrust and contempt against the FBI in its recent battle with Apple. </p>

<p>According to Justice Stewart in his majority opinion from <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9210492700696416594&q=Katz+v.+U.S.&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Katz v. U.S.</a>, the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places. Justice Stewart even went so far as to say that what a person "seeks to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public, may be constitutionally protected." I seek to preserve as private all data that is stored in my cloud account. I keep my account private, and so do millions of other cloud users. It is vital that the Fourth Amendment evolves with technology, and that is why I believe that it is time for the courts to award Fourth Amendment protections to data stored in the cloud. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Loreal Lingad of the <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/law">St. John's University School of Law</a> discusses the connection between disciplinary actions in schools and incarceration...</j:header></p>

<p><strong>O</strong>ut of all of my cousins in the tri-state area, I am the only one who has never been arrested. And as a Filipino-American, I have a lot of cousins. Growing up, my parents were fully invested in making sure that I succeeded in school and stayed out of trouble. And by fully invested, I mean both financially invested and personally invested. Both of my parents agreed to send me to a private elementary school and private high school that boasted high-test scores and promises of being feeder schools into exemplary colleges. My father worked at a well-known publishing house during the day and my mother worked at a laboratory during the night. It was a compromise they agreed to--to have one of them always at home to closely supervise my upbringing.</p>

<p>I always wanted to attend a public school. I almost thought I could get away with it in high school; but my parents were adamant that I not attend our local high school. A lot of my friends were there, even my cousins. Why couldn't I go?</p>

<p>Answer: our local high school had an awful reputation for producing students who did not graduate and that ended up in jail. My parents were dedicated to making sure that I did not get sucked into the school-to-prison pipeline. The school-to-prison pipeline is the connection between disciplinary actions in schools and incarceration. Most of the students who are caught in the school-to-prison pipeline are minority students. Oftentimes, minority students enter the school-to-prison pipeline from being punished by a zero-tolerance disciplinary policy. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/06/opinion/zero-tolerance-reconsidered.html?mcubz=1">zero-tolerance disciplinary policy</a> is a harsh disciplinary punishment implemented by a school that calls for extreme punishments for minor infractions at schools.  Examples of minor infractions include "profanity, talking back...and shoving matches."  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/09/us/us-criticizes-zero-tolerance-policies-in-schools.html?mcubz=1">Former Attorney General Eric Holder has stated </a>that, "[a] routine school disciplinary infraction should land a student in the principal's office, not in a police precinct."</p>

<p>A lot of parents don't have a choice as to where they send their children to elementary and high school like mine did. If a parent sends his or her child to a school that has implemented zero-tolerance disciplinary policies, what can that parent do? What choices does this parent have when his or her child is suspended from school for throwing an eraser at another student and is forced to miss valuable class time; which in turn allows this child to be more susceptible to getting into trouble? Unfortunately, Congress has not created a private right of action for parents to bring private lawsuits against a school or a school district for the disparate impact it has on minority students for its zero-tolerance disciplinary policies.  Until Congress does create a private right of action, one option available to a parent is to file a complaint under <a href="http://civilrights.findlaw.com/discrimination/title-iv-of-the-civil-rights-act-of-1964-desegregation-of-public.html?version=2">Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> with the Attorney General. An example of a school district that the Attorney General intervened in was the <a href="http://kirwaninstitute.osu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ki-interventions.pdf">Meridian Public School District in Mississippi</a>. Since the intervention of the Attorney General, Meridian has reported that its zero-tolerance disciplinary actions have decreased by 50 percent and academic achievement has increased by over 20 percent.  </p>

<p>At this point, you're probably thinking, "Why is this over-privileged law student rambling about the disparate impact of zero-tolerance disciplinary policies in schools?"</p>

<p>Answer: I've seen enough of my friends and family get arrested and end up in jail because they spent too much time outside of a classroom when they should've been inside one. As an intern in criminal court, I've seen enough eighteen-year-old African-American and Hispanic teenagers getting sentenced to state prison rather than graduating high school.  I've seen enough mothers cry over their sons and daughters as they watch their children enter guilty pleas. If it weren't for my active parents, I don't think I would've been able to avoid the school-to-prison pipeline. It's time for other parents to see that they have choices, too.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.savannahlawschool.org/facultystaff/andrew-wright/">Andrew Wright</a> of the <a href="https://www.savannahlawschool.org">Savannah Law School</a> discusses President Trump's newly revised travel ban...</p><strong>O</strong>n September 24th, President Donald Trump issued a <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017entry.prc_.rel_.pdf">presidential proclamation</a> revising the entry suspensions and restrictions outlined in <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/06/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states">Executive Order 13780</a>, issued March 6, 2017. The March 6 E.O. replaced the original chaos-inducing travel ban instituted by <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/27/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states">Executive Order 13769</a> on January 27, 2017.  For ease of reference, I refer to these three presidential executive actions sequentially as Travel Ban 1.0 (January 27), Travel Ban 2.0 (March 6), and Travel Ban 3.0 (September 24).  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/09/trump-significantly-limits-entry-into-us-from-eight-nations.php">JURIST reported</a> on the scope of the new ban's coverage, and Marty Lederman provided helpful <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/45278/entry-suspensions-restrictions/">additional analysis</a> of the Travel Ban 3.0 on <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org">Just Security</a>. In operative effect, Travel Ban 3.0 suspended immigration of individuals from Chad and North Korea, in addition to those from Iran, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen who were already covered by Travel Ban 2.0. It also suspends, to varying degrees, the entry of nonimmigrants from those countries, along with certain classes of Venezuelans. It also had the likely effect of mooting much of the pending federal litigation.</p>

<p>The president chose to shift from use of an executive order to a presidential proclamation as the platform for this policy pronouncement. While I cannot resolve the question as to the president's motivation, I offer some basic contours of these different forms of presidential directives. Bottom line: the validity of the president's travel ban policy will turn on its substance (and, I would argue, irrationality), not its delivery by means of executive order or presidential proclamation.</p>

<p>The Constitution's enumerated government structure requires that all presidential directives must trace authority to an express constitutional grant of power, a presidential power implied by the Constitution, or a legislative enactment delegating authority to the president. A presidential directive can be controversial as a matter of process by nature of its expression of unilateral action by the president. However, they are more often controversial as a matter of substance: either by means of a contested authority asserted by the president or the president's policy choice. </p>

<p>Neither the Constitution nor Congress created executive orders and other presidential directives. Rather, they are creatures of customary presidential practice. There are therefore no concrete, universally accepted definitions of each form of presidential directive. There is plenty of overlap, which often gives a president a choice among forms of directive for a given policy. There are some general distinctions that can be made based on recent presidential practices. Presidential directives can come in a number of forms, including executive orders, presidential memoranda, presidential proclamations, national security directives, or presidential signing statements. Here, I will address the general distinction between executive orders and presidential proclamations. More comprehensive treatments, albeit from the legislative branch perspective, may be found in a series of Congressional Research Service reports "Executive Orders and Proclamations" (See the <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/95-772.pdf">1999 report</a> and <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RS20846.pdf">2014 report</a>). One immediate similarity between them: the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/44/1505">Federal Register Act</a> requires that both executive orders and proclamations be published in the Federal Register.</p>

<p><strong>Executive Orders</strong></p>

<p>In 1957, the House Committee on Government Operations <a href="http://commdocs.house.gov/committees/judiciary/hju63865.000/hju63865_0f.htm">offered</a> the most widely recognized definition of an executive order: "Executive orders are written documents denominated as such...[and] are generally directed to, and govern actions by, Government officials and agencies." Executive orders tend to regulate the conduct of government officials and affect private individuals only indirectly. They tend to focus on management of the federal agencies of the Executive Branch.</p>

<p>Presidents have used executive orders to establish executive branch policy binding subordinate officials, to formulate policy in an area the President deems to have authority, to delegate executive authority to agencies, to direct agencies to establish regulations, to manage federal property, to reorganize federal agencies, and to supervise military organization.  For example, President George Washington used an executive order to require executive department heads "to submit a 'clear account'" of their departments' operations. Similarly, President Barack Obama used <a href="https://www.dol.gov/whd/flsa/eo13658/index.htm">Executive Order 13658</a> to establish a minimum wage for government contractors.</p>

<p>Executive orders that originate outside of the White House must go through an approval process run by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which is a component of the Executive Office of the President. </p>

<p>The travel ban executive orders originated inside the White House and were therefore exempt from the OMB formal process. President Trump used the Travel Ban 2.0 executive order direct subordinates (the Secretary of Homeland Security and Attorney General) to conduct a worldwide review of information and make recommendations the President to inform his judgment before that order expired. In that sense, while the Travel Ban 2.0 executive order certainly affected individual rights directly, it also largely directed subordinate executive officers to undertake duties.  </p>

<p><strong>Presidential Proclamations</strong></p>

<p>In contrast, presidential proclamations more often affect the interests of private individuals and organizations than executive orders. Presidents use proclamations to grant pardons, declare holidays, make hortatory pronouncements, and recognize citizen achievements. For example, President Abraham Lincoln issued the <a href="http://www.historynet.com/emancipation-proclamation-text">Emancipation Proclamation</a> on January 1, 1863, which declared that "all persons held as slaves" within the Confederacy "henceforward shall be free."  </p>

<p>Presidents have used proclamations to announce foreign policy. In addition, proclamations also may become the vehicle by which to make presidential findings required in order to trigger a conditional statutory authority. Presidents have also invoked emergency powers by means of proclamation.  </p>

<p><strong>President Trump's Shift</strong></p>

<p>The Travel Ban 3.0 proclamation is largely framed as announcements of policy (e.g., § 1(a) ("It is the policy of the United States...)" or § 1(c)(ii) ("The United States expects...")). Some of its provisions reflect the President's determinations following the recommendations he had previously mandated by Executive Order. See § 1(h)(ii) ("After reviewing the Secretary of Homeland Security's report...I have determined"). In these purely procedural senses, the president's policy is within the recent historical use of proclamation as a mode of presidential directive. However, the President could have also used an executive order again to achieve the same results. For example, the Travel Ban 2.0 executive order also declared U.S. policy. See Travel Ban 2.0 E.O. § 1(a) ("It is the policy of the United States..."). In any event, the legality of the president's policy will be decided on substantive constitutional or statutory grounds rather than the typology of presidential directive.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.cla.purdue.edu/polsci/directory/?p=Louis_Beres">Louis René Beres</a> of Purdue University, critically analyzes Trump's "America First" foreign policy...</p>

<p><em>Instead of exchanging corrosive epithets with Kim Jung Un, President Trump should focus on creating a better understanding of the North Korean dictator's personal pattern of crisis decision. This would best be accomplished by more express thinking along the traditional medical science orientations of diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy.</em></p>

<p><strong>I</strong>n medicine, it has long been understood that proper therapy must be based solidly upon prior diagnosis. Such diagnosis, moreover, must always be consciously founded upon appropriate and verifiable science, and not merely represent the physician's own personal seat-of-the-pants intuition. Oddly enough, although precisely the same pattern of scientific analysis and "healing" should be followed in diplomatic crisis management, U.S. President Donald Trump's orientation to North Korea has been singularly detached from any pertinent sorts of assessment. </p>

<p>Going forward, there is nothing to be gained for the United States by publically demeaning and taunting the North Korean leader, especially if he really is as "crazy" as President Trump alleges. Even if he is not "crazy" or "deranged" (Trump's other preferred descriptor), such rhetorical belligerence can do nothing to reduce sorely palpable risks to the United States. On the contrary, mindlessly hewing to what the logicians would call an argumentum ad bacculum - a fallacy based upon illogical expectations for the utility of force - can only further undermine this country's national security.</p>

<p>This is not a time for loose or inconsequential thinking. The only way American strategic planners can help to preserve nuclear peace with North Korea is by deriving a decipherable prognosis and promising therapy from systematic diagnosis. Without a prior and sound assessment of what is actually wrong with our adversary's calculations, we can never expect to fashion any reliable prognoses or derivatively usable remedies. It is foolish and dangerous for this <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/19/trump-un-speech-2017-full-text-transcript-242879">president to blame</a> Pyongyang's nuclearization on alleged eccentricities of the North Korean "rocket man." Among other things, it could be plainly apparent to a perfectly sane and rational Kim Jung Un that Iraq's Saddam Hussein and Libya's Mommar Gadhafi both lost power only after first losing their indispensable nuclear leverage.</p>

<p>Seen in this light, is "Rocket Man" still "crazy?</p>

<p>There is more. In preparing for purposeful nuclear crisis bargaining with North Korea, Donald Trump (through no fault of his own) will have little <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/29/world/asia/north-korea-nuclear-timeline---fast-facts/index.html">meaningful precedent</a> upon which to rely. Still, he will need to make some more-or-less predictable sense out of an intrinsically unpredictable set of problems. In this connection, Mr. Trump and his counselors ought never forget that a rapid-cycle deterioration of competition in risk-taking could be rendered ever more precarious as a result of certain unforeseen interactions. </p>

<p>At times, such perilous interactions would rise to the level of "synergies," or mutually-reinforcing debilities wherein the "whole" of formidable American risk exceeds the sum of enemy-inflicted "parts."</p>

<p>In any event, Mr. Trump must proceed in any still-impending North Korean crisis with exquisite prudence and an antecedent diagnosis, bearing in mind that while nuclear war avoidance is most important, maintaining "escalation dominance" would also be indispensable. In essence, presidential success here will require striking a very delicate "balance" between narrowly self-assertive and broadly cooperative strategies.</p>

<p>In all expectedly balanced deliberations with the North Koreans, America might do better to rely, at least in part, on talented diplomats, poets, philosophers and mathematicians than on exclusively career soldiers. For one thing, in the grievously measureless legacy of warfare, the military professional has made more than a few consequential mistakes. Looking ahead, we ought not now be demanding that trained military strategists could demonstrate optimal "therapeutic" capacities in managing conflicts with which they have had no possible acquaintance.</p>

<p>For the United States, the looming North Korea crisis, whether protracted or episodic, will inevitably be one of "mind over mind," and not of <a href="https://twitter.com/i/moments/895005799927250944?lang=en">"fire and fury."</a> During this daunting intellectual struggle, each side, as long as it remains recognizably rational, will be seeking "escalation dominance" without needlessly endangering its own national survival. Significantly, if the American side should sometime calculate that its North Korean counterpart is not fully rational, the apparent incentives to undertake far-reaching military preemptions could then quickly become overwhelming. </p>

<p>This is the case even if the American calculation on enemy rationality should turn out to be wrong. Also relevant here would be certain understandably anticipated prospects of any North Korean plans to "preempt the preemption," cautionary scenarios that could make genuine strategic sense in Pyongyang. President Kim's closest military counselors could sometime seek to clarify for their "great leader" ("The General") that the United States would have considerable damage-limiting advantages to striking-first, especially while North Korea's nuclear weapon and ballistic missile assets were in early stages of development, and were still few in number.</p>

<p>At that point, striking first against the United States could appear as the most visibly rational option, ironically, even more so if the American president had appeared "too convincing" with his own pet "madman" notions of pretended irrationality.  Managing national security is substantially different from negotiating real estate transactions in Palm Beach or The Bronx. It's time for the American president to acknowledge this fundamental difference.</p>

<p>There is more. If President Trump should decide to launch a defensive first-strike, a "preemption," the North Korean response, whether rational or irrational, could be "disproportionate." In that very unstable case, one rife with the potential for a more continuously unfettered escalation, any contemplated introduction of nuclear weapons into the mix might not easily be prevented.</p>

<p>If President Donald Trump's defensive first strike against North Korea were recognizably less than massive, a fully rational adversary in Pyongyang might determine that his own chosen reprisal should be correspondingly "limited." But if Mr. Trump's consciously rational and systematically calibrated attack upon North Korea were wittingly or unwittingly launched against an irrational enemy leadership, the response from Kim Jung Un could then become an "all out" retaliation. </p>

<p>Such an unanticipated response, whether nuclear or  non-nuclear, would expectedly be directed at some as yet undeterminable combination of U.S., South Korean, and/or Japanese targets. </p>

<p>Cumulatively, of course, this sort of response could inflict very tangible harms. North Korea's unconventional weapons already include advanced biological and chemical agents. Even a perfectly rational North Korean leadership could sometime calculate that all-out retaliations would make perfect strategic sense.</p>

<p>In facing off against each other, even under optimal assumptions of mutual capability and rationality, both President Trump and President Kim Jung Un must continuously concern themselves with  possible miscalculations, errors in information, unauthorized uses of strategic weapons, mechanical or computer malfunctions, and cyber-defense/cyber-war. This means that even if President Trump and President Kim were both entirely sane and focused - a charitable assumption, to be sure - northeast Asia could still descend rapidly toward an uncontrollable nuclear war. </p>

<p>When Pericles delivered his famous <a href="https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/ancient/pericles-funeralspeech.asp">Funeral Oration</a>, it was to express confidence in an ultimate victory for Athens. Simultaneously, as recalled by Thucydides, the Greek historian of the <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Thucydides/pelopwar.html">Peloponnesian War</a> (431 - 404 BCE), Pericles had also expressed various deep apprehensions about self-imposed setbacks along the way. "What I fear more than the strategies of our enemies," lamented Pericles, "is our own mistakes." </p>

<p>Today, our own biggest mistake vis-à-vis North Korea would be to further abandon a medical model of strategic crisis analysis, and continue to rely instead upon the patently ineffectual grammar of visceral tweets or competitive insults. This judgment is offered not because of any primary per se concern for reducing expansively boorish US presidential behavior in world politics, but only to better ensure that all our developing American "therapies" for the Kim Jung Un "pathology" are based upon thoroughly scientific diagnoses.</p>

<p>The hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, like the missiles of October 1962 and the hijacked airplanes of September 2001, were seen by many people as signs of the apocalypse. The slow-moving satellite pictures of swirling masses provided references for impending doom. When the storms hit land, their furious winds contained the sum of all fears, and, in seconds, countless things accumulated in finite lives were soaked and blown away. Parts of Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico, in short, became war zones.<br />
 <br />
Although these hurricanes took fewer than two hundred American lives, the damage was akin to an invader's path of destruction. For the civilians, the logical response was to evacuate. Climate change, many of them accepted, was as obvious a threat to their security as nuclear war and international terrorism. Warmer oceans, they heard, were the fuel for superstorms.<br />
 <br />
Our national security agencies, in fact, have long been concerned with the threats from hurricanes and other environmental disruptions. Writing with appropriate caution, the National Research Council <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/18322/chapter/1">warned </a>in 2013 that climate change could exacerbate stresses throughout the world, with serious dangers to the United States.<br />
 <br />
The NRC noted, for instance, that changes in the flow of the Nile River could destabilize Egypt, an important American ally and an anchor of peace in the Middle East, and intensify tensions over water usage between Egypt and its neighbors. Likewise, unstable Pakistan was described as "one of the most water-stressed countries in the world." Water scarcity there inflamed the antagonism between Pakistan and India, both nuclear-armed powers.<br />
 <br />
Forced migration was another topic for the NRC. It admitted that proof of a direct causal relationship between climate change and mass migration is elusive. Yet the links seem reasonably clear.<br />
 <br />
Even if climate change is not certain, it is irresponsible for American policymakers to put off contingency plans for a hotter planet. Something needs to be done. And for leadership, we look to President Donald Trump.<br />
 <br />
Just as it took Richard Nixon, a staunch Cold Warrior, to open up relations with Communist China, it will take a conservative President to make a compelling case for the environment. When environmental causes are spearheaded by an Al Gore or a Bernie Sanders, they come across as unconcerned with the repercussions for American industry and its workers. Trump is better positioned to build consensus. He can lay out the connections between environmental degradation and war, terrorism, and disruptive migration.<br />
 <br />
We are law professors, not climate scientists. Still, we wonder if it is a mere coincidence, for example, that <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/09/new-un-report-urges-investigation-into-human-rights-violations-in-yemen.php">civil war rages</a> in Yemen while drinkable water disappears. Or that Africans who migrate to Europe often come from places that cannot sustain enough food for all the people there.<br />
 <br />
Trump has been remarkably flexible in how he builds support for his policies. Witness his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/13/us/politics/trump-dinner-schumer-pelosi-daca-obamacare.html">recent deal-making</a> with Chuck and Nancy. His environmental leadership could thus start with a simple Tweet: "We need to consider this climate thing. Important."<br />
 <br />
We are not asking Trump to abandon campaign promises. Our proposal is more supplement than substitute. During our government careers, we advised officials in the military, intelligence agencies, and law enforcement. We hope that some of these officials, current and former, amplify the call for an ecological strategy. Women and men in uniforms can replace the standard images of environmentalists in sandals, tie-dyed shirts, and bandanas. And, as illustrated by the corporate lobbying against President Trump's <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/06/trump-us-to-pull-out-of-the-paris-climate-deal.php">withdrawal</a> from the Paris environmental agreement, many people in suits and ties are ready to devote time and dollars toward environmental issues.<br />
 <br />
So, Trump has an opportunity to co-opt part of the Democratic agenda--or to become bipartisan on another issue. His own Republican Party provides him a model.<br />
 <br />
<a href="https://www.nps.gov/thri/theodorerooseveltbio.htm">Teddy Roosevelt</a> is the man for Trump. The Rough Riding Republican loved hiking and hunting in remote places. This privileged son of a rich New York City aristocrat, a short man with thick glasses, forged himself from city slicker into cowboy badass. He became the man who stormed any hill, the original Westerner. Ahead of his time, Roosevelt was a progressive, a builder of new coalitions, who protected national parks, while busting trusts, building the Panama Canal, and establishing the United States as a world force.<br />
 <br />
We can't think of any former president more suitable to Trump than Teddy. The security of a nation Trump obviously loves, together with the protection of an endangered planet, require nothing less than Teddy's bold style and substance.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/profiles/khan-ali.html">L. Ali Khan</a> of the<a href="http://www.washburnlaw.edu/"> Washburn University School of Law</a> discusses the battle over public education funding in Kansas... </p>

<p><strong>S</strong>ince 2010, Kansas has been litigating the funding of K-12 public education. The Kansas Supreme Court has rendered four decisions repeatedly instructing the state legislature to provide adequate and equitable funding for Kansas public schools. In its <a href="http://media.kansascity.com/livegraphics/2017/pdf/Gannon-ruling.pdf">latest decision</a> of September 2017, the Supreme Court has given another nine months to the state legislature to fix the funding problems for "after that date we will not allow ourselves to be placed in the position of being complicit actors in the continuing deprivation of a constitutionally adequate and equitable education owed to hundreds of thousands of Kansas school children." For the Kansas Supreme Court, the funding of public education is not a political question that commands respect for legislative preferences but a grave constitutional issue. </p>

<p><a href="https://kslib.info/832/Article-6-Education">Article 6</a> of the Kansas Constitution secures a detailed state commitment to the right to education "for intellectual, educational, vocational and scientific improvement by establishing and maintaining public schools." To make this commitment meaningful, Article 6 further provides that "The legislature shall make suitable provision for finance of the educational interests of the state." Historically, Article 6 commitments reinforce the origin of Kansas as a Free State, which rejected slavery and the concomitant denial of education to slave children as has been the practice in pro-slavery states in the nineteenth century. For some, Article 6 violations, which disproportionately affect minority children in poor school districts, trigger the painful memories of disgraceful practices of educational apartheid that gave rise to <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/347/483/case.html">Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Wealth Redistribution Argument </strong></p>

<p>About <a href="http://ipsr.ku.edu/ksdata/ksah/education/6ed1b.pdf">half a million students</a>, from kindergarten to 12th grade including special education and at-risk students, study in Kansas public schools. That is roughly one-sixth of the total population (approximately 3 million) of Kansas. The projected public school enrollment will remain steady as will total population. The Kansas <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/KS">income and poverty statistics</a> furnish a further understanding of the funding of public education. The median household income is a little above $50,000 while per capita income is near $28,000. Twelve percent (12%) of the Kansas population lives in poverty. Statistically, therefore, 12% of the student body in public schools is likely raised in poverty.<br />
 <br />
Kansas public schools are funded from two major sources. First, each school district raises funds through imposing a mill levy upon taxable tangible property in its territory (called local effort). Second, the state provides compensatory funds to poor school districts that cannot raise sufficient funds through property tax. Rich school districts may raise more <a href="http://media.kansascity.com/livegraphics/2017/pdf/Gannon-ruling.pdf">additional money</a> by increasing the property tax but a limit has been placed on this option. "And if a district's local effort funds exceeded its state financial aid entitlement, the excess was remitted to the State."  Despite these corrective measures, the <a href="http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2016/jun/11/wealthy-school-districts-center-kansas-funding-dis/">286 school districts</a> in Kansas receive unequal funding. Poorly funded schools produce poor student performance. </p>

<p>Poor school districts bear two distinct harms. First, they do not get adequate funds. Second, they, as compared to rich districts, do not get equivalent funds for providing reasonably similar educational opportunity. Thus, poor school districts are subjected to inadequacy and inequity, the two wrongs that the Kansas Supreme Court continues to emphasize in its sequential decisions. A <a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/section/multimedia/map-how-per-pupil-spending-compares-across-us.html">2013 map</a> shows that school funding varies widely across Kansas ranging from $25,000 per student (district 292) to $7,000 per student (District 469). This range is not blatantly arbitrary and must be viewed in light of population density, number of students in the district, low property values in small towns, and <a href="https://statisticalatlas.com/state/Kansas/Household-Income">many other factors</a>.</p>

<p>For some, public school funding raises profound ideological and demographic questions, as it plays into the classical "redistribution of wealth" argument. Given the conservative politics of state legislature, public school funding collides with what some lawmakers see as educational socialism under which the kids of poor families are being educated with tax dollars acquired from rich families. This may also mean that urban school districts with high property values are educating the children living in small towns. Fears are hatched that the equitable allocation formula may require <a href="http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2016/jun/11/wealthy-school-districts-center-kansas-funding-dis/">cutting funds</a> to wealthier school districts, thus pitting poor districts against rich districts.</p>

<p>The wealth redistribution argument gathers additional toxicity when placed in the demographics context of Kansas population. Nearly 24% of the <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/KS">Kansas population</a> is non-white. African Americans are about 6% and Hispanics constitute about 12% of the population. It is unclear whether state legislators dragging their feet on equitable school funding believe that the Supreme Court is compelling white families to provide for the education of minority children living in poor districts. </p>

<p>Even though the Kansas Supreme Court does not consider ideological and racial factors in the analysis of adequate and equitable funding, and limits its observations to disparity and student performance at minimally funded school districts, the ideological and demographic factors shape Kansas politics that swings from being conservative to ultra-conservative. Predictably, the political reaction to the Supreme Court decisions is frequently rude and intimidating. </p>

<p><strong>Intimidation of Kansas Judiciary</strong></p>

<p>The Kansas lawmakers have threatened the Kansas judiciary with painful consequences if judges continue to promote education funding reforms. In 2016, after the Kansas Supreme Court instructed the legislature to add $100 million to public schools, some lawmakers impressed upon voters to <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/state/kansas/article80426327.html">remove</a> the Supreme Court Justices through the ballot. Some introduced legislation to impeach justices for usurping the power of the legislative and executive branches. In reaction to the most recent Supreme Court decision, Governor Sam Brownback <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article176606731.html">called</a> the ruling a "regrettable chapter in the never-ending cycle of litigation over Kansas school funding." The Senate President <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article176606731.html">condemned</a> the ruling as "clear disrespect for the legislative process." It appears that the legislature is prepared to subvert the ruling by any means necessary.<br />
 <br />
It is part of Kansas culture, as far as I can tell, to vacillate between normativity and tightfistedness. The Kansas Supreme Court is questioning the funding statutes in the realm of normativity when it demands that the state legislature comply with the constitution in providing adequate and equitable funding for all public schools. The state legislature has every reason to be tightfisted in raising and spending tax dollars. However, no branch of the government is legally or constitutionally empowered to engage in invidious funding discrimination and thus impact the future of children living in poor school districts. </p>

<p>Some politicians further complicate the Supreme Court efforts to remedy the school funding problem. For example, Kris Kobach, running for Governor in 2018, paints Kansas as "the sanctuary state of the Midwest," and <a href="http://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article155373284.html">argues</a> that Kansas should not subsidize the tuition of "illegal immigrants." Kobach also whips up the hysteria of fraudulent voting by non-citizens, causing legality doubts about all Kansans of Mexican heritage. Kobach's bogus views insinuate that the citizens are being taxed to educate the children of illegal immigrants.</p>

<p>Public funding of K-12 schools is an egalitarian undertaking, a value enshrined in the state constitution. Kansas will no longer remain a free state if the politicians, behaving like <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kansas-redefining-the-heart-of-america_us_59bdb293e4b0390a1564de4c">Border Ruffians</a>, challenge the dignity of high courts and deny poor children equal access to substantially similar educational opportunity. The Kansas Supreme Court refuses to endorse constitutional regression. </p>

		<title>Prosecuting President Duterte</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Perfecto Caparas of the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law discusses how Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte could face prosecution under international law...</p>

<p>In the face of <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/lawyer-files-icc-complaint-against-phillipines-president-over-alleged-death-squad.php">charges </a>of ordering and condoning the murder of thousands of civilians by the Philippine National Police, President Rodrigo Duterte boasts that he is immune from suit.  A former prosecutor himself, Duterte touts immunity as an armor.</p>

<p>The<a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/EA9AEFF7-5752-4F84-BE94-0A655EB30E16/0/Rome_Statute_English.pdf"> Rome Statute</a> [PDF] of the International Criminal Court created the first permanent global criminal court to hear and try genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.  The Philippines validly ratified the Rome Statute, pursuant to <a href="http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/constitutions/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines-article-vii/">Section 21, Article VII</a> (Executive Department) of the 1987 <a href="http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/constitutions/1987-constitution/">Philippine Constitution</a>.  The Rome Statute entered into force in the Philippines on November 1, 2011. <br />
 Its <a href="http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2009/ra_9851_2009.html">domestic counterpart</a>, the Philippine Act on Crimes Against International Humanitarian Law, Genocide, and Other Crimes Against Humanity (RA 9851) took effect 15 days after its publication in the Official Gazette on December 11, 2009.</p>

<p>Sitting presidents like Duterte can thenceforth be investigated, prosecuted, tried and punished under RA 9851 for war crimes, genocide, or other crimes against humanity before Philippine courts even during their tenure.  No impeachment needed. No need for them to finish their term.  Those constitute unjustifiable and inexcusable crimes - the gravest forms of human rights violations - and, therefore, absolutely prohibited.  The President retains her or his immunity, true; but not for "core crimes" under Art. 5 of the Rome Statute.</p>

<p>RA 9851 purportedly accords immunity to the President, at least during her or his tenure. Under Sec. 9(a), Chapter V (Some Principles of Criminal Liability), the President is supposedly immune from being hauled into court during his or her tenure.</p>

<p>The Rome Statute lacks any provision comparable to the "other than the established constitutional immunity from suit of the Philippine President during his/her tenure" qualifier found in Sec. 9(a) of RA 9851.  The Rome Statute's silence on immunity from suit of heads of state, for "core crimes" punishable under Art 5, speaks volumes.  This is precisely because no immunity for genocide, crimes against humanity, or war crimes exists.</p>

<p>Rome Statute Art. 27, para. 2 (Irrelevance of official capacity) accords no immunity at all to heads of state because, according to its preamble, such crimes are characterized by "unimaginable atrocities that deeply shock the conscience of humanity".  No immunity for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide exists since "such grave crimes threaten the peace, security and well-being of the world".<br />
 <br />
Shorn of immunity, heads of state can legally be investigated, prosecuted, tried and punished for these crimes in order "to put an end to impunity for the perpetrators of these crimes and thus to contribute to the prevention of such crimes".  Breaking the walls of impunity will surely "guarantee lasting respect for and the enforcement of international justice".</p>

<p>Hence, the Rome Statute provides that immunities "shall not bar the Court from exercising its jurisdiction over such a person."  Instead of according heads of state with immunity, the Rome Statute seeks to destroy impunity.  Non-immunity of heads of state from criminal prosecution deters the commission of mass atrocities.   <br />
 <br />
The Rome Statute's Art. 27 collides with Sec. 9(a) of RA 9851 on presidential immunity from suit for the worst international crimes.  Having been a later act of both the President and the Senate, the Rome Statute ratification expresses the latest, specific intent of the President and the Senate - on behalf of the Philippine state - for the President to be legally bound by the Rome Statute, including its Art. 27 provision on the "[i]rrelevance of official capacity".  This later act of ratifying the Rome Statute effectively nullifies the immunity from suit, under Sec. 9(a) of RA 9851, of the President insofar as those crimes are concerned, assuming <em>arguendo</em> that such immunity was valid in the first place. </p>

<p>Furthermore, the Philippine <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=39416#.Wd0GeMiGNPY">ratification</a> of the Rome Statute indicates the intent on the part of the state to further achieve its purpose in enacting RA 9851 into law.  In light of RA 9851's primary aim and purpose in Sec. 2(e) (Declaration of Principles and State Policies), the proper statutory interpretation then must be that, in ratifying the Rome Statute, the Philippine President and the Senate concurrently intended to reinforce and strengthen RA 9851 by removing any presidential immunity from suit for crimes under RA 9851.  This, in order to achieve both RA 9851's and the Rome Statute's fundamental objective "to put an end to impunity for the perpetrators of these crimes and thus contribute to the prevention of such crimes" (Sec. 2[e], RA 9851).</p>

<p>The Philippines' ratification of the Rome Statute reflects the subsequent and latest will of the state, as expressed through the President's signing of the Rome Statute's instrument of ratification with the subsequent concurrence of the Philippine Senate on August 23, 2011.  The effective ratification of the Rome Statute supersedes and repeals Sec 9(a) of RA 9851.  It shows its intent to fully carry out and fulfill the Philippine state's obligation under the Rome Statute and its RA 9851 domestic counterpart to end impunity. </p>

<p>The incorporation clause of the 1987 Constitution (Sec. 2, Art. II) also renders nugatory the presidential privilege of immunity stated in Sec. 9(a) of RA 9851 for being violative of <em>jus cogens</em> principles or peremptory norms of customary international law.  The Constitution's "generally accepted principles of international law" include customary international law, comprising uniform and consistent state practices performed out of a sense of legal obligation.  The Rome Statute also embodies <em>jus cogens</em> or peremptory norms of customary international law which are non-derogable.  Those cannot be deviated from under any and all circumstances at all times, anywhere in the world.  <em>Jus cogens</em> norms prohibit slavery, genocide, torture, crimes against humanity and war crimes.  </p>

<p>RA 9851's presidential immunity from suit is therefore void <em>ab initio</em>. Heads of state have no immunity for war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity, as established in the <a href="https://www.crimeofaggression.info/documents/6/1946_Nuremberg_Judgement.pdf">Nuremberg judgment</a> [PDF] and the Pinochet decision in <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199899/ldjudgmt/jd990324/pino1.htm">Regina v. Bartle</a>.  Such "exception" is tantamount to according impunity to sitting presidents for these most egregious forms of international crimes.  It's incompatible with jus cogens or peremptory norms of customary international law.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.syr.edu/profile/david-crane1">David M. Crane</a> of the <a href="http://law.syr.edu">Syracuse University College of Law</a> discusses the repercussions of certain UN member states' use of force on a fellow member state...</p><strong>W</strong>ithin the United Nations paradigm, state-parties settle their disputes peacefully and only resort to the use of force as a last measure. Several weeks ago four state-parties skipped the first step and used force against a fellow member state. That aggressive act consisted of embargoes, cyber-attacks, and trade and flight disruption, culminating in a list of demands by those states to lift those sanctions.</p>

<p>In 2017, it is hard to imagine that a member state would use force without a legal sanction by the Security Council or an appropriate regional body. The unilateral decision to do harm to a member state of the United Nations by other member states is an action that should be condemned and corrected. Most remarkably is how little has been done by the international community to correct the situation and restore international peace and security within the region. The silence is deafening.</p>

<p>The use of force by Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE, and Egypt (the Quartet) against Qatar would not have happened but for a new and unstable President in the White House. Past Presidents, regardless of party, would not have allowed this to happen; and one would surmise that this Saudi led attack would not have even been contemplated by this Quartet of member states due to that leverage by the West. This quartet saw a political weakness and an opening and took it almost assured of the reaction by the West. </p>

<p>This action by the Quartet could most likely be the beginning of a series of "events" brought upon by a weakened and confused American foreign policy. The lack of leadership coming out of Washington is starting to weaken that international peace and security upon which the United Nations is grounded.  Though international blackmail cannot be allowed to stand, the lack of discourse between the feuding parties will only exacerbate the situation. The <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/gulf-qatar-soccer/uae-qatar-must-shun-extremism-to-host-2022-world-cup-idINKBN1CF1FJ?feedType=RSS&feedName=sportsNews">recent demand by the UAE</a> for Qatar to withdraw as a host of the 2022 World Cup is an example of the blackmail and the lack of interest in settling a dispute peacefully. </p>

<p>The violations of international law and norms committed by the Quartet against Qatar are almost too numerous to mention. Among the treaties violated are the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/">Universal Declaration of Human rights</a>, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx">the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a>, <a href="http://www.humanrights.se/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Arab-Charter-on-Human-Rights.pdf">the Arab Charter on Human Rights</a>, as well as <a href="http://www.un-documents.net/a25r2625.htm">the Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United States</a>, among several others. These violations could arguably amount to an act of aggression. The battlefield and the weapons used are not conventional, but an embargo and the use of cyber space as a weapon to do harm could be construed as an aggressive act.</p>

<p>Hence the dilemma the international community now faces, technology has shifted the concept of conflict to another dimension, cyberspace. Its use to do harm continues to manifest itself and the lack of regulation of this new battlespace causes muddled or ineffectual response. </p>

<p>It is suggested that we look at this simply. Cyberspace is a platform that can be used for good and for evil.  When used aggressively to do harm the use of cyberspace can be seen as a tool of war, no different than conventional weapons systems. These weapons can only be used when there is a lawful sanction, such as a UN Security Council Resolution, coupled with military necessity as its governing principle. Only then can cyberspace be used as weapon. If either of these two principles are missing, it is an unlawful use of force and can be considered an international crime.  </p>

<p>The dispute in the Gulf cannot be brushed aside as a minor spat between warring clans. It is a possible precursor to future attempts by other member states to coerce an outcome using international blackmail.  Regardless of the lack of a coherent US foreign policy in the Middle East and elsewhere, the international community must step up and force a peaceful dialog to resolve the aggressive acts by Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE, and Egypt. If allowed to continue, the concept of international peace and security is threatened and the reputation of the United Nations harmed.</p>

<p>As stated in the Quran: [2:190] <em>You may fight in the cause of GOD against those who attack you, but do not aggress. GOD does not love the aggressors.</em></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Leigha A. Weiss, a 3L at  <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/law">St. John's School of Law</a>, discusses new technology that could help with pretrial release of the indigent defendant ... </j:header> </p>

<p><strong>J</strong>ohnathon Sacks, a renowned British Rabbi, philosopher and scholar, said: "<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2012/05/17/3505407.htm">technology gives us power, but it does not and cannot tell us how to use that power.</a>" Electronic monitoring and supervisory programs, like <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/26/dominique-strauss-kahn-house-arrest_n_867596.html">house arrest</a>, have been utilized by notable criminal defendants, such as Bernie Madoff, Paris Hilton, Michael Vick, and Dominque Strauss-Kahn, the former International Monetary Fund managing director. However, this list describes only wealthy defendants who, due to their immense wealth, posed a unique flight risk which prevented the use of bail, but were nevertheless able to pay for the privilege of pretrial release through the use of technology. Indigent defendants, who are unable to make bail, are denied these options and find themselves with no alternative but incarceration.</p>

<p>Despite the rise in technological advances, courts in New York State continue to use only the <a href="http://www.nycla.org/siteFiles/Publications/Publications1668_0.pdf">most onerous forms of bail in criminal proceedings</a>, to wit: cash or fully secured bonds. These types of bail place a large financial burden on defendants in order to obtain pretrial release and disproportionately incarcerate indigent and poverty stricken people, who are unable to obtain the funds necessary to make bail. In fact, according to the Vera Institute of Justice, "<a href="http://www.vera.org/sites/default/files/resources/downloads/incarcerations-front-door-report_02.pdf">money, or lack thereof, is now the most important factor in determining whether someone is held in jail pretrial</a>."</p>

<p>Nationwide, approximately <a href="https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/03/putting-fewer-innocents-behind-bars/">62% of detained offenders are pretrial detainees</a> awaiting trial. This is an <a href="https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/03/putting-fewer-innocents-behind-bars/">increase of nearly 40%</a> over the last 30 years, despite crime and arrest rates being lower. In 1985, with crime reportedly much higher than today, about half of people arrested were cited and released compared to 2012 in which <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/02/jails-prison-bail-racial-disparity">95% of people who are arrested and subsequently detained</a>. This <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/essay/pretrial-detention-and-the-right-to-be-monitored">trend favoring arrest disproportionately affects indigent defendants</a> and contributes to increased populations in prisons and jails nationwide. This is demonstrated by the fact that nearly <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/essay/pretrial-detention-and-the-right-to-be-monitored">30% of state court defendants are detained on bonds of less than $5,000</a>. This problem is exacerbated by the privation of bail services and <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/06/bail-bond-prison-industry">the creation of an industry</a> that serves as <a href="http://www.gpsmonitoring.com/pre-trial.html">bail bondsmen</a>. These bail practices impose a tremendous cost on taxpayers, which according to the Attorney General, the estimated <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/essay/pretrial-detention-and-the-right-to-be-monitored">annual cost nationwide of incarcerating pretrial detainees is approximately 9 billion dollars</a>. Why should these costs to taxpayers and the detrimental effects experienced by individuals denied their liberty in the absence of a conviction be continued to be given the cost-saving options of technology, especially when they are offered to wealthy defendants who would be able to afford bail had it been considered a viable condition to release?</p>

<p>Implementing electronic monitoring and other forms of pretrial technology for indigent pretrial detainees would cost taxpayers far less than incarceration, benefits the indigent defendant who is able to obtain release, and reserves pretrial detention for the cases in which it is necessary. Therefore, alternatives to incarceration through supervisory programs for pretrial detainees should be implemented to benefit indigent criminal defendants. While these programs have been used intermittently in the last 30 years, <a href="https://www.appa-net.org/eweb/docs/APPA/pubs/OSET_2.pdf">recent technological advances could greatly impact the lives of indigent detainees</a> and reduce costs for the criminal justice system while properly supervising the defendant to promote public safety. Specifically, <a href="https://www.appa-net.org/eweb/docs/APPA/pubs/OSET_2.pdf">kiosk reporting, electronic monitoring, and global positioning systems (GPS)</a> can be used in various combinations for low-risk defendants to high-level offenders alike to obtain pretrial release.</p>

<p>Kiosk reporting involves <a href="https://www.appa-net.org/eweb/docs/APPA/pubs/OSET_2.pdf">offenders reporting to a machine</a>, similar to an ATM, which uses thumb print scanning for identification followed by a photograph of the defendant and a video recording of the session. The session <a href="https://www.appa-net.org/eweb/docs/APPA/pubs/OSET_2.pdf">requires the offender to answer a series of questions</a> concerning their release and compliance, and then implements instructions to shape the offender's behavior through a negative response, the imposition of more restrictions or requiring action like substance abuse counselling or therapy, or a positive response, the reduction or elimination of restrictions or treatments. These programs are "<a href="https://www.appa-net.org/eweb/docs/APPA/pubs/OSET_2.pdf">best used for offender accountability</a>" as well as "<a href="https://www.appa-net.org/eweb/docs/APPA/pubs/OSET_2.pdf">treatment compliance and adding structure to offenders' lives</a>."</p>

<p><a href="http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/10/13/nyc-bail-reforms/">Supervisory programs</a> range from minimal restrictions, such as automated text-message reminders for court dates, mandatory curfews, and regular check-ins to more restrictive measures, like home confinement and house arrest. <a href="http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3954&context=penn_law_review">Home confinement</a> generally involves mandatory time blocks of remaining in the offenders' home and typically involves the aforementioned minimal restrictions. In contrast, house arrest, which is the most extreme form of supervisory program that is employed and is typically reserved for felony or high risk offender, requires the <a href="http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3954&context=penn_law_review">defendant to be confined to their residence at all times and may only leave based upon certain conditions</a> (such as work or school) or with permission (such as for medical treatment or religious observance). Most often <a href="http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3954&context=penn_law_review">home confinement and house arrest are employed in conjunction</a> with electronic monitoring and GPS that monitors the offenders' location at all time. The monitoring not only <a href="http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3954&context=penn_law_review">ensures</a> the defendant is not a danger to society but also provides the greatest certainty that the defendant will appear at court or for trial.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/01/house-arrest-surveillance-state-prisons/">Electronic monitoring</a> involves a continuous radio signal that is sent to the central computer, which will notify supervisors or the police department if the offender has left his home. The <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/01/house-arrest-surveillance-state-prisons/">defendant wears a device</a>, such as an ankle bracelet, which sends a continuous signal to the base.The equipment <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/01/house-arrest-surveillance-state-prisons/">allows supervisors to track the defendant's location</a>, to confirm compliance with release conditions (such as curfews), and is also equipped with technology to prevent tampering. In addition, <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/01/house-arrest-surveillance-state-prisons/">GPS tracking</a> allows for this continuous signal to be tracked to locate the defendant's physical location at all times. According to criminal justice specialists, electronic monitoring and GPS tracking, either through a cell phone or attached to the defendant's body, "<a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/essay/pretrial-detention-and-the-right-to-be-monitored">accurately deters flight, allows fugitives to be readily located [in real time], and is much less restrictive than a curfew requirement</a>." Thus, these technologies are not only effective of ensuring compliance but also saves the criminal justice system money while preserving the defendant's liberty, who is innocent until proven guilty.</p>

<p>Kalief Browder, a sixteen year old African American from Bronx County, New York, spent three years at Riker's Island Correctional Facility awaiting a trial that would never occur.  As a result of Kalief's abject poverty and youth, Kalief was the victim of a criminal justice system which "<a href="https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/03/putting-fewer-innocents-behind-bars/">uses money to determine who is detained [and] allows those who are dangerous but rich to go free.</a>" During arraignment, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/10/nyregion/after-a-shocking-death-a-renewed-plea-for-bail-reform-in-new-york-state.html?_r=0">judge set Kalief's bail at $3,000 because Kalief did not pose a flight risk</a>. However, even though Kalief's family was required to pay only 10% of the bail amount, they were still <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/10/nyregion/after-a-shocking-death-a-renewed-plea-for-bail-reform-in-new-york-state.html?_r=0">unable to come up with the funds in order to obtain pretrial release</a> for their son. Therefore, Kalief lived at Riker's for three years and became part of the indigent accused, unable to obtain pretrial release due solely to their poverty. In 2013, Kalief was released from Riker's after the charges against him were dropped, but on June 6, 2015, <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/exclusive-kalief-browder-died-days-court-appearance-article-1.2254078">Kalief committed suicide, never recovering from the traumatizing events suffered during his pretrial detention</a>. Kalief Browder's life and other similarly situated indigent criminal defendants, would greatly benefit from these technological advances that would allow them to await trial in their homes, an option that should not be solely reserved for wealthy defendants.    </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist, <a href="https://mckinneylaw.iu.edu/faculty-staff/profile.cfm?Id=541">Mohamed Arafa</a>, of Alexandria University Faculty of Law discusses the accomplishments and contributions of the late Mohamoud Cherif Bassiouni and his deep impact on international criminal law and justice...</p><strong>M</strong>ahmoud Cherif Bassiouni, a distinguished well-known Egyptian-American jurist and law professor was broadly viewed as a godfather of modern international law and criminal justice, passed away on September 25, 2017, at his home in Chicago, Illinois at 79 and the cause was problems of multiple myeloma (cancer). Bassiouni was born in Cairo on December 9, 1937. His father was a diplomat, his grandfather was a president of the Egyptian Parliament. His stepdaughter, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/m-cherif-bassiouni-father-of-international-criminal-law-dies-at-79/2017/09/26/7a5e736c-a2c5-11e7-8cfe-d5b912fabc99_story.html?utm_term=.f495b95b21be">Lisa Capitanini, said that</a> "however his parents were Muslims, they sent him, their unruly and precocious only son, to a Jesuit-run Catholic boarding school in Egypt."</p>

<p>Bassiouni was studying law at the Faculté de Droit of the Université de Dijon in France when he returned to Egypt to fight in the Suez conflict of 1956, but then put under house arrest for disapproving what he called the extreme torture and disappearances under 'Abdel Nasser. In 1962, Bassiouni immigrated to the United States and became a naturalized citizen. He studied law in Egypt, France, Switzerland, and the US, collecting doctorates, comprising honorary ones, and an extensive list of medals and awards. He was a forefather of the International Human Rights Law Institute at DePaul University in Chicago, where he taught for 45 years. He formed a significant perch in Europe when he founded the Siracusa International Institute for Higher Studies in Criminal Sciences in Italy. Veterans of the institute said it was a place where he ran dynamically seminars, mixing folks from diverse cultures and legal traditions and that many who joined his seminars became attorneys and judges at international courts. </p>

<p><u>Bassiouni's Influence and the Status Quo of International Law</u></p>

<p>One way to celebrate and honor Bassiouni is to reflect on his scholarly work and discuss how he helped explicate concepts such as Double Criminality for extradition purposes and articulate principles as aut dedere aut judicare. He was co-chairman of the committee that <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CAT.aspx">drafted the UN Convention Against Torture</a>. He helped draft the laws to prosecute apartheid and he was sent as a UN expert to report on war crimes in Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iraq, and Libya. In 2004, he was appointed by The UN as an independent monitor in Afghanistan, but, after he issued critical reports, Washington stopped the mission. In 1992, the UN Security Council appointed him chairman of a committee to document war crimes during the conflict in Bosnia and Yugoslavia. In the 1990s, he condemned the large-scale sexual abuse and violence of Muslim and Catholic women in Bosnia as war crimes and said that Bosnian Serbs were using rape as a technique of ethnic cleansing. He regularly marking international law as a credible function in the eyes of the international community. His report, a powerfully worded detailed document on torture, rape, prison camps and killings, defined the Serbian-instigated violence as part of a systematic policy of ethnic purgative and shaped the political motion that <a href="http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/law_prof_who_championed_human_rights_dies_at_the_age_of_79">produced the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICITY</a>) in 1993.  </p>

<p>In the field, Bassiouni counted skulls dug up from mass graves, toured prisons crowded with political dissidents and talked to rape victims, whose stories had his head spinning. This report opened the way for a similar tribunal to highlight the genocide crimes, "other inhumane acts" and several violations of international humanitarian law norms in Rwanda. Both tribunals equipped the ground for the enduring International Criminal Court (ICC), at the Hague in the Netherlands <a href="http://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1449&context=cilj">which Bassiouni also helped shape</a> [PDF].  Having <a href="http://www.brill.com/products/reference-work/legislative-history-international-criminal-court-2-vols">worked on a draft statute for such a court</a>, he was named Chairman of the drafting committee of the 1998 Rome Treaty, which created the court.  Professor William Schabas, <a href="http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/22131035-00101012;jsessionid=UelNUGnXSZQsNqlHtLnxQOVJ.x-brill-live-02">Professor at Middlesex University in London said</a>, "He defied senior bureaucrats in the UN by raising funds from private foundations" and "There is quite simply nobody like him in the international human rights law systems." </p>

<p>In 2007, Bassiouni liked to surprise his audiences, when he received The Hague Prize for International Law, gave a talk about "Jihad" and assembled researchers from Muslim and Western countries to debate its various interpretations and Islam. In 2010, <a href="http://www.osaarchivum.org/press-room/announcements/War-Crimes-Expert-Mahmoud-Cherif-Bassiouni-Dies">Bassiouni delivered a harsh speech</a> saying that "the ICC had become overly bureaucratic and that it was "doubtful" it could be successful as long as powerful countries did not want an independent international criminal justice system." </p>

<p>Bassiouni described as a magnetic speaker, tough taskmaster, a sociable host and a demanding perfectionist. He was a compulsive micromanager paid attention to every detail of his work. His scholarship expounded on definitions of the severest international crimes, including war crimes, and genocide and facilitated shape innovative ways to hold perpetrators liable before the law. While running legal institutes and teaching courses widely, he was also an overachiever author whose writings cover several shelves: thirty-five books, close to forty edited volumes and more than two-hundred seventy essays and articles in numerous languages and he never stopped. His expertise in international criminal law brought him global renown and even a Nobel Peace Prize nomination in 1999. He was a recurrent adviser to the U.S. State Department and a go-to source for National Public Radio on international affairs and worked as a legal consultant for President Obama.  <br />
 <br />
<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/women-war-and-peace/features/the-war-crimes-investigator/">He said in the PBS interview</a>, "I'm in my 70s, I'm a Muslim, I come from the Arab World, and I'm from another generation...I'm absolutely shocked and dismayed and amazed by the total lack of sensitivity to the plight of women in war."  </p>

<p>Bassiouni was not known as an attorney who would chase after headlines. When it was suspected that former Libyan dictator Mu'ammar Gaddafi was using systematic rape as a form of torture, he questioned the credibility of the evidence. He questioned why the U.S. did not have the political will to prosecute and accuse former President George Bush for the torture of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In 2004, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/obituaries/ct-cherif-bassiouni-dies-met-20170926-story.html">he accused the U.S. of hiding prisoners</a> from international inspectors.  In 2012, <a href="https://thewire.in/183649/cherif-bassiouni-international-law/">he told Foreign Policy</a>, "I have a sense of orderliness about things. Do the investigation first, see what the evidence is, and then indict. You don't start by indicating without getting the evidence."  His last major international assignment was in the field of international transitional justice as the head of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry tasked to look into deaths and allegations of torture in the aftermath of unrest in the country in 2011. His report confirmed several of the accusations against the Bahraini government and it also denied the government's claims that the protests were backed by Iran.</p>

<p>Bassiouni authored, contributed to dozens of books on the most debatable issues in the West on Islamic criminal justice. With his direct knowledge of the Muslim world, he wrote influential texts on interpretations of jihad and Islamic law, running seminars on those subjects for lawyers and western military personnel as Islamist violence expanded. </p>

<p>I wanted to recite at the end, that when I first met him in 2010, I flew from Cairo and shifted my flight to Chicago instead of Indianapolis and asked him to be my doctoral co-supervisor at Indiana University at Indianapolis, which is the same school he got his JD degree. I arrived at DePaul Law, I was waiting outside his office and I was surprised that he came outside his office welcoming and greeting me in Arabic and apologized for being a bit late and told me "Mohamed, is it by one M or Mss, then smiled said let's have lunch together like a turkey sandwich and little juice" I said, "really!!"? Then he said, "Yes sure boy" and then he said, "What is your Ph.D. talking about?" I said, "International Corruption" then he said, "you will talk about this after Egypt's' uprising," I said yes," then he said, "but you have to watch out." I felt at this moment how Chief treated me as a Dad talking to his son.   </p>

<p>On the day he died, a farewell message went out from his email account that he had dictated days earlier. It included quotations from the Prophet Mohammad, Pope Paul VI, and Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel. He repeated this saying often and it was included in a final message that was sent out to after his passing. It is this hadith by the Prophet Mohammad: "If you see a wrong, you must write it: with your hand if you can, or, with your words, or with your stare, or with your heart and that is the weakest of faith" and then quoted the Qur'an "From God we come and to God we return." Bassiouni often quoted from the Qur'an, the Bible, and the Talmud, he said, "I liked to build bridges and point to the similarities between the faiths instead of the differences." Bassiouni's farewell letter clearly reveals the kind of man he was. He was an aristocrat who 'walked with Kings, but never lost the common touch.' His charm, charisma, sense of humor were enchanting, his soul was generous and his heart sympathetic. He was a supreme orator; an inspiring teacher; a gifted wordsmith; a remarkable storyteller; and a supreme scholar of encyclopedic knowledge. <br />
 <br />
Farewell, MCB! Gone, but never forgotten. May you rest in peace.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.tjsl.edu/directory/marjorie-cohn">Marjorie Cohn</a>, Professor Emerita at <a href="http://www.tjsl.edu/">Thomas Jefferson School of Law</a>, and Jonathan Moore, adjunct faculty at <a href="http://www.law.cuny.edu/index.html">City University of New York School of Law</a>, discuss recent efforts to silence environmental groups through litigation...</p><strong>I</strong>n an audacious attempt to silence Greenpeace's constitutionally protected criticism of what the environmental protection group calls "Resolute Forest Destroyer," the logging company, <a href="http://www.pfresolu.com/en/?langtype=4105">Resolute Forest Products</a>, <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57338226f8baf3b63bbca47c/t/58a221f59f7456a80726ac52/1487020533885/Complaint.pdf">sued Greenpeace</a> under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1962">RICO - the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act</a>. In the suit, filed on May 31, 2016, Resolute sought CAD $100 million in economic damages and an injunction against "wrongful activity and disgorgement."  With punitive damages, liability could total $300 million.  </p>

<p>On October 16, U.S. District Court Judge Jon S. Tigar <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MTD-Decision-GP-RFP-1.pdf">dismissed the complaint</a> against Greenpeace and Stand, another environmental protection organization, without prejudice.</p>

<p>"The court's decision sends a clear message to corporations that attacks on core democratic values like freedom of speech and legitimate advocacy on issues of public interest will not be tolerated," Greenpeace wrote in a <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/press/releases/2017/Federal-Court-Dismisses-Racketeering-Case-Against-Greenpeace/">press release</a>.</p>

<p>Besides federal RICO violations, Resolute had alleged state claims against the two groups and their employees and officers for racketeering, defamation, conspiracy, and tortious interference with prospective and contractual business relations. Originally filed in the Southern District of Georgia, the case was transferred to the Northern District of California.</p>

<p>Resolute alleged that Greenpeace targeted the company with media campaigns aimed at cutting Resolute's profits through false or misleading statements about the company's impact on the environment and on indigenous communities. According to Resolute, Greenpeace spread false information in order to "fraudulently induce donations" to "pay its leaders and continue raising more funds." Resolute alleged that Greenpeace published "whopping lie[s] . . . misrepresenting Resolute's harvesting as a major climate change risk." </p>

<p><strong>Resolute Tries to Bolster RICO Claims With "Greenpeace Enterprise" </strong></p>

<p>In an attempt to bolster its RICO and racketeering claims, Resolute alleged that Greenpeace agreed to coordinate a "disinformation campaign" and carried it out as a racketeering scheme and a "criminal enterprise." But, Judge Tigar concluded, Resolute failed to "identify specific acts of racketeering by specific defendants" in its complaint and instead referred to the Defendants collectively as the "Greenpeace Enterprise."</p>

<p>Judge Tigar also noted that Resolute's RICO claims are subject to a higher pleading standard because they are based in fraud. See <a href="https://openjurist.org/356/f3d/1058/edwards-v-marin-park-inc">Edwards v. Marin Park, Inc.</a>. Under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_9">Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure</a>, plaintiffs alleging fraud claims must "state with particularly the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake," which means they <a href="http://ca.findacase.com/research/wfrmDocViewer.aspx/xq/fac.20160509_0014856.NCA.htm/qx">need to </a>"state the time, place, and specific content of the false representations as well as the identities of the parties to the misrepresentations." </p>

<p>"Resolute fails to meet these heightened pleading requirements," the judge concluded.</p>

<p>Moreover, he wrote, "Resolute has also failed to show proximate cause as to its RICO claims" because it didn't explain how it was victimized by the fundraising scheme and there are many reasons a customer might sever its relationship with Resolute.</p>

<p><strong>Resolute's State Claims</strong></p>

<p>The court had "little difficulty concluding" that the issue of whether Resolute's use of  sustainable forestry practices "is a public controversy generating large scale demonstrations and signed petitions, and that the alleged defamation is related to this public controversy." </p>

<p>Since Resolute is a limited public figure, the court stated, it was r<a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20130417133">equired by law to  allege actual malice</a> as an element of its defamation and related state law claims. Thus, Resolute <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/376/254/case.html">needed to show</a> that the statement was made with knowledge of its falsity or reckless disregard for its truth, and that the statement was materially false. </p>

<p>To demonstrate reckless disregard of the truth, Resolute <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/418/323/case.html">had to show</a> that the speakers subjectively  "entertained serious doubts as to the truth" of their statements. "[G]eneral allegations that a defendant should have known or should have investigated the truth of the statements do not adequately plead actual malice," the court said, quoting <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20141218b07">Wynn v. Chanos</a>.</p>

<p>Judge Tigar concluded that Resolute's complaint failed to "meet its burden of pleading actual malice with the requisite specificity." Greenpeace corrected maps and statements it had made about whether Resolute had breached the Canadian Boreal Forest Agreement. But the judge drew the "plausible inference" that "Greenpeace made a mistake, not that it acted with malice." </p>

<p>Since Resolute did not provide "any specific allegations" to "support a finding that [the Defendants] harbored serious subjective doubts as to the validity of [their] assertions," the court found it appeared "to be a claim that Greenpeace held honestly." </p>

<p>Thus, the judge determined, "Resolute fails to state a claim for actual malice," and dismissed the state defamation claim and related state tort claims.</p>

<p><strong>Lawsuit Implicates Environmental Groups' First Amendment Rights </strong></p>

<p>The court also quoted <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/12/1068/2498997/">Films of Distinction Inc. v. Allegro Film Prods</a>, which held that "[u]nder California law, First Amendment limitations are applicable to all claims, of whatever label, whose gravamen is the alleged injurious falsehood of a statement."</p>

<p>Judge Tigar found that many of Defendants' publications and statements "appear to be shielded by the First Amendment as statements that are not 'provable as false,' or statements that 'cannot reasonably be interpreted as stating actual facts,'" citing <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/497/1/case.html">Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co</a>.</p>

<p>The court also dismissed Resolute's defamation and related tort claims based on those statements on "the separate and independent ground that the Defendants' speech constituted the expression of opinion, or 'different viewpoints that [are] a vital part of our democracy . . . '" <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/1995120356f3d114711042">Partington v. Bugliosi</a>. </p>

<p>"Moreover, many of Greenpeace's publications at issue rely on scientific research or fact," the judge concluded. He added that Resolution's two expert declarations make "more manifest, not less, the degree to which the challenged statements are protected by the First Amendment" since they concern matters of public importance and are subject to professional debate. "The academy, and not the courthouse, is the appropriate place to resolve scientific disagreements of this kind."</p>

<p>The issues at stake in this lawsuit impact environmental organizations' rights to exercise their First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and expression. </p>

<p><strong>Anti-SLAPP Also Protects First Amendment Rights</strong></p>

<p>Defendants moved to strike Resolute's complaint under Georgia's, or, in the alternative, California's Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation (anti-SLAPP) statute. They contended that Resolute's lawsuit was "an effort to muzzle protected speech - here, statements about the company's poor environmental record" and was "brought with the obvious intent to silence" their speech about matters of public importance. </p>

<p>The judge determined that California law applies to the substantive claims under state law and California's anti-SLAPP statute applies to Defendants' motions to strike. But the judge didn't consider Defendants' anti-SLAPP motions to strike the federal claims.</p>

<p>California law allows for pre-trial dismissal of SLAPP's that "'masquerade as ordinary lawsuits' but are intended to deter ordinary people 'from exercising their political or legal rights or to punish them for doing so.'" <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/batzel-v-smith.pdf">Batzel v. Smith</a>.</p>

<p>Judge Tigar cited the <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/north-carolina/ncmdce/1:2011mc00063/58474/16/">Ninth Circuit's two-step evaluation</a> requiring (1) that defendant makes a prima facie showing that plaintiff's lawsuit arises from defendant's exercise of free speech about a public issue; and 2) that plaintiff establishes a reasonable probability of success on the merits. </p>

<p>Regarding the first prong, Defendants must show that Resolute's claims are based on a statement made in a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest, or based on conduct that furthered "the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest." California courts broadly construe "public interest" to include governmental matters as well as private conduct that impacts a broad segment of society.</p>

<p>Judge Tigar found the first prong was satisfied, concluding that Defendants "were involved in protected activity" because "environmental harm is a matter of public interest for the purposes of anti-SLAPP."</p>

<p>As for the second prong, the court determined that Resolute had not met its burden of showing a probability of success on its state claims as a matter of law because it had not alleged facts that could show actual malice.</p>

<p>The judge therefore granted Defendants' motions to strike Plaintiff's state claims without prejudice. Defendants are entitled to mandatory attorneys' fees for each state claim under anti-SLAPP.</p>

<p>Plaintiffs have 21 days from October 16 to file an amended complaint.</p>

<p><strong>Free Speech Rights of Environmentalists Vindicated</strong></p>

<p>Greenpeace USA General Counsel Tom Wetterer said, "[w]e are pleased the court unequivocally threw out this attempt to abuse our legal system and silence legitimate criticism on matters of public concern . . . The logging company's allegations were a clear attempt to silence the voices that advocate for the environment."</p>

<p>Wetterer added, "These cases don't seek justice. They intend to silence free speech through expensive, time-consuming litigation. This pattern of harassment by corporate bullies led by Trump's go-to attorneys must be stopped in its tracks," referring to Kasowitz Benson Torres LLP, Resolute's lawyers. Managing partner <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/07/14/trump-lawyer-marc-kasowitz-to-critic-watch-your-back/?utm_term=.d80a8c8fa154">Marc Kasowitz</a> is Donald Trump's longtime personal attorney.</p>

<p><strong>Other Pending Lawsuits By Corporations Against Environmental Groups</strong></p>

<p>This is Resolute's <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2185831/logging-company-sues-greenpeace">second lawsuit against Greenpeace</a>. In 2013, the company filed a CAD $7 million defamation case against Greenpeace Canada and two staff members. In striking out parts of Resolute's defamation pleadings in that case, a panel of appellate judges with the Ontario Superior Court ruled that Resolute had attempted to "greatly expand the scope of the litigation and transform the trial into an inquiry into Greenpeace." </p>

<p>On August 22, 2017, Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), which built the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAP), <a href="https://www.desmogblog.com/sites/beta.desmogblog.com/files/Energy%20Transfer%20v%20GP%20-%20Complaint%20NDakota%2017cv173.pdf">filed a RICO lawsuit seeking $300 million (trebled to $900 million) against Greenpeace</a>, Banktrack and Earth First! in North Dakota. ETP is also represented by the Kasowitz firm. After he was inaugurated, Trump made it a priority to green-light the DAP. "The goal of this suit is to silence opposition by misrepresenting what happened on the ground in Standing Rock - making outrageous and racist claims that big green organizations like Greenpeace orchestrated the Indigenous-led movement at Standing Rock," Greenpeace said in a <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/global-warming/greenpeace-v-energy-transfer-partners-facts/">statement</a>. "This lawsuit is about silencing opposition in Donald Trump's America. . . . This suit could have far-reaching consequences for journalists, advocacy organizations, and anyone who values free speech. . . . These suits are part of a pattern of legal bullying, as desperate corporations and political hacks try to silence activists, journalists, and anyone speaking out against injustice." </p>

<p>The purpose of these lawsuits is to bankrupt leading environmental organizations which have been a thorn in the side of large logging and oil pipeline corporations. They will be stopped only by vigorous litigation combined with massive public protest.</p>

		<title>Discrimination Via Public Utility Monopoly in LaGrange</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://projectsouth.org/about/staff/#azadeh">Azadeh Shahshahani</a> of Project South discusses a case of discrimination in access to public utilities ... </p><br />
                <strong>I</strong>t&#8217;s hard to believe that in the twenty-first century there are still households that face the risk of going without electricity or running water because of who they are and where they come from. But in Georgia, that&#8217;s still the case. In LaGrange, a town about an hour southwest of Atlanta, the City is the sole utility service provider and will not provide these basic services to any applicant who cannot provide specific identity documents that are unavailable to many immigrants, including those who are undocumented - and many who are lawfully present. </p>

                <p>While the City&#8217;s identity document requirements disproportionately hurt Latinos, the City also limits and denies basic utility services to people with unrelated court debt owed to the City, a policy that predominantly harms African-Americans. To deny utility services to people because they cannot provide certain identity documents, or owe the City debt, is both inhumane and in violation of federal law&#8212;which is why we went to court. </p>

                <p>In May, the Southern Center for Human Rights, the National Immigration Law Center, and the law firm of Relman, Dane and Colfax PLLC filed a <a href="https://www.nilc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Georgia-NAACP-v-LaGrange-complaint-2017-05-18.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] on behalf of the Georgia NAACP, the Troup County Branch of the NAACP, Project South, and several impacted individuals, challenging <a href="https://projectsouth.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.5.17-LaGrange-Press-release-FINAL.pdf">two local policies</a> [PDF] that make it incredibly hard, and even impossible, for many residents to keep the lights on and maintain running water in their homes. We are asking the court to permanently block these discriminatory policies. </p>

                <p>Both local policies<a href="http://law.emory.edu/eilr/content/volume-31/issue-4/article/water-critique-localities-denial-undocumented-immigrants.html"> unlawfully restrict access</a> to utility services that are vital to people&#8217;s ability to live in LaGrange&#8212;including gas, water and electricity&#8212;and the overwhelming majority of residents impacted are Black and Latino. Both of these policies put low-income residents of color in an impossible situation&#8212;either leave their homes and families in LaGrange or live without basic utilities.</p>

                <p>Many of the individuals affected by this first policy are undocumented Latino immigrants who, in order to get water or electricity, must either rent from a landlord who provides the utilities, which seriously limits available housing options, or find a third party willing to open an account for them. The latter practice is criminalized under a current municipal ordinance and could subject the utility user (and the third party) to jail time and fines. Both options make families vulnerable to exploitation. </p>

                <p>The policy applies to renters and homeowners alike. But for the kindness of a friend willing to risk prosecution, for example, a Project South member and his wife, and their two young children, would be unable to obtain water or electricity in their home in LaGrange, which they own.</p>

                <p>Another resident impacted by this policy is an undocumented man who has lived in LaGrange for more than fifteen years.  He lives with his four children in a home that he rents.  He can&#8217;t obtain utilities from LaGrange in his own name because he does not have a social security number and separate U.S. or state-government-issued photo ID.   </p>

                <p>Another man lives in LaGrange with his wife and their two young children in a home that they own. He, too, is unable to obtain utilities from the City of LaGrange in his own name because he lacks a social security number and other U.S.- or state government-issued photo ID. His wife is similarly unable to meet the requirements of the discriminatory LaGrange policy. </p>

                <p>The second policy we&#8217;re challenging adds individuals&#8217; unpaid fines and fees from the LaGrange Municipal Court to their utility bills, and then <a href="https://library.municode.com/ga/lagrange/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=PTIICOOR_TIT20CIUT_CH20-1GEPR">threatens</a> utility service disconnections if the court debt is not paid. LaGrange residents are often threatened with utility disconnection because of unpaid fines for things like traffic offenses, loitering and petty theft.  Some of those convictions are more than ten years old. Most of the individuals affected by this policy are African-American - even though only half of the town&#8217;s residents are African-American, more than 90 percent threatened with utility disconnection because of court debt in recent years are African-American.  </p>

                <p>Many of the individuals affected by these discriminatory policies are on a fixed income, and some rely on electricity for medical treatment. One of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, for example, is an African-American man with disabilities who relies on an oxygen machine to breathe. Yet the City of LaGrange has continually threatened to disconnect his electricity and other utilities, in part, because of court fines stemming from a traffic ticket.</p>

                <p>These policies prey upon LaGrange&#8217;s most vulnerable residents. They are not only inhumane - they are illegal, too. We are confident the courts will agree.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnists Christina Pesavento and Ashley Baker, of the <a href="https://www.committeeforjustice.org/">Committee for Justice</a>: Thanks to a sex trafficking bill, the Internet's days as the bullhorn of democracy may be limited...</p>
<strong>I</strong>n <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/521/844"><span class="casename">Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union</span></a> (1997), Justice John Paul Stevens extolled the virtues of the Internet as a medium for speech. In this "vast democratic forum," he wrote, anyone "with a computer connected to the Internet can 'publish' information ... [A]ny person with a phone line can become a town crier with a voice that resonates farther than it could from any soapbox."</p>

<p>Two decades later, Justice Stevens' words ring even more true. The explosion of Internet access--from <a href="http://www.virginia.edu/virginia/archive/webstats.html">1.3 percent</a> of the world's population in 1997 to <a href="https://thenextweb.com/contributors/2017/04/11/current-global-state-internet/">51 percent</a> in 2017--has expanded this democratic forum to include billions. Thanks to broadband, voices now resonate across six of Earth's seven continents without the use of a phone line.</p>

<p>Since the 1990s, hundreds of innovative Internet intermediary services--website hosts and operators, email and domain name providers, search engines, social media networks, and more--have popped up to provide or facilitate virtual soapboxes for town criers to engage in worldwide discourse.</p>

<p>Yet, thanks to ill-advised efforts by Congress, the Internet's days as the bullhorn of democracy may be numbered. In August, Senators Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) introduced the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/s1693/BILLS-115s1693is.pdf">Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act of 2017</a> (SESTA) (S. 1693), a bill that would amend <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230">Section 230</a> of the <a href=https://www.congress.gov/bill/104th-congress/senate-bill/314">Communications Decency Act</a>. A similar bill was introduced in the House (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1865">H.R. 1835</a>). </p>

<p>Though the intentions are laudable, these legislative efforts to fight sex trafficking would undermine key protections that enable free expression online.</p>

<p><strong>The Internet's First Amendment</strong></p>

<p>In 1996, Congress passed the Communications Decency Act (CDA) in an attempt to regulate speech online. Following a public campaign against the CDA by free speech advocates, a panel of federal judges <a href=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1996/06/13/court-upholds-free-speech-on-internet-blocks-decency-law/02e2ecfd-50c0-4d36-8d11-b78cdc3ad8e3/?utm_term=.6d323d4c8f4d">blocked</a> part of the legislation, writing that "as the most participatory form of mass speech yet developed, the Internet deserves the highest protection from government intrusion."</p>

<p>A year later, in <span class="casename">Reno v. ACLU</span>, the Supreme Court stripped the law of its more constitutionally problematic provisions, leaving Section 230 intact. <a href="https://cdt.org/insight/joint-letter-on-free-speech-concerns-with-s-1693-sesta/">Called</a> "the cornerstone for free speech online," Section 230 protects online speech by granting "interactive computer services"--the intermediary services discussed above--limited immunity from third-party speech liability.</p>

<p>Section 230 does <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/01/the-most-important-law-in-tech-has-a-problem/">not</a> grant intermediaries full immunity. Courts have differed on the breadth of circumstances under which the safe harbor provision applies. Moreover, the provision explicitly does not extend to criminal liability under federal law, including federal sex-trafficking statutes.</p>

<p>SESTA would dramatically narrow the safe harbor by subjecting Internet services to state criminal prosecution as well, and to civil actions targeting user content that violates federal sex-trafficking laws. This narrow exception for sex trafficking is the camel's nose under the tent, and It is difficult to overstate the significance of the Section 230 protections that SESTA threatens to erode. </p>

<p>Without Section 230, intermediary services that host third-party speech would be subject to publisher liability under a patchwork of complex and potentially conflicting state laws. Online platforms could potentially face state criminal prosecution or civil liability for every single comment, image, and video their users post.</p>

<p>With service providers as diverse as Facebook, Google, Pinterest, Wikipedia, and Reddit hosting and transmitting often millions of pages of user-generated content per day, the legal risk becomes astronomical--and the incentive to censor proportionally so.</p>

<p>Absent Section 230, the services that make online speech possible would not only face a slew of defamation suits and other costly litigation; they would also come under enormous pressure to filter, moderate, or otherwise censor their users' speech. Many intermediaries may opt not to host or transmit any user content at all.</p>

<p>At the same time, little would be gained in the efforts to stop sex trafficking. Even sympathetic <a href="https://cdt.org/blog/sesta-would-undermine-free-speech-online/">experts</a> have questioned whether SESTA would be effective and many say it could be counterproductive by driving the activity farther underground, where law enforcement would have a harder time reaching it.</p>

<p><strong>A Catch-22 for Online Intermediaries</strong></p>

<p>Paradoxically, even though SESTA's state-law preemption exception would encourage further policing of user content, its linking of liability to a broad knowledge standard - SESTA speaks of "knowingly" benefiting from sex trafficking - could actually discourage intermediaries from monitoring content for misconduct. </p>

<p>As Matt Schruers, vice president of law and policy at the Computer & Communications Industry Association <a href="http://www.project-disco.org/information-flow/100417-house-hearing-section-230-whats-problem-knowledge-standard/#.Wd7dcmhSzIU">notes</a>, "[m]issed calls happen, and if a missed call about one posting could provide the requisite knowledge for a trafficking charge, many intermediaries might be directed by lawyers to stop policing at all."</p>

<p>Consider that Silicon Valley giants are not the only ones SESTA's provisions would target. <a href="http://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2017/07/senates-stop-enabling-sex-traffickers-act-of-2017-and-section-230s-imminent-evisceration.htm">According</a> to Eric Goldman, director of Santa Clara University's High Tech Law Institute, SESTA's vague language "potentially implicates every online service that deals with user-generated content." SESTA would thus force even smaller entities, like independent bloggers and social media entrepreneurs, to err on the side of caution by screening or censoring their users' content.</p>

<p>Section 230 is the law that made today's Internet possible. Without a robust safe harbor, the vast democratic forum that Justice Stevens praised would cease to exist as we know it. While fighting sex trafficking is certainly a goal worthy of pursuing, damaging that engine and sacrificing our freedom of speech is too high a price to pay.</p>

		<title>The Future of Europe: Is Europe really moving forward to Federalism?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Sedef Asli Topal of The University of Szeged, Hungary discusses the affairs of the European Union ... </p>

                <p><strong>T</strong>he European Union surely cannot be simply identified as an international organization. It holds both particular confederative and federal characteristics within its institutional structure. Generally, it is described as an &#8216;unprecedented supranational organization&#8217; which is neither a complete federation, nor only a confederative entity; but somewhere between these two. Accordingly, to figure out to what extent the &#8216;Federation of European States&#8217; is likely to be established in the future; the line between the federation and confederacy on which the EU is currently standing will be discussed in more detail in this article.</p>

                <p>Firstly, Europe had made remarkable progress on the road to federation with the application of a joint economic and monetary policy in ten years (1992-2002). The enforcement of four freedoms - free movements of labour, capital, goods and people - via the <a href="https://www.unizar.es/euroconstitucion/library/historic%20documents/SEA/Single%20European%20Act.pdf">Single European Act</a> [PDF] (1987) accelerated the process heading the political unity, which created a powerful federating force: the common internal market. The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/economic-and-monetary-union_en">Economic and Monetary Union</a> (EMU) was the first attempt required to turn the 'negative' barrier-removing mentality in domestic markets into a 'positive' one for the achievement of full integration in Europe (Wincott 1996).</p>

                <p>During the Intergovernmental Conference on Economic and Monetary Union in 1988, the European Monetary System (EMS) was revised for the regulation of exchange rate management, stabilization of prices and provisions of Single European Act. Also, the '<a href="http://aei.pitt.edu/1007/1/monetary_delors.pdf">Delors Report</a>' [PDF] published by the Delors Committee - which was chaired by Jacques Delors - set three main stages of the EMU: (1) full membership of the participatory states with their loyalty to common goals, (2) common institutions protecting common interests and monitoring common policies, and (3) establishment of a single currency.</p>

                <p>The Delors Committee decided to apply working principles of the central banking systems of the US and the Federal Republic of Germany as a model. The <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/orga/escb/html/index.en.html">European System of Central Banks</a> (ESCB) and <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/orga/escb/html/index.en.html">European Central Bank</a> were created in 1998 as the Euro was accepted as a common currency in the same year and launched on the 1st of January 2002. In relation, Patrono states (2004, 337) that &#8220;briefly, what distinguishes European integration from its counterparts is the fact that the ever greater degree of economic integration, which has now reached a peak that will not easily be equaled, had made use of the combined and contemporaneous action of structures and legal tools already provided for in the founding Treaty.&#8221;</p>

                <p>The establishment of the European Economic Community (EEC) by the Treaty of Rome (1957) was an exciting improvement for functionalists who thought that integration in particular areas such as economy and finance would bring more integration in different areas (spill over effect). They assumed that the completion of economic integration would result in political integration, and finally EU would turn into a 'pure' federation. However, the EU still seems to continue to be far away from representing a political unity rather than a monetary union. It couldn&#8217;t go much beyond an economic integration to coordinate a mutually advantageous liberal market policy within the continent. In a federation, the central government follows a common trade and fiscal policy binding all participatory states in respect of their domestic regulations and activities. Although it is restricted by the national constitution to a large extent at the regional level, it is authorized to set common standards and rules - regarding taxation, pensions and social security- all sub-units are bound to. Similarly to the system in federations, the EU has a joint economic and monetary policy at the supranational level, but in contrast to the federation, it is nearly absent in fiscal policies concerning the distribution of social justice.</p>

                <p>According to Moravcsik (2001,165), &#8220;the union is completely excluded from the major function of developed industrial democracies, namely 'the provision of social welfare.' National welfare systems provide direct income support, unemployment insurance, various forms of medical care, retirement and pension benefits, assistance for children hardly any of which is directly regulated by the EU. In the related area of labour regulation, the EU has provided weak labour standards.&#8221; This exacerbates the lack of trust between the EU institutions and European people - low turnouts in Parliamentary elections (%43 in 2014) have already revealed this fact - and considerably weaken the union&#8217;s legitimacy.</p>

                <p>Secondly, EU lacks significant defense, military and police powers and underlying policies as a most fundamental activity of a modern state. &#8220;Even if the ambitious plan currently on the table for European defense coordination were realized, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) would remain the preeminent international institution in European Defense.&#8221; (Patrono 2004, 334) Although there is strict coordination between the internal and external national security forces of the member states to prevent cross-border crime such as human trafficking and illegal migration, EU does not have its own armed force and central decision-making body, unlike a federation. When the guideline for CFSP is set by the European Council as the highest political authority of the union; the Council of European Union follows the guideline for implementation of the policy, and the High Representative of The Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Issues - who is appointed by the European Council - advocates the union in the international political arena. It shows that, the weight of national governments in settlement of CFSP is dramatically high. The European Parliament - which is the voice of EU citizens, and the European Commission - which is the only politically disinterested organ and executive branch of the union - have nearly no role in CFSP, which indicates that EU is not fully competent in policy making on external affairs and security issues as a &#8216;supranational&#8217; political entity with its independent and democratically elected institutions.</p>

                <p>In contrast, a federation has its own military forces directly authorized by a central government which is executed by a &#8216;unique&#8217; authority in the top of hegemonic hierarchy rather than a group of governmental branches which are executed by different presidents, and which are horizontally ordered in terms of political power. This brings us to the third major point: the absence of a central government represented by a &#8216;single&#8217; person. For this reason, it would not be wrong to claim that in terms of the distribution of powers, the EU is considered to be more similar to confederacy governed by an assembly which is composed of Heads of participant states&#8217; instead of federation and undoubtedly, this obviously results from the unwillingness of its member states to transfer their sovereignty to a supranational decision-making body due to their protectionist attitudes when it comes to their national interests. The Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER) deployed in the Council of European Union is one of the most significant state intentions in this attitudinal tendency.  </p>

                <p>Finally, EU law is always superior to the domestic law if a legal contradiction occurs between the union&#8217;s legislation and national constitutions. Similar to federal constitutional systems, EU member states have to comply with the obligations of a common legislation in which the EU is exclusively competent when they are free to legislate in policy areas EU is partially competent or non-competent. In addition, EU has specific punishment mechanisms for the member states that do not obey the EU legislation. Whereas European Commission acts as the guardian of the treaties with its jurisdiction to start infringement procedure against the member state which violated the EU law, Court of Justice of European Union (CJEU) may sentence relevant state if the breach is not remedied in a given time. Its decisions are binding as primary source of law and cannot be reversed unless the opposite is stated by itself.</p>

                <p>Nevertheless, the EU law has been formed by the &#8216;treaties&#8217; rather than an exclusive common constitution in contrast to federations. New laws are made via &#8216;ordinary legislative procedure&#8217; started by the European Commission and concluded with collaboration of European Parliament and The Council of European Union. However, this collaboration is not easily achieved. Their individual decrees on adoption of new acts are determined through majority voting, qualified majority voting or unanimity according to the importance of issue in European Parliament and The Council. It requires a strict compromise among most of the member states or all member states, or sometimes even the majority of EU population regardless the necessary number of member states is reached to adopt a decision. Instead, constitutional identity of a federation is self-directed, in other words, completely independent from its sub-units.</p>

                <p>Consequently, with its present form, the EU seems to have fulfilled vital requirements from the point of economic integration, constitutional sovereignty and institutional structure so as to turn into a political unity as well as it cannot go beyond a confederacy or an international organization in terms of specific conditions under same policy areas. In my opinion, in one way or another, as long as it cannot achieve its constitutional self-governance, EU is unlikely to cope with the obstacles to full economic integration and its institutional structure such as the lack of common regulation on taxation, pensions and distribution of wealth and lack of a central government based on a single authority and vertical distribution of powers.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://commonlaw.uottawa.ca/en/people/manirakiza-pacifique">Pacifique Manirakiza</a> of the <a href="http://www.uottawa.ca/en">University of Ottawa</a> discusses  the effectiveness of Burundi's withdrawal from ICC...</p><strong>O</strong>n October 27th, 2017 Burundi became the first State Party to withdraw from the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/archives/emu_history/documents/treaties/rometreaty2.pdf">Rome Treaty</a> creating the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC), in accordance with the provisions of <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/ADD16852-AEE9-4757-ABE7-9CDC7CF02886/283503/RomeStatutEng1.pdf">Article 127</a>. It is worth recalling that prior to Burundi's withdrawal notice, the Office of the Prosecutor launched a preliminary examination into the situation in Burundi. Since this was a <em>motu proprio</em> move by the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP), the latter cannot go further without an authorization from the Court. On the date of withdrawal, the Prosecutor has not formally seized the Pre-Trial Chamber (PTC) of an authorization request to open criminal investigations on the alleged third term related crimes. Burundian victims and other actors were hoping the Prosecutor would have opened a formal criminal investigation by the deadline. The expectations became even higher when the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Burundi, in its final report, requested the OTP to speed up the examination and request an authorization to investigate those alleged crimes. However, for those familiar with international proceedings, the OTP's inaction was not a surprise. Technically, the OTP had to act in twenty months and this timeline obviously proved inadequate to build a strong case and meet the required threshold. The examination of the situation was still at the phase 2 (subject-matter jurisdiction) at the time the withdrawal became effective. </p>

<p>Now that Burundi opted out, the fate of the preliminary examination is not clear. A legal discussion on whether or not ICC retains its jurisdiction on Burundi despite the withdrawal is well warranted, at least for the alleged crimes committed before October 27th. Each one's position on the issue depends on the reading and interpretation of paragraph 2 of Article 127 of the ICC Statute, which stipulates: <blockquote>A State shall not be discharged, by reason of its withdrawal, from the obligations arising from this Statute while it was a Party to the Statute, including any financial obligations which may have accrued. Its withdrawal shall not affect any cooperation with the Court in connection with criminal investigations and proceedings in relation to which the withdrawing State had a duty to cooperate and which were commenced prior to the date on which the withdrawal became effective, nor shall it prejudice in any way the continued consideration of any matter which was already under consideration by the Court prior to the date on which the withdrawal became effective. </blockquote>Basing himself on the literal reading of this provision, Mr. Fadi El Abdallah, the ICC spokesman, in an interview relayed by the mainstream media such as AFP, Reuters, Al Jazeera, etc., stated that Burundi's withdrawal does not affect the jurisdiction of the court with respect to crimes alleged to have been committed during the time it was a state party, namely up until October 27, 2017. The voice of the spokesperson usually represents the position of the Court or, at least that of the OTP. However, in this particular instance, one can legitimately ask the following question: to what extent can we rely on the spokesperson's view as a statement of applicable law on such an important issue, absent a declaration from the OTP clarifying the way forward or an existing caselaw on the scope the said provision?</p>

<p>Mainstream international and Burundian civil society organizations are also of the same view that the withdrawal does not bar the ICC to exercize its jurisdiction as the situation is already under examination. For instance, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/10/burundi-cynical-icc-withdrawal-will-not-derail-wheels-of-justice/">Amnesty International stated</a> that "The ICC can continue its preliminary investigations regardless of Burundi's efforts to stop its work by withdrawing from the Court. Even if President Pierre Nkurunziza's government will not cooperate with the Court, the ICC has ways and means to investigate and prosecute the crimes committed." For the Fédération internationale des droits de l'homme (FIDH), the withdrawal "does not mean that Burundian perpetrators now have entered a safe space: the <a href="https://www.fidh.org/en/region/Africa/burundi/burundi-withdraws-from-the-icc-an-attempt-to-shield-perpetrators-from">ICC can still open an investigation into crimes</a> committed in Burundi before October 27, 2017." For The Burundian Coalition for the International Criminal Court, since the preliminary examination began before the expiration of the withdrawal date, the Prosecutor can still open an investigation into the alleged crimes.</p>

<p>Apart from civil society organizations, where there is a consensus on the generous and liberal interpretation of Art. 127(2), the same consensus is not obvious among scholars. Some like <a href="https://www.icjafrica.com/single-post/2017/10/27/Burundis-withdrawal-from-the-ICC">Beitel van der Merwe think </a>that ICC will retain jurisdiction on Burundi after its formal withdrawal. For him, "at first glance then, it seems that the withdrawal will not affect the preliminary examination already underway." <a href=": https://www.justsecurity.org/33501/burundi-leaves-icc-international-criminal-court-investigate-crimes-there/">Other authors posit</a> that the OTP's failure to open a formal criminal investigation, or <a href="http://opiniojuris.org/2017/10/29/does-the-icc-still-have-jurisdiction-over-crimes-in-burundi/">at least to request an authorization </a>thereof before the October 27 deadline deprives the ICC of its jurisdiction.</p>

<p>In fact, the lack of consensus on this issue is intrinsically linked to the different views people hold on the question whether preliminary examinations are part or not of the court proceedings referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 127. Those who argue for the continuation of the ICC jurisdiction, except Whiting, favor the position that preliminary investigations are "matters" which are already under consideration by the Court, provided that the Prosecutor is also part of the Court. To the contrary, other authors are of a different opinion. After sampling and highlighting different provisions of the ICC Statute, which are formulated in a similar way as Art. 127(2), Kevin J.Heller concludes that the "Court" refers to the judiciary. Therefore, the OTP is not part of the Court for the purpose of Art. 127(2). He finally and convincingly argues that a situation is not under consideration of the Court by the virtue of OTP preliminarily examining it.  </p>

<p>I tend to agree with Heller. First of all, it is obvious that preliminary examinations are not part of either criminal investigations or proceedings referred to in Art. 127(2). According to me, criminal investigations refer to investigations duly authorized by the Pre-Trial Chamber of the ICC (in a <em>motu proprio</em> situation) after the Prosecutor has demonstrated that the information and evidence at her disposal support reasonable grounds to believe that ICC crimes have been committed in a particular situation. Regarding the proceedings, the notion refers to proceedings already pending or under consideration before the Court. </p>

<p>In my view, preliminary examinations are pre-investigations carried out in order to ascertain whether a particular situation warrants further OTP's action or not. At that particular stage, the State has no case to answer and in fact no legal obligation whatsoever towards the OTP. From a comparative criminal law perspective, the State is in a similar situation to a person of interest (PI) in domestic criminal investigations where the Police, which is the entry point for criminal proceedings, gets and analyzes information on a possible crime and the potential involvement of a particular person. The police will not bother or otherwise interfere with the person of interest's life until they get precise and sufficient evidence to support an indictment. Until then, there is no criminal case. In the case of preliminary examinations, it is the same. In its <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/OTP-Policy_Paper_Preliminary_Examinations_2013-ENG.pdf">Policy Paper on Preliminary Examinations</a>, the OTP's position is that at the preliminary examination stage there is not yet a 'case,' as understood to comprise an identified set of incidents, suspects and conduct. No wonder that under Ocampo tenure, preliminary examinations were treated as confidential information with little or no information released to the public during the process. This was not illegal practice at all. The difference with current practice under Bensouda is simply that now preliminary examinations are dealt with in a transparent manner. The launch is usually made public and the public gets updated information at each of the four stages of the preliminary examination. </p>

<p>In conclusion, a State Party's withdrawal while under a simple preliminary examination deprives the ICC of its jurisdiction. In the particular case of Burundi, an OTP decision to continue examinations followed by the request to conduct investigations would lack a firm legal basis under the existing regime. The situation would have been different if the PTC was at least seized of a prosecution's motion requesting the authorization to open formal criminal investigations on the alleged third term related crimes. Whether the authorization was granted or still pending before the PTC, it can be said that the matter was under consideration before the Court, in accordance with the provisions of Art. 127(2). Therefore, it would be difficult to support the claim that ICC retains post-withdrawal jurisdiction on Burundi. The ICC Spokesperson's statement was probably a strategic move to smoothly assuage the apparent deception of victims and other actors involved in this situation. In any case, if the Prosecutor is of the same view and decides to request a post-withdrawal formal investigation in the Burundian situation, it will be interesting to see how the PTC will interpret relevant provisions, in particular those of paragraph 2 of Article 127, especially when even the travaux préparatoires are not helping in order to understand the minds of the framers of the Rome Statute.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.syr.edu/profile/david-crane1">David M. Crane</a> of the <a href="http://law.syr.edu">Syracuse University College of Law</a> discusses recent harmful developments regarding the restriction of chemical weapons in international law...</p><strong>T</strong>he United Nations Security Council (<a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UNSC</a>) should not ignore or walk away from the alleged use of any prohibited weapon, such as chemicals, as it signals it is permissible to violate the Chemical Weapons Convention (<a href="https://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention/">CWC</a>) and erodes international norms related to such weapons. Further, it signals that countries with deep ties to P5 (U.K., U.S., France, Russia, China) are outside the scope of UNSC authority, therefore creating a bigger issue of eroding the international authority of the UNSC and jeopardizing the foundation of international law. </p>

<p>On Tuesday, October 24, 2017, Russia vetoed the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/2017/884">resolution</a> extending the mandate of the investigators probing chemical weapons attacks in Syria. [<a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/10/russia-vetoes-un-security-council-investigation-into-syria-chemical-weapons-attacks.php">JURIST report</a>] [<a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/PV.8073">Meeting Record</a>] Following the chemical attack in 2015, Russia and America created the Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM) to investigate the presence/use of chemical weapons in Syria, which found 27 active production facilities. In its most recent <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/2017/904">report</a> late last month, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said it had verified the destruction of 25 of the 27 chemical weapons production facilities declared by Syria and continued to prepare an inspection to confirm the current condition of the last two. The vote on the resolution was in advance of the JIM investigative report (presented Thursday October 26). The report sought to identify the party responsible for a deadly April 4 attack in the rebel-controlled town of Khan Sheikhoun in southern Idlib that killed and sickened scores of civilians allegedly using sarin gas. Shortly after that attack, the United States launched an airstrike on a Syrian air base and accused the al-Assad regime of carrying out the gas attack.</p>

<p>This action by Russia is primarily concerned with the sovereignty of Syria and stresses the maxim that you cannot enter a sovereign territory without concrete evidence of wrong doing. Further Russia believes they face possible retaliation by Syria and/or rebel groups present in Syria. Finally, Russia is concerned that there has been a blurring of lines between the conflict against Syria and the conflict against ISIS.  Additionally Russia is supporting the regime and has economic ties to Syria. They do not want the US to gain any influence in Syria. </p>

<p>The media and various member states are concerned that the UNSC is impotent in assisting in Syria due to the P5 structure. The UNSC and the UN system are shouldering the blame for little progress in Syria. The broader discussion criticizes the entire UN system as being outdated and ineffective. </p>

<p>The UN is not impotent, as it has facilitated international cooperation on the conflict, resulting in ceasefires, the initial formation of JIM, condemnation of acts, and investigation of potential war crimes. Further, the UN is serving its purpose as a neutral forum for these discussions. Syria has not simply become a battlefield upon which America and Russia are fighting, nor are we seeing a return to interstate war. Therefore, the UN is working as a forum for these issues. Further negotiations need to be based on interests and relationships as nationalistic and realist strategies fail within the cooperative international organizational model. </p>

<p>The UN must continue to negotiate towards extending the investigation in Syria, and the UNSC should never turn away from condemning, investigating, and helping to eliminate the proliferation of chemical weapons. Ceasing any further condemnation or investigation signals to the world that the use of chemical weapons brings no accountability. If there are no ramifications for the use of chemical weapons, the CWC could become irrelevant. All State Parties to the CWC have agreed to disarm by destroying any stockpiles of chemical weapons they may hold, any facilities which produce chemical weapons, and any chemical weapons they abandoned on the territory of other States Parties in the past. </p>

<p>The Convention aims to eliminate an entire category of weapons of mass destruction by prohibiting the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention, transfer or use of chemical weapons by States Parties. States Parties, in turn, must take the steps necessary to enforce that prohibition in respect of persons (natural or legal) within their jurisdiction. </p>

<p>A unique feature of the CWC is its incorporation of the 'challenge inspection,' whereby any State Party in doubt about another State Party's compliance can request the Director-General to send an inspection team. Under the CWC's 'challenge inspection' procedure, States Parties have committed themselves to the principle of 'anytime, anywhere' inspections with no right of refusal.</p>

<p>To lose this feature would create an incredibly dangerous world without any oversight into weapons production and use. Losing the global norm that chemical weapons are taboo could reintroduce them to warfare. Also, allowing chemical weapons leaves open the race to innovate biological weapons as well. Do we want to go in this direction in the 21st Century?</p>

<p>An inadequate international response to the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime will only increase the risk that the world's most dangerous, indiscriminate, and inhumane weapons will be used to commit atrocities in the future, erode the integrity of the CWC, and undermine the authority of the Security Council. International peace and security would be undermined.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.seanclearypa.com">Sean M. Cleary</a> of the Law Offices of Sean M. Cleary discusses the difficulty in establishing liability for driverless cars. . . </p><br />
                <strong>D</strong>riverless cars are one of the most controversial topics that never ceases to raise doubts and concerns. While many of us hope that this is the answer to a less stressful and more responsible driving experience, others fear that the risks brought by these vehicles exceed their advantages.The biggest concern regarding driverless cars is the accident risk that they pose. Are these mechanisms really capable of adapting to any traffic conditions in real time? If not, who will take responsibility for the accidents that might occur? Should we put the blame on the manufacturer, the software developer or the driver who purchased the car and helplessly witnessed an accident or was too distracted to intervene in due time and avoid it? </p>

                <p>These answers are hard to come by, even for us lawyers, because this emerging industry isn&#8217;t yet regulated by strict federal laws. </p>

                <p><strong>What Degree of Autonomy Do These Vehicles Currently Have?<br />
                </strong>Autonomous Vehicles (AV) are not yet completely independent, but we&#8217;re expecting to have fully autonomous cars anytime soon. At the moment, these vehicles still require the involvement of a human driver up to a certain extent. Driverless cars are currently designed to minimize, but not to exclude the driver&#8217;s responsibility, presenting certain autonomous features like self-parking, cruise control or anti-lock brakes. Yet, there are few vehicles that can operate independently without a driver&#8217;s intervention. Currently, in the US, we are not allowed to commercialize fully autonomous cars. Car manufacturers have to be compliant with approximately 70 safety standards from the <a href="https://icsw.nhtsa.gov/cars/rules/import/FMVSS/">Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards</a> that regulate vehicle construction, which imply the presence of a licensed driver. </p>

                <p>However, technology develops at a fast pace and the laws on self-driving cars are expected to adapt to an imminent reality where cars will operate in complete autonomy. Large manufacturers such as <a href="https://www.tesla.com/autopilot">Tesla</a>, <a href="https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/mercedes-benz/innovation/research-vehicle-f-015-luxury-in-motion/">Mercedes</a>, <a href="https://www.volvocars.com/intl/about/our-innovation-brands/intellisafe/autonomous-driving">Volvo</a> are currently making efforts to develop fully autonomous self-driving vehicles. https://waymo.com is also one of the leading developers in this field and their plan is to build autonomous cars which won&#8217;t even be equipped with steering well or brake pedals. </p>

                <p><strong>Who&#8217;s Guiltier in Case of an Accident?<br />
                </strong>One of the main benefits of driverless-cars should be the ability to actually reduce the number of accidents. Drunk driving and speed are two of the leading causes of car accidents and, ideally, these habits could be avoided with full automation. Nonetheless, it&#8217;s still too early to envisage a future of driverless cars when we are merely in the testing phase. States like <a href="http://governor.wa.gov/sites/default/files/exe_order/17-02AutonomouVehicles.pdf?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery">Washington</a> [PDF, executive order], Connecticut, and <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB2205/id/1620770">Texas</a> allow self-driving car manufacturers to perform tests in traffic. But this is another argument that gives rise to concerns among local authorities and citizens alike. There have been notable cases when self-driving cars crashed; two of the most striking examples involve cars designed by Google and Tesla. The first manufacturer admitted to being partially responsible for the incident and implemented over 3000 new tests to improve the vehicle&#8217;s algorithm. In the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/business/self-driving-cars.html">second case</a>, Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot function was deployed during a car accident that marked the first driverless car fatality. After the investigations, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2016/INCLA-PE16007-7876.PDF">concluded</a> [PDF] that the car&#8217;s self-driving system was not at fault because it was not designed to avoid the specific circumstances that lead to the crash. </p>

                <p>So, who is really responsible for this type of accidents? The debates between lawmakers, manufacturers and insurance companies that try to figure out how the fault should be divided are still open.  </p>

                <p><strong>What Does the Law Currently Say?<br />
                </strong>So far, driving regulations are essentially centered on human drivers. The person who&#8217;s driving the automobile is responsible for his or her own safety and the actions that they take in traffic. Drivers are required to be in the right physical and mental state that allows them to control the vehicle appropriately. Therefore, the driver is not allowed to delegate his or her entire responsibility to their vehicle. They must be able to take control of the vehicle at any moment. Yet, after an accident, the liability issue is sometimes hard to tackle because there are several factors that might have caused the damage, including the driver&#8217;s negligence, a vehicle manufacturing defect or a bug in the operating system that controls the car. These three potential causes all point out to different authors who might bear some or full responsibility for the accident. Different legal standards should apply to accidents involving driverless cars. The key determiner should be the responsible party that controlled the car when the accident occurred. </p>

                <p>However, there&#8217;s still room for debate because we are <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0018720816634226">soon expecting</a> highly automated vehicles (HAVs) on our roads.  These vehicles aim to take almost full responsibility for what they do in traffic as they will limit the driver&#8217;s role to occasional involvement. In this case, the driver will basically be the automated system which should leave little or no liability for the human behind the steering wheel. </p>

                <p><strong>New Regulations on Driverless Cars <br />
                </strong>The Federal Government is making efforts to develop and implement a set of laws regarding driverless cars that can apply across the country. Up to now, these vehicles have had to adapt to the specific rules of each state&#8217;s roads. The objective is to have a strict set of laws that can enhance safety in traffic and regulate liability. One of the major steps in this direction was taken last year, in September, when the government issued its <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/13069a-ads2.0_090617_v9a_tag.pdf">first set of standard rules</a> [PDF] regarding the production and sale of driverless cars. These regulations required manufacturers to provide detailed information to the federal authorities. Moreover, the manufacturers, as well as the software providers who design the vehicles&#8217; control system, would be required to pass a safety assessment comprising 15 points.  The purpose is to establish whether the vehicles are safe enough to be allowed in traffic. </p>

                <p>The latest news in the field of self-driving cars regulations was released last month when the House of Representatives agreed to allow 100,000 autonomous and semi-autonomous test vehicles on the roadways. This step was enabled through a bill called the <a href="http://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF17/20170719/106309/BILLS-115pih-HighlyAutomatedVehicleTesti-U2.pdf">Highly Automated Vehicle Testing and Deployment Act of 2017</a> [PDF] which not only raised the number of driverless cars but also exempts manufacturers from traditional safety standards while deploying the cars for testing purposes. More driverless cars on our public roads pose higher accident risks even if they&#8217;re here for mere testing purposes. Increasing the number of testing vehicles to 100 000 is not the biggest concern; the typology of the cars that are now allowed in traffic is more disconcerting. We can expect to see completely autonomous cars which are devoid of steering wheels anytime soon on our roads.</p>

                <p>With more driverless cars in the traffic and no strict rules to establish the boundaries of liability, we can&#8217;t stop doubting whether it&#8217;s safe or not to drive among these vehicles. Yet, we can&#8217;t develop a legislative framework for autonomous cars before we know what exactly we are dealing with and this requires time, patience and, indeed, trials. Bottom line is that we are still in the early days of adapting our legislation to this dazzling new technology that might change driving as we know it. Where the liability lies in case of an accident is a matter that requires strict analysis and interpretation according to each state&#8217;s law. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Ricardo Arredondo of the University of Buenos Aires School of Law discusses the aftermath of recent violence against Argentine diplomatic facilities in Chile...</p>

<p>On the night of October 23, both the residence of the Argentine Embassy and the Consulate General in Santiago de Chile were exposed to a <a href="http://www.lagaceta.com.ar/nota/749304/politica/como-fue-ataque-embajada-argentina-chile-durante-marcha-maldonado.html">violent situation</a> [Spanish], when a group of people protesting in the streets, whose number ranged between 50 and 150 according to different sources, attacked the premises of the diplomatic and consular missions of Argentina.<br />
 <br />
People were demonstrating after <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-41710389">the death </a>of Santiago Maldonado outside these missions. At a certain point, they took a bus, set it on fire and blocked the <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenida_Vicu%C3%B1a_Mackenna">Vicuña Mackenna Ave.</a> [Spanish] where the missions are. Then, part of this large group of people destroyed objects on the public road, destroyed the entrance gate of the residence and caused important damages to the premises on the ground floors of both the residence and the consulate, including to a vehicle that was parked there. <a href="http://www.t13.cl/noticia/nacional/encapuchados-danan-embajada-argentina-chile-protesta-caso-maldonado">There were no</a> [Spanish] personal injuries.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_1_1961.pdf">Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations</a> (CVDR) [PDF] establishes that the receiving State, in this case Chile, "is under a special duty to take all appropriate steps to protect the premises of the mission against any intrusion or damage and to prevent any disturbance of the peace of the mission or impairment of its dignity" (Art. 22.2). A similar provision is contained in the <a href="http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_2_1963.pdf">Vienna Convention on Consular Relations</a> (VCCR) [PDF] (Art. 31.3).</p>

<p>The protection granted is not absolute, since the VCDR requires the adoption of "all appropriate steps", which should be interpreted as the adoption of all measures proportional to the risk to the security of the occasion. This obligation may be reflected in the adoption of special internal laws or may be left to the police action, depending on the circumstances of the case.</p>

<p>Generally, the protection is carried out by the security forces of the receiving State through certain monitoring of the premises of the mission. When it is presumed that hostile demonstrations may occur because of the state of public opinion or the existence of some tension, the receiving State should strengthen police protection. If it does not do so and the mission is damaged, the receiving State may be liable.</p>

<p>The receiving State does not compromise its international responsibility by tolerating certain types of manifestations. But where a receiving State has failed in its duty to protect against intrusion or damage to the premises of the diplomatic and consular missions, it is clearly liable to pay reparations to the sending State, in this case Argentina, for the damages suffered, as Argentina did when a demonstration protesting the Armenian genocide caused damage to the premises of the residence of the Turkish ambassador in Buenos Aires in 2002.</p>

<p>The demonstration was disbanded and two people were arrested by the Carabineros (Chilean police), which is conducting an investigation into the events. Chilean Foreign Minister Heraldo Muñoz <a href="http://www.minrel.gob.cl/canciller-munoz-tras-ataque-a-residencia-argentina-quisiera-expresar/minrel/2017-10-24/150942.html">condemned</a> [Spanish] the incident, calling it unacceptable to his Government, recalled that the diplomatic and consular missions are inviolable and apologized. He stated that additional measures will be taken to ensure security and to prevent the repetition of these events.</p>

<p>However, he left the door open for Chile to be exempt from international responsibility by saying that the event was "<a href="http://www.lanacion.com.ar/2075728-santiago-maldonado-protesta-chile-embajada-argentina-mapuche">something massive</a>" [Spanish], implying a circumstance that went out of control of the Chilean Government precluding wrongfulness in this situation. The Argentine Government, through its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, <a href="http://cancilleria.gov.ar/hechos-de-violencia-en-sede-diplomatica-argentina-en-santiago-de-chile">transmitted</a> [Spanish] its deep concern for this violent attack.</p>

<p>It is still premature to reach any conclusion. It will be necessary to wait for the report of the Carabineros and the position of Chile to this event, which both countries have affirmed will not affect the good relations and the cooperation between them.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In one of my favorite scenes from <em>The Wire</em>, the great HBO television series about crime, cops, and life in Baltimore, detectives Bunk Moreland and Jimmy McNulty sit in an interrogation room across the table from a young African American man they call Cheese. The detectives suspect Cheese in one of several recent murders, and for good reason: they have him recorded, on tape. When Cheese refuses to tell them anything, Bunk re-enacts Cheese's recorded statement: "Oh, he was my dawg, man&#8230;I didn't sleep since I capped his ass. Lookin' up at me, all bloody and shit&#8230;He had much love for me, even then. I ain't never gonna find another&#8230;" The detectives know they've hit pay dirt when Cheese becomes emotional, fighting back tears. They point at the pictures of the bodies of murder victims they've put in front of Cheese, and they ask him: which one was his dawg? "Which one of these is he?"</p>

<p>What the detectives don't know, because they weren't there &#8212; they have Cheese's voice on tape, but no video or other witnesses to fill in the details of the scene &#8212; is that Cheese was talking about an actual dog. The dog &#8212; a fighting dog belonging to him &#8212; had lost a fight, and Cheese killed the animal. The detectives naturally assume that Cheese's statement &#8212; "he was my dawg, man" &#8212; refers to a human friend or acquaintance of Cheese, because that's what "dog" almost always means. Everyone knows this, including Bunk and McNulty. According to the website Urban Dictionary, the slang term "dawg" means "my close acquaintance of an African-American ethnic background." </p>

<p>I recalled this scene as I read about a recent case from the Louisiana Supreme Court. It seems that Justice Scott Crichton might need a lesson or two on the meaning of "dawg." He might have made a mistake &#8212; though a different one than Bunk and McNulty's. But he also turns out to be correct about the law. </p>

<p>The Louisiana case involved a police interrogation of a defendant accused of sexual misconduct. The police interviewed the defendant twice, both times advising him of his Miranda rights, including the right to an attorney; defendant waived his rights and agreed to talk without a lawyer present. During the second interview, the defendant called a halt to the questioning; he seems to have decided he didn't like the direction things were going. He said:<br />
<blockquote>"If y'all. This is how I feel, if y'all think I did it, I know that I didn't do it, so why don't you just give me a lawyer dog cause this is not what's up."</blockquote></p>

<p>The police did not get the defendant a lawyer, and he made further incriminating statements. The defendant moved to suppress all the statements that followed, because the police had not honored his request for a lawyer. The trial court refused, and the statements became part of the evidence used to convict the defendant. </p>

<p>The defendant appealed, and eventually asked Louisiana's Supreme Court to take the case for review. The court refused, 8-1, without writing any opinion. Refusing a case without any statement or explanation happens every day, in state and federal appeals courts and supreme courts (including the United States Supreme Court).</p>

<p>Occasionally, a judge writes an opinion to explain his or her vote in favor of or against taking a case up for appeal. And that was where Justice Crichton came in. He agreed with the majority of his colleagues that they should not take the case, and he could have simply voted with them, without uttering a word. But he decided to speak up and add a <a href="https://www.lasc.org/opinions/2017/17KK0954.sjc.addconc.pdf">concurring opinion</a>, to explain why he thought his court was right to refuse to hear the appeal. The statement of the defendant asking for a lawyer, Justice Crichton said, was ambiguous.</p>

<blockquote>In my view, the defendant's ambiguous and equivocal reference to a "lawyer dog" does not constitute an invocation of counsel that warrants termination of the interview&#8230;</blockquote>

<p>Because the defendant asked for a "lawyer dog," it was not clear that he was asking for a lawyer. If he had asked for a lawyer, under <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/451/477/case.html"><span class="casename">Edwards v. Arizona</span></a>, interrogation would have to cease, and the prosecution could not use anything the defendant said after that point to prosecute him. But asking for a "lawyer dog" isn't asking for a lawyer. End of story.</p>

<p>One can explain Justice Crichton's statement in a few different ways.</p>

<p>First, perhaps Crichton just read the words on the page in the most literal way. Whatever a lawyer dog is, he might say, it sure isn't a lawyer. Call this the Cool Hand Luke theory: what we have here is a failure to punctuate. The defendant's statement should have had a comma between the words lawyer and dog. What he said, which didn't make its way onto the page, was "why don't you just give me a lawyer, dog." That would make it clear.</p>

<p>Or perhaps Justice Crichton is one of the few people living in the U.S. today who doesn't understand that the word "dog," as used in the defendant's statement, means the same thing as "pal" or "buddy." One would hope that a law clerk or a staff person, someone younger and less sheltered, or maybe just anyone who has watched television or a movie in the last 15 years, would have caught this "dog" reference before Justice Crichton's opinion went out, and that would have saved Judge Crichton the embarrassment. Alas, not.</p>

<p>So far, so funny. And the media and internet web sites and commentators have all had a good laugh over this. But the unfortunate truth is that, with or without those explanations, Justice Crichton turns out to be correct: the defendant probably did not have a right to a lawyer. And the reason for this does not turn on an omitted comma, or a stray "dog." Rather it turns on the defendant's use of the word "if" &#8212; and how that word fits into a U.S. Supreme Court case Justice Crichton cited in his opinion. That's the real lesson here.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/328/582/case.html"><span class="casename">Davis v. U.S., 512 U.S. 452 (1994)</span></a>, the Supreme Court set out rules for the moment when a defendant decides to invoke his or her Miranda rights: hearing the police officer say in the Miranda warnings that he or she has a right to have a lawyer, the defendant says yes, that's a good idea &#8212; I'd like a lawyer. The facts of the <span class="casename">Davis</span> case explain this. In Davis, the defendant waived &#8212; gave up &#8212; his right to a lawyer, and talked. While giving statements to investigators, he seemed to change his mind midstream, saying, "maybe I should talk to a lawyer." After backing away from that, and giving more statements, the defendant said, "I think I want a lawyer before I say anything." Questioning then stopped. </p>

<p>At trial, the prosecution used the defendant's statements to convict him, despite his attempt to invoke his Miranda rights. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that, despite the defendant's statements, he had not invoked his right to a lawyer. Speaking for the Court's majority, Justice O'Connor said that to invoke Miranda's right to have a lawyer, "the suspect must unambiguously request counsel&#8230;[H]e must articulate his desire to have counsel present sufficiently clearly that a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand the statement to be a request for an attorney." One could only understand what the defendant had said &#8212; "maybe I should talk to a lawyer" &#8212; as "a statement that might be a request for an attorney&#8230;" This, O'Connor said, isn't enough.</p>

<p>The problem with the Supreme Court's <span class="casename">Davis</span> opinion is that it ignores both the practicalities of how people actually communicate, and the social science that confirms what we know. When a person says "maybe I should talk to a lawyer" or "I think I need a lawyer," we would understand that as, "yes, I think a lawyer is a good idea &#8212; I want one." We would not understand them to say, in any serious conversation, "hmm, I'm considering that option." And the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BwNhR02OgB8C&pg=PT582&lpg=PT582&dq=hedged+speech+minorities+and+women+more+likely+to+use&source=bl&ots=N-79dySy4e&sig=77ZKXFdxWDEUS6kr-WhivfUqOQo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjJ1MKl9qzXAhUM5oMKHXP5AzAQ6AEIPjAD#v=onepage&q=hedged%20speech%20minorities%20and%20women%20more%20likely%20to%20use&f=false">research confirms</a> our understanding: people tend to speak in indirect, hedged speech patterns. These indirect speech patterns tend to show up most often in the speech of women and most minority racial and ethnic groups; moreover, this way of speaking also occurs most often in situations in which the person speaking (here, the suspect) confronts a person of much greater power in the context of the situation (the interrogating police officer). </p>

<p>Justice O'Connor seems to have known this. She says, in the Court's opinion, that "[w]e recognize that requiring a clear assertion of the right to counsel might disadvantage some suspects who &#8212; because of fear, intimidation, lack of linguistic skills, or a variety of other reasons &#8212; will not clearly articulate their right to counsel although they actually want to have a lawyer present." But that wasn't enough to convince her or the majority that police ought to clarify these ambiguous assertions before questioning further. Thus only a clear, direct and assertive statement &#8212; "I want a lawyer" &#8212; using words atypical of the way so many people, especially those most likely to be a power disadvantage in the interrogation room &#8212; will suffice. </p>

<p>This explains why Justice Crichton might be right after all. The defendant said, "<em>If</em> y'all. This is how I feel, <em>if</em> y'all think I did it&#8230;" Those "ifs" seem to put the case into the <span class="casename">Davis</span> category of ambiguous requests. </p>

<p>So what Justice Crichton's opinion tells us might be funny, if we focus on the "lawyer dog" comment. But what's more important is the way the case highlights <span class="casename">Davis</span>, and its rule that speaking like we usually do &#8212; "I think it's time for lunch" or "I'm not sure doing this is a good idea" &#8212; doesn't count for anything in the legal system, when we want to do something as bold as exercising our rights. That's what's unfortunate, and it isn't funny at all. </p>

<p>In a case like the one involving the "lawyer dog" statement, or <span class="casename">Davis</span> itself, where the suspect is trying to assert his or her rights, we ought to look for ways to respect those attempts, not excuses to disregard them.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://law.uark.edu/directory/directory-faculty/uid/uchee/name/Uche-Ewelukwa/">Professor Uché Ewelukwa Ofodile</a> of the University of Arkansas School of Law discusses answers to questions about Arkansas' new right of publicity legislation ... </p>
<strong>T</strong>he right of publicity is the right to control the commercial use of one's identity. Over the years, a growing number of celebrities, athletes and sports personalities have brought lawsuits to enforce their right of publicity including <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15763501998860364615">Vanna White</a> of "Wheel of Fortune" fame, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15989138338581244750">Tom Waits</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6021003493814451958">Bette Milder</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7120335566499403969">Jesse "The Body" Ventura</a>, Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, Hulk Hogan, and Muhammed Ali. In some states, the right of publicity extends beyond the grave and has been exercised on behalf of dead personalities such as <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3389829714381222724">Elvis Presley</a> and <a href="Experience Hendrix, LLC v. HendrixLicensing.com, Ltd., 766 F. Supp. 2d 1122 (W.D. Wash. 2011).">Jimi Hendrix</a>. In the United States (U.S.), a growing number of states have adopted right of publicity statutes (e.g. <a href="https://www.justia.com/trials-litigation/docs/caci/1800/1804a.html">California</a>, <a href="http://iga.in.gov/legislative/laws/2017/ic/titles/032#32-36-1">Indiana</a>, and <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=2241&ChapterID=62">Illinois</a>) and a few more are considering adopting similar statutes. When seven-time Grammy-winning singer Prince died in 2016, a bill - the "Personal Rights in Names Can Endure" (or PRINCE) Act - was immediately introduced in the state legislature in an attempt to codify the right of publicity in Minnesota law; the bill was subsequently retracted. In April 2016, the Arkansas legislature passed the <a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/arkansas/2016/title-4/subtitle-6/chapter-75/subchapter-11">Frank Broyles Publicity Rights Protection Act of 2016</a> ("Frank Broyles Act" or "Act").</p>

<p>It is important for individuals in the U.S. and outside the U.S. to be aware of the right of publicity law applicable in a state like Arkansas because unlike trademarks, patents, and copyrights, which are governed by federal law, in the U.S. the right of publicity is a state law intellectual property right. Moreover, thanks to globalization, a growing number of people from around the world are having reason to be in Arkansas and may have reason to seek to enforce their right of publicity in a state court. For instance, Arkansas is home to the world's largest retailer, Wal-Mart.</p>

<p><em>1.	What does the Frank Broyles Act protect? <br />
</em>The Act creates a property right in the commercial use of one's identity. The Act protects five aspects of an individual's identity:  name, voice, signature, photograph, and likeness from unauthorized commercial use. The Act does not protect every aspect of an individual's identity. The Act does not protect distinctive appearances, gestures, unique phrases, and mannerisms.</p>

<p><em>2.	Who does the Frank Broyles Act protect? Does the Frank Broyles Act protect children?<br />
</em>	The Act protects individuals defined as "natural persons whether living or dead." Children of all ages are protected. However, the Act does not protect pets and other animals.</p>

<p><em>3.	Does the Frank Broyles Act require an identity-holder to be a celebrity or to have a commercially valuable identity?</em><br />
No. Unlike the law of some states, in Arkansas an identity holder need not be a celebrity. However, although the Act protects ordinary individuals, non-celebrities may have a harder time proving actual damages resulting from any unauthorized use of their identity.</p>

<p><em>4.	Does protection under the Frank Broyles Act hinge on whether an individual is exploiting or has exploited his or her identity in the past?</em><br />
No. Prior exploitation of an individual's identity is not required to trigger the right of publicity in Arkansas. </p>

<p><em>5.	Is the right of publicity created by the Frank Broyles Act transferable? </em><br />
	Yes. The property right created by the Act is freely transferable, assignable, licensable, and descendible, in whole or in part, by contract or by a trust, testamentary disposition, or other instrument.</p>

<p><em>6.	How long does the right of publicity in Arkansas last? Does the right expire upon the death of an individual? <br />
</em>Arkansas' right of publicity lasts throughout the lifetime of an individual and for fifty (50) years after the individual's death. In other words, dead individuals have a protectable right of publicity in Arkansas.  Under the Act, an individual's right of publicity is exclusive to the individual during the individual's lifetime. After death, the right is exclusive to the individual's executors, administrators, heirs, devisees, and assignees.</p>

<p><em>7.	What types of uses does the Frank Broyles Act prohibit? Is registration required to exercise Arkansas' Statutory right of publicity?  <br />
</em>	The Act only prohibits unauthorized "commercial use" of an individual's identity. Commercial use is defined as the use of an individual's 'readily identifiable' name, voice, signature, photograph, or likeness "[f]or advertising, selling, or soliciting purchases of products, merchandise, goods, or services;" or "[o]n or in connection with products, merchandise, goods, or other commercial activity that is not exempt." </p>

<p><em>8.	Is registration required to exercise a right of publicity in Arkansas?  <br />
</em>No. Formal registration is not required to exercise a right of publicity under the Act. However, to fully exercise and enforce a post-mortem right of publicity, it is advisable for a successor-in-interest of a descendant's right of publicity to register his or her claim of property rights. </p>

<p><em>9.	Is domicile and/or residence in Arkansas required to exercise Arkansas' statutory right of publicity?<br />
</em>Yes. Protection under the Act is available "only to individuals maintaining a domicile or residence in the State of Arkansas" on or after the effective date of the Act. Although protection under the Act is available only to individuals maintaining a domicile or residence in Arkansas, given the presence of a growing number of Fortune 500 companies in the State, more and more people from across the U.S. and around the world have reason to be in the state and may have cause to enforce their right of publicity in the state.</p>

<p><em>10.	Is any and every use of an individual's identity absolutely prohibited in Arkansas? <br />
</em>No. The Act exempts several types of uses from liability including: (i) use "[i]n connection with a news, public affairs, or sports broadcast, ...  an account of public interest, or a political campaign;" (ii) use in work of political, public interest, or newsworthy value including a comment, criticism, parody, satire, or a transformative creation of a work of authorship; and (iii) use in a photograph or likeness where the individual appears as a member of the public, an attendee of a photographed event, or in a public place, and the individual is not named.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the right of publicity is going global. Sometimes foreign nationals bring right of publicity claims in the U.S. and other times, U.S. citizens attempt to enforce their right of publicity overseas. Former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-videogames-noriega/judge-dismisses-noriega-case-against-activision-over-videogame-idUSL1N0SN2NK20141028">against Activision Blizzard, Inc.</a>) and legendary Brazilian soccer player Pelé (against <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/313950843/Pele-IP-Ownership-v-Samsung-Electronics-complaint-pdf">Samsung Electronics Co.</a> [complaint]) have both brought lawsuits in the U.S. to enforce their right of publicity. In turn, U.S. celebrities - Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones - successfully enforced their rights of publicity in the United Kingdom by bringing a breach of confidence cause of action.<br />
The provisions of the Frank Broyles Act are yet to be litigated in court. How to appropriately balance the right of publicity against the public interest in free speech and free press will be a challenge for courts in Arkansas. Moreover, unlike Indiana's <a href="http://codes.findlaw.com/in/title-32-property/in-code-sect-32-36-1-9.html">right of publicity statute</a> that contain broad jurisdictional and choice of law provisions, the Act lacks a choice of law provision. It thus remains to be seen how court in Arkansas will address thorny jurisdictional questions if and when they arise.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.law.gmu.edu/faculty/directory/fulltime/krauss_michael">Michael Krauss</a> of the <a href="https://www.law.gmu.edu/">George Mason University Antonin Scalia Law School</a> discusses the "crime fraud exception" to attorney-client privilege and how it applies to the recent situation with Paul Manafort and Robert Mueller...</p><strong>T</strong>he attorney-client privilege is a common law privilege against testifying about the content of confidential communications between clients and their attorneys, made for the purpose of obtaining or providing legal assistance. The privilege has been recognized by the Supreme Court in the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5153750416071396937&q=upjohn+co+v+united+states&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Upjohn [1981]</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15126544245741859873&q=Swidler+and+Berlin&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Swidler and Berlin [1998] </a>cases, among others. It is perpetual (surviving the death of the client, or of the lawyer).  But it is waivable, and it has one other significant exception.</p>

<p>The privilege may be waived (expressly or impliedly), by the client or by her attorney. Voluntary disclosure will waive the privilege, as will invocation of the otherwise-privileged communication by the client or her lawyer. If the lawyer waives privilege negligently she may be civilly liable to her client and also subject to professional responsibility (for incompetence).  </p>

<p>And there is one big exception to the privilege:  the so-called "crime fraud exception." Privileged information may be waived, but information covered by the crime-fraud exception is non-privileged from the get-go. Clients may reveal past criminal or fraudulent conduct to their attorneys in total confidentiality, but ongoing or intended future crime will not be protected. This is a corollary of the prohibition against assisting a client to commit a crime (<a href="https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/events/state_local_government/2014%20Fall%20Council%20Meeting/reefer-madness/D%20Merriam%204075_001.authcheckdam.pdf">§ 1.2(d) of the Model Rules of Professional Responsibility</a>).</p>

<p>The <em><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=91CiV-wbSd4C&pg=PA103&lpg=PA103&dq=restatement+third+of+the+law+governing+lawyers+consults+a+lawyer+for+the+purpose,+later+accomplished,+of+obtaining+assistance+to+engage+in+a+crime+or+fraud+or+aiding+a+third+person+to+do+so,+or&source=bl&ots=5f354xNcWN&sig=GVA3uXZqBP6fjYUjie2sSx70Gzo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj58sThhMTXAhWns1QKHWXiAAgQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=restatement%20third%20of%20the%20law%20governing%20lawyers%20consults%20a%20lawyer%20for%20the%20purpose%2C%20later%20accomplished%2C%20of%20obtaining%20assistance%20to%20engage%20in%20a%20crime%20or%20fraud%20or%20aiding%20a%20third%20person%20to%20do%20so%2C%20or&f=false">Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers</a></em> provides that the exception applies when a client: <blockquote>a) consults a lawyer for the purpose, later accomplished, of obtaining assistance to engage in a crime or fraud or aiding a third person to do so, or</p>

<p>b) regardless of the client's purpose a the time of consultation, uses the lawyers; advice or other services to engage in or assist a crime or fraud.</blockquote>Note that the crime-fraud exception does not require that the lawyer be an accomplice to the crime or fraud. The lawyer may be duped, or may be responding to a "law book" question the answer to which, unbeknownst to the lawyer, will be used by the client to facilitate the commission of the crime or fraud. If the client is trying to "go straight" or rectify the crime or fraud, however, the communication is privileged.</p>

<p>So a client seeking advice to become or remain a fugitive from justice (an ongoing crime) will be unable to invoke privilege for communications to his lawyer seeking information about "loopholes" in our extradition treaties with certain other countries. But a client seeking to return stolen property should find her confidential communications with her lawyer to be privileged.</p>

<p>At the request of the Department of Justice's special counsel Robert Mueller, Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the U.S. District Court for Washington, DC <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/sites/dcd/files/17-mc-2336_MEM_OP_REDACTED%20FOR%20UNSEALING_20171030.pdf">ruled on October 2</a> that the crime-fraud exception applied to communications with Paul Manafort's ["Target 1"] and Richard Gates' ["Target 2"] attorney, which presumably led that attorney to respond to inquiries about why Manafort and Gates had not filed foreign-agent lobbying registrations in compliance with the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-2062-foreign-agents-registration-act-enforcement">Foreign Agent Registration Act</a>. Failure to file is an ongoing crime. [The Chief Judge did not name the attorney, who is called "witness" throughout the ruling. But I note that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/29/politics/mueller-manafort-attorney-spokesman-subpoenas/index.html">CNN reported in August</a> that Mueller was seeking the testimony of Melissa Laurenza, a partner at Akin Gump and an alumna of my law school.] Chief Judge Howell said some facts, which have been redacted from her opinion, "establish" that Manafort's and Gates's denial of U.S. activity for Ukraine's Party of Regions "is false, a half-truth, or at least misleading because evidence shows that Target 1 and Target 2 were intimately involved in significant outreach in the United States on behalf of ... the Party of Regions and/or the Ukrainian government."</p>

<p>In other words, at this point, the Chief Judge has concluded that the attorney was likely duped by her clients. What they told her to dupe her, and get her to (presumably unwittingly) advance their fraudulent scheme, is therefore non-privileged.  [What if she wasn't duped? What if she connived with her clients to perfect their crime? See below.]</p>

<p>The Supreme Court has ruled that an invocation of the crime-fraud exception by a trial judge is not subject to immediate appeal.  Witness's recourse, if she believes the ruling is erroneous, would therefore be to refuse to comply with the ruling, be condemned for contempt, and then appeal the contempt ruling. The appellate court would then decide if the redacted facts do indeed give rise to the crime-fraud exception.</p>

<p>From what is publicly known, the Chief Judge's ruling, it seems to me, is correct. So one can ask one's lawyer, in full confidence, if a Sunday-closing law is unconstitutional. One can ask one's lawyer in full confidence what the penalties are for violating the Sunday-closing law. But one cannot, in full confidence, communicate to the lawyer that one's store is currently closed when it is in fact open, whether or not the lawyer knew of this fact.  [If the lawyer did know, then of course she is an accomplice to the crime, properly chargeable and also subject to disbarment by Bar authorities. Nothing in the Chief Judge's ruling implies that situation obtains as regards the "Witness."]</p>

<p>Note, finally, that the Chief Judge allowed Mr. Mueller to ask of the "witness" only seven of the eight questions he had proposed. She ruled that a question about whether "witness" made any record of her conversations with Manafort or Gates violated a protection against revelation of mental observations, or "opinion work product" protection.  The thoughts of a lawyer are sacrosanct unless that lawyer's thought are part of a criminal conspiracy; and, as stated above, the Chief Judge has, at this point, no reason to infer such a conspiracy existed. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Julia Selman Ayetey of McGill University discusses the UK Space Industry Bill... </p>

<p><strong>T</strong>he <a href="https://www.spacefoundation.org">global space market</a> was valued at $329 billion in 2016 and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/introduction-of-space-industry-bill-shows-uks-commitment-to-commercial-spaceflight">private sub-orbital flights and launches of small satellites</a> alone are anticipated to be worth £25 billion pounds over the next 20 years. It is therefore unsurprising that the UK seeks to become a major player in the private commercial space industry. To facilitate its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/apr/29/plans-for-british-spaceports-in-danger-of-being-grounded-by-poor-legislation">ambition to launch the very first spaceflight from UK</a> territory by 2020, the <a href="http://news.sky.com/story/commercial-space-flights-from-uk-by-2020-under-new-govt-plans-10774991">government has proposed the Space Industry Bill</a> which is currently before parliament. If passed, it will significantly reduce, if not eliminate, the UK's reliance on foreign launch services, facilitate innovative research, create hundreds of jobs and contribute to the growth of the country's NewSpace sector.</p>

<p><strong>Features of the Space Industry Bill</strong><br />
The Space Industry Bill, an updated version of the earlier Draft Spaceflight Bill, provides for the implementation of a regulatory framework and licensing scheme to enable private commercial space activities, such as spaceflights and small satellite launches, to occur from UK spaceports. It <a href="http://spacenews.com/uk-industry-praises-spaceflight-bill-but-calls-2020-launch-goal-unrealistic/">covers traditional vertical launches and is likely to accomodate horizontal launches.</a> Additionally, it enables the imposition of civil sanctions for non-compliance with regulations, authorizes the creation of space-related criminal offences and addresses issues of liability. It also makes provision for the transfer of licenses which is in sharp contrast to other space legislation, such as <a href="http://www.spaceresources.public.lu/content/dam/spaceresources/news/Translation%20Of%20The%20Draft%20Law.pdf">Luxembourg's new space mining law</a> which does not permit licenses to be transferred. This is likely to be welcomed by space launch operators and investors.<br />
 <br />
<strong>Criticisms</strong><br />
Some provisions of the Bill could be viewed as counterproductive to efforts intended to establish the UK as an attractive business environment for commercial space activities. For example, the Bill does not limit space operators' liability for damage to property or injury to persons but only grants discretion to the regulator to do so. Whilst this might be considered useful in discouraging risky business practices, it is also likely to put off investors.<br />
 <br />
Another issue with the Bill is that the negative impact of commercial space activities is, arguably, not sufficiently considered. Although the Bill authorizes the imposition of safety regulations and gives examples in one of the schedules to the Bill of what those safety regulations may contain, the Bill itself is devoid of sufficient specifics. Risks to public health and safety arising from increased commercial space use are not yet fully known but include potential effects on climate change and pollution both on earth and in outer space. Some assert that such risks may be existential. Yet, the Space Industry Bill has been proposed without wide public consultation or public education. In 2014 the government did conduct a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/649976/Space_Environments_and_Human_Spaceflight_Strategyv2.pdf">consultation exercise on its National Strategy for Space Environments and Human Spaceflight</a>, however, the majority of respondents were company representatives or industry experts, namely those who have a direct interest in seeing an expansion of the space sector and tailoring the legislation to that end. The response from ordinary members of the public was negligible. The government did solicit feedback on the Draft Spaceflight Bill, but again this was primarily targeted at those in space-related professions. Further, although government funding has been allocated to support space education initiatives, it doesn't appear that any of these funds have been earmarked for educating the public on the effect of the Bill's provisions.<br />
 <br />
Importantly, some provisions of the Bill arguably erode fundamental legal principles. The very wide prerogative conferred on the regulations to "generally" give effect to the eventual Act undermines the ability to seek judicial review on the basis that permitted powers have been exceeded. Further, it could be contended that the principle of separation of powers is infringed by the extensive delegated powers contained within the Bill. These include Henry VIII clauses that would authorize the amendment or repeal of the primary legislation by secondary legislation even in absence of parliamentary scrutiny. Moreover, the lack of judicial supervision on the emergency power of the Secretary of State to grant an unspecified individual the authority "to do anything necessary" for the protection of national security, health and safety or compliance with international obligations is worrying. All three of these issues have been a <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201719/ldselect/ldconst/18/18.pdf">matter of concern</a> for the House of Lords Constitution Committee, yet they remain in the Bill. </p>

<p>Finally, there has been criticism that the Bill is skeletal in nature. The government has responded by stating that details will be covered in the eventual secondary legislation mandated by the Bill. However, without reviewing the intended regulations, the attempt to "<a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2017-10-23/debates/E0222961-B54E-45B7-B7EB-4511997A0FC2/Debate">future-proof</a>" the law through substantial delegated and discretionary powers makes it difficult for parliament (and the public and investors) to know with relative certainty whether, and the degree to which, UK space governance will operate holistically. The government has published a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/629967/space-industry-bill-policy-scoping-notes.pdf">policy document</a> outlining its intentions with regard to the delegated powers but this is an insufficient substitute for actual draft regulations.<br />
 <br />
<strong>The Right Move?</strong><br />
The Space Industry Bill seeks to create the rare situation where law is ahead of technological advances and has been drafted to significantly accommodate the emerging private commercial space market. It is therefore unsurprising that the Bill has garnered wide support within the industry. If enacted, it is likely to achieve its target of boosting the employment rate and cementing the UK's position as a leader in the NewSpace sector. However, it is important that these objectives do not blind legislators to the need to adhere to the normal legal standards of proportionality and access to justice as well to ensure adequate legislative scrutiny of the draft regulations, given their novel nature.<br />
 <br />
Is the Bill headed in the right direction? For the private sector, the answer is a resounding yes. For those concerned about fundamental democratic legal principles and the sustainability of humanity, earth and outer space? The answer is far less clear.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Corinne Maupin of Valparaiso University School of Law discusses advances in facial recognition technology and the corresponding ripeness for matching regulations ...</j:header></p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/facial_recognition_technology_crime_privacy">recent article</a> in the ABA Journal noted that law enforcement agencies have proposed the use of facial recognition software within departments to aid in the capture of criminals. This software obtains photographs and catalogs them for later use. This could be mug-shots, driver's license photos, or photographs captured while someone is walking down the street.  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/16/smile-your-face-is-changing-how-you-move-through-the-airport.html">For example</a>, there are already studies implemented in airports to replace the driver's license and passport. </p>

<p>The widespread implementation of this type of software requires an analysis of the benefit and risks. Once the benefits and risks are understood, citizens will be able to make an informed decision about how and when this software should be utilized.</p>

<p>The potential benefits of facial recognition may be endless. Importantly, the <a href="https://www.forensicmag.com/article/2010/10/facial-recognition-valuable-tool-law-enforcement">software</a> provides law enforcement with ways to manage records of people of interest. Facial recognition software in the criminal justice system utilizes two different biometric techniques to increase the efficiency and accuracy of the verification process. This software identifies individuals when it is not legally or physically possible to obtain fingerprint or DNA evidence. As a demonstration, the Pierce County Sheriff in Washington State has <a href="https://www.forensicmag.com/article/2010/10/facial-recognition-valuable-tool-law-enforcement">been able</a> to demonstrate 94% accuracy in the first candidate spot when using mug shot photographs for facial identification during booking. Although the quality of the facial images varies, such as those frequently obtained from surveillance footage, it is still possible to compare photograph stored in the database and make a possible identification. </p>

<p>This technology, however, does not come without the attendant risks. Facial recognition software is currently an un-regulated algorithm that uses facial features to identify people from previously stored photographs. This means that each individual State or department is controlling their own facial recognition software. Facial recognition software is not as accurate in its identification methods as other, more established methods such as fingerprinting or DNA testing. </p>

<p>For instance, Georgetown Law Center on Privacy and Technology <a href="https://www.perpetuallineup.org/sites/default/files/2016-12/The Perpetual Line-Up - Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law - 121616.pdf">did a study</a> [PDF] regarding the accuracy and risks of the unregulated use of facial recognition software by law enforcement in America. In this study, Georgetown Law Center noted several flaws with facial recognition software. Most notably, that facial recognition software is least accurate when it comes to people with dark skin. In a poll done at the Seattle Police Department, the department states their system does not see race. However, a co-study done by the Federal Bureau of Investigation suggested that facial recognition software may be less accurate on black people. This is troubling because, as the study suggests, mug shot databases are likely to include a disproportionate number of African Americans. However, there is no testing method to discover racially biased errors. The potential for racial bias in the facial recognition may be a sore spot for many police departments. Transparency is going to be important in communities when the facial recognition software becomes more popular.      </p>

<p>With the inherent risk of racial bias, law enforcement agencies may be less likely to be transparent with their communities. A <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/testimony/law-enforcements-use-of-facial-recognition-technology">report</a> written by Kimberly Del Greco, Deputy Assistant Director, Criminal Justice Information Services Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, states the facial recognition software used for identifying criminals is only accurate 85% of the time in a controlled environment. Compared to the accuracy of fingerprinting, <a href="http://wordpress.jmcgowan.com/wp/the-accuracy-of-fingerprint-identification-in-criminal-cases/">which is</a> roughly 92.5%, there is still work to be done on facial recognition software before it becomes a reliable method of capturing criminals.</p>

<p>Additionally, facial recognition software raises some important constitutional questions.  A pertinent example involves the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a>, and the specific right of freedom of assembly.  Citizens are granted the right to protest anonymously.  However, the use of facial recognition software to identify anyone on the street potentially halts the freedoms of citizens. If this software is used at political protests citizens lose their right to protest anonymously. To protect the right to protest and freedom of speech there should be some form of regulations on the use of facial recognition software. There are a wide array of benefits and risks associated with the use of facial recognition software in police departments. When this use is unregulated it allows criminal justice systems to use it how they see fit. Regulations on facial recognition software in law enforcement agencies will standardize the use of facial imaging and protect citizens First Amendment rights. </p>

<p>To see how the technology has fared without regulation, it is helpful to examine recent implementations of it, such as with the <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/iphone-x-facial-recognition-faceid-hands-on-feature-review-apple-new-phone-a8028851.html">iPhone X</a>.  This phone allows a person to simply show their face near the camera of the phone to unlock their device. This device software also authenticates Apple Pay, and some applications on the device. Your face is now the key to opening and securing your phone.  </p>

<p>Having the facial recognition software in the iPhone means easy accessibility for the owners. There are added security features for the facial recognition software.  <a href="https://www.thurrott.com/mobile/ios/142861/heres-reviewers-saying-iphone-x-facial-recognition">Reviewers</a> of the iPhone software recognize that unlocking the iPhone is not automatic. The Face ID readies the phone for unlock, then an additional icon appears to unlock the phone.  One user <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/iphone-x-week-one-first-impressions/">has noted</a> that Face ID also works in an almost completely dark room by using only the light on the iPhone's screen. The features of the iPhone X make using a smartphone easy. Forgotten passwords seem to be a thing of the past with this new technology.<br />
 <br />
However, as with any new technology, there are risks associated with having a device that uses a face as a key. The iPhone X has been <a href="http://mashable.com/2017/10/31/putting-iphone-x-face-id-to-twin-test/#mdinCwl_Lqq6">tested </a>on identical twins, and it cannot tell the difference. In 2012, it was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/24/health/research/twin-births-in-the-us-like-never-before.html">suggested</a> that about one in 30 babies born is a twin. The article also suggested that the rate of twins born in the United States has been increasing since 1980. With there being such a small population of twins, one would think this risk does not apply to them.  The risk, in fact, may be more widespread than many think: the <a href="https://twinstrangers.net/">Twin Stranger Project</a> is an example of a group showcasing two people looking almost exactly alike, while sharing little to no relation to one another. </p>

<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/twin-strangers">an article</a> written for Women's Health Magazine explores the reasons we may look like complete strangers. The article explains that any two people at random may share about 99.5% of their gene sequence. This is a relatively small risk considering the Twin Strangers is global, and not limited to the United States. </p>

<p>A Vietnamese cybersecurity firm has also taken steps to show how the device can be hacked. Ngo Tuan Anh has <a href="http://www.euronews.com/2017/11/15/you-can-fool-iphone-xs-face-recognition-software-but-its-not-easy">demonstrated</a> how to hack the device by using a 3D mask, paper tape skin, silicone nose, and paper eyes, he can unlock the iPhone X. In the same article it is noted, however, that the process could take up to five hours. Apple's own technical support page <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208108">notes</a> the probability of a random person unlocking a phone that does not belong to them is approximately one -in-a-million. Although the risk exists, it is relatively small and would take in-depth consideration from a person trying to hack into a phone.</p>

<p>The potential for the future of facial recognition in smart devices is endless. The iPhone X seems to be user-friendly. The device uses facial features to secure the smartphone. The increased security is appealing. However, with benefits come inherent risks. Like all technology, facial recognition software can be hacked. The device cannot differentiate identical twins, yet, and as noted, there is a convenient website for strangers to find people who match them almost identically. This opens the door to hacking and potential theft of devices.<br />
 <br />
Facial recognition software is set to take America by storm. New technology is often utilized in a variety of ways and incorporated into everyday lives. Fingerprinting and password locks on phones are soon to be a thing of the past. With all new technology, there are risks. The government has not yet caught up to the speed of the dissemination of the facial recognition devices. There are no regulations on how the software is being used. Law enforcement agencies are deciding when and where to use the software. We may soon see a future where facial recognition technology in government agencies and phones connect. </p>

<p>New technology that has the aforementioned risks should be regulated. There should be a standardized use of the technology. The regulations will protect citizens from the infringement on their rights, while also protecting law enforcement and government agencies from outrage by citizens.  The goal of the technology should not just be ease of use for phones or catching criminals. The technology should also be utilized to protect the rights of all citizens. </p>

		<title>The Argument for Federal Liability in Sutherland Springs</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Gary Reynolds of the <a href="https://www.valpo.edu/law/">Valparaiso University Law School</a> discusses the shooting in Sutherland Springs and its potential legacy in the landscape of gun control...</j:header><strong>A</strong> common criticism about the gun debate in America is the lack of change after a tragedy.   The knee-jerk reactions to pursue legislative action immediately happen, which then incurs the wrath of pro-gun advocates who declare rash changes in the law will inevitably lead to government infringement of an enumerated constitutional right.  The cycle continues until no change comes about and then the next shooting happens, restarting the pattern.</p>

<p>The initial facts from the Sutherland Springs shooting on November 5, 2017, seem to indicate that this tragedy can lead to an outcome different from the tragedy/reaction/stasis rotation we typically face. </p>

<p>What is known about the shooter, Devin Kelley, is that he served in the United States Air Force and was given a bad conduct discharge due to serving a year in prison for a felonious assault resulting in multiple injuries, including the fractured skull of his infant step-son. Kelley also had a significant mental health history.</p>

<p>Kelley's actions that led to his incarceration and the USAF's failure to report are important to note because his ability to purchase weapons would've been stopped had the FBI been informed.  <a href="http://www.rip.uscourts.gov/rip/supervision/firearmpossession/FirearmPossessionProhibition.pdf">A felon "convicted in any court </a>of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding more than one year" cannot own a firearm. Kelley's multiple assaults certainly satisfy that standard.</p>

<p>Kelley's domestic abuse conviction and incarceration have been required to be reported to the FBI background search database for more than 30 years, per the "<a href="http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a384328.pdf">DoD Criminal Investigations Policy Memorandum</a> Number 10 (CPM No. 10), Criminal History Data Reporting Requirements, March 25, 1987." Quoting, "DCIOs and all other DoD criminal investigative and police organizations <em>shall</em> submit to the FBI . . . offender criminal history data for all Armed Forces members they investigate for commission of an offense . . .," emphasis added.  </p>

<p>If the DoD regulations, memos, and studies had said the DoD "may" report to the FBI, or that reporting was within the discretion of an officer or particular subdivision, then the FBI reporting would be something that a military person would be within their right to either perform or not perform. But that discretion is not present; the language uniformly says the DoD "shall" submit reports to the FBI. It is this lack of discretion on the part of the DoD to perform this duty that potentially triggers the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2680">Federal Torts Claims Act</a> as controlling law in this tragedy. <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2674">Such liability could lead to</a> wrongful death, property damage, and spousal loss of consortium damages, but not prejudgment interest or punitive damages.</p>

<p>Under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1346">Federal Tort Claims Act § 1346(b)</a>, the laws of the state where the incident took place can act as a limitation on liability. Texas appears to have no such limitation on this type of neglect. Nor does it appear that Texas law has to be applied at all since this shooting resulted from a breach of DoD duty. <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/32/536.74">The Military Claims Act</a> serves as an extension of authority under the Federal Tort Claims Act to apply to non-combat related breaches of duty by the United States Armed Forces against residents in the United States.</p>

<p>Alternative to the victims' potential reliance on the Federal Tort Claims Act or the Military Claims Act, an interesting prolonged civil suit is still being litigated. <em><a href="https://www.in.gov/judiciary/opinions/pdf/10290701jts.pdf">Smith and Wesson Corp. v. City of Gary</a></em> is an ongoing lawsuit originating in 1999. The city of Gary, Indiana filed a lawsuit under a public health nuisance claim that gun manufacturers and dealers (gun industry) were liable for gun-related deaths as a result of negligent sales and distribution practices. The case was heard and remanded for further proceedings, directly challenging the authority provided under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/chapter-105">Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA)</a>. The PLCAA is another layer of legislative immunity for members of the gun industry engaged in legal commerce, however "predicate exceptions" exist in the law that allow actions to proceed under several different circumstances. The <em>City of Gary</em> case is exceptional in that while the central lawsuit is still progressing some 18 years after initial filing, several defendant merchants have settled and the case serves as a real-time application of new legislative enactments and legal arguments.</p>

<p>But just as <em>City of Gary</em> is informative of how evolving legal and legislative posturing impacts ongoing litigation, the greatest value of this case may just be the focus on how private manufacturers and dealers are shown to be manifestations of government action.</p>

<p>The plaintiffs in <em>City of Gary</em> rely on several base assumptions in order to validate their claims: that the gun industry has a duty to the public; that the same entities exercise discretion in their respective roles that create potential breaches; and that the unique roles taken on by the respective manufacturers and dealers are solely in the position to prevent or permit the types of damages suffered by Gary, Indiana. Taken in combination with the fact that the gun industry is the exclusive commercial manifestation of an enumerated constitutional right, the argument that the gun industry is a state actor can be made. Should a state actor theory be established for the gun industry, liability under § 1983 can then be explored, presenting another layer of federal liability when gun massacres occur.</p>

<p>Taking the PLCAA's predicate exceptions that are litigated in <em>City of Gary</em> and applying them to the current tragedy, the victims' families from Sutherland Springs can look for evidence that the gun industry abused its discretion or otherwise negligently sold firearms to Kelley. Perhaps Kelley sought a personal acquaintance who was working at the store who knew but ignored Kelley's criminal and mental health issues, or maybe Kelley appeared to be impaired or otherwise incapable of using a firearm safely at the time of purchase. Such evidence would go a long way in helping to establish the gun industry's liability under the PLCAA. Again, when combined with the exclusivity the gun industry enjoys, liability under § 1983 becomes a real possibility because the plaintiff's rights have been violated by the negligence of a state actor.</p>

<p>The survivors and loved ones from the Sutherland Springs massacre possess a strong factual basis to hold the federal government liable under the FTCA and the MCA due to the DoD's failure to report. Depending on additional evidence, gun industry liability under the PLCAA is also a strong possibility, and can potentially lead to § 1983 liability due to the constitutional factors presented. Any successful action by the plaintiffs under one of these theories has the possibility of bringing about the change sought (or feared) in our nation's gun debate. For that matter, a successful defense by the gun industry under any of these theories can have the same legacy.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.cuny.edu/faculty/directory/kirchmeier.html">Jeffrey L. Kirchmeier</a> of <a href="http://www.law.cuny.edu/index.html">City University of New York School of Law </a>discusses diminished capacity standards in recent capital punishment cases...</p>

<p><strong>T</strong>he United States Supreme Court in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/17-193_6j37.pdf">Dunn v. Madison</a> [text, PDF] recently considered whether or not a death row prisoner is competent to be executed if due to mental incapacity the prisoner cannot remember the crime. Ultimately, the Court decided on procedural grounds to let the execution proceed, but the case left unresolved questions.</p>

<p>Vernon Madison ended up on death row in Alabama for killing a police officer in 1985. During decades on death row, Madison, who now is in his late 60's, suffered several physical and mental impairments. Additionally, a severe stroke in 2015 affected Madison's vision, his motor coordination, and resulted in memory loss. After another stroke in 2016, guards found Madison unresponsive and incontinent. The second stroke resulted in disorientation and more memory loss. </p>

<p>Because of Madison's mental decline, his attorneys requested a hearing to determine if he were competent to be executed. During the hearing, an expert gave unrefuted testimony that Madison had no memory of the murder that had put him on death row. The trial court concluded Madison was competent to be executed because Madison still understood that he was being executed as a punishment for a crime. In habeas corpus proceedings, however, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-11th-circuit/1853025.html">ruled </a> in favor of Madison</p>

<p>The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously reversed. Ultimately, though, the issue regarding memory's relevance to competence was not resolved due to the Court's application of the habeas corpus standard of review under the<a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ132/html/PLAW-104publ132.htm"> Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA)</a>. </p>

<p><u>The AEDPA Standard</u></p>

<p>The Supreme Court in Dunn applied the highly deferential standard of review under AEDPA.  Under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2254">Section 2254</a> of that statute, a state prisoner is entitled to federal habeas relief only if the state court's decision "was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law" determined by the Supreme Court or was "based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence" submitted in state court. </p>

<p>Therefore, the Dunn Court had to evaluate whether the state trial court's finding of competency was unreasonable. In other words, Madison could only win if the Supreme Court had already "clearly established" that a capital prisoner's inability to remember the crime would render the prisoner incompetent to be executed.  </p>

<p><u>Competency to Be Executed</u></p>

<p>The current <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendment</a> standard for determining whether a capital defendant is competent to be executed results from two Supreme Court cases, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7904262174469084060&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr">Ford v. Wainwright</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14658207443609957147&amp;q=panetti+v+quarterman&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=40000006&amp;as_vis=1">Panetti v. Quarterman</a>. The Ford standard, which came out of a concurring opinion in that 1986 case, prohibits the execution of defendants who "'do not have the mental capacity to understand the nature of the death penalty and why it was imposed on them.'" <br />
	<br />
In 2007, the Supreme Court somewhat clarified the Ford standard in Panetti, concluding that to be competent to be executed, a prisoner must have a rational understanding of the State's reasons for execution. The Court explained that capital punishment does not serve its retributive goals if "the prisoner's mental state is so distorted by a mental illness that his awareness of the crime and punishment has little or no relation to the understanding of those concepts shared by the community as a whole."  </p>

<p>Thus, the competency issue in Dunn v. Madison centered on whether a defendant -- who due to mental incapacity does not remember the crime - has a rational understanding of the State's reasons for execution. Due to the deferential AEDPA standard, the Court concluded that neither Ford nor Panetti clearly required that a defendant remember the crime.  Thus, Dunn's habeas claim lost.</p>

<p>The Court stressed that it was not addressing the merits of the competency issue outside of the AEDPA deferential standard. It did note, however, that Madison did recognize that he was being put to death as punishment because he was convicted of murder; he just did not remember committing the murder.</p>

<p><u>Future Treatment of the Issue?</u></p>

<p>Although the Court's per curiam opinion did little to clarify the standard for competency to be executed, three of the Justices wrote a short concurring opinion stressing that the competency issue eventually needs to be addressed. Thus, in a non-habeas case, several of the Justices appear ready to resolve the question. </p>

<p>In addressing the merits of the issue in the future, the Court should consider the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1547916">underlying reasons for the ban on executing incompetent prisoners</a>.  Some of the oft-stated reasons for the ban, such as the fact that incompetent prisoners cannot adequately prepare to meet their Maker, rest on questionable legal policy grounds. For example, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1547916">some note</a> that it is questionable whether deterrence theory supports the ban. One could conclude that other possible murderers would be deterred just as much by the execution of an incompetent prisoner as by the execution of a competent murderer. </p>

<p>Arguably the most solid justification for the ban is grounded on retributive theory. The death penalty only serves retributive goals where prisoners rationally comprehend why they are being executed and understand how they deserve it.</p>

<p>Yet, where a defendant does not remember the crime, does the death penalty still serve punishment goals? The Player King in William Shakespeare's <a href="http://shakespeare.mit.edu/Tragedy/hamlet/hamlet.3.2.html">Hamlet</a> notes, "Purpose is but the slave to memory." And where there is no memory, purpose may not be served. More specifically, in the case of a defendant like Madison, who due to mental incapacity has no memory of the crime, the retributive purpose of the death penalty is not served.<br />
  <br />
<u>Mental Health and Capital Punishment</u></p>

<p>The issue in Dunn v. Madison highlights other problems with executing people with <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/mental-illness-and-death-penalty">mental illness</a>.  For example, the American Bar Association, the American Psychiatric Association, American Psychological Association, Mental Health America, and National Alliance on Mental Illness <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/crsj/DPDPRP/SevereMentalIllnessandtheDeathPenalty_WhitePaper.pdf">oppose the use of the death penalty</a> for prisoners with severe mental disorders or disabilities at the time of the crime.  Although some states have <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/states-ban-death-penalty-people-severe-mental-illness">contemplated barring the death penalty for such defendants</a> [PBS], no state yet has barred the execution of people with mental illness.  </p>

<p>Finally, in a separate concurring opinion in Dunn v. Madison, Justice Breyer provided another solution to the quandary created when courts are forced to ponder how much a prisoner must remember or understand before execution.  Referring to a <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-7955_aplc.pdf">problem he has repeatedly raised</a>, Justice Breyer stressed the fact that death row prisoners now spend "unconscionably long periods of time" on death row awaiting execution, and he called again on the Court to reconsider the constitutionality of capital punishment. <br />
 <br />
As Justice Breyer noted, it is not that unusual that the 67-year-old Madison has spent more than half his life on death row. With aging prisoners spending long periods of time on death row, courts are likely to have to face more and more questions about competency, mental and physical health, and the rationale for the death penalty.</p>

<p>Thus, ultimately, although the Court decided Dunn v. Madison based on the habeas standard, it left questions unresolved. In the future, the Court and legislatures will continue to have to wrestle with mental health and competency issues, as well as with how merely asking those questions may help undermine any remaining asserted justifications for capital punishment.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.adflegal.org/detailspages/biography-details/jeffrey-shafer">Jeff Shafer</a> of <a href="http://www.adflegal.org/">Alliance Defending Freedom</a>, discusses expression's reliance on context in light of <span class="casename"> Masterpiece Cakeshop </span> ...</p>

                <p>Two perpendicular lines: a cross. A church architectural committee asks a sculptor to design one for placement atop the steeple over its new sanctuary. Delighted, he agrees. The KKK admires the craftsmanship provided the church and asks the sculptor for the same design for use during its march in Skokie. Revolted, he declines.</p>

                <p>While the existence of social forms and practices that symbolically communicate are human constants, many of the particulars conveying those messages are historically contingent&#8212;and at times intensely contextual.</p>

                <p>Burning a flag would be just one more kind of fire, in a society without flags in its repertoire of political meaning-markers. But in modern American constitutional jurisprudence, burning a flag can qualify as <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2084618710761560217&q=texas+v+johnson&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">protected expression under the First Amendment&#8217;s speech clause</a>. If the context indicates, so can <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15235797139493194004&q=tinker+v+des+moines+independent+community+school+dist&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">wearing an armband</a>. Or silently <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8332999881059454410&q=hurley&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">walking in a parade</a>. Or playing the violin. So can refusing to do any of those things: The Supreme Court has found the First Amendment&#8217;s protection for individual freedom of mind to shield not only one&#8217;s speech, but also <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8030119134463419441&q=barnette&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">refusal to speak</a>. The state may not compel an individual &#8220;to utter what&#8217;s not in his mind.&#8221;</p>

                <p>May the state compel a Christian cake artist to design a custom cake celebrating a same-sex wedding? That question was <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2017/16-111_f314.pdf">argued</a> before the United States Supreme Court on Dec. 5 in the marquee case of <span class="casename">Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission</span>.</p>

                <p>Much of the controversy turns on whether the custom design of the cake for a same-sex couple&#8217;s celebration qualifies as expression under the First Amendment. If the Supreme Court rules that it is, the State of Colorado may be forbidden to compel Masterpiece Cakeshop owner Jack Phillips to design and fashion cakes for same-sex ceremonies if he creates cakes that celebrate marital unions.</p>

                <p>The wedding cake is an institution. It has long been the centerpiece of receptions celebrating the joining of husband and wife. It is a focal point and monument to the occasion that receives the ceremonial attention and admiration of guests. It is the object of a symbolic unity ritual that marks and orients the wedding reception. Its image represents and honors new nuptial union.</p>

                <p>When that iconic cake is relocated to celebrate a same-sex relationship, the expressive alteration is severe. That transfer conveys the message that the relationship of the same-sex celebrants can be and is a marriage, and should be lauded as such; that the relationship of husband and wife is irrelevant to the composition of marriage; that an institution binding together mother-father-child is inconsequential and justly erased from law; that orthodox Christian anthropology, theology, and ethics are false; and that marriage is not a natural and pre-political institution, but one more item subject to individual design and government manipulation.</p>

                <p>These messages Jack Phillips knows to be sacrilege, and his participation in the custom design of the sculpture that represents and ratifies those claims is morally forbidden him. Yet his adversaries assert that he faces no such predicament. The ACLU (representing the male couple joining the state in suing Jack in this case) dully describes the government coercion of his artistry on behalf of a celebration representing the renovation of marriage and family as merely requiring he sell &#8220;the very same product&#8221; he would design for husband-wife ceremonies. The very same?</p>

                <p>Context plays a decisive role in the meaning that attends symbols. A high-profile example of this dynamic is on display in New York at the site of the well-known Charging Bull statue near Wall Street. Provoked by the stock market crash in 1987, Italian immigrant and sculptor Arturo Di Modica devoted two years and a small fortune to constructing the sculpture, which he installed in the financial district in 1989. He intended that his art symbolize national optimism, strength, and resilience in the face of adversity. &#8220;My bull is a symbol for America. My bull is a symbol of prosperity and for strength.&#8221;</p>

                <p>Not anymore. That message has been replaced due to the change in Charging Bull&#8217;s context:  Its visual field has been invaded by another figure. In March of this year, State Street Global Advisors arranged the installation of a statue of a pig-tailed young girl defiantly postured with hands on hips facing the bull&#8212;which now threatens her. In such manner, Di Modica&#8217;s artistry has been co-opted to contribute to a new message about female empowerment against male dominance in the business and financial sectors.</p>

                <p>Di Modica implored the city to remove the statue of the young girl that has converted his sculpture&#8217;s positive and optimistic message into one of negativity and threat. (The Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/14/fearless-girl-statue-women-new-york-bull">reports</a> his attorneys&#8217; dry observation: &#8220;The idea for the bull was never to represent the possible trampling death of a small child.&#8221;)</p>

                <p>Messages&#8212;be they symbolic, spoken, written&#8212;yield their meaning through complex engagement with the features of spatial, cultural, and narrative environments. Their expressive significance can dramatically change upon contextual alteration. And notably, that alteration can do more than transform the message; audacious reassignments (for that reason) actually may raise the volume on the expressive quality of the appropriated symbol. (Note how formerly mundane pronouns have leapt to a stratospheric elevation in expressive significance upon their reassignment from bodies to minds.) Indeed, that very dynamic acutely impresses itself upon Jack Phillips as he contests the hijacking of his artistry to facilitate new messages about marriage that he devoutly opposes.</p>

                <p>The de-sexing of marriage represents the overthrow of an archetype anchoring a public understanding of human nature. It constitutes and manifests a cultural reorientation in precepts of anthropology, government, and related concerns that carry foreboding implications for the legal significance of the likes of motherhood, fatherhood, and kinship itself. Dislocating indications are already appearing.</p>

                <p>As marriage has become a contested concept, so also its symbols. From Jack Phillips&#8217; vantage, there is a world-description at stake in the placement of those symbols. It is an undiscerning or trivializing advocacy that would treat his conscientious stand against compelled speech as but a spiteful commercial denial, rather than an exercise of artistic integrity at the very heart of First Amendment concern.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnists Shaunee Morgan and John Peng of the University of Pennsylvania School of Law and Azadeh Shahshahani of <a href="https://projectsouth.org">Project South</a> discuss the need to recognize the growing violations surrounding detained immigrants on Human Rights Day...</p>
Institutions and governments across the world will celebrate the 70th Human Rights Day on December 10, commemorating the day in 1948 when the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Declaration forms the basis of core international human rights treaties to which the US is a signatory such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention Against Torture. These documents codify fundamental rights on due process and bodily integrity, aligned with US constitutional protections. But while the international community prepares to celebrate the Declaration and the moment when the world came together around universal values of human rights, immigrants whose daily lived experiences are a far cry from the pronouncements and declarations of "rights" will wake up in Stewart and Irwin County Detention Centers, two privately-owned and operated for-profit prisons in Georgia that house individuals in civil immigration proceedings.

Despite more than a decade of activism highlighting human rights violations at these detention centers (most recently the publication of a report, "<a href="https://projectsouth.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Imprisoned_Justice_Report-1.pdf">Imprisoned Justice: Inside Georgia Immigrant Detention Centers</a>" [PDF], by Project South and the Penn State Law Center for Immigrants' Rights Clinic), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has failed to take action and the list of violations grows longer every year. Immigrants detained at Stewart and Irwin, their loved ones, and advocates continue to wonder if the tenets of human rights or even basic considerations of human decency have any meaning in these centers. Officials at both facilities regularly deny immigrants their right to meet with attorneys, even those with pre-scheduled meetings; employ lengthy terms of solitary confinement as a means to punish and control the detained immigrants; fail to ensure adequate temperature control within the facilities, forcing immigrants to wear jackets and blankets during the winter months; and refuse immigrants sufficient and appropriate meals and predictable meal times, among other rights violations.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has repeatedly denied requests to investigate organizational practices and policies at the detention centers. Even after highly publicized incidents such as the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/16/us/ice-stewart-detention-center-death/index.html">suicide of 27-year-old Jean Jimenez-Joseph</a>, who had been held in solitary confinement for 19 days, ICE officials refused to review the systematic overuse of solitary confinement. Another man was <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/10/10/ice-immigrant-detainee-solitary-confinement-work-stoppage/">placed in solitary confinement</a> for 30 days for verbally complaining about the $1 per day immigrants are paid for their extensive labor. Wilhen Barrientos was held in solitary confinement for a week after reporting an incident of sexual assault and then again for 31 days, supposedly for having chickenpox, even though he had the disease as a child and was never given any medication during his confinement.

Extended solitary confinement can and does lead to prolonged and sometimes permanent negative socio-psychological and physical effects. In a <a href="https://ccrjustice.org/solitary-report">recent study</a> on the mental health consequences of solitary confinement, the Center for Constitutional Rights and Stanford University's Mental Health Lab concluded that solitary confinement leads many to develop mood symptoms consistent with major depressive disorder and social estrangement. Juan Mendéz, former Special Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment for the United Nations Human Rights Council, likened periods of solitary confinement beyond 15 days to torture and noted that where "the prison regime of solitary confinement fail[s] to respect the inherent dignity of the human person and cause[s] severe mental and physical pain or suffering, it amounts to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment." Despite international guidelines and ICE's own detention standards that prohibit the regular and punitive use of solitary confinement, particularly for extended periods of time, solitary confinement continues unabated within Stewart and Irwin, and in immigrant detention centers and nationally.

Beyond the overuse of solitary confinement, Stewart and Irwin officials are inattentive and uncooperative to immigrants' physical and medical needs. Nam Dieu, an elder Vietnamese immigrant detained at Stewart, is being refused access to medically-prescribed amounts of insulin to treat his diabetes. When concerned attorneys emailed ICE officials about increasing his insulin dosage, a local field officer replied that there was "no indication that he is not receiving appropriate medical care," despite the fact that his blood sugar now hovers at a level signifying severe hyperglycemia.

On International Human Rights Day, as the world gathers in self-congratulatory praise and gratitude for its commitment to the preservation of fundamental human rights, let us remember that our humanity is judged not by the profundity of our messages but by how we live our stated values. Every violation at these centers should serve as a reminder of the work that remains for government officials at DHS and ICE to do in ensuring that protecting human rights becomes not just a cause for a celebration, but the norm.

The strength of the international human rights framework is the universality and inalienability of rights. In every moment and in every context, governments are obligated to respect and protect people's rights, regardless of their migration status. The protection of human rights is even more important in remote places literally outside the purview of the public eye; places like Stewart and Irwin that are hundreds of miles away from the nearest metropolitan center. Seventy Georgia and national human rights organizations recently <a href="https://projectsouth.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Letter-to-Congress-Georgia-Detention-Centers.pdf">petitioned Georgia's Congressional delegation</a> [PDF] for a full investigation into the practices at Stewart and Irwin. Such an investigation would serve as an important first step toward realizing the promise of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, which is a lofty but unfulfilled set of ideals if it has no relevance to the experiences of those in our society least able to access its protection.

		<title>The Clash of Gun Rights and Federalism</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://law.umkc.edu/directory/faculty-directory/name/allen-rostron/">Allen Rostron</a> of the <a href="https://law.umkc.edu">University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law</a> discusses policy and constitutional concerns about the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, which would expand the right to carry concealed guns outside one's home state...</p><strong>F</strong>or years, liberals and conservatives have argued about how to strike the ideal balance between federal and state authority. While liberals have generally favored expansion of federal power, conservatives have called for states to be given more room to make their own decisions about difficult issues like civil rights, abortion, health care, marriage, and education. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr38/BILLS-115hr38rfs.pdf">The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017</a> [text, PDF] is a striking example of how easily the tables can turn. If enacted, this law would significantly reduce each state's authority to make its own decisions about how to regulate the carrying of concealed firearms.  The U.S. House of Representatives recently passed the measure by a <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll663.xml">vote of 231-198</a>, with conservative legislators voting to nationalize the issue and liberals contending that it should be left up to the states.</p>

<p><a href="https://americanconcealed.com/articles/second-amendment/states-that-allow-concealed-carry/">Every state</a> allows the carrying of concealed firearms to some extent, but the degree of regulation varies. In about a dozen states, people who carry concealed guns do not need to obtain any special sort of permit or license to do so.  In about thirty other states, permits are required but relatively easy to obtain. A small and shrinking bloc of liberal states, like California, Massachusetts, and New York, have much stricter requirements for permits.  </p>

<p>Each state also gets to decide whether to honor permits issued by other states.  For example, if a Michigan resident has a permit to carry a concealed gun in Michigan, is he allowed to carry a concealed gun while traveling in Texas?  Some states have opted to honor permits of all other states.  Some states are more selective and have reciprocity agreements with certain states and not others. And a handful of the nation's most liberal states do not honor any out-of-state permits, effectively banning concealed carry for visitors. </p>

<p>Under the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, reciprocity would become a national mandate rather than a state choice. Anyone who is legally authorized to carry a concealed gun in his home state would be allowed to carry a concealed gun in the other 49 states as well.  </p>

<p>This measure would dramatically undercut states' discretion about how strictly to regulate concealed firearms. For example, a state that has a very careful process for vetting applicants for concealed carry permits would be obligated to allow concealed carrying by visitors from states that have an extremely minimal process or even none at all. A state that requires extensive training on firearm safety would be obligated to allow concealed carrying by visitors from states that require little or no training.</p>

<p>Enacting this sort of nationwide reciprocity has long been a top legislative priority of the National Rifle Association, which claims the new law will eliminate the "<a href="https://www.nraila.org/articles/20171206/house-passes-concealed-carry-reciprocity/">confusing patchwork</a>" of state laws facing gun owners who want to carry concealed firearms while traveling.</p>

<p>While the NRA condemns it, that sort of variation among the state laws is one of the chief virtues of federalism. By dispersing power across fifty states rather than concentrating it all at the national level, the American system permits diverse policy approaches and encourages experimentation. As <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/448152/concealed-carry-reciprocity-federalism-state-issue">Robert Verbruggen</a> warned fellow conservatives, no matter how strongly they favor gun rights, they "should be wary of forcing their legislative preferences on unwilling states via federal decree."</p>

<p>Having won approval in the House, the bill is now before the Senate and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/us/politics/house-concealed-carry-guns-nra-reciprocity.html">seems unlikely</a> to draw enough support to overcome a Democratic filibuster. If the bill did become a law, it would be <a href="https://www.thetrace.org/rounds/concealed-carry-reciprocity-constitutional-challenges/">challenged</a> and courts would decide whether there is anything in the Constitution that authorizes the federal government to override state decisions about concealed firearms.</p>

<p>The Congressman who introduced the reciprocity bill <a href="https://www.congress.gov/crec/2017/01/03/CREC-2017-01-03-pt1-PgH47-9.pdf">asserts</a> that it is based on the Second Amendment. If supporters of the bill rely on that argument in court, they are likely to fail. The Supreme Court has not yet decided whether the Second Amendment provides a right to carry concealed firearms.  Although the majority opinion in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf">District of Columbia v. Heller </a>[opinion, PDF] noted that 19th-century courts generally upheld bans on concealed weapons, it is conceivable that the Court might nevertheless find that the Second Amendment includes some right to carry concealed firearms in public. But that would not be enough to justify Congress's enactment of the national reciprocity statute. Even if there is some right to carry concealed weapons, the Supreme Court is unlikely to say it is an absolute and unfettered right. Minimal requirements, like obtaining a permit or having some training, surely would still be allowed. And yet, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act undercuts even those sorts of minimal restrictions. For example, under the Act, a state that wants concealed gun carriers to have just a few minutes of gun safety training would be unable to impose that requirement on people who come from states with no training requirement. While Congress has some power to protect and enforce constitutional rights, cases like <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/521/507/">City of Boerne v. Flores</a> have made clear that the federal government does not have the power to enact legislation that infringes state authority merely because Congress thinks a constitutional right should be broader or stronger than the courts have found the right to be.</p>

<p>Perhaps realizing that the Second Amendment would be a precarious foundation, the drafters of the bill put in a back-up plan. The bill applies only to carrying concealed firearms that have "<a href="https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr38/BILLS-115hr38rfs.pdf">been shipped or transported in interstate commerce</a>."  Many federal gun control laws rely on a similar tactic, reaching only firearms that have moved in or otherwise affected interstate commerce.  Given how broadly courts have construed the federal power to regulate interstate commerce, that is likely to be a sufficient basis for the enactment of the national reciprocity law. But the hypocrisy here is extreme. As Professor <a href="http://joshblackman.com/blog/2015/02/15/is-the-constitutional-concealed-carry-reciprocity-act-constitutional/<br />
http://joshblackman.com/blog/2015/02/15/is-the-constitutional-concealed-carry-reciprocity-act-constitutional/">Josh Blackman</a> observed, "it is perverse that conservatives, who have for decades railed against an expansive commerce clause jurisprudence, would suddenly cite the commerce clause to advance gun rights."</p>

<p>Unhappy with the commerce argument, some scholars have come up with creative alternative justifications for the reciprocity law. <a href="http://www.stevesachs.com/HR38_SachsBarnettBaudeLtr_20170323.pdf">Some urged Congress</a> to rewrite the bill so that it would rely on the Constitution's Full Faith and Credit Clause. That provision requires each state to respect public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of other states, and it gives Congress the power to "prescribe the manner in which such acts, records, and proceedings shall be proved, and the effect thereof."  Does that empower Congress to force each state to honor all other states' decisions about concealed carry?</p>

<p>While interesting, the argument is a stretch. Final judgments rendered by courts have received strong protection under the Full Faith and Credit Clause. But states have not been constitutionally bound to honor out-of-state licenses to do things like practice law or medicine, go hunting or fishing, or get married. Licenses to carry concealed firearms would be no different. And if the obligation to give full faith and credit does not attach to such licenses, then Congress has no basis for prescribing the manner in which that obligation will be proven or the effect it will have. For the sake of an analogy, suppose you were told that three soldiers are to be honored for their bravery, and you've been assigned the task of prescribing the manner in which the awards will be bestowed and the effects that the awards  will have. No one would think that authorizes you to run out and confer honors on anyone other than the three chosen soldiers. In other words, the fact that Congress can prescribe the manner in which the full faith and credit obligation will function does not mean Congress can expand the category of things to which the full faith and credit obligation applies.</p>

<p>To be sure, there is a constitutional interest in preventing states from going too far in favoring their own residents over visitors. The privileges and immunities clauses and the implicit constitutional right to travel reflect this value. But rather than equalizing the treatment of residents and non-residents, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act would have the perverse effect of forcing states to favor visitors over residents. Under the Act, states that require their residents to be licensed or to have some training to carry concealed firearms would be forced to let visitors from other states carry concealed firearms without having any license or training.</p>

<p>In an era when Americans are sharply divided in so many ways, federalism can serve to moderate conflicts. Rather than battling over a single approach to take for the entire nation, people can agree to disagree and each state can go in the direction that it prefers. Congress should think hard about whether it is worth exacerbating the division over guns, already one of the nation's most polarizing Issues, for the sake of modestly expanding some people's ability to carry guns while traveling. Of all the problems faced by Americans today, having too little access to firearms seems like it would rank fairly low on the list of concerns. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Alireza Ranjbar of the Iranian Association for UN Studies discusses approaches to Iran's ballistic missile program under international law...</p>

<p>Before and after his election as president, Donald Trump has threatened the 2015 <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/iran-world-powers-reach-nuclear-agreement.php">Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action</a> (JCPOA) limiting Iran's ballistic missile ambitions. President Trump has also been trying to challenge and demote the achievements of that deal since the beginning of his presidency.</p>

<p>After taking office, President Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/10/president-trump-delegates-iran-sanction-powers-to-the-secretaries-of-the-state-treasury-and-homeland.php">transferred</a> the decision-making process regarding JCPOA to several cabinet secretaries. In harmony with the president, the House of Representatives as its first step against the JCPOA, passed <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1698/text">a bill</a> titled "Iran Ballistic Missiles and International Sanctions Enforcement Act" (the House Bill) on 30 October 2017 which might be passed by the Senate and signed by the President in the near future. </p>

<p>In addition to passing this kind of international law-related national legislation against Iran, the US has been inviting the international community, especially its allies, to perform in the same manner. Despite the fact that Iran's ballistic missiles program is designed for Iran's military defense, and is unrelated to the United States (and other countries) for determining its frameworks, the possibility of imposing unilateral sanctions against Iran's ballistic missile program (which is the main goal of the House Bill) is of questionable compliance with international law.</p>

<p>The first concept to consider is how Iran's ballistic missile program fits into the scheme of international law.  Although there is no consensus on what the general principles of international law are, sovereign equality is undoubtedly one of them. The principle of sovereign equality is one of the oldest and most fundamental principles of international law, tracing its origins to the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, and always has been respected by other governments. The importance of sovereign equality is even enshrined in the charter of the United Nations (UN), wherein Article 2(1) states that the organization "is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members." According to the "Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations," also known as UN General Assembly <a href="http://www.un-documents.net/a25r2625.htm">Resolution 2625</a>, the General Assembly of the UN reaffirms that:<br />
<blockquote>All States enjoy sovereign equality. They have equal rights and duties and are equal members of the international community, notwithstanding differences of an economic, social, political or other nature.</blockquote></p>

<p>Then, benefiting from most advanced weapons, the US cannot restrict other countries' rights to develop and research comparable weapon systems from the perspective of the sovereign equality.</p>

<p>While sovereign equality forms a basis for other rules, such as <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/en/case/143">state immunity</a>, one of the most crucial outcomes of sovereign equality is the right of self-defense. In fact, the right of self-defense, like state immunity, is rooted in the principle of the sovereign equality. UN General Assembly Resolution 2625 also noted some elements directly related to the right of self-defense including "[e]ach State enjoys the rights inherent in full sovereignty" and "[t]he territorial integrity and political independence of the State are inviolable" Self-defense is <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-vii/index.html">further recognized</a> as an "inherent right" of states according to the Article 51 of the UN Charter.</p>

<p>Self-defense, however, is not an unlimited right; any military action done in self-defense must be both necessary and proportionate to the threat at hand, <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/70/070-19841126-JUD-01-00-EN.pdf">according to</a> customary international law. As a recognized element of self-defense, proportionality serves a prominent role for the very existence of the Iran's missiles program since Iran is a country has been surrounded by notorious non-governmental armed organizations, such as Islamic State, the Taliban, Al-Qaeda, and so forth. In addition, Iran's political rivals in the international community, especially Saudi Arabia and Israel in the Middle East, already have been armed to the teeth by the US. These three countries (also main critics of the JCPOA and Iran missiles program), have the most mass destructive weapons and arsenals in scale and amount. According to <a href="https://www.sipri.org/research/armament-and-disarmament/arms-transfers-and-military-spending/international-arms-transfers">the latest research</a> conducted by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the US and Israel stand among top major arms exporters (US: #1; Israel: #10) and states with highest military expenditure (US: #1; Israel: #15). Additionally, Saudi Arabia is the second largest importer of arms after India. Furthermore, Israel has its own nuclear arsenal, and it is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/20/us-saudi-arabia-seal-weapons-deal-worth-nearly-110-billion-as-trump-begins-visit.html">officially confirmed</a> that the 2017 United States-Saudi Arabia arms deal is one of the biggest arms deals in history.</p>

<p>It is also worth mentioning that the territorial integrity of Syria, Palestine and Lebanon has been violated by Israel, and that Yemen has been attacked by Saudi Arabia. On the other side, after the Iran-Iraq War, Iran has not resorted to its military or directly engaged in any international armed conflict. </p>

<p>Obviously, taking advantages of available military mechanisms is the main means of self-defense. Therefore, depriving a country from its inherent right of self-defense is not acceptable and logical at all. In line with this argument, there are two worthy opinions against depriving a country from its inherent right of self-defense.</p>

<p>First, the ICJ, in its 1996 <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/en/case/95/advisory-opinions">advisory opinion</a> on "Legality of the Use by a State of Nuclear Weapons" confesses that:<br />
<blockquote>[T]he Court cannot conclude definitively whether the threat or use of nuclear weapons would be lawful or unlawful in an extreme circumstance of self-defence, in which the very survival of a State would be at stake.</blockquote> </p>

<p>Second, Bosnia and Herzegovina, in its <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/en/case/91/institution-proceedings">1996 application</a> concerning "Application of The Convention on The Prevention And Punishment of The Crime of Genocide" includes this request:<br />
<blockquote>(m) that Security Council <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/713(1991)">Resolution 713</a> (1991), imposing a weapons embargo upon the former Yugoslavia, must be construed in a manner that shall not impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the terms of United Nations Charter Article 51 and the rules of customary international law.</blockquote></p>

<p>While the ICJ did not follow that request put forward by Bosnia and Herzegovina, the UNSC implicitly accepted the argument and has not taken any actions against the Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>

<p>The criteria of the proportionality of self-defense, then, authorizes recourse to the attacks, of an equal or lesser amount than the initial attacks. In other words, Iran is at least able to develop its missiles program in proportion of the minimum level its neighbors have, especially, when considered in light of its position in the Middle East. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, Iran has been the subject of numerous rounds of UN sanctions for its weapons program, and a basis under international law to prevent its ballistic missile program has predated the JCPOA for decades.</p>

<p>Although the UN Charter states that there is no authorization for the "United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state or shall require the Members to submit such matters to settlement under the present Charter" but "application of enforcement measures under Chapter VII."</p>

<p>Under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, Iran has been the subject of intense sanctions for many years. After the JCPOA was approved, the UN Security Council lifted the sanctions in Resolution 2231. In accordance with the JCPOA and Resolution 2231, Iran is forbidden from possessing "ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology." <em>Contra rationem</em>, there is no limitation or prohibition for Iran to establish ballistic missiles programs designed to be capable of delivering non-nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>Iran's nuclear activities are observed by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). According to the JCPOA, the Director General of the IAEA is responsible for "the necessary verification and monitoring of Iran's nuclear-related commitments." Furthermore, the Director General also is required to prepare and render regular reports, or emergency reports in case the Director General "has reasonable grounds to believe there is an issue of concern directly affecting fulfillment of JCPOA commitments" to both the IAEA Board of Governors and the UNSC. Any violation of the JCPOA will be reported to the UNSC, who would then take the necessary steps to ensure compliance, even though Iran's commitment to the JCPOA is <a href="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/focus/iran">confirmed</a> by Director General of the IAEA so far.</p>

<p>Besides, there is also the <a href="http://disarmament.un.org/treaties/t/npt">Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons</a> (NPT) which restricts the sphere of influence of the Sovereign Equality related to the nuclear-related military development and research. Iran joined the NPT as well and declared to always respect the obligations therein.</p>

<p>From the foregoing, we can draw several conclusions regarding Iran's ballistic missile program and its relationship to international law:</p>

<p>1.	While the JCPOA was an innovation and strikes a balance between Iran's peaceful nuclear activities and international community's concerns, the US's aggressive acts against the JCPOA would lead to tear apart the peaceful and diplomatic mechanisms.</p>

<p>2.	The United States and other countries and entities cannot impose any sanctions and limitations against the Iranian missile program, unless they act in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. </p>

<p>3.	According to Article 103 of the UN Charter and Article 2 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, neither any other international agreement, nor national rules and acts of states, can undermine obligations of the members of the United Nations. So, the US could not invoke national reports and national policies for restraining Iran's missiles program and violate Resolution 2231 by its national legislation.</p>

<p>4.	Based on the principles of Sovereign Equality and the inherent right of self-defense, not only there are no limitations against military development and research of missiles but also it is an inherent right and this is necessary for the very existence of a country. </p>
