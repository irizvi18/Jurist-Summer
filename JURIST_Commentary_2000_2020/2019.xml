		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center">"What does not benefit the entire hive is no benefit to the bee."</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Marcus Aurelius, <em>Meditations</em></p>
Back at the World War I Armistice Day ceremonies in France in 2018, Emmanuel Macron <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-46168105">ventured</a> a well-reasoned condemnation of Donald Trump's belligerent nationalism. By describing the American president’s rancorous sentiments as a "betrayal of patriotism," the French president was urging everyone present to "reject the selfishness of nations...." To have been even more analytically specific in this correct assessment, Mr. Macron could have added certain further legal clarifications.

Most importantly, he could also have explained that any presumed nationalistic selfishness undermines every state’s national interests, including those of the presumptively self-centered nation.

Looking ahead to 2019, there are urgent lessons here for the entire legal community of nations. This means learning, among other things, that the apparent benefits of traditionally-defined patriotism can prove manifestly harmful, illegal and effectively unpatriotic. In essence, because the effect of individual states that persistently confuse belligerent nationalism with patriotism is the cumulative weakening of all states, it is high time for national security decision-makers in Washington to think more seriously and also jurisprudentially about "<a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2017/08/beres-america-first-policy/">America First</a>."

US President Trump's "America First" foreign policies undermine national and international law and are destined to fail. This starkly deleterious outcome is what observers should reasonably expect of superficial, non-historic and endlessly clichéd strategic thinking, a self-defeating process whereby tweets, primal chanting and thoroughly empty witticisms continuously threaten to supplant both law and "mind."

Sigmund Freud, while never directly concerned with the dynamics of world politics or international law, had examined such issues at the microcosmic or "molecular" level, that is, at the level of individual human beings. Looking over such psychologically focused examinations, his core conceptual understanding - that unfettered "liberty" among individual human beings must invariably lead to corrosive and presumptively zero-sum social conflicts - applies equally well to states. Accordingly, back at last year’s World War I memorialization ceremony, Emmanuel Macron's cautionary remarks (however unwittingly) represented a timely reaffirmation of Freud. Macron (unlike Trump) must have understood that if left alone to pursue their collective lives "patriotically"- that is, within the anarchic global state-of-nature that seventeenth century political philosopher Thomas Hobbes had famously called a "war of all against all" - the separate states would be forced to endure unmanageable conditions of a permanent war.

Amid any such palpable outcomes of ferocious global anarchy - a structure of irremediable disorder originally bequeathed at the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 - there could never arise any meaningful forms of world legal order. In this connection, special and still-expanding hazards would concern US President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from certain key elements of the authoritative non-proliferation regime in international law; his more-or-less corresponding <a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2018/11/beres-nuclear-treaty-termination/">withdrawal</a> from the July 2015 JCPOA multilateral nuclear pact with Iran; and his curiously blatant <a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2018/05/north-korea-nuclear-diplomacy-and-international-law/">disregard</a> for North Korea’s aggressive continuance of its destabilizing ballistic missile program.

Further recalling Thomas Hobbes <em>Leviathan </em>(1651, chapter XIII), the life of any states attempting to chase after narrowly nationalistic goals (what Donald Trump would today call "America First") must assuredly be "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short."

But how does one actually fix a system that is founded upon flagrantly erroneous notions of nationalism, patriotism and international law? How should well-intentioned states best plan their escape from the global state of nature, an escape that must be utterly indispensable? There are really just two defensibly coherent responses, and these need not even be mutually exclusive.

The first, and the most frequently recommended reaction, focuses on changing a perpetually anarchic context of world politics. Even before the formal appearance of academic World Order Studies back at Yale and Princeton in the 1960s, philosophers from Dante and Immanuel Kant to H.G. Wells, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, and Sri Aurobindo had already elaborated imaginatively on various configurations of world law.

The second response would take investigators back to the indisputable origins of the jurisprudential problem, that is, to always evident and undiminished imperfections of the individual human being. In this properly analytic posture, one that regards all world politics as epiphenomenal or as a manifestation of much deeper causes, the scholar's overriding emphasis must somehow be placed upon "fixing people." To be sure, if the first reaction could be reasonably critiqued as "unrealistic" or "utopian," the second qualifies even more plainly for such pejorative characterizations.

But how to actually proceed in Washington?

Analytically, the most promising answers will require a consciously transformational focus upon the individual human being, on the microcosm, and on his or her primary place in global rescue preparations. To be sure, our incessantly nationalistic state system remains incapable of serving humankind's most utterly basic security and justice obligations. Earlier, Friedrich Nietzsche had exclaimed in <em>Zarathustra </em>that the "state is the coldest of all cold monsters," a darkly accurate view later reinforced by Jose Ortega y' Gasset's corresponding observation that "the state is the greatest danger."

It is most urgent that the American president learn to supplant the relentlessly zero-sum aspects of world politics with more expressly legal visions of cooperation and "oneness." <em>Apropos of</em> such imperative learning, both scholars and policy makers would be well-advised to recall the uniquely special wisdom of Jesuit philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin: "The egocentric ideal of a future reserved for those who have managed to attain egoistically the extremity of `everyone for himself' is false and against nature."

This succinct but correct warning in <em>The Phenomenon of Man</em> now assumes especially powerful relevance regarding US President Donald Trump's <a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2018/06/us-foreign-policy-cant-ignore-human-rights/">corrosive emphases</a> on "America First." These <a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2018/07/us-abandoning-legal-obligations-in-syria/">retrograde emphases</a> are incompatible with any reasonably sought-after outcomes of world peace and justice. Instead, they point only to enlarging unwanted prospects for human insecurity and further human degradation.

There exist myriad connections between intra-national and inter-national legal processes. These indissoluble links suggest that "fixing states" could soon represent a vital intermediary step between fixing individual human beings and world legal order transformations. In American universities, which are increasingly given over to narrowly vocational forms of "education," we need to bring-back and even amplify "world order studies" as a designated legal field of academic inquiry.

In general, before humanity can achieve appropriately rule and value-based forms of global cooperation, there will first have to take place certain distinctly primary human changes. Although it may be premature to seek identification of a systematic and sequential inventory of such required changes, the core process needed is no longer ambiguous. This process willingly rejects the distracting delusions of a society given over to demeaning amusements (e.g., American society today) and accepts instead a genuinely challenging set of intellectual imperatives. Ultimately, any more forms of global legal cooperation – including eventually perhaps even global governance – demands dialogue not only among fractious nation-states, but also among individual human beings.

All this thinking can bring us back gainfully to Teilhard, to the immutable importance of <em>system: </em>"The existence of `system' in the world is at once obvious to every observer of nature.... Each element of the cosmos is positively woven from all the others." There are complementary "lessons" in Aristophanes' <em>Lysistrata </em>that conveniently recollect what used to be called "cosmopolitanism," or a determined ideology of global integration: "Then you should card it and comb it, and mingle it all/in one basket of love and unity,/Citizens, visitors, strangers, and sojourners - all the/entire, undivided community."

In the end, our true patriotic interests can be met only by cultivating a more unqualified legal loyalty to humankind in general. In turn, this rationally redirected loyalty, which would still likely be labeled "unpatriotic" within the separate states, will require an antecedent and robust global development of intellect or "mind." Such a development would be at definitional odds with any exaggerated expectations of populism. Absolutely nothing could be solved by further encouraging the increasingly empty virtuosity of technology and/or the consistently dreary mechanizations of daily life.

Ultimately, we need to suitably replace a recognizably false communion of nation-states – one that is time-dishonored, anti-legal and close to collapsing – with a reassuringly gentle and new harmony. When such an ambitious replacement is tangibly successful, or at least recognizably underway, we could finally take seriously the long-distant promise of Sigmund Freud. While the seminal psychologist was assuredly not focused on world legal order <em>per se</em>, he would nonetheless agree with the following: A greatly expanded or fully supplanting power of world legal order makes sense only if there can first be rejected an inwardly-rotten "balance-of-power" communion, one that is based on fear, trembling and perpetual dread.

There is one last summary observation, one pointing toward a potentially damaging barrier to all conceivably plausible iterations of human transformation. This "fly in the theoretic "ointment" is the problematic assumption of human rationality. Even before Freud, and especially in Dostoyevsky, Nietzsche and Kierkegaard, we may read purposefully about <em>human irrationality</em> as the all-too- frequent foundation of human behavior and political decision-making.

Though daunting, this literary/philosophic recognition of the "absurd" – <em>Credo quia absurdum;</em> "I believe because it is absurd" – must somehow be incorporated into all reasonably proposed programs for world legal order reform, however seemingly persuasive. Reciprocally, without such an indispensable incorporation, absolutely every otherwise carefully worked-out prescription for global "civilization" could sometime fail calamitously.

Back in 2018, French President Emmanuel Macron was correct that traditional nationalism can never be authentically patriotic. The main reason behind this accurate assessment and meaningful indictment of President Trump's "America First" is as follows: <em> Any true spirit of patriotism must inevitably recognize the essential singularity or "oneness" of our species and the corollary interdependence of all nation-states. </em>In the end, any promising forms of patriotism must finally and firmly acknowledge that (1) all human beings are legally interconnected; and (2) what cannot benefit the world legal system (the "hive") in its entirety can never benefit the separate sovereign state (the "bee") in its feigned singularity.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span>The cornerstone of military justice is ensuring that commanders at all levels, called convening authorities, do not influence the lawful carrying out of investigations and prosecutions of service members who violate the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Developed through customs of the service over two centuries and codified by Congress in the early 1950’s, the UCMJ has been a model for the rule of law ensuring America’s armed forces conduct themselves in a way that would not bring discredit to the United States or a service. It’s a system that works, ensuring all of the constitutional protections afforded American citizens are available to its fighting forces, with some exceptions.</span>

<span>Military justice is an important tool for commanders to ensure that US armed forces conduct themselves for the good order and discipline of the service. This is the sine qua non of the system: good order and discipline. Commanders are charged with this important duty.</span>

<span>Stung by the misconduct of mercenaries hired from Hesse in Germany by the British to fight during the Revolutionary War, America’s armed forces were created under the principles of customs of the service and good order and discipline. It is a proud tradition and a system that has worked for centuries overseen by a civilian US appellate court made up of five Senate confirmed judges. An Article 1 Court, the US Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces ensures the system comports with law, policy, tradition and the Constitution. One of its important duties is to monitor the possibility of any hint of unlawful command influence.</span>

<span>If unlawful command influence is found to have occurred during the creation of a court's martial proceeding, military appellate courts or the US Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces will reverse any conviction. Further investigation and follow-up administrative or judicial punishment may occur against any commander having even attempted to, or in fact, influenced a proceeding. It’s serious, and at a minimum, career ending for a commander. It rarely happens. Commanders know their duties vis a vis the UCMJ.</span>

<span>Recently, President Trump, as Commander in Chief of the armed forces of the United States (a commander under the UCMJ) <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2018/12/16/trump-says-hell-review-case-matt-golsteyn-special-forces-veteran-who-faces-murder-charge/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.b7cb2854eba4">declared</a> that a decorated special operations officer was being unfairly investigated/prosecuted for an alleged murder of an Afghan civilian. That is unlawful command influence.</span>

<span>This results in a potential miscarriage of justice. The appearance that the Commander in Chief is meddling in and trying to influence an outcome of a possible courts martial threatens the good order and discipline of the armed forces. This is contrary to the Presidents sworn constitutional duties. It also taints subordinate commanders' decisions on how to proceed -- either proceeding forward with a courts martial or not, their decisions will be suspect. Additionally, the alleged perpetrator of the crime will not receive the due process he rightfully is allowed and it prevents justice for the victim.</span>

<span>Another consequence is that the murder of a civilian or a combatant in custody of a party to a conflict is a war crime. As a signatory to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, the US is obligated to investigate and prosecute allegations of the laws of armed conflict under our law or if unable or unwilling to turn the case over to a nation who is willing. The President, the proverbial bull in a china shop, has skewed the entire paradigm contemplated under international law by his comments about the case.</span>

<span>Where this all goes or how it ends up remains to be seen. Commanders have an obligation to maintain good and discipline without any outside influence from higher commanders. The President has politicized the process and it is so inappropriate. </span>

<span>My sense is that the officer’s commanders will stick to the law and their duty to protect and uphold the Constitution of the country they are sworn to defend. They know their allegiance is to that Constitution, not the President. Something the President will never understand.</span>

<span>Should the matter proceed to trial, the judges will be mindful of the inappropriate comments by the Commander in Chief in their weighing whether unlawful command influence was applied and make the appropriate legal procedural call. As a former judge advocate, I have the confidence that they will.</span>

		<title>Court Decisions on LGBT Rights Echo ‘A Wild Wish’</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[More than two centuries ago Mary Wollstonecraft laid the foundations for feminist thought with a simple premise: lack of equal opportunity diminished individual self-worth and hobbled social progress. In <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em> (1792), Wollstonecraft made a “wild wish” for equality between the sexes. When women are treated as less than equal in law and society, she argued, it affects not only the practicalities of everyday life, but encroaches on autonomy, dignity and agency.

Her arguments apply today to people marginalized by prevailing social norms, including those who do not conform to sexual and gender stereotypes. It is these same issues – autonomy, dignity, equality and agency – that were addressed in 2018 in three landmark court judgments in India, Trinidad and Tobago, and Guyana.

These decisions – each one striking down discriminatory laws – herald new legal dispensations and life possibilities for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in these countries. But the judgments go much further than striking down archaic and discriminatory laws. They trace ignoble colonial histories, highlight the negative impact on individuals and society, and seek avenues for redress. In doing so they draw on and develop jurisprudence from countries in the global South, each grappling with the legacy of colonialism.

It is not often that a judgment reflects on the meaning of human existence and the nature of desire, but the long-awaited <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2018/09/india-supreme-court-decriminalizes-gay-sex/">decision</a> of the Indian Supreme Court, handed down in September, did so, poetically. The court drew on literature, philosophy, social science, queer theory and individual testimony to invalidate Section 377 of India’s penal code, which punished “carnal intercourse against the order of nature” with 10 years to life in prison. In doing so, the court upheld individual autonomy, equality, privacy and dignity, stating that “homosexuality is a completely natural condition, part of a range of human sexuality.”

The decision rejected the idea that individual lives should be limited by “the bondage of dogmatic social norms, prejudiced notions, rigid stereotypes, parochial mindsets and bigoted perceptions.” It railed against the “tyranny of the majority” and reasserted the role of the court as a “threshold against an upsurge in mob rule.” By using “constitutional morality” to protect minorities against “societal morality,” the courts protect freedom for all: “Our ability to survive as a free society will depend upon whether Constitutional values can prevail over the impulses of the time.”

The India judgment references a broad sweep of comparative law from around the world, including Belize, Canada, Colombia, Ecuador, Fiji, Hong Kong, Nepal, South Africa, Trinidad and Tobago, the US and the United Kingdom. Invoking the “sodomy” laws as a residual “yoke” of British rule, the court declared that “history owes an apology to the members of this community and their families, for the delay in providing redressal for the ignominy and ostracism that they have suffered through the centuries.” The Indian Penal Code served as a template for similar laws imposed throughout the British Empire. Its demise will register globally; it is already referenced in a legal challenge to a similar Kenyan law and is inspiring a new challenge to Singapore’s colonial sodomy law as well.

The High Court in Trinidad and Tobago similarly <a href="http://webopac.ttlawcourts.org/LibraryJud/Judgments/HC/rampersad/2017/cv_17_00720DD12apr2018.pdf">ruled</a> sections of the Sexual Offences Act that criminalize “buggery” and “serious indecency” unconstitutional, pointing out that – even when dormant – these laws send a message that “society hates homosexuals.” The judgment asserted the rights of individuals, including members of unpopular groups, above vague concepts such as tradition and religious morality. The court stated: “this is a case about the dignity of the person and not about the will of the majority or any religious debate.” The court also reflected that it was unfortunate when individual traits of race, gender, age, or sexual orientation were used as yardsticks to measure worth: “That is not their identity. That is not their soul.” In coming to these conclusions, judges referenced foreign precedent from courts in South Africa, Nepal, Fiji and Belize.

In November, the Caribbean Court of Justice <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2018/11/guyana-cross-dressing-ban-ruled-unconstitutional/">struck</a> down as unconstitutional a 125-year-old law against cross-dressing for an “improper purpose.” This law had been used disproportionately against transgender women in Guyana. The court traced the origins of the law, part of a suite of laws against vagrancy, to the coercive labor practices imposed in the aftermath of slavery and rejected them as relics of an oppressive past. The primary objective of vagrancy laws was to restrict mobility and force former slaves back to plantations as a way of maintaining a steady supply of cheap labor.

The court found that the law violated fundamental rights to equality, non-discrimination and freedom of expression. It condemned the role of gender stereotypes in restricting gender equality and individual self-determination. Pointing out that “[l]aw and society are dynamic, not static,” the court asserted the value of tolerance for individuals and society as a whole, recalling that “[t]oday’s heresy may easily become tomorrow’s gratefully embraced orthodoxy.” In this the court echoes the prescient insights of the feminist frontrunner Wollstonecraft and her wild wish:
<blockquote>A wild wish has just flown from my heart to my head, and I will not stifle it, though it might excite a horse-laugh. I do earnestly wish to see the distinction of sex confounded in society, unless where love animates the behaviour.</blockquote>
Taken together, these landmark judgments go to the heart of how restrictive and discriminatory laws harm individual lives and hamper social progress. When free expression is denied, said the Caribbean Court of Justice, “On the one hand, the human spirit is stultified. On the other, social progress is retarded.”

		<title>Take Care That the Laws be faithfully Executed - A Manufactured National Emergency</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The President only has two enumerated constitutional duties, to be the Chief Executive of the Executive Branch and be Commander in Chief of the Armed forces during time of war. That is it. His oath in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii">Article II of the Constitution</a> requires him to protect and defend that Constitution. Additionally, he is constitutionally bound to take care that all laws be faithfully executed given to him by the Legislative Branch which is charged to make all laws necessary and proper to carry out the enumerated powers listed in the Constitution for all branches of the federal government.

The President has both explicit and implied powers to take care that those laws be faithfully executed. He can only exercise power granted to him by the Constitution and the Legislative Branch. He cannot make law and has no plenary power domestically save for invasion and insurrection. As Head of State, he does have broader, even plenary power, overseas. Even then, he is bound by the parameters, in large part, of international law.

There is clear and specific dicta, precedent and rulings regarding the above by the Supreme Court of the United States. Though the Judicial Branch defers greatly in the exercise of national security powers by the two political branches, the Executive and Legislative branches, they make it very clear that a President cannot step away from the clear confines of the Constitution. Justice Robert Jackson in his famous concurring opinion in “<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14460863599772421355&amp;q=Youngstown+Sheet+%26+Tube+Co.+v.+Sawyer&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39">The Steel Seizure Case</a>” stated that without the support of the Legislative Branch a President is acting weakest in the use of executive power.

It is important to note that federal power to govern is strictly limited to the enumerated powers in the first three articles of the Constitution. The <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/tenth_amendment">Tenth Amendment</a> to our Constitution clearly and unambiguously states that all powers not enumerated in the Constitution are reserved to the States or to the people. Almost all power to govern domestically is with the various States, who are separate and sovereign entities under our federated Republic. Federal power is limited and enumerated within the parameters of the Constitution.

National emergencies are within the executive powers of a President if given that power by the Legislature. Should a President act under that power granted under law, such as in the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/chapter-34">National Emergencies Act</a>, he is taking care that the laws be faithfully executed. Acting outside of the act, he is constitutionally weakened and perhaps breaking the law. Throughout history Presidents have acted in actual or perceived emergencies such as, the Whiskey Rebellion, the War of 1812 and the invasion of the United States by Great Britain; the Civil War; the Pullman Strike; the Korean War; as well as the so called “war on terror” precipitated by the 9/11 attacks. These were in fact emergencies.

Given all this, are we about to see the current President declare a national emergency along the southern border allowing him to take executive action such as building a wall?  He can declare a national emergency for whatever reason, but that rationale will most assuredly be reviewed by a federal court. That court will consider the enumerated powers of the Executive, his role domestically in exerting executive power vis a vis the Constitution and federal laws, the historical use of those powers, legal precedent (to include the clear guidance by the Supreme Court related to that power), and then apply the facts.

Given the facts, and applying the law, the President will ultimately <em>fail </em>in his politicized attempts to build his wall. A court will give great weight to the President’s declaration of a national emergency. The court may even defer to his judgement, as the Supreme Court in several rulings has stated that it will not get involved in political decisions particularly related to national security.

In this instance though, a federal court will look to the law and the factual underpinnings of the declaration and find that there is no national emergency that was earlier contemplated by historical and legal precedent. The President is not taking care that the law be faithfully executed, as there is factually no emergency. The court will state that a President has limited domestic power absent an invasion or insurrection. This manufactured crisis to get around legislation he disagrees with does not come close to an emergency and a federal court will most likely not defer to the President related to this “national security issue”.

The beauty of our Constitution is that it does not place the power to govern in any one person, but distributed that power throughout the three branches of government, all three being co-equal. They can each constitutionally check the improper use of that governmental power. We will see this play out when all three branches of our government flex their constitutional muscle in clarifying the power of a sitting President to declare a national emergency as it relates to our southern border.

I predict that the federal court, perhaps ultimately the Supreme Court, will once again note that a President has a right to protect and defend the United States, but the right is enumerated by the Constitution and law. The federal court will then rule that based on the facts presented that there is no national emergency contemplated by law and his enumerated powers and declare the action by the President unconstitutional. A ruling such as this protects Executive power in times of crisis and national emergency, yet stops this “national emergency declaration” by this President as it is factual unsound.

As Justice Black stated in his majority opinion in the “Steel Seizure Case” (in declaring that an Executive Order by President Truman during the Korean War was unconstitutional): <em>In the framework of our Constitution, the President’s power to see that the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea he is a lawmaker. The Constitution limits his functions in the lawmaking process to the recommending of laws he thinks wise and the vetoing of laws he thinks bad.  </em>

This President cannot ignore the law or pending legislation and go around the will of the Legislature. There is no national emergency to declare nor is there an invasion or insurrection. The current President is operating outside his enumerated powers given by the Constitution and federal law. He should heed the clarion call of our Constitution that he is bound to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. If the President truly declared a national emergency for political gain and purpose, he is not faithfully executing the law. My bet is on the Constitution and our federal courts that they will so rule.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When the Delhi High Court <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2018/12/india-court-sentences-former-parliamentarian-to-life-in-prison-for-orchestrating-1984-riots/">sentenced</a> a former parliamentarian to life in prison for his role in the 1984 anti-Sikh pogrom in December, it ended an excruciating 34-year ordeal for victims of the hate crime that shook India’s national conscience and threatened to tear apart its social fabric. Spurts of sectarian violence are not uncommon in India, and religious minorities are often the victims of rampaging lynch mobs that enjoy the patronage of powerful individuals and groups. Judges Muralidhar and Goel discerned a “familiar pattern” of religious violence, referring to ghastly episodes of mass violence such as the 1993 riots in Mumbai and the Gujarat riots of 2002. Common to these mass crimes were “the targeting of minorities” in attacks “spearheaded by the dominant political actors being facilitated by the law enforcement agencies,” the judgment read.

The judges’ observations are illustrative of what many in the country believe are loopholes and inadequacies in Indian criminal law. Investigations are shoddily conducted, and perpetrators are often let off for want of evidence. Trials dragging on for decades on end leave little room for justice and serve as cruel reminders for families of victims seeking closure. The criminal justice system’s ineptitude in such matters is scarcely reconcilable with the need for the law to be a deterrent and only serves to embolden individuals and groups out to orchestrate carnage.

At present, religious (or communal, as it is called in India) violence attracts charges under the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Chapter VIII of the IPC pertains to offenses against public tranquility and individuals accused of rioting are charged under provisions such as Section 147 and Section 153A. Murder draws penal sanction per Section 302. Suffice it to say, these are very general and too lethargically invoked in practice for them to serve as deterrents against mass killings of the 1984 ilk. The need of the hour is legislation enabling the creation of special tribunals for the specific offenses of crimes against humanity and genocide. The Delhi High Court judgment highlighted the desirability of special laws when it termed the absence of domestic laws on crimes against humanity and genocide a “loophole” to be “addressed urgently.”<span>  </span>

India’s constitution, under Article 21, guarantees the right to life and liberty. An individual’s right to be protected from mass violence cannot be divorced from any reasonable understanding of India’s constitutional values and the fundamental rights enshrined therein. Article 51(c) makes it incumbent upon the state to foster respect for international law and treaty obligations. India has signed and ratified the Genocide Convention, which declares in Article I that genocide, whether committed in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime under international law, which the contracting parties “undertake to prevent and to punish.” Article V makes it obligatory for contracting parties to enact the necessary legislation to give effect to the provisions of the convention. There is a conventional and customary international law obligation on the Indian state to both prevent and punish mass killings amounting to genocide.

The International Court of Justice in its 2007 judgment on the Application of the Genocide Convention (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), ruled that “if an organ of the state, or a person or group whose acts are legally attributable to the state, commits any of the acts proscribed by Article III of the Convention, the international responsibility of that state is incurred.” States cannot absolve themselves of blame when individuals wielding the proverbial stick of the state’s power and authority misuse their positions to encourage, either tacitly or explicitly, mass killings and other genocidal acts. Equally, the state mustn’t remain a passive spectator; it has a responsibility to protect the lives of its citizens and residents. Enacting effective special laws on crimes against humanity and genocide would demonstrate to the world in no uncertain terms that India is serious about its international law obligations and is committed to securing human rights.

An effort to legislate against religious violence was made in 2005 when the interior ministry introduced the <a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Doc-1-Communal-violence-bill-2005.pdf">Communal Violence (Prevention, Control and Rehabilitation of Victims) Bill</a> in the upper house of parliament. The bill sought to provide for the prevention and control of religious violence, an expedited investigation and trials process, and the rehabilitation of victims. Special courts were also to be established. The bill was referred to a parliamentary standing committee, which presented a <a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Doc-2-Standing-Committee-Report-Communal-Violence-Bill-2006.pdf">report</a> in December 2006. One of the suggestions made by the standing committee was the inclusion of genocide, as a crime against humanity, to clause 2 of the bill.

Unfortunately, the bill never saw the light of day and was eventually withdrawn in February 2014, just a few months after the 2013 riots in Uttar Pradesh’s Muzaffarnagar. According to <a href="http://ncrb.gov.in/StatPublications/CII/CII2016/pdfs/Table%201.2.pdf">data</a> from the National Crime Records Bureau, India saw 66,378 cases of rioting or offenses “promoting enmity between different groups” in 2014.

There were 65,679 cases in 2015 and 62,452 in 2016. Admittedly, most of this violence is not inter-religious and more often than not, does not see people getting killed. However, a substantial portion of it is religious violence, and according to an interior ministry <a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Doc-3-religious-violence-data.pdf">report</a> tabled in parliament, there were 644 “incidents” of religious violence in 2014, 751 in 2015 and 703 in 2016, which resulted in 278 deaths.

While there seems to be little chance of the legislature enacting laws on genocide and crimes against humanity anytime soon, there is a silver lining. The judiciary has sounded the clarion call by acknowledging that mass crimes of a genocidal nature have been committed. In November, a district court in Delhi <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2018/11/india-court-delivers-death-sentence-over-1984-pogrom/">sentenced</a> a man to death for his role in the 1984 violence. The judge said, “victims of mass genocide” cannot be left in the lurch, and that fair trials are necessary. That even the lower judiciary is taking note of the gravity of the crime of genocide is an encouraging sign, and one hopes that the legislature will see a reason to do the same in the future.

		<title>Confidence Not Complacency Regarding the Human Rights Challenges in Yemen and the UAE</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left">The ends should not justify the means when it comes to the protection of basic human rights in Yemen and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Severe challenges to the peace and stability of these regions along with overarching transnational terrorism threats have incentivized the erosion of human rights by the respective governments. These challenges are well-documented in press reporting, and in the lived experiences of two participants in <span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tushJaeLSzo">my recent discussions at the American Society of International Law.</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><span><a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2018/11/uae-pardons-british-citizen-who-had-been-sentenced-to-life-in-prison/">Matthew Hedges</a></span>, a 31-year-old Durham University PhD student, was held in solitary confinement for seven months in the UAE after being accused of spying for the U.K. government. These accusations were based on nothing more than mere supposition and space would not permit full recitation of his suffering. Dr. Lauren Minsky, Professor at NYU-Abu Dhabi, also experienced similar maltreatment. Instead of enjoying the academic and intellectual freedom guaranteed as a term of her employment, Dr. Minsky instead suffered intimidation and censorship under the UAE auspices. Instances of maltreatment like that suffered by Dr. Minsky are not uncommon in these regions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Domestic laws ostensibly designed to protect the public that simultaneously provide valid reasons for the abuse of basic human rights and the degradation of human dignity cannot be ignored. Harnessing domestic judicial systems to empower such violations represents the <em>sine quibus non</em> of systematic human rights violations. This pattern of abuse is far too common in the region, representing the capstone of a coordinated suppression of fundamental human rights.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Sovereign nations have the absolute right to enact and enforce laws that are the best-suited to protect their citizens and defend legitimate interests. All nations enjoy these prerogatives. This legitimate duty of the state to protect the common good operates in healthy friction with the concurrent obligations to uphold human rights and the dignity of persons within the ambit of state power.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">The UAE has ignored this friction in pursuit of domestic counter-terrorism efforts during the conflict in Yemen. The Saudi and the UAE-led coalition has isolated and degraded Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, while sharply curtailing the extent of Houthi/Iranian influence in Yemen. These salutary ends do not always justify the means. Documented reports of enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions, erosion of basic human rights and the subversion of rights under <a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl/WebART/375-590006">Common Article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions</a> tell that sad tale.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">These issues represent a thicket of complex legal concerns. The actions of the UAE security and proxy forces are diagnostic in documenting human rights violations. Routine denials by the UAE officials do not dispel these difficult truisms. Though various violations have been misreported, the majority of these reports are legitimate and cannot be readily discounted. As former Secretary Mattis noted in his <a href="https://admin.govexec.com/media/gbc/docs/pdfs_edit/2018_11_28_-_senate_yemen_briefing_-_as_prepared_(final).pdf">November 2018 comments</a> regarding the Yemen conflict, we must not become complacent in confronting evil in the region. By extension, the coalition and human rights organizations must remain diligent in dissecting and in documenting reported human rights violations.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">The difficulty lies in the complex connection between various intersecting bodies of laws. While the laws and customs of war do precisely overlap with the laws of state responsibility, less overlap exists with the prevailing juridical approaches to the protections of basic human rights. The ends do not justify the means, yet experts and policymakers must work together to disaggregate these competing legal strands. This is the crux of a new effort underway by the Proxy War Project of the American Bar Association.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">We need to reconcile the gap between these legal regimes, human rights obligations and the experiences of people on the ground. The lived experience of citizens is often the best measure in an otherwise esoteric – maybe even quixotic quest for human rights. There is some incremental progress being made, but more must be done. In particular, allies of Saudi Arabia and the UAE must remain diligent in both reporting and reviewing human rights investigations. Credible and good faith work must be reinvigorated in order to ensure “allegations” remain undocumented and unaddressed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">States should also re-examine the overlapping statutory and treaty-based frameworks for counter-terrorism, as well as the rights of collective self-defense. Gaps in understanding and application of domestic laws should not be misinterpreted to justify human rights violations.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Finally, policymakers and attorneys should admit to the recurring nature of these tensions. The Lomé Peace Agreement comes to mind. The best practices and accumulated wisdom should be torqued to provide a fulcrum to facilitate a fragile peace in Yemen. Many talking heads and external “experts” will seek to address the issues in Yemen in a sanitized vacuum. Human rights abuses at home bleed over into similar abuses abroad. The two cannot and should not be divorced. As Eleanor Roosevelt wrote, we must do what we know to be right because we will be “criticized anyway.” Respect for human rights and the worth of every UAE citizen will be the cornerstone in reinforcing the quest for a sustainable peace settlement in Yemen.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In January 2018, following the killing of Iranians in European countries, the EU <span><a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2019/01/eu-imposes-sanctions-on-iran/">imposed new sanctions</a></span> on Iran. This came after the Trump administration imposed sanctions on Iran after withdrawing from the <a href="https://www.state.gov/e/eb/tfs/spi/iran/jcpoa/">Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action</a> in August 2018. The International Court of Justice then issued a decision ordering the United States to <span><a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2018/10/icj-orders-to-us-to-lift-iran-sanctions-on-humanitarian-goods/">lift the sanctions</a></span> linked to humanitarian trade, food, medicine, and civil aviation on the basis of the 1955 US-Iran Amity Treaty. This led the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, to state on <span><a href="https://twitter.com/JZarif/status/1052638354733436928">Twitter</a></span> that the sanctions disregarded Iranians’ human rights.

Iran is one of the countries with a long-standing history of international sanctions. The country has been impacted by three types of sanctions: United Nations sanctions, European Union comprehensive multilateral sanctions and United States unilateral sanctions. The impact of these sanctions on Iranian citizens’ human rights is under-estimated. Yet, decades of sanctions have had a deep effect on people’s lives and on society, as illustrated by the ongoing twitter testimonies found under the hashtag “<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=TargetingOrdinaryIranians&amp;src=typd">TargetingOrdinaryIranians</a>.”

The renewal of sanctions against Iran raises the necessity of examining the human rights’ impact of such restrictive punishments. The main question at hand is to understand why the international community seems to support sanctions despite the violations of human rights law. How far are states ready to go when violating human rights in the name of controlling the Iranian authorities, with perhaps, the goal of changing the governance system in place?

In 1996, <span><a href="https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/fss_papers/877/">Reisman observed</a></span> sanctions rarely reach their targets – the political and military elite – and deeply impacted the population in Haiti. It is indeed impossible to separate sanctions from their economic and social impact on a population. <span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022343312456224?journalCode=jpra&amp;">Studies demonstrate</a></span> sanctions have the same effect as war. This is why the Iranian authorities have focused on denouncing the sanctions on human rights grounds. Gholamali Khoshroo, Iran’s representative to the United Nations, <span><a href="https://www.presstv.com/detail/2018/10/15/577121/khoshroo-iran-us-sanctions-un">stated sanctions</a></span> were morally wrong and violate basic human rights.

Javaid Rehman, the UN special rapporteur for Iran, also <span><a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2018/10/un-rights-expert-iran-should-emphasize-human-rights-in-response-to-social-challenges/">noted the impact</a></span> the sanctions have on the population. The UN special rapporteur also commented on the negative effect of unilateral coercive measures. <span><a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=23469&amp;LangID=E">Idriss Jazairy said</a></span>:
<blockquote>These unjust and harmful sanctions are destroying the economy and currency of Iran, driving millions of people into poverty and making imported goods unaffordable […] The current system creates doubt and ambiguity which makes it all but impossible for Iran to import these urgently needed humanitarian goods. This ambiguity causes a ‘chilling effect’ which is likely to lead to silent deaths in hospitals as medicines run out[.]</blockquote>
The rapporteurs are correct to point out the human rights’ violations. The right to health is currently being breached. Iran has developed a public insurance coverage, the <em>bimeh</em>, which has been unable to provide full coverage due to the economic impact of the sanctions. As a result, the poorest cannot have access to full medical services. Citizens who can afford private healthcare insurance have seen the list of services covered drastically reduced. As a result, Iranians are converging towards a saturated and impoverished public health system. Other health ramifications are difficult to quantify, for example, suicides or addiction as a result of job loss.

Past and current sanctions have breached the right to life. The sanctions have caused a major disruption to the distribution of medical supplies and medicine. <span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016885101500216X">Individuals have struggled</a></span> to buy the relevant medicine to treat life-threatening diseases like cancer. Some have tried to buy cheaper medicine online or on the black market, often with disastrous outcomes. While no statistics are available, it is clear that Iranians have died as the result of the lack of available medicine. The sanctions have also made it impossible to buy pieces for aircrafts or cars. As a result of the lack of proper engineering support, two planes crashed in early January 2019.

The right to food is also limited as prices soar. Meat and fruits have become a luxury. The development of a black market means that the most vulnerable individuals cannot buy some food while the elite may purchase whatever. The sanctions also bear on fertilizers so crops have not been producing enough, making Iran even more dependent on imports blocked by sanctions. This happens at a time of severe drought caused by climate change stressing the need to take care of the water system and sanitation facilities. However, this impossible without the relevant engineering pieces. This, in turn, impacts the right to development.

Education is also struck. In rural areas, children must contribute to labor rather than attend schools or are unable to purchase school books and any other relevant educational material due to their price. The sanctions have also <span><a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/01/iran-students-sanctions-impact-banks-europe-us-visa.html">impacted Iranians abroad</a></span> as illustrated by the inability of students to pay their university fees or individuals who are being de-risked through the freezing of a bank account.

Women’s rights are also impacted by the sanctions. Urban women recently have been empowered through work and were pushing back the age of marriage and child-bearing. This fragile uprising is now threatened as women are either unable to find work or are the first ones dismissed during slews of layoffs. The conservative leaders then use the economic situation to justify new laws on family or work that limit women’s contribution to the public sphere as well as their presence in society.

Iran is also host to one of the largest refugee communities in the world. As the authorities are unable to provide for their own, they have cracked down on refugees to ensure their prompt departure, fuelling in part the migration towards Europe.

The right to work is also at stake as many citizens have lost their jobs. In November 2018, workers at a sugar cane plant in Ahvaz went on strike due to unpaid wages. The economic <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/04/world/middleeast/iran-protests.html">crisis has caused protests</a></span>, sit-ins, and demonstrations leading to internal tensions. The authorities have responded by arresting some of the trouble-makers to lessen chances minorities or woman would join the protests. Although women and minorities’ have protested, such popular movements are still marginal.

Consequently, the over-whelming blow of sanctions effects mostly the vulnerable: children, women, refugees, the insolvent, people with disabilities, the infirm, and minorities. It is therefore clear and evidenced that the sanctions are impacting the human rights of Iranian citizens.

However, the right to self-determination of the Islamic Republic of Iran is also at stake, as the sanctions are partly aimed at controlling the nuclear production but also at punishing Iran for its human rights record, with the goal of a regime change. Perhaps the international community believes if Iranians use their civil and political rights to protest the economic crisis, it could lead to a regime change. This is a misunderstanding of the importance of economic and social rights in Iran at the present time. The clash between human rights ideals undermines political efforts at changing the governance system.

The sanctions thereby openly advocate for interference, which has been <span><a href="https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/ilj/vol22/iss2/7/">labeled the new imperialism</a></span>. This belief is strengthened by the inability of the authorities to respect human rights as stated in the Iranian constitution (right to life, right to food, gender equality…) due to external obstruction. In such a context, human rights become a luxury, raising doubts about their universality. How can human rights be universal when they are used to coerce a country into forfeiting its sovereignty, thereby supporting a foreign power’s political agenda? It is a double standard practice the Iranian authorities have long complained about.

Overall, the human rights’ violations of the Iranians living under sanctions illustrate why the United Nations Food Programme has <span><a href="http://www.ijhpm.com/article_3454_413e7c40127a45913385d0def29682a6.pdf">called sanctions “brutal instruments.”</a></span> It is the powerless and the voiceless citizens that are struck first in the name of human rights. Some scholars and practitioners argue that sanctions will bolster human rights, while the impact is clearly that of a violation of economic and social rights. This is not a schizophrenic attitude towards human rights if one considers the overall aim of the sanctions is to ensure a change of regime that would hopefully respect human rights. This, therefore, creates a double standard, where the United States and the European Union can use international human rights law to criticize the Islamic Republic while simultaneously breaching Iranian citizens’ rights. It begs the question of “which” human rights standards are applicable to Iranians? Should Iranians be punished for a system that exists above and beyond them?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Thomas Jefferson is reported to have said: "When government fears the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny."

I have investigated and prosecuted dictators and their henchmen for most of my professional life. I have studied their lives, personalities, their rise to power and how they governed once achieving that power. The one common theme in their theories of governance is fear. It is easier to govern and dictate to citizens through fear.

As Hannah Arendt wrote in her book, The Origins of Totalitarianism: "A fundamental difference between modern dictatorships and all other tyrannies of the past is that terror is no longer used as a means to exterminate and frighten opponents, but as an instrument to rule masses of people who are perfectly obedient." The infamous dictators of the twentieth century, such as Stalin, Hitler, and Mao Tse-tung among others, understood this all too well. Their theory was that a frightened populace will allow their government to take drastic measures to protect them without protest, usually from perceived evil that threatens their society or country externally.

This object, person or peoples, religion or culture which focuses their fear is what I call their boogeyman. These boogeymen threaten their way of life and only the men in power have the capacity to address the threat. In a perverse way they tell their frightened citizens "We may have to take away your liberties, even kill some of you, to protect you from that boogeyman." Over ninety million of those frightened citizens died at the hands of their own dictatorial governments in the twentieth century.

As the twentieth century morphed into the twenty-first century mankind pushed back and began to hold dictators, tyrants, and thugs accountable. With the advent of modern international criminal law, mankind created international courts and tribunals, which include a permanent <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/">international criminal court</a>, to seek justice for victims of those who rule by fear. This movement lasted around twenty-five years. This age of accountability is wavering today.

With a rapidity that was shocking, this age of accountability gave way to the age of the strongman. International order and cooperation also gave way to a new populism that rejected the concept of international peace and security through the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/charter-united-nations/">United Nations Charter</a> for a more inward domestic nationalism, not seen since the late 1920’s and the early 1930’s.

The rise of strongmen across the globe in the past several years in Russia, China, Syria, Iran, Israel, Turkey, Venezuela, Hungary, the Philippines along with other longer term dictatorships from the twentieth century, has been astonishing and threatens the global order put in place after the Second World War. Even the cornerstone country of that world order, the United States, is toying with this populism.

In similar ways, each of the modern era strongmen rose to power and maintained that power through a boogeyman, that proverbial threat from the outside. They stoke a real or imagined fear of holding up that threat in order to remain in power and to get their frightened citizens to acquiesce. Why do they all consistently use fear as their modus operandi? Because it works...almost every time.

Our current President, a distant and envious admirer of these strongmen campaigned on this populism and once in power began manufacturing existential threats by Muslims, brown people of all sorts, terrorists and rapists all clamoring to “invade” us along our southern border. Hence “the wall” that had frozen our federal government in place until recently (and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/lawmakers-to-debate-border-immigration-as-next-shutdown-threat-looms-11548614760?mod=breakingnews">reportedly</a> may do so again).

To counter his boogeyman, this President is threatening to invoke emergency powers and step around the people’s branch, our Congress, to get what he wants. Having studied tyranny in all it’s aspects, most dictators begin to seize absolute power by using the law to invoke emergency powers to protect the citizens from the proverbial outside boogeyman. The problem is the emergency which justified the seizure of power “remains” and the dictator places a stranglehold around the liberties of the populace which tightens until they wake up one morning with that liberty gone.

Fear can also be a good thing. It sharpens one's focus and brings a populace together to fight against the threat. We are not at the point in this country where we are hapless. The Constitution, as the great gyroscope that provides balance for our Republic from any challenges that rock our government back and forth, should be our rallying point to counter this President’s fear mongering. We should not be afraid to step forward under law to stop this madness.

Nelson Mandela had it right: "I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear."

		<title>Cap-and-Trade Could Fill Gaps in Governor Wolf&#039;s Climate Change Executive Order</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The news on the climate crisis has been bad lately and getting worse. In the face of President Trump’s continued denial and his administration’s diligent efforts to roll back every shred of progress made by the Obama administration and to prop up an ailing coal industry, the warnings from the scientific community have only become more dire.

In November, 13 of Trump’s own agencies <a href="https://science2017.globalchange.gov/">released a 1,600-page report</a> confirming that climate change is already impacting communities across the country — bringing major storms, droughts, disease, water shortages, and more. That came on the heels of the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), warning that climate change is occurring more rapidly than previously thought. The report <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/summary-for-policy-makers/">predicted catastrophic consequences</a> if we don’t make “rapid,” “far-reaching,” and “unprecedented” “transitions in energy, land, infrastructure, and industrial systems” within the next 12 years.

What a relief, then, to actually get some good news on climate this month. Governor Wolf’s January 8 <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2019/01/pennsylvania-governor-signs-greenhouse-gas-executive-order/">Executive Order</a> on the climate crisis is welcome news indeed and undoubtedly a step in the right direction. His order calls climate change “the most critical environmental threat confronting our world” and sets specific goals for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in Pennsylvania — 26 percent by 2025 and 80 percent by 2050, from 2005 levels. While a number of other states have had similar <a href="https://www.c2es.org/document/greenhouse-gas-emissions-targets/">emissions reduction goals</a> on the books for some time, many of those (though not all) are states in which reliance on coal is already relatively low. Pennsylvania, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, is the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/?sid=PA">third-largest coal producer</a> in the nation. Twenty-two percent of the state’s electricity is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/24/climate/how-electricity-generation-changed-in-your-state.html">still generated from coal</a>. It is also the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/rankings/?sid=PA#series/226">fourth largest emitter of CO2</a>. So, for Pennsylvania to make this pledge is significant.

The executive order also directs Commonwealth agencies to take a whole list of actions to reduce their carbon footprints in the coming years. This directive is particularly impressive in its specificity. The order requires agencies to reduce energy consumption by 3 percent per year, to replace 25 percent of the state’s passenger car fleet with electric or plug-in electric hybrid cars by 2025, to offset 40 percent of electricity use with renewable energy or renewable energy credits, and to make sure any new building or major renovation projects achieve a 10 percent reduction in energy consumption. The governor could have filled his E.O. with vague promises and hortatory phrases. His choice to specify particular numeric measurable requirements instead is commendable.

The simple steps that government agencies can take by changing their procurement and energy consumption habits are important and have more than just symbolic impact. State agencies represent a large enough portion of the economy that these changes can produce significant emissions reductions in their own right. Through the government’s very real purchasing power, they can also provide the jump-start that green industries need to get moving, reduce prices, and begin attracting more widespread business from the private sector.

But, while undoubtedly a laudable first step, the executive order could have and should have gone further.  The statewide goals are better than nothing, to be sure, but they are based on outdated science.  The latest IPCC report says in order to avoid catastrophe, we need immediate, deep reductions in carbon emissions. That means cutting emissions by 45 percent by 2030 and by <em>100 percent</em> by 2050, rather than the 80 percent target the E.O. sets. That is, global greenhouse gas emissions have to get to<em> net zero</em> by mid-century in order to avoid climate change impacts that threaten major ecological, economic, and political disruptions that could shatter the foundations of civilized life on a global scale.

Transforming our economy to produce <em>net zero </em>emissions just over three decades from now will require us to make big changes quickly. But conspicuously absent from the governor’s new executive order are any specifics on how he plans to achieve the emissions reductions from the private sector necessary to meet the order’s climate goals. Maybe he’s figuring he can count on the largely market-driven trend in Pennsylvania away from coal and toward natural gas to get us to the 2025 goal. But that passive reliance on market forces is not going to get us to an 80 percent reduction by 2050, and certainly not to net zero. Sure, the governor has a legislature that won’t touch climate legislation with a 10-foot pole, but there’s so much more his executive order could have done.

Ironically the executive order begins with the language of the Pennsylvania Constitution’s Environmental Rights Amendment (ERA): “WHEREAS . . . the Constitution of Pennsylvania . . . preserves the commonwealth’s citizens’ right to clean air, pure water, and the preservation . . .  of the environment . . .” But that language actually imposes a constitutional obligation on the governor to go beyond what he said in the executive order and address private-sector greenhouse gas emissions. We know that because in a landmark 2017 case, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said so, declaring that the ERA requires all levels and branches of Pennsylvania government to “<span><a href="http://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Supreme/out/J-35-2016mo%20-%2010314240919600966.pdf#page=32">prohibit the degradation, diminution or depletion of our public natural resources, <em>whether these harms might result from direct state action or from the actions of private parties</em></a></span>” [emphasis added].

Why not direct the Commonwealth’s agencies to change the criteria they use in awarding contracts so that private companies compete not just with respect to project costs, but with respect to sustainability? Award contracts to companies that can show they are achieving the same kinds of energy efficiency and renewable energy benchmarks that the governor has imposed on the agencies themselves.

The executive order does use fairly broad language in defining the mission of the new GreenGov Council, created under the order to oversee agency sustainability efforts. It requires the new Council to “encourage the incorporation of environmentally sustainable practices into the Commonwealth government's policy, planning, operations, procurement, and regulatory functions . . . to achieve the goals set forth above.” This language certainly gives the new Council the power, and arguably the obligation, to suggest and incentivize agency programs like the one I suggest above and to also encourage the agencies to interpret their regulations and policies wherever possible in ways that require or incentivize sustainable practices in the private sector. And I certainly hope and expect that the GreenGov Council will take this mission seriously.

But why not include language in the executive order imposing a mandate directly on agencies to prioritize sustainability goals in the promulgation and interpretation of policies and regulations impacting the private sector? The order makes a nod in this direction with language requiring the agencies to “[d]evelop policies to incorporate the strategies outlined in this order to achieve the Commonwealth’s Performance Goals.” And we can hope that the agencies interpret this language broadly and take the overall mission of the order seriously. But more specific language with respect to agencies’ regulatory functions would have been preferable.

I hope this executive order signals a shift in the governor’s approach toward climate. Wolf's earlier decision to <a href="https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2018/01/26/gov-wolf-doesnt-recall-campaign-pledge-to-join-climate-initiative/">break a campaign promise</a> to join the nine other northeastern states participating in the <a href="https://www.rggi.org/">Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative</a> (RGGI) raised serious questions, as did his decision not to take the simple but important step of joining the <a href="https://www.usclimatealliance.org/">U.S. Climate Alliance</a>. But the climate executive order, as well as the governor’s participation in the <a href="https://www.transportationandclimate.org/nine-states-and-dc-design-regional-approach-cap-greenhouse-gas-pollution-transportation">Transportation Climate Initiative</a>, suggest (I hope) an increased focus on climate in Wolf’s second term.

Fortunately, one particularly powerful tool that would take the Commonwealth a long way toward achieving the goals set out in the executive order was just handed to Wolf on a silver platter. A large coalition of environmental groups, religious organizations, businesses, municipalities, schools, and individuals recently <a href="https://www.calltothebar.org/petition-to-keystone-state-seeks-carbon-pricing-as-climate-change-solution/">petitioned the Environmental Quality Board</a> (EQB) to issue a regulation instituting a cap-and-trade program in Pennsylvania to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Like the executive order, this proposed regulation would require no action by the Pennsylvania legislature. As the petition lays out in comprehensive detail, the EQB is authorized to issue such a regulation under the state’s Air Pollution Control Act and is required to issue it under the Constitution’s Environmental Rights Amendment.

The petitioners have made this as easy as possible for the EQB. They have submitted along with their petition a detailed draft regulation (400+ pages) that contains all the elements necessary to set up an economy-wide cap-and-trade program in Pennsylvania, similar to the one that’s been successfully operating for several years in California. The proposed program would require reductions in Pennsylvania’s overall greenhouse gas emissions of 3 percent per year, putting the Commonwealth on track to achieve the IPCC’s goal of net zero emissions by 2050. It would also generate an estimated $2.5 billion annually in much-needed state revenue.

The proposed cap-and-trade program provides the missing piece necessary to make the laudable goals set forth in the governor’s executive order a reality. It is serendipitous that this petition was filed just as the governor has begun to make the climate crisis the priority it deserves to be. He should take advantage of this opportunity to make good on the executive order’s promise by publicly endorsing the proposed cap-and-trade program and urging the EQB to adopt it.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span>Dictators <a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2019/01/fear-a-dictators-tool/">use fear</a> as a tool to stay in power. Politicians use various techniques to govern as well. In liberal democracies governance is based on incentives, good governance, rule of law, and service. Strongmen use other techniques to govern, such as fear, outside threats, coercion, and incentives.</span>

<span>Another technique to govern seen largely in totalitarian states is possible conflict perceived or actual. A strongman uses conflict to detract from the lack of civil liberties, a weak economy, and other challenges to an oppressed society.</span>

<span>In liberal democracies this use of conflict is not unheard of to help govern. Weak, insecure, and politically threatened politicians use conflict as a rally point, a distraction from political and legal threat.</span>

<span>Recently, America has ramped up its distaste of a failed socialist South American state and sudden concern for its people. That state <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-bolton/boltons-notes-raise-questions-on-us-military-plans-amid-venezuela-tensions-idUSKCN1PN1M9">is</a> Venezuela. As the Trump administration flails about in trouble, the shadow of the Mueller investigation looms large over what is called a “team of vipers”.</span>

<span>The central figure in this debacle is a threatened president who is in political trouble and possible criminal liability. He needs a distraction. What about a war with Venezuela? The basis is to “free the Venezuelan people from a tyrant.”</span>

<span>The hope is to take Trump's legal and political problems off the front page and to rally the American people around this just cause of freeing Venezuela from itself. As a political point America is great once again.</span>

<span>Having failed in his attempt to distract American citizens from his political problems by manufacturing an invasion of brown people, terrorist, and rapists coming up from the south along the Mexican border, Trump’s team of vipers needs another distraction...a war with a weak and unstable Latin American country.</span>

<span>International norms and law preclude a member state of the United Nations to use force against another member state absent a legal basis to do so to restore an imbalance to international peace and security. The cornerstone to the United Nations is settling disputes peacefully resorting to force only as a last resort.</span>

<span>Unilateral action, absent self defense, is generally illegal. Without a United Nations mandate, such action may be construed as an act of aggression, an international crime.</span>

<span>The rule of law is not a standard this administration holds itself up to, so whatever Trump directs will be another manufactured event to distract us from the real problems America faces, a possible criminal in office who is dismantling all this country stands for: respect, dignity, goodwill, hope, and an optimistic view of itself and the world. A manufactured war with Venezuela is not the answer.</span>

<span>Such an action weakens the United Nations paradigm and sets a bad example, as other strongmen will seize the moment and take their own unilateral action now and into the future. This happened in the early 1930’s under Hitler and Mussolini. The result was World War Two.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Before January 15<sup>th</sup>, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross’s decision to have every 2020 Census respondent answer a question about citizenship (for the first time in sixty years) lived as either a story of bureaucratic and political intrigue or a high-profile case on the Supreme Court’s docket.

The bureaucratic-intrigue focus would have included a chain of events in which Secretary Ross decided early after his confirmation to add the question -- skeptics would say, to cause an under-count of predominantly Democratic and minority voters. Ross then had aides find another agency to provide political cover, made arguably misleading statements to Congress that the question was triggered by the Justice Department’s need for data to better enforce the Voting Rights Act, and then tried to hide the relevant facts.

The Supreme-Court focus would have noted the justices’ previously announced February 19th hearing on an earlier interim ruling by Jesse Furman, the federal district judge hearing a lawsuit against Secretary Ross. The Supreme Court stayed Judge Furman’s order for supplementing the administrative record and taking depositions from Secretary Ross and others. At oral argument, the Court proposed to consider “[w]hether a district court may order discovery outside the administrative record to probe the mental processes of the agency decision-maker by compelling the testimony of high-ranking Executive Branch officials.” (For reasons noted below, the justices recently took this question off the high-Court table.)

Now, with Judge Furman’s lengthy and methodical January 15<sup>th</sup> <a href="https://apps.npr.org/documents/document.html?id=5684706-Jan-15-2019-Ruling-by-U-S-District-Judge-Jesse">judgment</a> invalidating the Secretary’s citizenship-question decision, it is Judge Furman’s final ruling that moves front and center. That decision is significant for four reasons.

<em><u>1. Another Reminder of the Importance of the APA – and Enabling Statutes</u></em>

First, Judge Furman’s decision provides another striking example of how administrative law can empower challengers to push back on a governmental policy they oppose.

I explained in a recent <a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2018/12/glenn-smith-daca-docket/">commentary</a>  how the federal Administrative Procedure Act allowed several courts (including a Ninth Circuit panel) to invalidate as “arbitrary and capricious” the Administration’s proposed rescission of DACA. And, the APA has been central to other attacks on Trump Administration initiatives.

Still, the Census decision is an even more textbook example of why “administrative law matters” (and so does statutory interpretation!). In twenty-six pages of close and methodical analysis, Judge Furman found four independent reasons why the APA invalidates Secretary Ross’ decision.

Two of the grounds turned on conflicts with the enabling statutes authorizing Commerce Department Census decisions. Such conflicts violate the APA provision forbidding agency action “not in accordance with law.” [5 USC 706(2)A]. Judge Furman found a clear violation of a requirement Congress added in 1976, when it sought to avoid “too many questions” on the census. The statute obligated the Secretary “to the maximum extent possible” to “acquire and use information available from [other existing sources] instead of conducting direct inquiries.” [13 USC 6(c)]. Judge Furman’s rationale gets technical, but the basic point is that Secretary Ross never explained why having census respondents self-report about citizenship would be more accurate than using existing administrative records; to the contrary, the evidence in the administrative record suggested the opposite.

Judge Furman also found that the Secretary failed to follow a different 1976 provision requiring reports to Congress about the “subjects” and “questions” proposed to be included in an upcoming census.  Engaging in a sophisticated analysis of how three reporting provisions [13 USC 141(f)] interact, the Judge concluded that the Secretary blew through a key three-years-in-advance timeline and was not saved by another provision allowing later reporting “if the Secretary finds that new circumstances exist.” The Judge’s only hesitation here was whether reporting violations are reviewable and enforceable by courts, as opposed to Congress needing to assert its informational rights.

Turning to the administrative record and depositions with lower-level staffers, Judge Furman found two grounds for finding Secretary Ross’ citizenship-question decision invalid under the different APA obligation that agency decisions not be “arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion.”  One holding deconstructed Secretary Ross’s argument that the Department of Justice needed the results of the citizenship question to better enforce the Voting Rights Act. Judge Furman saw this explanation ran “counter to the evidence before the agency,” ignored “several important aspects of the problem,” and failed “to justify” several “dramatic departure[s] from the standards and practices” -- both at the Census Bureau and in OMB government-wide data-gathering guidelines – “that have long governed administration of the census.”

Finally, and “perhaps most egregiously,” the Judge found that the Secretary’s rationale was “pretextual”--thus violating the APA by undermining the courts’ and public’s ability to assess the grounds upon which the agency acted. Based on the timing of the Secretary’s decision, the omission of the Justice Department/VRA issue in key decisional memoranda, and staff efforts “to conceal aspects” of the decisional process, the Judge found it “inescapable” that “the real reason for [Secretary Ross’] decision was something other than the sole reason he put forward” in the official Memorandum announcing the addition of the citizenship question.

<em><u>2. The Limitations of Constitutional Claims</u></em>

A second reason why the Jan. 15<sup>th</sup> decision is important is that it underscores how the APA can provide an easier handle for judging <em>when constitutional bases are problematic</em>. Just as in the DACA-rescission decisions, non-APA arguments took a backseat. Judge Furman rejected the claim that the Secretary’s decision violated the Equal Protection component of the Fifth Amendment by discriminating against “Latinos, Asian-Americans, Arab-Americans, and immigrant communities of color generally.” In so doing, the Judge underlined the difficulties inherent in constitutional equal-protection arguments.

Specifically, proving census discrimination against non-racial groups (e.g., Democratic voters; urban dwellers) would only have triggered low-level “rational-basis” scrutiny. To have any traction challengers had to show that the Secretary’s decision intended to discriminate on the basis of race or nationality. Further, it is not enough to show that decision-makers were “aware” of a disproportionate impact on these minorities; officials must have be motivated in part “because of” a desire to discriminate. Without the probing of the “mental processes” of Secretary Ross and others that Judge Furman ordered but the Supreme Court stayed pending its review, the Judge concluded that challengers failed to prove their discriminatory-intent claim by “a preponderance of the evidence.”

<em><u>3. Exemplary Judging</u></em>

A third significant aspect is that Judge Furman’s January 15<sup>th</sup> decision will make gratifying reading for any fan of meticulous judicial craftsmanship. With an obvious commitment to get at the truth and honor transparency and the rule of administrative legality, the Judge used extensive discovery and navigated the intricacies of federal civil litigation to preside over an 8-day evidentiary trial that laid bare the flimsy pillars of Secretary Ross’s decision.

The size of a novelette, the 124-page opinion features 49 pages of detailed factual workup summarized in 184 conclusions of fact. Strongly worded but at-times-understated conclusions of law destroy the Departmental rationale. The opinion is replete with citations to Supreme Court decisions – including, cannily, citations to opinions authored by Justice Scalia that are likely to resonate with the Court’s two newest members, Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh. (Indeed, several Kavanaugh opinions from the D.C. Circuit are prominently cited.)

<em><u>4. District- and Supreme-Court Interaction</u></em>

Fourth and finally, Judge Furman’s January 15<sup>th</sup> decision is a case study in how lower courts and the Supreme Court interact. As noted earlier, the Supreme Court placed the legitimacy of further “probing of the mental processes” of decision-makers on its February argument calendar.

At the same time, however, the justices declined to stay further proceedings in the case. The challengers elected to build their arguments without further record supplementation and depositions. And Judge Furman proceeded to enter a decision which, while noting how further information could be helpful, based its judgment for invalidation on the un-supplemented administrative record.

Judge Furman’s approach gave the Court a perfect invitation to postpone the question docketed for February. After all, if Furman’s current-record-based invalidation stands, the question of whether the existing record should be supplemented is moot.

The Court accepted the invitation three days after Judge Furman’s decision, removing the Census case from the February docket and placing it in docket limbo. (The Trump Administration later requested that the Court bypass intermediate appellate review and hear a direct appeal of the January 15<sup>th</sup> order.)

As you stand by for further developments, notice how the actions of a “subordinate” can influence the reactions of judicial “bosses” and executive-branch officials appearing before them.

		<title>EPA Takes a Toxic Turn by Backing Away from Mercury Regulation</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Mercury is one of the most toxic substances on earth. <a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/PHS/PHS.asp?id=112&amp;tid=24#bookmark05">When inhaled or ingested</a> by humans, mercury can cause severe neurological damage, cardiovascular harm, endocrine disruption, kidney damage and muscle coordination issues. When <span><a href="http://environment.harvard.edu/news/general/mercury-matters-2018-science-brief-journalists-and-policymakers">pregnant women are exposed</a></span>, their babies can suffer IQ and motor skills impairments that will last their lifetime.

Through rain, snow or dry deposition, mercury can <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/03/070321181643.htm">deposit</a> either directly into waterbodies or indirectly into waterbodies via groundwater seepage through plants and soil. Mercury is emitted by sources around the world; some of it travels long distances around the globe, while other sources deposit relatively close to where it has been emitted. Once in water, mercury chemically transforms into methylmercury, which is readily taken up first by plant and then by animal life and moves up the food chain to ultimately be consumed by people. People are primarily exposed to mercury through the consumption of freshwater or marine fish, either self-caught or, more commonly, purchased at the grocery store or a restaurant.

There have been mercury poisoning events of devastating proportion, including in Minamata, Japan where in 1956 a <span><a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/07/14/the_odd_body_minimata_disaster/">chemical plant released</a></span> massive amounts of wastes containing mercury into Minamata Bay, ultimately killing 900 people and injuring more than two thousand. Later, in 1971, seed grain treated with a <span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2366450/">methylmercury fungicide</a></span> was mistakenly consumed by people in rural Iraq. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people died or were seriously sickened as a result. These were extreme events, but they highlight the point that a very small amount of mercury can cause significant contamination. According to the <span><a href="https://www.pca.state.mn.us/quick-links/preventing-mercury-pollution">Minnesota Pollution Control Agency</a></span>, “approximately one gram of mercury enters a 20-acre lake each year. Over time, just this small amount can contaminate the fish in that lake, making them unfit to eat on a regular basis.”

Anthropogenic sources of mercury include fossil-fuel burning, gold mining, municipal and medical waste incinerators, as well as cement and brick production. Until three years ago, when the EPA’s Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) for power plants went into full compliance, the <span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/international-cooperation/mercury-emissions-global-context">burning of coal and oil</a></span> in power plants had been the most significant source of industrial mercury emissions in the United States because other US industrial sectors had already been subject to Clean Air Act rules that limited their emissions. MATS put in place similar reduction requirements for power plants. In December 2018, however, the <span><a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2018/12/epa-announces-plan-to-ease-restrictions-on-power-plants/">EPA issued a proposal</a></span> that could prove to be a first step in unraveling MATS.

MATS has deep regulatory roots, and the rule signed in 2011 was the result of significant development over time. In 1970, Congress passed the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7401">Clean Air Act</a>, the aim of which was to protect Americans’ health and our environment from the adverse impacts of air pollution. Congress directed the EPA to identify pollutants that posed the most risk and to develop regulations to reduce that risk. The original risk- and exposure-based approach proved extremely difficult for the EPA to implement. In 1990, Congress changed the approach to one that required the EPA to set technology-based standards for the <span><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7412">most significant sources</a></span> of air toxics, based on what the best performers in the industry were achieving. With tight standards for sources and follow-up risk and technology reviews, the program would assure continued reductions of air toxics emissions. Because coal-fired power plants were already regulated through other Clean Air Act programs, such as the Acid Rain program, Congress gave the EPA the extra step of evaluating whether existing programs were sufficient to reduce mercury emissions or whether, in the parlance of the Act, it was still “appropriate and necessary” to develop an air toxics rule for these sources.

The path of mercury regulation at the EPA was a long and winding one. After making a positive Appropriate and Necessary (A&amp;N) Finding in 2000, the EPA reversed that Finding in 2005, took coal-fired power plants off the list of sources to be regulated for mercury, and issued the <span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-11/documents/20111216matspresentation.pdf">Clean Air Mercury Rule</a></span> (CAMR), which switched to a cap and trade program. In 2008, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals <span><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1980585614175257397&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr">overturned</a></span> CAMR, so when the Obama Administration arrived in 2009, moving this issue forward was one of EPA Administrator Jackson’s highest priorities. Without CAMR, coal-fired power plants were the cheese standing alone, responsible for nearly half of US mercury emissions.

In 2011, Administrator Jackson signed the <span><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2012-02-16/pdf/2012-806.pdf">Mercury and Air Toxics Standards</a>.</span> The rule itself was accompanied by a new A&amp;N Finding and an analysis of the costs and benefits of the rule. Using the best information available at that time, the <span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-11/documents/20111221matsimpactsfs.pdf">EPA projected</a></span> that the rule would cost industry $9.8 billion annually, and generate $37-90 billion in benefits through improved public health. These are big numbers, but the control technologies the EPA expected utilities would use to control mercury —particularly <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=4410">scrubbers</a> — would also reduce other harmful air pollutants, including fine particles, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. The health effects of these pollutants are well-studied and costly; reducing these pollutants has been demonstrated to save lives.

As with all modern EPA rules, the next stop was the courthouse. In the first level of review, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals <span><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12809509887889779783&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr">fully upheld MATS</a></span>. The US Supreme Court agreed, with one exception: it held that the EPA should have considered cost as part of the A&amp;N Finding, and it directed the EPA to do so, leaving the rule in place in the meantime. The <span><a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/576/14-46/">Court stated</a></span> that the law did not require the EPA to conduct a “formal cost-benefit analysis in which each advantage and disadvantage is assigned a monetary value. It will be up to the Agency to decide (as always, within the limits of reasonable interpretation) how to account for cost.” The EPA moved quickly to propose and finalize a <span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/04/25/2016-09429/supplemental-finding-that-it-is-appropriate-and-necessary-to-regulate-hazardous-air-pollutants-from">Supplemental A&amp;N Finding</a></span>, again concluding that MATS was appropriate and necessary, using several approaches to evaluate the costs and the impact those costs would have on the utility industry and consumers.

In the meantime, the industry went about the business of complying with the rule.

Plants had three, four, or in a very few cases five years to come into compliance. In a letter to the EPA on July 10, 2018, the Edison Electric Institute, the American Public Power Association, the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and several other organizations, <span><a href="http://src.bna.com/Ajk">advised</a></span> that “all covered plants have implemented the regulation and that pollution controls—where needed—are installed and operating.”

Reconsidering MATS was high on the incoming Trump Administration’s to do list. Stakeholders were anticipating a proposal long before it arrived on December 28, 2018, and groups made their views known through meetings with Administration officials, letters, and other forms of advocacy. Notably, the electric utility industry reported to the EPA that it had spent $18 billion to comply with MATS, facilities were in compliance, and asked that the EPA “allow the industry to continue full implementation of MATS.”

So, after all the speculation, what has the EPA proposed and, if utilities are already in compliance, why does it matter? The proposal takes the A&amp;N Finding head-on. The EPA has looked yet again at the information it considered in 2011 and then again in 2015, and <span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2018-12/documents/frnmatsfindingandrtr_12_2018wdisc.pdf">now proposes to rescind</a></span> the A&amp;N Finding solely because, it asserts, the costs outweigh the benefits. The proposal does not propose to rescind the standards themselves, though it invites comment on that option. The proposal also takes on the Residual Risk and Technology review required under <span><a href="https://www3.epa.gov/airtoxics/rrisk/risk_rep.pdf">§112(f)(2)</a></span>, proposing to find that “residual risks due to emissions of air toxics from this source category are acceptable and that the current standards provide an ample margin of safety to protect public health” and that “[n]o new developments in… emissions reductions were identified under the technology review,” thus concluding that no revisions to MATS are warranted.

There are several aspects of the proposal worth noting.

First, the EPA based its analysis on costs projected in the 2011 original rule, disregarding up-to-date information on how much utilities have actually spent.  Moreover, although the latest <span><a href="http://environment.harvard.edu/news/general/mercury-matters-2018-science-brief-journalists-and-policymakers">science supports</a></span> “the conclusion that the mercury-related benefits from MATS are orders of magnitude larger” than previously estimated in the MATS Regulatory Impact Analysis, the proposal relies on the 8-year-old Regulatory Impact Analysis for its benefits calculations.<span> Thus, the EPA’s consideration of both costs and benefits in this proposal is out of date, inaccurate, and artificial.</span>

Second, the EPA proposes to reverse itself on the strength of a single highly significant policy change: the agency now proposes to find that it is inappropriate to consider benefits associated with any pollution reductions other than mercury and other air toxics specifically targeted by MATS. This is really the crux of the proposal. The EPA proposes that the <em>only</em> correct way to follow the Court’s direction in <em><a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/576/14-46/">Michigan</a></em> is to “directly compare the cost of compliance with MATS with the benefits specifically associated with reducing emissions of HAP as the primary inquiry in this Finding, in order to satisfy our duty to consider cost in the context of CAA section 112(n)(1)(A).”

But this argument ignores the Court’s statement in<em> Michigan</em> that the consideration of cost is but one of multiple relevant factors, and it assumes that the value of health benefits associated with pollution other than the air toxics included in the analysis are not meaningful within the legal construct of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, it ignores Guidance from the Office of Management and Budget that agencies are to consider <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/circulars/A4/a-4.pdf">both direct and indirect benefits</a> of rules. It also ignores cause-and-effect realities. If you quit smoking to reduce your chances of getting lung cancer, you will also necessarily reduce your risk (and the risk of others around you) of other significant health impacts. Is it really good policy to discount or even ignore those kinds of facts when considering how the costs of quitting smoking measure up to the benefits?

Third, the EPA has injected uncertainty into a regulatory landscape where certainty is prized by regulated industry. In this case, the regulated industry has already complied and is seeking to recover its costs through rate cases. If the EPA reverses the A&amp;N Finding, it will kick the legal legs out from under the standards themselves, leaving them vulnerable to an administrative petition or lawsuit by a third-party seeking rescission or vacatur of the entire rule. If the requirements go away, utilities may not be able to recover the costs they have already expended, and may operate controls less, if at all, to save operating costs.

There is much more to say, and people will say it all during the public comment period, which will start once the proposal is published in the Federal Register. In the meantime, <span><a href="http://environment.harvard.edu/news/general/mercury-matters-2018-science-brief-journalists-and-policymakers">mercury emissions</a></span> from US coal plants have gone down 85% between 2006 and 2016, and mercury levels in water and fish have also decreased. That sounds like a successful program to me.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As trials begin in March, all eyes are on the multi-state opioid litigation against pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors. More than 30 states, including hard-hit Ohio and West Virginia, and nearly 1,500 cities and counties have filed suit against pharmaceutical companies, wholesalers, and pharmacies for their role in the opioid crisis. Every day, more than 130 people in the United States die after overdosing on opioids, which include prescription painkillers like OxyContin, Percocet, and Fentanyl, according to the <span><a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/opioids/opioid-overdose-crisis#one">National Institute of Drug Abuse</a></span>. Experts says these lawsuits are likely to lead to marketing restrictions for the drugs and the biggest settlement since Big Tobacco <a href="https://www.publichealthlawcenter.org/sites/default/files/resources/master-settlement-agreement.pdf">paid out</a> $250 billion in 1998.

Coincidentally, the man who brought down Big Tobacco, Mississippi lawyer Mike Moore, is heading the charge against the opioid industry. The 65-year-old, who served as Mississippi’s attorney general from 1988 to 2005, is formally representing four states, including Ohio, and coordinating with many of the other state and local governments. “Ohio is losing $4 billion or $5 billion a year from the opioid epidemic. And they’re losing 5,000 or 6,000 people a year from overdose deaths,” Moore told <span><em><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/opioid-crisis-attorney-mike-moore-takes-on-manufacturers-and-distributors-at-the-center-of-the-epidemic-60-minutes/">60 Minutes</a></em></span> in December. “So when a jury hears the evidence in this case, they’re not gonna award just a couple hundred million dollars. It may be $100 billion. And whoever amongst these companies thinks they can stand up to that? Good luck.”

There are three central arguments in this litigation:

The first allegation is that opioid manufacturers, including Purdue Pharma, Endo Pharmaceuticals, and Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Janssen Pharmaceuticals, among others, <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2019/01/massachusetts-ag-brings-amended-complaint-against-purdue-pharma-in-opioid-deaths/">downplayed</a> the risks of opioids in the late ’90s, marketing the drugs to the medical community as non-addicting, which resulted in healthcare providers prescribing them more aggressively. Some physicians, identified as “key opinion leaders,” were paid by manufacturing-defendants to encourage opioid prescribing. Some of these same physicians are also now listed as defendants.

Purdue Pharma told <em>60 Minutes</em> in a statement that when the FDA approved OxyContin in 1995, it authorized the company to state on the label that “addiction to opioids legitimately used is very rare.” But the news show notes that the company admitted in federal court in 2007 that it had misled doctors and consumers about how addictive OxyContin can be. The lawsuits argue that opioids are addictive both when they are misused and when they are used as directed.

The second argument is that distributors—including AmerisourceBergen, McKesson Corp., and Cardinal Health (known as the “Big Three”)—allegedly distributed more than 80 percent of the opioids at issue and failed to monitor, investigate, refuse, or report suspicious orders of prescription opioids, flooding states with the drugs.

A 2016 investigation by the <span><em><a href="https://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/cops_and_courts/drug-firms-poured-m-painkillers-into-wv-amid-rise-of/article_99026dad-8ed5-5075-90fa-adb906a36214.html">Charleston Gazette-Mail</a></em></span> found that in six years, drug wholesalers bombarded West Virginia with 780 million hydrocodone and oxycodone pills, while 1,728 residents fatally overdosed on those two painkillers. And in Kermit, West Virginia, which has a population of only 392 people, 9 million opioid pills were delivered to a single pharmacy in just two years. “The distributors are saying things like, ‘We’re just truck drivers. We didn’t know where the pills went,’” Moore told <em>60 Minutes</em>. “Of course they did. There’s a <a href="https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/21usc/811.htm">Controlled Substances Act</a>. You’re supposed to control these pills. And when you don’t, you have a responsibility for it. It’s real simple.”

The third claim is that pharmacies and distributors, including big names like Walmart, CVS, and Walgreens, knew they were selling too many pills, creating addiction and a black market—but did nothing about it.

According to litigators we spoke to, expert witnesses are likely to be used heavily in these cases to put the science in perspective and industry regulations in context. To prove each opioid-related case, law firms will need evidence that the companies engaged in fraud or understated the risks. Take, for example, the argument that doctors didn’t fully understand that the drugs were potentially addicting—litigators will need scientists to add color to that idea.

According to <span><a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/opioids/opioid-overdose-crisis#two">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a></span>, the total "economic burden" of prescription opioid misuse in the U.S. is an estimated $78.5 billion a year. That figure includes the costs of healthcare, addiction treatment, criminal justice involvement, and more.

The plaintiffs say drug companies created and should pay for the war against the opioid epidemic. As a result of so many people across the country becoming addicted to opioids many government agencies, including foster care programs, drug rehab clinics, and law enforcement, are simply overwhelmed. In Ohio, for example, half of the children in foster care have parents who are addicted to opioids, and the number of babies born addicted to the drugs grew by almost eight times between 2006 and 2015. A large settlement could pay for more training for first responders and additional rehab programs among other things.

In the end, Moore hopes drug companies will not be let off the hook for their role in this epidemic. “I don’t think they cared enough,” Moore told <em>60 Minutes</em>. “And if they cared enough, maybe we would not have lost 500,000 lives from this problem. It appalls me.”

Soon, we will know if jurors agree.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[An important decision of special interest to politically active citizens in Europe came out on January 24, 2019 by the European Court of Human Rights.<span> </span>As stated in the Press Release <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng-press?i=003-6308613-8238123">issued</a> by the Registrar of the Court, in the case of Catt v. the United Kingdom (application no. 43514/15) “UK failed to protect the right to privacy of a lifelong activist whose personal data appeared in an extremism database”. The judgment was held unanimously and regarded that the UK violated <a href="https://human-rights-law.eu/echr/article-8-echr-right-to-private-life-family-life-correspondence-and-home/">Article 8 </a>(“right to respect for private and family life”) of the European Convention on Human Rights.

The case started with the complaint of Mr. John Olroyd Catt,who is 94 years old and has been a “life long peace activist and a regular attender at demonstrations of various kinds”. Although the applicant has never been convicted of any offense and has had no violent history, the police collected and retained the applicant’s personal data in a database for “domestic extremists”. He appealed to the relevant UK judicial authorities and the UK Supreme Court decided that the police acted in a proportional way due to the fact it regarded the file on Mr Catt was not nominal anymore. It was not aiming to establish criminal charges against him, but it was useful for an <a href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2013-0112-press-summary.pdf">assessment of danger</a> to the public and it had value for policing purposes due to the activities of a violent organised group whose demonstrations he attended. <span>The UK domestic legal framework related to the gathering and retaining of the above information is the Data Protection Act 2018 (that replaced Data Protection Act 1998) and the </span>Code of Practice on the Management of Police Information.

The European Court of Human Rights, with this decision, tries to balance the need for security (eminent in many countries due to violent extremism and terrorist threat that needs intelligence and monitoring of suspects in order to prevent attacks) and the respect of privacy (a main aspect of human rights and liberties, often endangered by counter- extremism policies). While it considers that collecting information on the applicant can be regarded as justified for security purposes, it further argues that retaining this information that is about sensitive data is not justified. Furthermore, the Strasbourg Court <a href="http://www.journalonline.co.uk/News/1026824.aspx#.XGH7Mi2ZNQI">focuses</a> on the issue of lack of safeguards regarding this retention of data:
<blockquote><em>Like the Supreme Court it found that there were good policing reasons why such data had to be collected. In Mr Catt’s case, the collection of his data had been justified because Smash EDO’s activities were known to be violent and potentially criminal. While Mr Catt had never been violent or shown any tendency towards such behaviour, he had identified himself repeatedly and publicly with that group. The Court found, however, that the continued retention of the data in Mr Catt’s case had been disproportionate because it was personal data which revealed political opinions and so had enhanced protection; it had been accepted that Mr Catt did not pose a threat to anyone, also taking into account his age; and there had been a lack of effective procedural safeguards. The lack of safeguards included the absence of a time-limit on how long data should be kept, the only definite rule being that information would be held for a minimum of six years before being reviewed. In Mr Catt’s case it was not clear that such six-year or other reviews had taken place. This also contrasted with privacy resolutions passed by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, which indicated that there should be maximum time-limits for holding certain kinds of information. The Court was also concerned about the effectiveness of legal challenge as a safeguard 3 in this case because the police had actually held more data on Mr Catt at the time of the domestic proceedings than previously acknowledged.</em></blockquote>
An upper time-limit of retaining sensitive information is viewed by the European Court of Human Rights as essential in order to have effective procedural safeguards, meaning an effective protection from police abuse, especially in the contemporary era of advanced monitoring technology. This is crucial as an indefinite time of detention of data that has to do with citizens’ activities and even their political opinions associated (or in some cases the religion of citizens, when monitoring possible threats of Islamist extremism) creates an environment of insecurity and gives excessive, potentially dangerous power to the police. The relationship between state and citizen should not end up in one of “all seeing”-“all knowing”-“all registering” without limits and effective ways for citizens to question the gathered information about them, how long it is stored and how it can be used.

The European Court of Human Rights has dealt also in the past with the UK police practice of retaining information about citizens in its decision MM v United Kingdom ECHR (issued on 13 Nov 2012, application no 24029/07). Based on this previous judgement, the Court now refers to texts of the European legislation framework, like the regulations of the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data 1981, the Explanatory Report to the Convention, the Protocol amending the Convention for theProtection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data, the Data Protection Directive and the General Data Protection Regulation and Directive (EU) 2016/680.

Strasbourg took an important step towards the protection of human rights when in many countries counter- extremism and counter-terrorism legislation and measures have compromised civil liberties. In several European countries,social and economic reasons have led people to the streets protesting for better living conditions. From active practicing of religion, to participation in demonstrations or political protests and being an activist (all the above even without any involvement in violence) can be reasons for authorities to flag a person and gather information on him/her, creating a file about them in security services without justifying its usefulness v. proportionality. The reason why the protection of privacy from counter-extremism databases matters (hence why this ECHR decision is important for Europeans) is described eloquently by the dissenting opinion of Lord Touson in favour of the applicant, noted actually in the UK Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2013-0112-judgment.pdf">decision</a> that led the case to the European Court:
<blockquote><em>It matters because in modern society the state has very extensive powers of keeping records on its citizens. If a citizen’s activities are lawful, they should be free from the state keeping a record of them unless, and then only for as long as, such a record really needs to be kept in the public interest.</em></blockquote>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[From intrauterine device Mirena, to anticoagulant Xarelto, to gardening weed killer RoundUp, the German conglomerate Bayer has attempted to dip their feet into awe-inspiring advances in many sectors of the science field. Unfortunately, not all of the results have been ideal with the corporation now facing thousands of lawsuits from consumers over the past several years.

While Bayer has been under fire for many of their products, they are currently facing more than 18,000 lawsuits over their implantation method of female sterilization, Essure. Women all over the United States are <u><a href="https://www.consumersafety.org/legal/essure-lawsuit/">suing the pharmaceutical giant</a></u> for serious side effects that occurred as a result of the defective device.

Conceptus Inc, the original manufacturer of Essure, was obtained by Bayer in April of 2013. Around the same time, a slew of adverse events was reported to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the permanent birth control device. Women have reported the development of autoimmune disorders, migrating devices, and unintended pregnancies. There is even evidence that suggests that the manufacturer failed to report many adverse events they knew about and altered records to <u><a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=FDA-2015-P-0569-0001">show favorable information</a></u>.

The marketing behind the product showed it as a quick, safe, and effective method of permanent birth control for women. But women complain about false marketing as many of the health risks that they experienced were not expressed by physicians before implantation.

Plaintiffs claim that the manufacturer failed to inform patients and physicians of possible dangerous side effects. Some women have been forced to have additional operations in an attempt to correct complications that the device caused. Women’s organs have been perforated, devices have broken inside fallopian tubes, and many women have endured years of pain and suffering.

Women are seeking several types of damages as a result of the pain and suffering from Essure, from compensatory damages for medical costs, to general damages for mental and emotional anguish. Consumers are also seeking <u><a href="https://www.consumersafety.org/news/types-of-damages-in-drug-medical-device-and-personal-injury-lawsuits/">punitive damages</a></u> in order to punish Bayer for developing and selling a harmful product and to stop the company from making this negligent practice into a habit.

The FDA did step in several times over the years in an attempt to regulate the reports and lawsuits by restricting sales to women who reviewed a patient-decision checklist with their provider that discussed the possible risks of Essure. But the introduction of these new safety warnings also led to more lawsuits. Reports show that before the new safety warnings, Bayer faced 3,000 lawsuits, and after, they faced <u><a href="https://www.thestar.com/business/technology/2018/07/20/bayer-to-stop-selling-contraceptive-implant-essure-after-threats-by-fda.html">more than 16,000</a></u>.

Bayer’s annual reports acknowledge the lawsuits and the claims from women, but they also defend their product’s effectiveness and safety. Bayer denies any problems with the product and claims that their benefit-risk profile still stands. They even stand by the original labeling, claiming that the FDA reports were false and some of the reports had to be <u><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-25/bayer-essure-suits-skyrocketed-as-fda-pushed-stronger-warnings">from the same women</a></u>. According to the company, they always properly disclosed side effects and believe that women should be wary of all birth control options because side effects are inevitable with every contraceptive method.

Even when the company voluntarily discontinued the product in the summer of 2018, they continued to back the effectiveness of the product, claiming the reasoning for halting sales was because there was <u><a href="http://www.essure.com/assets/pdf/PP-250-US-1923-FINAL-News-Release.pdf">no longer a market</a></u> in the United States for the product. But demand for the product started to fall when the reports of dangerous side effects and lawsuits were published.

In Bayer’s announcement to remove Essure from the market, they also claimed the decline in sales was due to “inaccurate and misleading publicity,” which some attribute to a recent Netflix documentary, “The Bleeding Edge.” The documentary dives into the medical device industry, following an Essure patient who suffered from severe adverse events as a result of the device. Though the documentary was quite damning for Bayer, the company did not address it in its announcement of discontinuation. With the release of the Netflix documentary, <u><a href="https://www.consumersafety.org/news/essure-recall-bayer/">more lawsuits are expected</a></u> to surface.

Women have also come together to form a Facebook group called “<u><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Essure-problems-178631888835781/">Essure Problems</a></u>,” where they gather together to discuss the hardships they have endured because of the product, news regarding the device, and legal steps they are taking as a result of Essure.

Some say that Bayer’s decision to halt Essure sales could trigger an uproar of settlements, as the device will no longer be available, creating a possible deadline for when women can file cases against the company. However, there is currently a steady flow of cases coming in from women who have struggled for years as a result of the device.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400">Recently, a District Court Judge in Iowa <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2019/01/iowa-judge-strikes-down-fetal-heartbeat-abortion-law/">struck down a law</a> passed in the spring of 2018 which would have barred abortions after a fetal heartbeat could be detected by means of a vaginal ultrasound. The exceptions included cases of medical emergency, or medically necessity, severe fetal defects, or when the fetus was conceived through rape or incest.  A fetal heartbeat can be detected as early as the sixth week of pregnancy. Heartbeats are easily detectable by the twelfth week of pregnancy.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">This ruling was no surprise.  All sides expected it. To understand why, it is useful to look at recent legislation and court rulings regarding abortion in Iowa.  When the Republicans took over the legislature after the 2016 elections, one of the items on the party’s agenda was to restrict abortions.  In the 2017 legislative session, <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=87&amp;ba=sf471">a law was passed</a> that banned abortions after twenty weeks and required a seventy-two (72) hour waiting period from when a woman gives “informed consent” and has an ultrasound to determine the age of the fetus to when she can have the abortion.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-heartland">Planned Parenthood of the Heartland </a>immediately sued to prevent the law from going into effect.  The law was enjoined before trial at the District Court. A different Judge heard the trial and found that the law was constitutional.  He ruled against Planned Parenthood’s case. The Iowa Supreme Court stayed the statute while it considered the appeal. At the end of June 2018, the Iowa Supreme Court by a vote of 5-2 found a state constitutional right to abortion.  <a href="https://www.iowacourts.gov/courtcases/439/embed/SupremeCourtOpinion">The Court ruled</a> that women had a fundamental right to choose to have abortions under substantive due process and equal protection. It rejected the US Supreme Court’s use of the “undue burden” test as an analysis to use to determine the constitutionality of an abortion restriction.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The Court’s analysis included a detailed description of the huge burden the 72 hour waiting period placed on women, especially lower income and rural women.  These burdens included: difficulty getting to clinics, obtaining ultrasounds, making two appointments 72 hours apart before the 20 week deadline. For rural women, access to transportation to an abortion clinic that might be hours away could also be quite difficult.  Making the trip twice, might be impossible for some women. The Court noted that the longer it took to get the abortion, the more medical risk there is to having an abortion. An abortion by medication is only available in the first ten weeks of pregnancy. A second trimester abortion is more expensive and has more risks than a first trimester abortion.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In finding that the substantive due process clause of the Iowa Constitution includes a right for a woman to choose to have an abortion, </span><a href="https://casetext.com/case/planned-parenthood-heartland-v-reynolds-ex-rel-state"><span style="font-weight: 400">the Court stated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">:</span>
<blockquote>Autonomy and dominion over one’s body go to the very heart of what it means to be free. At stake in this case is the right to shape, for oneself, without unwarranted governmental intrusion, one’s own identity, destiny, and place in the world. Nothing could be more fundamental to the notion of liberty. We therefore hold, under the Iowa Constitution, that implicit in the concept of ordered liberty is the ability to decide whether to continue or terminate a pregnancy.</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400">The Court then applied strict scrutiny to the 72 hour waiting period and found the statute unconstitutional.  That was not the end, however. Rather, the Court went on to look at abortion rights under equal protection. Iowa has a history of making its equal protection clause robust and the Court used that tradition in this case.  In recognizing that equality included women’s autonomy over their reproduction, the Court discussed the consequences of unwanted pregnancies:</span>
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400">Laws that diminish women’s control over their reproductive futures can have profound consequences for women. Some women embrace them and never look back. Others, however, do look back and see a trajectory in life different from men. Without the opportunity to control their reproductive lives, women may need to place their educations on hold, pause or abandon their careers, and never fully assume a position in society equal to men, who face no such similar constraints for comparable sexual activity. Societal advancements in occupational opportunities are meaningless if women cannot access them. Policies that make education more affordable are meaningless if women are kept out of reach. Equality and liberty in this instance, as in so many others, are irretrievably connected.</span></blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400">The seventy-two hour waiting period was rejected.   This ruling was issued June 29, 2018, after the legislature passed the <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=87&amp;ba=H-8441">fetal heartbeat measure</a>.  While the legislature was debating the fetal heartbeat bill, members who supported it explicitly said that they hoped the bill would be a vehicle for the United States Supreme Court to overturn </span><a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/410/113.html"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Roe v. Wade </span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/505/833">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</a>.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">  They made it clear that they understood that the only way the statute could be upheld would be for the Supreme Court to do that.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The <a href="https://www.aclu-ia.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa</a> threw a wrench in this plan.  When it sued the state for an injunction representing Planned Parenthood, it filed its suit only under the state constitution. The <a href="https://www.iowaattorneygeneral.gov/">state Attorney General</a> refused to represent the state in the lawsuit because the statute was so clearly unconstitutional.  The state received free representation from a national organization opposed to abortion rights. There was an attempt to remove the case to federal court which was rejected since no federal question was raised. The judge enjoined the statute while the case was pending.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">With that, the suit continued in state court.  Once the Iowa Supreme Court’s opinion in the 72 hour case was issued, it became even clearer that the statute was unconstitutional.  Planned Parenthood sought summary judgment. The state opposed trying to argue that there were material issues of fact in dispute. Primarily, they argued that a fetal heartbeat is not always detected at six weeks into the pregnancy.  They said it could take as long as 12 weeks for a fetus to develop a heartbeat that can be recognized with an abdominal ultrasound. The Judge found this distinction irrelevant because the only distinction that is important to the constitutionality of abortion regulation is viability.  No fetus is viable at twelve weeks. Applying </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Planned Parenthood v. Reynolds</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, the Judge easily found the statute unconstitutional.  Those who pushed for the law professed shock at the ruling even though they knew that the law was unconstitutional under </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Roe</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Casey</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">This has not been the end of the story.  Legislatures are now going two paths in their attempt to end women’s rights to reproductive freedom.  First, <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ba=SJR9&amp;ga=88">they are introducing</a> an amendment to the state constitution which would include language that there is no right to abortion under the state constitution.  This is a long run effort. For an amendment to be enacted, it must be approved by two different legislative sessions (in other words another session held after the next set of state elections in 2020) and be approved by popular vote.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">For a quicker solution, the legislature is considering an attack on the judiciary itself.  Iowa currently has a merit selection system for judges in its constitution. As currently formulated, a commission made up one half by lawyers elected by the bar and the other half appointed by the Governor nominated two candidate for district court positions and three for appellate court positions.  The Governor must choose between those nominated to fill positions. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Since getting rid of merit selection completely would take the same work as an amendment to say no right to abortion, the legislature is trying an end run around an amendment.  Some are proposing to eliminate lawyers electing people to the nominating commission and have all members of the commission be political appointees. Their hope is that they will then be able to install more conservative anti-abortion judges to the Court.  Since Republicans are in the majority in the State Assembly and State Senate and Iowa has a Republican governor, many fear that these efforts will be successful. If so, not only will abortion rights be endangered, but also the high quality of Iowa’s judiciary could be in jeopardy.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2019/02/hhs-proposes-rules-to-increase-interoperability-of-electronic-health-information/">recently issued</a> proposed regulations that could enhance the value of electronic health information. Specifically, the <span><a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2019/02/11/hhs-proposes-new-rules-improve-interoperability-electronic-health-information.html">proposed regulations</a></span> focus on the areas of interoperability and patients’ access to their health data.

Electronic health information is a relatively new phenomenon. It became a subject of national importance in 2004, when President George W. Bush announced a <span><a href="https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/infocus/technology/economic_policy200404/chap3.html">plan</a></span> to computerize most Americans’ health records by 2014. The transition to electronic health records (EHRs) accelerated under President Barack Obama who passed the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act as part of the 2009 stimulus plan, the <span><a href="https://www.hitechanswers.net/about/about-arra/">American Recovery and Reinvestment Act</a></span>. The HITECH Act dedicated <span>$19 billion</span> to promoting the adoption of health information technology. Eligible professionals and hospitals received substantial incentive payments through Medicare and Medicaid for implementing certified EHR systems. Now EHR systems are nearly <span><a href="https://dashboard.healthit.gov/quickstats/quickstats.php">ubiquitous</a></span> in medical offices.

HHS began regulating the quality and use of EHR systems in 2011. It has done so by implementing <span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ehrmeaningfuluse/introduction.html">Meaningful Use</a></span> and <span><a href="https://www.healthit.gov/topic/certification-ehrs/certification-health-it">Certification</a></span> regulations. As I have argued in my book, <span><em>Electronic Health Records and Medical Big Data: Law and Policy</em></span>, these regulations have many benefits but also significant shortcomings. HHS is now attempting to address some of these limitations.

Seemingly insurmountable barriers to full interoperability have been a major disappointment in the electronic health information arena. <span><a href="https://www.himss.org/library/interoperability-standards/what-is-interoperability">Interoperability is</a></span> “the ability of different information systems, devices or applications to connect, in a coordinated manner, within and across organizational boundaries to access, exchange and cooperatively use data.” Policy-makers <span><a href="https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/ONC10yearInteroperabilityConceptPaper.pdf">have long hoped</a></span> to build a nationwide, interoperable health information technology infrastructure, but they acknowledge that we have fallen <span><a href="https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/interoperability-remains-limited-according-national-academy-medicine">far short</a></span> of meeting this goal.

Currently, EHRs in one health system all too often remain inaccessible to physicians in other health systems. Thus, patients’ EHRs are fragmented, with pieces of them housed in different facilities. When a patient goes to a doctor for a second opinion or specialized care, the new doctor cannot necessarily access the patient’s EHR at other facilities to obtain the patient’s full medical history, diagnoses, test results, and other information. Similarly, physicians in hospital emergency rooms may not be able to access patient records and could be forced to provide treatment with little to no information about the individual’s health status if the person arrives unconscious or confused. Comprehensive, national interoperability would allow physicians with proper authorization to retrieve patients’ records anywhere in the country in any medical entity.

Interoperability would yield other benefits as well. It would enable health care providers to switch more easily to new EHR systems if they are dissatisfied with the products they have. This is because clinicians could easily transition all patient records to a new system. Technological innovations could also have much faster uptake because they could sync with all EHR systems.

Not surprisingly, EHR vendors often are not highly motivated to promote interoperability because it could increase the likelihood that established customers will switch to different systems. Likewise, some health care organizations may not be enthusiastic about sharing patient information with competitors. Consequently, interoperability will not happen without aggressive regulatory intervention.

Another way to promote interoperability is to empower patients to obtain and share their health information. The <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/index.html">HIPAA Privacy Rule</a> establishes that patients have a <span><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/45/164.524">right</a></span> to access, inspect, and obtain copies of their health information that HIPAA-covered entities maintain.  <span><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/45/160.103">Covered entities</a></span> include health care providers, public and private health plans, health care clearinghouses, and their business associates. If patients can easily obtain their medical data, they could presumably provide it directly to other physicians and facilities that they visit.

Patients also have a <span><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/45/164.526">right</a></span> to ask covered entities to modify their health information if they believe it is inaccurate. Patients who access their health data thereby can contribute an important layer of quality control to medical record-keeping. EHRs are all too often <span><a href="https://medcitynews.com/2016/03/ehr-eliminate-medical-errors/">rife with errors</a></span>. It is patients themselves who may be in the best position to scrutinize documentation and detect mistakes.

The <span><a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/cms-advances-interoperability-patient-access-health-data-through-new-proposals">proposed regulations</a></span> in part would establish the following requirements:
<ul>
 	<li>Certain covered entities, namely Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, Medicare Advantage plans, and Qualified Health Plans in the Federally-facilitated Exchanges, must provide enrollees with immediate <em>electronic</em> access to claims data and other health information by 2020;</li>
 	<li>These covered entities must implement technologies (application programming interfaces) that promote data sharing so that patients can more easily transition between plan types;</li>
 	<li>Patients must be able to access their data electronically at no cost;</li>
 	<li>Health care professionals or hospitals that engage in “<span><a href="https://www.healthit.gov/topic/information-blocking">information blocking</a></span>” activities that unjustifiably limit data access and hinder interoperability will be subject to public reporting of their misconduct.</li>
</ul>
HHS is accepting comments on the proposed regulations until April 2019. It will likely modify the rules later this year to address various concerns that commentators raise. In whatever form they ultimately take, the new regulations certainly will not fully solve the problem of interoperability. For example, the electronic data access provisions outlined above will govern particular health insurers and not health care providers and will apply to 125 million patients rather than all Americans. However, the regulations may well promote meaningful incremental advances and reinforce policy-makers commitment to the ultimate goal of national interoperability.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400">Under current leadership, the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) seems committed to only grudgingly protecting consumers from unfair and exploitative financial products.  In its </span><a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-releases-strategic-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400">strategic plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, former Acting Director Mick Mulvaney explained that the Bureau had “committed to fulfill the Bureau’s statutory responsibilities, but go no further.”  This language aligns with Mulvaney’s earlier </span><a href="https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/is-the-consumer-financial-protection-bureau-mission-changing-010518.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">change</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to the Bureau’s mission statement, identifying the CFPB’s mission as, among other things, to help “consumer finance markets work by regularly identifying and addressing outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome regulations.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The Bureau’s newly-confirmed new Director, </span><a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/the-bureau/about-director/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kathy Kraninger</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, seems to share Mulvaney’s priorities.  Although she took office pledging that she would not be a mere Mulvaney </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-kathy-kraninger-cfpb-20181211-story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">puppet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, her signature initiative thus far appears to be </span><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_payday_nprm-2019-reconsideration.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">rescinding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> payday and car title lending protections. Under Kraninger’s leadership, the Bureau has proposed to rescind a rule providing that “it is an unfair and abusive practice” to make certain payday and car title loans, “without reasonably determining that consumers have the ability to repay those loans according to their terms.” As justification for the shift, the Bureau simply announced that it changed its mind about the rule—claiming that the evidence it previously found persuasive was “not sufficiently robust and reliable to support” the Bureau’s underwriting rules. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The Bureau’s opposition to its own rule comes from its newly-discovered doubt in its own key finding that payday and car title borrowers struggled to accurately predict their ability to repay.  In particular, the Bureau now believes that insufficient evidence supported three conclusions: </span>
<blockquote>(1) consumers who use covered short-term or longer-term balloon-payment loans lack the understanding needed to reasonably avoid injury from lenders’ failure to assess consumers’ ability to repay those loans; (2) consumers lack understanding of the material risks, costs, or conditions of such loans; and (3) consumers’ lack of understanding contributes to their inability to protect their interests in the selection or use of such loans.</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400">This goes to the core of the controversy over payday and car title lending. As one </span><a href="http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/main.asp?PID=4672"><span style="font-weight: 400">scholar</span></a> <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2638481"><span style="font-weight: 400">explained</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, the debate centers around whether payday borrowers act rationally “because borrowers need access to credit and lack superior alternatives” or lenders simply exploit “consumers' systematically poor decision making.”  If many consumers lack sufficient sophistication to protect their own interests, the payday lending industry may earn significant profits by inducing customers to enter into bad deals that hurt their interests.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, not all payday and car title borrowers are alike. Available deals may be good for some borrowers and catastrophic for others.  Consider the common </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/06/02/480329986/new-rules-to-ban-payday-lending-debt-traps"><span style="font-weight: 400">example</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> of the hardworking low-wage worker with a broken-down car.  Even with its high cost, a payday loan may allow her to repair the car and keep working instead of losing her job because she cannot otherwise make it to work. Industry advocates argue that these loans provide access to capital and help (apparently friendless and unable to hitch a ride) working people mitigate harms from cash-flow issues.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Still, substantial evidence indicates that many borrowers find themselves locked into a debt cycle, borrowing again and again to make payment on existing loans.  The Bureau’s own </span><a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/Payday_Loans_Highlights_From_CFPB_Research.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> from 2016 found that “more than 80 percent of payday loans  . . . were rolled over or reborrowed within 30 days, incurring additional fees with every renewal.”  About 20% of borrowers ultimately default and roughly the same percentage of auto-title borrowers with single-payment loans eventually find their lender seizing their car.  A borrower who loses her car to a lender may suffer a cascade of problems—including losing her job and her ability to ultimate drive herself to any new job.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Broader </span><a href="http://freakonomics.com/podcast/payday-loans/"><span style="font-weight: 400">evidence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> around payday lending’s overall impact </span><a href="https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2015/10/reframing-the-debate-about-payday-lending.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">appears mixed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.  Some studies show that payday lending </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1538-4616.2011.00499.x"><span style="font-weight: 400">helps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> households and others indicate that payday lending </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378426611003256"><span style="font-weight: 400">exacerbates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> many problems. Assessing the research may be especially difficult because of reports that the payday lending industry has exercised </span><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/payday-loan-study_us_5633d933e4b00aa54a4e4273"><span style="font-weight: 400">significant influence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> over the research into its lending practices and outcomes for the purpose of creating “research that they can point to in order to argue against regulation.” </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The Bureau’s underwriting requirements provided a sensible way to balance appropriate access to short-term loans against the disastrous consequences for consumers finding themselves in a </span><a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-finalizes-rule-stop-payday-debt-traps/"><span style="font-weight: 400">debt trap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. By making a lender assess a borrower’s ability to repay at the time it issued the loan, the Bureau’s regulation aimed to facilitate responsible lending and protect consumers.  Although the regulation would have restricted some lending activity, it would also address some of the worst risks facing consumers.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In seeking to rescind the underwriting requirements, Kraninger’s Bureau balances priorities differently.  It aims to protect lender business and customers’ freedom to take on debts they cannot plausibly repay over the risk that borrowers will continue to fall into debt traps.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Ultimately, rescinding the underwriting rules shifts the responsibility for consumer protection to the consumers themselves and the States.  On the consumer front, the Bureau essentially tells consumers to get better at making financial decisions and signals support for “improved financial education programs” as “a viable alternative to more direct market interventions such as issuing regulations.”  This suggestion ignores the substantial </span><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1105384"><span style="font-weight: 400">research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> documenting that financial literacy education does little to improve consumer decision-making.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The Bureau’s move to unwind restrictions signals the need for States to exercise their authority to regulate payday lending.  In proposing to unwind the Bureau’s underwriting requirement, it </span><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_payday_nprm-2019-reconsideration.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">explained</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that it viewed the original rule as improperly “reducing credit access and competition in the States which have determined it is in their citizens’ interest to be able to use such products, subject to State-law limitations.”  This justification implicitly rebukes States that thought it best to allow a federal consumer protection agency to set standards and avoid subjecting lenders to both state and federal regulation. States that stood down on their regulatory efforts in deference to the Bureau’s extensive initial rule-making process now find their deference betrayed and used as an excuse to avoid any action.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">States should not expect significant action from the Bureau in the near term.  After Kraninger’s 50-49 </span><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/finance/420096-senate-confirms-kraninger-to-lead-consumer-bureau-in-partisan-vote"><span style="font-weight: 400">confirmation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> vote, she enjoys a five year term—allowing her to protect Americans’ longstanding freedom to be fleeced by bad deals for years to come.  At the least there are some early signs that States may soon take action to protect their citizens despite the federal flight from the field.  For example, Nevada has two pieces of legislation pending to address payday lending problems. Senator Cancela’s </span><a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/80th2019/Bill/6345/Text"><span style="font-weight: 400">Bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> proposes to, among other things, fund the creation of a database to track payday lending activity in Nevada.  The measure would likely make state regulators more </span><a href="https://lasvegassun.com/news/2018/sep/10/nevada-lawmakers-must-step-up-on-payday-lending/"><span style="font-weight: 400">effective</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in overseeing Nevada’s lenders.  Another </span><a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/80th2019/Bill/6156/Text"><span style="font-weight: 400">Bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, introduced by Assemblywoman Swank, proposes to simply cap interest rates at 36 percent, the same rate used in the Military Lending Act. If enacted, Swank’s legislation would add Nevada to the list of States with </span><a href="https://www.responsiblelending.org/research-publication/map-us-payday-interest-rates"><span style="font-weight: 400">rate caps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> on payday loans.  In considering how to proceed to best protect their citizens, States should no longer defer to the federal Bureau charged with responsibility for protecting consumers.</span>

		<title>International Criminal Court Struggles to be Effective or Legitimate</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On March 24, 2016, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (“ICTY”) <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2016/03/former-bosnian-serb-leader-karadzic-convicted-of-genocide-crimes-against-humanity/">convicted Radovan Karadžić</a>, a former Bosnian Serb political leader, of genocide, crimes against humanity, and violations of the laws or customs of war. Almost exactly three years later, on March 20, 2019, the Appeals Chamber of the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2019/03/radovan-karadzic-sentenced-to-life-in-prison/">upheld his conviction</a> and even increased his sentence from 40 years to life in prison.

Since its establishment over two decades ago, the ICTY has successfully indicted 161 individuals. Of these indictees, 90 have been convicted and 18 acquitted. History will judge the ICTY as a success in bringing to account those who committed some of the most heinous crimes during the war in the former Yugoslavia. However, the ICTY’s permanent successor tribunal - the International Criminal Court (“ICC”) - is struggling to sustain any perceptible notion of success. The Court has convicted fewer than ten people and acquitted four since its establishment 17 years ago. The recent acquittal of former President of the Ivory Coast, Laurent Gbagbo, sheds further light on the shortcomings of the ICC.

In January of this year, the ICC <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2019/01/icc-acquits-former-ivorian-leader-of-war-crime-charges/">acquitted Laurent Gbagbo</a>, a former Ivorian leader, of all charges. It was the first time a former Head of State ever appeared before the ICC, and the second highest profile acquittal in the Court’s history. There are many signs that the struggling Court’s impact has fallen short of expectations. But the Gbagbo acquittal is particularly damaging. It sheds light on the Office of the Prosecutor’s (OTP) inability to successfully bring a case against a high profile indictee.

Gbagbo had been detained for nearly eight years, accused of crimes against humanity committed during the <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2013/10/un-rights-expert-victims-of-ivory-coast-election-violence-must-not-be-forgotten/">violence that followed his defeat</a> in the 2010 Ivory Coast presidential elections. As <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2010/12/eu-adopts-sanctions-against-ivory-coast-over-non-compliance-with-election-results/">Gbagbo refused to step down</a>, forces loyal to him attacked civilians in the city of Abidjan. Specifically targeting communities supportive of the newly elected president, Alassane Ouattara. Pro-Gbagbo <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/02/23/cote-divoires-forgotten-victims">forces killed more than 3,000 civilians and raped 150 women</a> and girls. They ruthlessly attacked demonstrators against the Gbagbo government-controlled state television station, Radiodiffusion Télévision Ivoirienne (RTI), which was inciting violence against pro-Ouattara groups. The attacks appeared well-organized, widespread, and systematic, giving rise to allegations that Gbagbo and his inner circle were giving the orders.After roughly four months of bloodshed, pro-Ouattara forces, with UN and French assistance, captured Gbagbo and transferred him to The Hague on November 30, 2011.

Gbagbo’s trial might have been groundbreaking. As the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/30/laurent-gbagbo-charged-ivory-coast">OTP confidently stated</a>: “Leaders must understand that violence is no longer an option to retain or gain power. The time of impunity for these crimes is over.”

However, the anticipation of justice quickly evaporated at trial. Before the Defense even presented its case, the charges were dropped. The Prosecutor had presented 82 witnesses during 231 days of court hearings, and submitted thousands of evidentiary documents, yet the judges found insufficient evidence to prove that Gbagbo was directly responsible for the violence.

This monumental defeat for the OTP is reminiscent of the 2018 acquittal of former Vice-President of the Central African Republic, Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo. <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2016/03/jurist-the-case-of-the/">Bemba was convicted</a> of war crimes and crimes against humanity, but the <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2018/06/icc-appeals-chamber-acquits-former-congolese-politician-of-war-crimes/">conviction was appealed and overturned</a>. The Appeals Chamber declared that certain crimes for which Bemba was convicted fell outside the scope of facts and circumstances described in the ICC Statute. Consequently, Bemba was acquitted of the remaining charges. For the victims it was a devastating ruling.

While these high-profile acquittals can be seen as a setback for justice, they also highlight concerns about the Court’s viability. Despite important achievements, the International Criminal Court remains in jeopardy.

Exactly 124 countries are State Parties to the Court and consent to its jurisdiction. However, some of the most important and populous states - the United States, China, India, Russia, Israel and Indonesia have yet to cede to the Court’s jurisdiction. Three of these countries are permanent  members of the UN Security Council.

The United States has been particularly disparaging of the Court. While U.S. objections have been clear for years, the current National Security Advisor, John Bolton, has used incendiary rhetoric to <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2018/09/aclu-files-foia-request-related-to-bolton-comments-on-icc/">declare the ICC “illegitimate”</a> and threatened the arrest of Court personnel if it pursues criminal charges against U.S. military and intelligence staff for alleged war crimes committed in Afghanistan.

Without full support of the Security Council, the ICC’s authority will continue to be challenged. The Security Council has been deaf to the Court’s request for assistance in enforcing arrest warrants. Sudan is a telling example. Despite an <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2009/03/icc-issues-sudan-president-arrest/">outstanding ICC arrest warrant</a> for Sudanese President Omar Al-Bashir, thirty-three countries to date have refused to enforce it. Of these, ten are State Parties to the ICC. The Security Council has done absolutely nothing to sanction non-cooperation, despite UNSC Resolution 1593, which urges <em>all</em> states to cooperate with the ICC in relation to the Sudan situation. The result is that Al-Bashir has <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2017/07/icc-rules-south-africa-violated-obligations-by-failing-to-arrest-al-bashir/">travelled freely</a>, without consequence, for almost ten years.

Another challenge to the ICC’s legitimacy comes from within. During the past five years, the <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2019/03/philippines-withdraws-from-icc/">Philippines, Burundi</a>, and <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2016/10/gambia-announces-intended-departure-from-icc/">The Gambia</a> have initiated steps to withdraw from the ICC (The Gambia recently <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2017/02/gambia-president-country-will-remain-in-icc/">reversed its position</a>). Others, notably <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2017/03/south-africa-cancels-withdrawal-from-icc/">South Africa</a>, have contemplated the same. The African Union (“AU”) has <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2017/02/african-union-leaders-back-leaving-icc/">criticised the Court</a> for a disproportionate focus on prosecutions against Africans. Considering that the largest number of State Parties is from Africa, the AU’s ongoing call for state withdrawal is unsettling, at best. Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, the British jurist who prosecuted Slobodan Milosevic at the ICTY, admitted that “[i]f the African Union pulled out <em>en bloc</em>, it would be terminal for the court. The court would die.”

Finally, the ICC’s annual budget of over $170 million raises legitimate arguments that money may be better spent on rebuilding post-conflict societies. Since its establishment, the ICC has convicted fewer than ten people and acquitted four, all at a cost well in excess of $1 billion. The Court doesn’t help itself when its judges, already earning a tax-free six-figure salary for less than full time work, are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/20/world/europe/hague-judges-pay.html">demanding a retroactive 26%</a> raise and increase in pensions.

Already there is movement among some states to ensure Head of State impunity in all ICC cases. Gbagbo’s acquittal will bolster this position. This should provoke deep self-examination by the OTP on its investigation and charging strategies. It is the OTP that drives the Court’s agenda. Its failures become the Court’s failures in the eyes of the public.

		<title>10th United States Court of Appeals upholds risk payments to health insurers</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The 10th United States Court of Appeals <a href="https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/18/18-2186.pdf">upheld</a> the validity of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's ("ACA") risk adjustment program, which reversed the lower court's decision that disagreed.  As a part of the ACA's enactment, Congress empowered the Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") with designing and implementing this risk adjustment program with each state.  The formula that HHS used to assure fairness of cost was a "statewide average premium" which is "the average of all applicable premiums insureds pay to health insurers in a state."

The New Mexico Health Connection ("NHMC") alleged that the Department of Health &amp; Human Service's use of the statewide average premium to calculate charges and payments was arbitrary and capricious, making it a violation of the ACA's risk adjustment program.   The risk adjustment program was meant to stabilize health insurance premiums and prevent insurers from covering sick enrollees.

The lower court ruled in favor of NMHC, stating that HHS failed to explain why the agency chose to use the statewide average premium in its program.  The court stated that "HHS 'erroneously read the ACA’s risk adjustment provisions to require' budget neutrality, which 'infect[ed] [HHS’s] analysis of the relative merits of using a state’s
average premium when calculating risk adjustment transfers instead of using a plan’s own premium.'" HHS appealed to the 10th United States Court of Appeals that then reversed.

The lower court's decision was so significant that it resulted in the suspension of payments to the insurers until a better solution was found.  This freezing was announced on July 7, 2018.  This was later lifted two and half weeks later by the White House.  Today's decision counters these previous actions by ruling that HHS did act reasonable in using the formula to calculate payments to insurers.  Judge Scott Matheson said that they were even justified in not choosing alternatives to calculate this.  Most notably, Matheson added that "courts cannot second guess an agency's rulemaking decision when it provided reasons for its chosen course of action."

		<title>Grant of Clemency to Cyntoia Brown Highlights Deep Rooted Social Issues</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Imagine being a young, insecure, terrified child who feels like she does not belong or is loved by anyone. You have been beaten, raped, mistreated and neglected your entire life. Your own family gave you up for adoption, and while you were adopted, you do not feel like the family values you or honestly desires that you be a part of the family. In an act of sheer desperation and in an effort to find love and affirmation, you run away from home. You meet a handsome young man who tells you all you want to hear: you are beautiful, smart, pretty, kind, funny, and he loves you. He tells you that no one else sees the value in you like he does and that no one else will love you like he does. He buys you clothes, when no one else has done that for you. He takes you to nice restaurants and makes you laugh. He looks in your eyes and sees into your soul and you believe that he is your super hero. You have finally found your one true love until the day comes when he beats you to within an inch of your life. He yells at you, calls you vulgar names, tells you that you are a whore and a slut. He tells you that you need to learn now how to just be a good whore since that is all that you were meant for. Imagine feeling hurt, confused, lost, devastated, afraid and scared. Imagine not knowing what to do other than to try to win your one true love back. He tells you to go and get him some money. He has made you sell yourself for cash in the past. You hate it. It is degrading and humiliating but you do it to make him happy. You do not want to lose the one person in the world that loves you like no one else. You do this even though you are 16 years old, legally a child, it is what you know to do to survive in a world where your value is minuscule. You know that the world does not value you, and you place very little value in yourself.

Society and our criminal justice system place a value on victims and defendants. We manifest this valuation in how we mete out punishment, how we choose who will be stopped, frisked, searched, arrested, charged, given probation, have charges dismissed and even expunged. We show the worth we place in people by the fact that 95% of elected prosecutors are white males and they have control and say over a jail and prison population that is increasingly People of Color.

We do not have to look very far or wide to see who our country values more. All we need to do is watch the evening news, open a newspaper, do a cursory search online, or listen to the radio. When a white female is kidnapped or missing, it is a major source of news and the stories appear daily until she is found, dead or alive. There is a current ongoing tragedy involving Native American women, who are murdered or are missing. Local police stations are not tracking or investigating these murders. Neither are they being reported by any local news outlets. It is said that these women have disappeared three times: in life, in the media and in the data.

Another gauge into who we as a society value is how we notice and change the health outcomes for varying groups. African American women have the worst health outcomes of any group when it comes to heart attacks. They die in disproportionate numbers from cancers in numbers greater than other groups.

Latina women earn 62% less on the dollar than all groups, (education, experience and training all being equal). They are the lowest paid without question. These facts should outrage all decent, honest people but they are facts that are not challenged and are not going to be easily changed.

This disparate shows that we live in a world that judges people according to constructs as dictated by those in power. They show that there are discrepancies and discrimination that take place which mainly affect Black and Brown lives. These system failures cause Black and Brown lives to stay caught up in an unfair, biased, system that is not designed to seek the truth, justice or liberty.

The arrest, charge, conviction and imprisonment of Cyntoia Brown is a classic example of how law enforcement and the criminal justice system fail victims of commercial sexual exploitation, but it also exemplifies how girls and women of color are vilified, overlooked and grossly under-served. Human trafficking is an ever changing criminal enterprise and traffickers know how to navigate the evolving face of victimization to stay a step or two ahead of the law. Many traffickers know how to capitalize on how our system fails girls and women of color. They use this to their advantage. It is past time for law enforcement officials, prosecutors, legislators, NGO’s, the criminal justice system and all agencies working to effectuate change, to recognize that a disproportionate amount of victims are girls and women of color and that they are falling through the cracks.

The vast majority of victims of sex trafficking have endured neglect, exploitation, and horrific abuse prior to being trafficked. These are some of the factors that cause individuals to be more vulnerable to being exploited. That is what happened in Cyntoia’s case. She was born into a life that made her a perfect candidate for being trafficked. Her mother suffered from drug and alcohol addiction. Cyntoia was born with “fetal alcohol syndrome” and later in life was diagnosed with a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. She was a foster child when she got caught up with the wrong group of people. By the age of 16, Cyntoia was controlled by an abusive, domineering, hate filled man who went by the name, “Cut Throat.” Cut Throat beat Cyntoia repeatedly, raped her, choked her until she was unconscious and forced her to have sex with multiple strangers for money. On the evening of August 6, 2004, Cut Throat demanded that Cyntoia go out and “get him some money.” She knew what that meant and what would happen to her if she returned empty handed. She was walking through a fast food parking lot when she was solicited by a 43 year old, white, male, real estate agent, Johnny Allen. Allen took this child to his home where he agreed to pay her for sex. Cyntoia said that Allen was violent towards her and brandished guns. While in bed with Allen, Cyntoia said she felt that Allen was reaching for a weapon when she shot him in the head. After killing him, she stole two guns and some cash and drove away in his truck. She was arrested, and charged with murder and aggravated robbery. She was tried as an adult and described at trial as a “prostitute.” She was convicted and sentenced to two life sentences to run concurrently.

Cyntoia was “purchased” and raped by a man 27 years her senior. Her mother testified at trial that she drank as much as she could get her hands on while she was pregnant. She gave birth to a child that as a result of the “fetal alcohol syndrome” would be at risk of being slower mentally, unable to control her actions/impulses and subject to reduced reasoning skills. After being in the foster system, Cyntoia was later adopted but had trouble adjusting to life. She had stability and trust issues. Understandably she felt alone, rejected, inferior, and as if no one cared for her. She had low self-esteem and felt devalued. She ended up running away and falling into the wrong hands. Cut Throat was a master manipulator and told Cyntoia that she was born to be a whore and that the best thing for her to do was to learn how to be a “good whore.”

Cyntoia’s case is an exception to the rule in that she was fortunate enough to receive clemency from Tennessee Governor, Bill Haslam. This came after multiple denied appeals, a denial by the Tennessee Supreme Court in December 2018, and sadly after spending almost 16 years in prison. Cyntoia is set to be released in August 2019. Everything that happened to this child is a tragedy but it happens far more than we care to think about. That is part of the problem with sex trafficking: we do not want to think about it.

It is our “dirty little secret.” Why do we not like to think about it? Because if we do, we have to address the demand component of sex trafficking. We have to stop and look at who are the johns, the perpetrators, the buyers, the predators, the men that purchase these boys, girls, men and women for sex? Where do they come from? What do they look like? Why do they do this? The answers are far too complicated and difficult for us to fathom or entertain. We would rather close our eyes and ears to this problem because that is more comfortable. The reasons why are staggering, heavy, embarrassing, earth shattering, and devastating. Why? Because these men are our fathers, husbands, sons, uncles, friends, boyfriends, next door neighbors, our police officers, our doctors, and even our pastors. They are us. When we confront, face to face this heinous issue and we peel back the layers we must see that there would be no sex trafficking if there were no Johnny Allen’s in this world. Cut Throat would have to sell a new product if the demand were not existent.

What kind of society do we have where we are raising boys, who grow up to be men, who think it is acceptable to buy children? How can we rectify how we are rearing young men to think that a person could ever be for sale? What kind of community do we live in where the vast majority of human trafficking victims are African American females? When these same women comprise 13% of the U.S. population? What is it about African American females that they are much more expendable and sexually commodified? If Cyntoia came from a home where both parents were educated, and was an affluent, white, 16 year old female, would she have been deemed a prostitute at trial and tried as an adult? Would she have been given two life sentences as her punishment?

As a society, until we address these issues, we will not be able to truly tackle this problem. These questions are fraught with varying complexities and nuances that are not easily dealt with, but if we want to live up to the notion that all men, and women, are created equal, then we must find a way to discuss these issues and create real change. If we do not do this, we are a lying, pretentious, hypocritical nation that really only values certain people. The Cyntoia Brown’s of the world deserve better and as a nation we owe them better because we
are better.

		<title>Women Outnumber Men in Law School Classrooms for Third Year in a Row, but Statistics Don’t Tell the Full Story</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the 2018 elections, women played a larger role than in any other election in American history. The <a href="https://psmag.com/news/how-a-record-number-of-female-candidates-translated-into-numbers-of-women-in-power">record-breaking number</a> of women running for US senate, house, and gubernatorial seats motivated media outlets to label 2018 another “Year of the Woman.” The first “Year of the Woman” was in 1992, when an unprecedented influx of women entered congress inspired by, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/04/02/us/02timeline-listy.html">as many theorized</a>, the fiercely contested Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings and Bill Clinton’s ascension into the white house despite allegations of infidelity.

When the American Bar Association (ABA) released data in the final weeks of 2018 showing that <a href="https://www.enjuris.com/students/law-school-female-enrollment-2018.html">women outnumbered men in law schools</a> for the third year in a row, media outlets jumped at the chance to toss the data into this strengthening narrative current.

While the report is certainly encouraging, it also distracts from a larger issue. Though the number of women in law schools has <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/legal_education/resources/statistics/statistics-archives/">increased steadily</a> for several years, the number of women holding leadership positions within the legal profession has not kept pace. Moreover, women are leaving the practice of law at an alarming rate.

The gender data recently released by the ABA is submitted accredited law schools and collected by the ABA’s Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar. The data shows that the percentage of women enrollees (which first surpassed male enrollees <a href="https://www.enjuris.com/students/ranking-universities.html">in 2016</a> and then went up an additional 1.21% in 2017) increased 1.09% (to 51.3%) in 2018.

The data also shows that women have begun to alleviate prior concerns that they were not being admitted to the most prestigious law schools. Out of the top 20 law schools ranked by U.S. News &amp; World Report, 11 increased the percentage of female attendees from 2017 (the percentage of women in 3 of the top 20 schools remained the same). This includes the top 4 law schools (Yale, Stanford, Harvard, and the University of Chicago), which all saw more women attend in 2018 than 2017. What’s more, 9 of the top 20 law schools now have more female attendees than male attendees.

But the gradual increase in the number of women attending law schools over the last thirty years hasn’t translated to women having more power in the legal field.

According to a <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/women/a-current-glance-at-women-in-the-law-jan-2018.pdf">2018 report</a> from the ABA Commission on Women in the Profession, women make up only 22.7% of partners and 19% of equity partners. Moreover, these numbers have barely increased in the last 18 years—a curious statistic considering that the percentages of men and women who attend law schools hasn’t been separated by <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/legal_education_and_admissions_to_the_bar/statistics/jd_enrollment_1yr_total_gender.authcheckdam.pdf">more than 10%</a> in 33 years.<span>  </span>

According to the ABA report, the percentage of women serving as general counsel for Fortune 500 companies was only 26.4% in 2018. The numbers are similarly dismal for law school deans (32.4%) and federal and state level judges (27.1%).

It’s true that some women are choosing to pursue non-profit work. But it’s also true that women are leaving law firms at what should be the height of their careers. A trend that <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/news/abanews/aba-news-archives/2018/08/law_firms_need_toma/">Stephanie Scharf</a>, partner at Scharf Banks Marmor LLC, called “a gigantic power drain.”

This trend is so troubling that ABA President Hilarie Bass launched a <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/leadership/office_of_the_president/advisorycouncil/">special initiative</a> to determine why women are leaving the legal field and what can be done about it. Thus far, the results have been disheartening–if not unsurprising. Despite a relatively equal level of satisfaction with the practice of law, women experience far more harassment and <a href="https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/jones-day-hit-with-explosive-gender-discrimination-case/">gender bias</a> at work than men. They are perceived as less committed and disproportionately denied salary increases and bonuses.

As a result, women initially like the challenge of working at a law firm (in fact, the report indicates that women express <em>more </em>satisfaction at having become lawyers than men), but grow increasingly frustrated with the profession as their salaries fail to rise like their male counterparts and they face the added stress of harassment and gender bias. This might help explain why the gender breakdown of summer associates and associates is almost equal, but then changes dramatically at the partner level.

The statistical results of the ABA’s special initiative are supported by a cursory review of the most recent legal headlines.

In Michigan, <a href="http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/lawyer-told-prosecutor-she-doesnt-know-how-to-act-like-a-young-lady-ethics-complaint-says">just last month</a>, a lawyer called a prosecutor a “little girl” who “doesn’t know how to act like a young lady.” A recent <a href="http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/study_finds_53_percent_gap_in_pay_between_male_and_female_partners">partner compensation survey</a> showed that male partners make an average of 53% more than female partners at top law firms. And a <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/04/legal-scholarship-highlight-justice-interrupted-gender-ideology-seniority-supreme-court/">recent study</a> by Tonja Jacobi and Dylan Schweers of Northwestern Pritzker School of Law found that the female justices of the US Supreme Court are much more likely to be interrupted than the men on the court—and the interruptions often come from their male colleagues, who are less likely to interrupt one another.

The lack of females in positions of power within the legal field hurts everyone. <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20161032">Numerous studies</a> have extolled the benefits of gender diversity, including the fact that diversity breeds innovation, allows companies to attract top talent, allows companies to attract more clients, and leads to <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/news/2012/07/12/11900/the-top-10-economic-facts-of-diversity-in-the-workplace/">economic growth</a>.

Looking back to the previous “Year of the Woman” in 1992, the influx of women helped reshape policy by passing the Family and Medical Leave Act and the Violence Against Women Act. One can’t help but wonder what progress the legal field might have made during this time with more women at the table.

The fact that so many women are attending law school is encouraging. But looking at the statistics in a vacuum is dangerous. The legal field has taken a quick first step, but without increased efforts and attention paid to the entire legal career of women, it risks stumbling well before the finish line.<span>  </span>

		<title>Payday Loan Rule Rollback Consistent with CFPB’s New Anti-Regulation Pro Industry Mission</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is considering rolling back payday and title loan regulations designed to protect consumers from dangerous debt traps. Considered part of America’s democratization of credit, payday and title loans are offered by a multi-billion-dollar industry that is growing at a rate that far exceeds the rest of the financial services industry.

Claiming that the studies it relied on in the original rule are now suddenly flawed, the Trump-era CFPB has chosen to favor lender profits over protections for low-end consumers.

<strong><u>Whatever happened to interest rate regulation?</u></strong>

The deregulation of interest rates that followed the US Supreme Court’s decision in <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&amp;court=us&amp;vol=439&amp;page=299">Marquette National Bank of Minneapolis vs. First of Omaha Service Corp</a>. has led us to an interesting place in history.

Middle-class and upper middle-class people can now get a 30-year fixed rate mortgage for between 3% and 4.5%, in contrast the working poor and working-class regularly take out loans carrying annual interest rates of 300%, 500%, 1100% or more. Never before in our credit-hungry history has there been a greater gap between the interest rates paid by well-heeled and low-end consumers.

<strong><u>What are the various high-cost loans and how do they work?</u></strong>

Post-Marquette, high-cost, small dollar, loans have proliferated in states that allow them. The loans are readily available with no credit check, and are easy to get but hard to pay back. These products include “payday loans” designed to get a cash-strapped consumer from today until payday, “title” loans secured by an unencumbered auto, and high-cost “installment” loans designed to get around state payday loan laws as well as the proposed CFPB regulation that is now being rescinded.

Payday loans, the original product in this portfolio, cost $15-20 for every $100 borrowed for up to two weeks, or 391-500% per annum. The loans don’t amortize. At the end of the 14 days or less, the borrower can pay back the loan plus the fee, or just keep rolling over the fee, leaving the principal untouched. Rollovers are frequent because it is hard for low-income people to come up with all that money at once, and because the demographic who uses these loans is always in need of more cash.

Installment loans are best illustrated through the facts of the <u><a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/new-mexico/supreme-court/2014/34-266.html">B &amp; B Investments v. King</a></u> case, in which a customer borrowed $100, to be repaid in twenty-six bi-weekly installments of $40.16 each, plus a final installment of $55.34. The customer pays $1,099.71 to borrow $100. The annual percentage rate on this loan is 1,147%. The high-cost installment loan is the new darling of the short-term loan industry because it remains largely unregulated. These increasingly popular installment loans are not covered at all by the new CFPB regulations.

Then there is the 25% per month title loan, which is 300% per annum, secured by a car that is worth more than the loan. The lender looks to the car to recover its loan, not just the borrower’s future income.  Repossession is frequent and to make repossession more efficient, cars are often equipped with location and automatic turnoff devices. The new payday and title loan regulations, which are now being rescinded, would have made a huge difference in regulating title loans.

None of these loans are currently underwritten, meaning that lenders need not determine if borrowers can repay the loan principal when making the loans. Indeed the industry business model seems designed to make principal loans that consumers cannot repay, so that lenders can continue to extract lucrative rollover fees. In his paper, <span><em><a href="https://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/wlulr/vol69/iss2/10/">Loan Sharks, Interest-Rate Caps, and Deregulation</a></em></span>, psychology professor Robert Mayer, draws some obvious parallels between high-cost lenders and traditional loan sharks:
<blockquote>"The real aim of loan sharks,” explained Avon Books’ <em>How and Where to Borrow Money</em>, “is to keep their customers eternally in debt so that interest (for the sharks) becomes almost an annuity.” A scholarly study on <em>The Small-Loan Industry in Texas</em>, published in 1960, noted that, while the loan shark always charges a high rate of interest, “he does more than this. He loans for... too short a period of time...making payments too high, and... encouraging renewals or refinancing."</blockquote>
<strong><u>The CFPB’s creation and mission</u></strong>

The CFPB was created under the <u><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/4173/text">Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and </a>Consumer<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodd%E2%80%93Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_and_Consumer_Protection_Act"> Protection Act</a></u> in 2010, in reaction to the financial crisis of 2007-08 <u></u>and the subsequent great recession. After creation, the agency’s mission statement read:
<blockquote>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is a 21st century agency that helps consumer finance markets work by making rules more effective, by consistently and fairly enforcing those rules, and by empowering consumers to take more control over their economic lives.</blockquote>
The new mission under Trump appointee <a href="https://twitter.com/mickmulvaneyomb?lang=en"><span>Mick Mulvaney</span></a> and his predecessor, <a href="https://twitter.com/cfpbdirector?lang=en"><span>Kathy Kraninger</span></a>, reads like this:
<blockquote>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is a 21st century agency that helps consumer finance markets work by <em>regularly identifying and addressing outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome regulations</em>, by making rules more effective, by consistently enforcing federal consumer financial law, and by empowering consumers to take more control over their economic lives.</blockquote>
Since its inception, the CFPB has regulated many financial products, including high-cost loans. The question now is whether the CFPB will continue to do so.

<strong><u>What did the rule now being rescinded do?</u></strong>

On November 17, 2017, the CFPB issued <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/11/17/2017-21808/payday-vehicle-title-and-certain-high-cost-installment-loans"><span>a final rule</span> </a>governing payday and title loans with short term or balloon-payment structures. The rule itself is quite complex but at its essence  it is an underwriting rule that- if enforced as planned- would have required lenders to determine if a borrower could pay back the principal of a loan without entering into a long-term debt trap.

Underwriting has long been considered the only way to lend responsibly and to avoid a debt-trap, which is why the new payday loan rule focuses on underwriting.  There are particular rules regarding how a lender determines ability to repay, and other rules as well, but at its essence the rule requires lenders to determine if the borrower can repay the principal of the loan. If not, the loan is an unfair and abusive practice and is illegal.

<strong><u>The Rollback</u></strong>

The CFPB had a long and arduous payday loan rulemaking process underway for some time, with both industry and consumer groups participating. At the end of the day, as indicated above, a rule was passed that would have required underwriting for payday and title loans but not installment loans. Despite this big installment loan loophole, even these half-measure regulations may never be enforced.

On February 6, 2019, the Trump-era CFPB announced <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-releases-notices-proposed-rulemaking-payday-lending/"><span>its proposal to rescind</span> </a>the mandatory underwriting provisions of the new payday loan rule, or to at the very least to delay the compliance date for the mandatory underwriting provisions.  While the CFPB made it sound like it was only rescinding part of the new rule, the underwriting provisions are the essence of the rule.

As <span><a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/about/news-room/press-releases-and-statements/2019/02/06/pew-proposal-to-dismantle-payday-loan-rule-would-harm-millions?utm_campaign=2019-02-26+FSP&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Pew">stated by</a></span> the <span><a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/projects/small-dollar-loans-research-project">Pew Charitable Trust</a></span> which has been engaged in thoughtful payday loan research for nearly a decade, the proposed plan to rescind the rule would:
<blockquote>leave millions of Americans at risk of becoming trapped in a cycle of debt. The rule…was based on years of extensive research and was designed to take a balanced approach by curbing harmful lending practices while keeping credit available to consumers. Today’s proposal would eliminate the rule’s ability-to-repay provision—the central consumer protection measure that curbs unaffordable loan terms… Eliminating these protections would be a grave error and would leave the 12 million Americans who use payday loans every year exposed to unaffordable payments at interest rates that average nearly 400 percent.</blockquote>
The heart of the reconsideration is the CFPB’s finding that only 33 percent of current payday and vehicle title borrowers would be able to satisfy the Rule’s ability-to-pay requirement when initially applying for a loan and that for each succeeding loan in a sequence only one-third of borrowers would satisfy the mandatory underwriting requirement, i.e., 11 percent of current borrowers for a second loan and 3.5 percent for a third loan.

This is a remarkable admission that as it stands now, only one third of borrowers can afford to pay back even their first loans. This leaves two-thirds or more of consumers in the debt trap.

In the rescission, the current CFPB chronicles a lengthy and embarrassing explanation of why the studies originally relied upon in drafting the proposed rule are not that great after all, creating a back and forth worthy of telenovela drama.

The Trump-era CFPB ultimately concluded that the mandatory underwriting provisions would reduce payday loan volume and lender revenue by approximately 92 to 93 percent relative to lending volumes in 2017 and reduce vehicle title volume and lender revenue by between 89 and 93 percent, resulting in payday lender reduction in revenue of between 71 and 76 percent.

Therein lies the real reason for the rescission. The current CFPB concluded that the mandatory underwriting provisions would restrict loans, impose substantial burdens on industry, and significantly constrain lenders’ offering of products.

Everyone involved in analyzing and writing the new underwriting rules knew that these rules would result in less lending and fewer loans for covered loans, namely traditional payday loans and title loans. This result was seen as better than letting consumers continue to borrow loans they could not repay.  The decision was made to keep consumers out of loans that they could not pay back, because these loans would likely cause more harm than good. That decision is now in question, given that limiting dangerous lending will limit lender profits. The CFPB has clearly chosen lender profits over borrow protections, allowing the debt trap to continue.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the continuously unsettling matter of Otto Warmbier, Donald Trump and Kim Jung Un, a key legal point has been overlooked or obscured: <em>Whether or not the North Korean leader actually knew of Mr. Warmbier's brutal treatment, torture and death, he remains fully responsible for this crime under pertinent law</em>. This is primarily because of a core principle in binding jurisprudence known formally as <em>respondeat superior</em> or "Let the master answer." Following landmark post World War II judgments at both the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials, any commanding "master" - but most notably the recognized head of a sovereign state - is correctly held responsible for the behavior of his designated or linear (chain-of-command) subordinates.

Even if, Kim Jung Un was, in fact, unaware of what went on in this particular case, he nonetheless remains legally responsible because after the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials he certainly "ought to have known." It follows then that not only has US President Trump been unmindful of such a conspicuously basic or peremptory legal precept (significantly, one that is a part of US law under assorted expectations of the US Constitution's <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">Article 6</a> "Supremacy Clause" and also various corollary US Supreme Court decisions including the <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/175/677/">Paquette Habana</a> and <a href="https://www.asser.nl/upload/documents/DomCLIC/Docs/NLP/US/Tel-Oren_v_LigyanArabRepublic_3_2_1984.pdf">Tel-Oren v. Libyan Arab Republic</a>) but so has the US National Security Advisor. Ironically, NSA John Bolton is a former UN Ambassador and a lawyer by profession. He should be familiar with this indispensably critical rule of international law.

Another key question needs to be raised in this still-ongoing matter: Where is the US Congress positioned on such a fundamental legal misunderstanding (or betrayal)? Why have no Members weighed in concerning strongly relevant jurisprudence and its derivative obligations?

The modern principle of individual leader culpability under international law has a clear history which can be traced back to the Leipzig Trials following World War I. In essence, this jus cogens principle (a principle of law that is never subject to any modification or "derogation") is the reciprocal or "flip side" of the international law argument rejecting a defense of "superior orders." This precedent-setting rejection became most evident and prominently binding in the 1946 judgments of the Nuremberg Tribunal.

Later, it was reaffirmed for the United States during the 1970-71 US military court martial prosecutions for the My Lai Massacre committed by American forces in Vietnam on March 16, 1968.

Today, <em>respondeat superior</em> is authoritatively held to be an integral and incontestable part of customary international law and is thus ipso facto a part of US domestic law. Moreover, this authoritative incorporation is as fully valid as any corresponding Supremacy Clause incorporations of US ratified treaties into American law.

Whether examined in an expressly military context and/or in a civilian leadership context such as that of North Korean leader Kim Jung Un, jurists are speaking here of "command responsibility" (sometimes called "vicarious liability"). The key legal concept in this regard is the "Yamashita Standard," drawn plainly from the post-War <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/327/1/">trial</a> of General Tomoyuki Yamashita by a US military commission in late 1945. General Yamashita was executed on 23 February 1946 expressly because "he ought to have known" of the egregious crimes underway by soldiers under his specific command.

Accordingly, even if Mr. Trump were now factually correct about Kim's alleged lack of knowledge concerning Warmbier's mistreatment and murder, it would be immaterial in law. Even if Kim had been utterly unaware of what had happened (an altogether implausible assumption, of course) he would still bear "vicarious liability" or "command responsibility." In essence, especially after Yamashita, if Kim didn't know he still "ought to have known."

Under any circumstances, the North Korean leader's lack of pertinent knowledge would not have been exculpatory, and US President Trump's corresponding refrain concerning this purported lack would merely underscore his own incorrect assertions about criminal responsibility.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Nicholas Acklin is on death row in Alabama, our home state where we both have practiced law for almost 50 years. As past presidents of the Alabama State Bar, and together with former members of Alabama’s appellate courts, we have urged the U.S. Supreme Court to review Mr. Acklin’s case and ensure that he receives a fair sentencing hearing that comports with the U.S. Constitution.

That did not happen the first time around. Mr. Acklin’s lawyer learned, on the eve of trial, that Mr. Acklin’s father had severely abused him as a child. This was powerful mitigation evidence that may have caused the judge or jury to spare Mr. Acklin’s life, if his attorney had presented it. But Mr. Acklin’s lawyer did not present the abuse evidence because Mr. Acklin’s father, who was paying his legal fees, threatened to stop paying if the lawyer revealed his abusive behavior in open court. In short, Mr. Acklin’s attorney put his own interest in being paid -- and the wishes of his client’s abusive father -- ahead of his client’s life.

Rule 5.4(c) of the Alabama Rules of Professional Conduct, which govern attorney conduct in Alabama, provides: “A lawyer shall not permit a person who recommends, employs, or pays the lawyer to render legal services for another to direct or regulate the lawyer's professional judgment in rendering such legal services.”

This Rule is intended to protect a client by requiring the lawyer to place the client's best interests above his or her own. Contrary to this rule, Mr. Acklin’s attorney put his own financial self interest first.

As we wrote to the Court, “[T]here is injury here not only to Acklin, though his injury could not be more dire. If Acklin’s death sentence is permitted to stand under these circumstances, our system of justice itself is also damaged.” Mr. Acklin’s lawyer failed in his ethical duties of loyalty, competence, and candor, which are the utmost expectations of an attorney, and caused the system to break down in the worst possible way.

First, Mr. Acklin’s attorney failed in his duty of competence. Widely accepted standards at the time of Mr. Acklin’s trial required Mr. Acklin’s attorney to conduct a thorough mitigation investigation. Such an investigation would have revealed the childhood abuse months before trial, rather than two days before. Had Mr. Acklin’s attorney discovered this critical evidence at the outset, he could have avoided becoming financially dependent on the perpetrator of the abuse.

Second, Mr. Acklin’s attorney violated his duty of loyalty to his client in a way that was acute and obvious. Just two days before trial, Mr. Acklin’s attorney met with Mr. Acklin’s mother alone. For the first time, she revealed that Mr. Acklin’s father had abused her, Mr. Acklin, and Mr. Acklin’s brothers, including with physical violence. At times, Mr. Acklin’s father threatened to kill Mr. Acklin at gunpoint.

Mr. Acklin’s attorney understood that this information would be critical mitigation evidence that could be used to save his client’s life, so he asked Mr. Acklin’s father if he would testify about it. Mr. Acklin’s father responded that if the attorney went down this road, he would be “done helping with this case.” When Mr. Acklin’s attorney chose to do the bidding of the abuser, Mr. Acklin’s right to conflict-free counsel was violated.

Third, Mr. Acklin’s attorney failed to uphold the duty of candor. After Mr. Acklin was convicted, the attorney called Mr. Acklin’s father to testify before the jury for the penalty phase. Mr. Acklin’s father testified that he was “overly protective, really a father who loves his children,” and that Mr. Acklin was raised in “a God-fearing home.” Mr. Acklin’s father left the impression that Mr. Acklin’s childhood was unremarkable. The jury voted 10 to 2 for death, the absolute minimum needed to make a death penalty recommendation in Alabama.

At the sentencing hearing before the judge, Mr. Acklin’s attorney again made the unconscionable decision to have Mr. Acklin’s father address the court. Mr. Acklin’s father reiterated that Mr. Acklin was raised in a “Christian home” with “good values.” The judge expressly relied on Mr. Acklin’s father’s false testimony in sentencing Mr. Acklin to die. The court noted that “most killers” were the products of abusive childhoods, but Mr. Acklin was “exposed to all of the values that are central to an ordered society; however, he chose to reject them.” Mr. Acklin’s attorney knew that the father’s testimony was false and that the court’s conclusions were incorrect, but he stood mute.

There is no dispute that Mr. Acklin was convicted of a serious crime. But when someone is accused of such a crime, it is even more important to uphold our Constitution. Regardless of one’s views about the death penalty, this case cannot represent the way our government may go about ending a human life. For that reason, we have urged the Court to accept Mr. Acklin’s petition, enforce the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, and safeguard the legitimacy of our criminal justice system.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Toledo, Ohio residents last month overwhelmingly <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2019/02/toledo-voters-approve-legal-rights-for-lake-erie/">voted</a> in favor of the innovative <a href="http://www.lakeerieaction.org/?fbclid=IwAR3-O0Dc-EvKWmm61ZIZw58Qoa6uXrCBeFlPuXF1kHCzzMjbYCwP58mav0E">Lake Erie Bill of Rights</a> (LEBOR), an amendment to the city charter which declares Lake Erie has enforceable legal rights. What that vote signals may turn out to be more important to Lake Erie than the well-intentioned but legally flawed LEBOR itself.

LEBOR states that Lake Erie has the right to exist, flourish and naturally evolve, and that the people of the City of Toledo have the right to a clean and healthy environment, including a clean and healthy Lake Erie. LEBOR prohibits any corporation (defined to include any business) or government from violating these rights, and it allows the city or any resident of the city to sue in state court to enforce these rights and prohibition. The amendment further provides that Lake Erie itself may enforce its rights, as a named plaintiff and real party in interest, through a suit brought by the city or any resident of the city. A corporation or government that violates the LEBOR rights or prohibition is subject to criminal fines and strict liability for all harms resulting from its violations, including damages for the cost of restoring Lake Erie.

A law recognizing that a natural resource has enforceable legal rights is highly unusual, if not unique, in the United States. However, the concept is neither unprecedented nor new. So-called “<a href="http://therightsofnature.org/what-is-rights-of-nature/">rights of nature</a>” laws have gained a foothold in some foreign nations, including Ecuador, New Zealand and Bolivia. Nearly half a century ago, Professor Christopher Stone wrote a provocative and influential law review article titled <em><a href="https://iseethics.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/stone-christopher-d-should-trees-have-standing.pdf">Should Trees Have Standing?</a>,</em> and U.S. Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas in a <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15417249624067275504&amp;q=sierra+club+v+morton&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39">dissenting opinion</a> asserted that natural objects should have standing to sue for their own protection.

<span style="text-decoration: underline"><em>Legal Validity of LEBOR</em></span>

Lake Erie in recent years has been plagued by <a href="https://greatlakes.org/campaigns/lake-erie-algae-blooms/">harmful algal blooms</a> (HABs) caused by excessive nutrient loading to the lake and its tributaries, resulting in ecologic and economic damage and threatening public health. LEBOR purports to provide another legal tool in the fight to protect Lake Erie from HABs and nutrient pollution, going beyond environmental statutes and common law claims such as public nuisance and the public trust doctrine. In my view, however, LEBOR suffers from multiple legal flaws that likely will thwart its good intentions. Let me highlight just a few.
<ul>
 	<li>LEBOR creates a cause of action to be heard in the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas, an Ohio state trial court. But LEBOR, as an amendment to the City of Toledo charter, is merely a municipal law.  A municipality cannot create a new cause of action in state court.</li>
 	<li>According to LEBOR, no permit or authorization issued by a federal or state entity is valid in Toledo if it would violate rights under LEBOR; corporations which violate LEBOR cannot assert preemption by state or federal laws as a defense; and state laws are valid in Toledo only to the extent they do not conflict with the terms of LEBOR. So, for example, under LEBOR a corporation sued with violating the rights of a clean and healthy Lake Erie by discharging pollutants into a Lake Erie tributary could not defend itself on the basis the discharge of pollutants was authorized by a Clean Water Act permit issued by Ohio EPA or U.S. EPA. LEBOR impermissibly turns principles of preemption and the Supremacy Clause on their heads. Municipal law cannot trump state or federal law.</li>
 	<li>The rights of nature asserted in LEBOR cover the entire Lake Erie watershed, which extends far beyond the City of Toledo borders to include much of northern Ohio, parts of four other states (Indiana, Michigan, New York and Pennsylvania), and a significant portion of the province of Ontario, Canada. A municipality in one state cannot extra-territorially make law for other states and nations.</li>
</ul>
A farm <a href="https://www.ocj.com/2019/02/wood-county-farmer-files-lawsuit-challenging-lebor-legality/">filed</a> a lawsuit against the City of Toledo the day after the election challenging LEBOR as unlawful, asserting multiple claims under the U.S. Constitution and various Ohio state laws. More litigation over LEBOR is likely to follow. That LEBOR will withstand such legal challenges and be enforced is questionable at best.

<span style="text-decoration: underline"><em>The Importance of LEBOR</em></span>

So why do I think the vote for LEBOR is nonetheless important? Because it signals that the people of Toledo – in the immortal words of the Howard Beale character in the classic film <em>Network</em> – are mad as hell and they’re not going to take it anymore.

Lake Erie was a polluted mess prior to the enactment of the federal <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/33/chapter-26">Clean Water Act</a> in 1972. But largely due to that statute’s regulation of industrial and municipal point source polluters, Lake Erie became demonstrably cleaner. Since the turn of this century, though, HABs have been growing increasingly prevalent in Lake Erie. The thick green scum has been particularly troublesome in the western basin near Toledo, which is the shallowest and warmest part of the lake and receives the most nutrient loading. The excessive algae adversely impacts recreation, tourism, fishing, lakefront property values, and aquatic life. Perhaps most importantly, HABs can produce toxins that can cause illness or even death to humans. In August 2014, nearly half a million persons in the Toledo area were <a href="https://www.ecowatch.com/toxic-algae-bloom-leaves-500-000-without-drinking-water-in-ohio-1881940537.html">left without safe public drinking water</a> for 2 ½ days when elevated levels of the toxin microcystin were detected in the city’s drinking water system.

Scientists say that the principal cause of the HABs in Lake Erie is excess nutrients entering the lake and its tributaries, primarily from agricultural stormwater runoff of manure and fertilizer. The solution, they agree, is to significantly reduce the amount of nutrients entering the lake, especially from agricultural runoff. Unfortunately, the federal Clean Water Act does not regulate nonpoint source pollution such as agricultural runoff; instead, regulation of agricultural runoff is left to state law. But Ohio, like many farm states, traditionally has been reluctant to regulate agricultural pollution. And nearly five years after the Toledo drinking water crisis, not much has changed. Ohio legislators and agencies have done little to regulate agricultural runoff, and HABs continue to choke Lake Erie every summer or fall.

Last month’s vote for LEBOR signals that the people of Toledo are tired of waiting for their state government to take action, so they are trying to take matters into their own hands. Hopefully, Ohio’s elected officials, and the agency personnel they appoint, will get the message: Either take action to reduce nutrient loading to Lake Erie by regulating agricultural runoff, or the people of Toledo – and the many other voters in Ohio who care about Lake Erie -- will cast their ballots in the next election against those who failed to take the steps needed to solve the HABs problem in Lake Erie.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Much needed legislation, which reins-in use of algorithms to determine who stays in jail pending trial and who gets out, recently passed in the Idaho legislature. <a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2019/legislation/h0118/">House Bill 118</a>, sponsored by Representative Greg Chaney (R-Caldwell), is first-of-its-kind legislation that addresses inherent flaws in the criminal justice system. The bill calls for the algorithms to be transparent and certified free of any bias. It’s a good start to addressing a problem that has afflicted not only Idaho, but the entire nation.

What are these algorithms and how do they work?  They start by taking data concerning individuals who have been previously involved in the criminal justice system and then breaking it down into categories. A typical risk assessment tool will have around ten factors, including the number of previous convictions in a person's criminal history, but there can be as many as 200. For example, age is a factor that correlates highly to the probability that a defendant is going to flee or commit a new crime while out on bail. (It should also be pointed out that age is one of the biggest predictors in criminal justice. Individuals typically "age out" of crime as they get older.)  Regression analysis is then performed on the data, which reveals mathematical correlations. After the entirety of data is analyzed, an overall risk score is produced, which is then given to judges.

There are a number of fundamental problems with the algorithms. Generally, their analyses are not shared with either the public or criminal defendants. They don’t get to see the data that was used to build these tools. Also, they are not allowed to examine the regression analysis, nor are they permitted to perform even basic checks on the data, such as confirming the math.

As to why this is the case, the reasons lie in the murky world of corporate self-interest. In many instances, for-profit corporations are the builders of the algorithms, which includes <a href="https://www.equivant.com">COMPAS</a> and <a href="https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2019/1/28/when-philanthropy-is-not-enough-a-top-billionaire-donor-couple-take-a-broader-approach-to-impact">Arnold Ventures</a>, LLC. These entities are fearful of others stealing their information and building their own algorithms, thus taking them out of the game. Also, the algorithms are often constructed from information gleaned from FBI crime files, as well as state and local criminal history databases. Builders and users of the algorithms are claiming that existing laws prohibit disclosure of such information to the public. In addition, these same <a href="https://www.stanfordlawreview.org/print/article/life-liberty-and-trade-secrets">algorithm proprietors are asserting they are trade secrets</a> and thus protected from disclosure.

Another issue is that the majority of algorithms used around the country have never been tested for racial or other bias. Arnold Ventures had a research center called <a href="https://www.rti.org/">RTI International</a> perform a study, which unsurprisingly, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3168452">concluded that their risk assessment tool was free of bias</a>. Conversely, legitimate researchers from <em>ProPublica</em> found just the opposite for the COMPAS tool, damningly concluding that it was, in fact, “<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing">biased against blacks</a>.”

To my knowledge, there are few risk assessment tools that have ever been tested for racial bias. Despite their being deployed in dozens of jurisdictions across the country from Virginia to California, rarely, if at all, has anyone even bothered to check on what should be a foundational aspect of the other algorithms. Because of this systemic oversight, we can't really know if the tools are inherently biased, but there is evidence to suggest they are.

Yet another problem is that risk assessment algorithms don't seem to deliver on what they promise to achieve. They have been widely touted as being effective in decreasing pretrial incarceration and reducing new crimes while out on bail. However, after examining a variety of such tools, a <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3016088">paper published by the Minnesota Law Review</a> concluded that they largely have little to no positive effect on the system, while even having a negative effect in a substantial number of cases.

Idaho's House Bill 118 attempts to solve these problems by first requiring that the algorithms are free of bias before they are used. Even more important, it calls for making the data behind them open-source. This will have a profound effect across the country, as it will allow researchers to conduct bona fide analyses as to whether these ubiquitous tools truly work and whether or not they address the glaring problem of racial bias in our criminal justice system.

H-118's call for nationwide transparency echoes <a href="https://ainowinstitute.org/AI_Now_2017_Report.pdf">recommendations made more than two years ago by New York University's AI Now Institute</a>, which declared, “Core public agencies, such as those responsible for criminal justice, healthcare, welfare, and education (e.g., ‘high stakes’ domains) should no longer use ‘black box’ AI and algorithmic systems.”

As the debate on algorithms grows louder—even as their use grows disturbingly more widespread—policy-makers would be wise to take a page out of the Gem State’s playbook and carefully consider all the facts. If they do, they will also conclude that use of these black-box systems must come to an end, once and for all.

		<title>Nuclear War Avoidance in the Middle East: Background (Part I)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center">"For there is nothing on earth more acceptable to that Supreme Deity who rules over this whole world than the councils and assemblages of men bound together by law, which are called States."</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Cicero, <em>Somnium Scipionis</em></p>
<strong> </strong>

<strong>R</strong>ecent news from the Middle East, though generally "beneath the surface," deals with Sunni Arab <a href="https://www.israeldefense.co.il/en/content/middle-eastern-nuclear-build">state reactions</a> to continuing Iranian nuclearization and also to <a href="https://www.israeldefense.co.il/en/content/north-korean-nuclear-test-and-its-implications-irans-nuclear-program">growing connections</a> between North Korean nuclear tests and the problematic Iranian program All of this news has important international law content; ultimately, enhancing the prospects for nuclear war avoidance in the region could depend largely upon jurisprudential factors.

To begin, there must be analytic background and a suitable legal context for understanding such current news. Accordingly, the statement by Cicero (above) appears as epigraph to Emmerich de Vattel's classic work of international law, <em>The Law of Nations, or the Principles of Natural Law</em> (1758). It remains determinably significant for at least two compelling reasons: This statement (1) underscores utterly primary connections between international law and natural law; and (2) overstates the civilizing benefits of state-centric world politics, a geopolitical system based on competitive power politics, belligerent nationalism and potentially endless conflict.

This system of <em>Realpolitik</em> was formally transformed into acceptable law by the <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/17th_century/westphal.asp">Peace of Westphalia</a> in 1648.

The Westphalian peace which put a codified end to the Thirty Years' War (the last of the major religious wars sparked by the Protestant Reformation) acknowledged a world system that lacks any loci of central governance. This fearful condition of structural anarchy still stands in marked contrast to any neatly sanitizing or falsely reassuring assumptions of solidarity between states. Such a "peremptory" expectation (known <a href="https://treaties.un.org/doc/publication/unts/volume%201155/volume-1155-i-18232-english.pdf">formally</a> in international law as a <em>jus cogens</em> assumption) had already been mentioned in Justinian’s, <em>Corpus Juris Civilis </em><strong>(</strong>533 C.E.); in Hugo Grotius’, <em>The Law of War and Peace</em> (1625); and most conspicuously of all, in Emmerich De Vattel’s, <em>The Law of Nations, or The Principles of Natural Law </em>(1758).

Vattel's "first principle" of the Law of Nations is the mutual independence and dependence of sovereign states. Though "foreign nations have no right to interfere in the government of an independent state...." (II, sec. 57), these states are "bound mutually to promote the society of the human race . . ." and, correspondingly, "owe one another all the duties which the safety and welfare of that society require." In essence, as Vattel clarifies in his Introduction: "What one man owes to other men, one Nation, in its turn, owes to other Nations."

Before appropriately legal remedies can be identified and assessed, one key question needs to be asked: How, more-or-less exactly, might Israel ultimately find itself in some configuration or other of actual nuclear war? What, with still greater exactitude, are the more-or-less identifiable circumstances under which Israel could sometime discover itself involved (whether wittingly or unwittingly) with belligerent nuclear weapons use? To meaningfully answer these complex questions, pertinent analysts must capably integrate the expressly strategic aspects of their necessary investigations with the jurisprudential.

There can be no plausibly successful ways of managing the latter without simultaneously understanding and applying the former.

For the moment, all such concerns could appear extraneous, gratuitous or simply without useful foundation. Israel, after all, remains the only presumptive nuclear weapons state in the region. Nonetheless, certain still malleable order-of-battle considerations could change quickly and unexpectedly, perhaps even from moment to moment. In the always unpredictable Middle East, this "fluidity" is specifically plausible in regard to any <a href="http://www.acpr.org.il/ENGLISH-NATIV/03-ISSUE/daniel-3.htm">future aggression from Iran</a>.

Iran will not be easily deflected from its seemingly long-term nuclear ambitions. All things considered, Tehran’s confirmable membership in the Nuclear Club remains more than likely within the next several years. This worrisome "membership" is reasonable to expect despite the multilateral July 2015 <em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/historic-nuclear-deal-with-iran-expected-to-be-announced/2015/07/14/5f8dddb2-29ea-11e5-a5ea-cf74396e59ec_story.html?utm_term=.5d548ba8e7a6">Vienna Iran Agreement</a></em> and despite also the subsequent unilateral <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html">JCPOA withdrawal</a> by US President Donald Trump. Even in the absence of any actual Iranian nuclear adversary in the region,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span></span></a> the Jewish State could still find itself having to <a href="https://www.israeldefense.co.il/en/node/30198">rely upon nuclear deterrence</a> against certain biological and/or massive conventional threats.

Acknowledging such a prospectively existential reliance, the residual prospect of atomic weapons firings should never be ruled out prematurely or altogether.

In all cases, Israel's nuclear strategy and forces must remain oriented toward successful deterrence; never to any actual war fighting. With this in mind, Jerusalem has likely already taken certain suitable steps to reject tactical or relatively low-yield "battlefield" nuclear weapons and any corresponding operational plans for counter-force targeting. For Israel, always and without any exception, nuclear weapons can make sense only for deterrence <em>ex ante</em>; not for revenge <em>ex post</em>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>C</strong>ontrary to conventional wisdom, both nuclear deterrence and associated forms of nuclear strategy, including preemption, can support the authoritative expectations of international law. The adequacy of international law in preventing a nuclear war in the Middle East will depend upon more than formal treaties, customs and "the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations." It will depend, especially, upon the success or failure of particular countries’ strategies in the volatile region. Therefore, if Israel's nuclear strategy should successfully reduce the threat of nuclear war, either because of viable forms of nuclear deterrence or because of essential preemptive strikes, this strategy could be considered as an authentic component of international law enforcement.

Pertinent threat scenarios should remind Israel of an always overriding need for applicable nuclear theory based upon coherent scholarship. Among other things, this core need would postulate a counter-value targeted nuclear retaliatory force that is recognizably secure from enemy first-strikes and is seemingly capable of penetrating an enemy state's deployed active defenses. <em>Inter alia,</em> to best meet this imperative security expectation, the IDF would be well-advised to continuously advance with its sea-basing (submarines) of designated portions of the country's nuclear deterrent force.

To satisfy the equally important and complex requirements of “penetration-capability,” Tel-Aviv will have to stay conspicuously well ahead of foreseeable enemy air defense refinements.

All such recommendations, if duly followed, could convincingly enhance not only Israel's national security, but, correspondingly, the more general prospects for nuclear war avoidance in the Middle East.

Sooner rather than later, Jerusalem will need to consider a partial and possibly sequenced end to its historic policy of "<a href="https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2018/11/15/israels-nuclear-ambiguity-would-a-shift-to-selective-nuclear-disclosure-enhance-strategic-deterrence">deliberate nuclear ambiguity</a>." By selectively beginning to remove the "bomb" from its metaphoric "basement," Israel's national strategic planners would be better positioned to enhance the credibility of their country's vital nuclear deterrence posture and the safety of the region. In this case, any enhancements of Israel's deterrent would effectively enhance the wider objectives of pertinent international law.

In Israel’s strategic nuclear planning, would-be aggressors, whether nuclear or non-nuclear, must be systematically encouraged to believe that Jerusalem maintains the <em>required willingness</em> to launch measured nuclear forces in retaliation and that these nuclear forces are <em>sufficiently invulnerable</em> to any-contemplated first-strike attacks. Additionally, these enemies must be made to expect that Israel's designated nuclear forces would reliably penetrate all their already-deployed ballistic-missile and related air defenses.

Israel, and the wider region, could benefit from releasing at least certain broad outlines of its always-evolving strategic configurations. Without a prior and well-fashioned strategic doctrine, no such release could make sufficiently persuasive deterrent sense. At the same time, a too-pointed release could be interpreted as a too-explicit rejection of NPT (Nonproliferation Treaty) objectives—a Treaty to which Israel is not a party (and is therefore not beholden by law) but which nonetheless is still generally regarded as an authoritative regional nuclear "benchmark."

Selectively released Israeli nuclear information could support the perceived utility and security of Israel's nuclear retaliatory forces. Once disclosed, it should center purposefully upon the <em>targeting,</em> <em>hardening,</em> <em>dispersion</em>, <em>multiplication</em>, <em>basing,</em> and <em>yield</em> of national ordnance. Under certain conditions, the credibility of Israeli nuclear deterrence could vary inversely with the perceived destructiveness of its relevant weapons.

Unsurprisingly, there will be many interrelated policy concerns, all with some measure or other of prospectively legal significance. One such concern underscores that Israel will need to prepare differently yet subtly for engagements with an expectedly rational nuclear adversary than for an expectedly irrational foe. In such variously nuanced and unprecedented circumstances, national decision-makers in Jerusalem would need to distinguish precisely and meaningfully between genuine enemy irrationality and feigned enemy irrationality.

How should they be reasonably expected to make such highly imprecise distinctions?

In studies of world politics, rationality and irrationality have taken on specific meanings. More precisely, an actor (state or sub-state) is determinedly rational to the extent that its leadership always values national survival more highly than any other conceivable preference or combination of preferences. Conversely, an irrational actor might not always display such a determinable preference ordering. <em>Apropos of</em> the scientific limitations already discussed, however, ascertaining when such an adversary (e.g., Iran) would actually be rational or irrational could prove to be a very inexact undertaking.

In actual practice, operationalizing these potentially indecipherable distinctions would present staggeringly complex intellectual challenges and would need to take account of whether the scrutinized adversaries were (1) fully or partially sovereign states; (2) sub-national terrorist groups; or (3) “hybrid” enemies comprised of assorted state and sub-state foes. A subsidiary but still daunting task would be to ascertain the effective ratio of decision-making responsibilities among all hybridized foes.

How should this multi-layered assessment be carried out?

In principle, at least, such a task might prove not just daunting, but literally impossible.

At a minimum, this would not be a task for the intellectually faint-hearted or even for any self-described "very stable genius" (the self-description offered by US President Donald Trump). In further specific regard to President Trump, his presidency itself is apt to be an increasingly important factor in managing Middle East nuclear war avoidance. To successfully keep the nuclear "lid" on in this volatile region, American foreign policy will need to be made more coherent, predictable and law-oriented. More precisely, the White House will need to better clarify its position on a Palestinian state, Iranian nuclearization and, reciprocally, on any prospective Sunni nuclear weapons preparations oriented toward deterring Shiite Iran.

This last point would mean closely monitoring and eventually supporting or opposing certain increasingly plausible nuclearizing steps undertaken by Saudi Arabia and/or Egypt.

Whatever calculable nuances will be encountered in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv (political leadership/IDF leadership), the only rational way for Israel to successfully meet these growing and overlapping challenges will be to stay well ahead of its adversaries through the inestimable power of strategic erudition and high-quality scholarship. Long ago, in classical Greece and Macedonia, the linked arts of war and deterrence were already being described by military planners as theoretic challenges of “mind over mind;” not merely as crude <em>ad hoc</em> contests of “mind over matter.” For Israel and the wider Middle East, such ancient descriptions remain even more valid today.

There is one further relevant observation concerning Israel's nuclear strategy and American national security. Although analysts generally examine the foreseeable impact of US nuclear guidance upon Israel, it would be equally valid and important to consider the impact of Israel's nuclear strategy upon US national security. In essence, though generally unrecognized, there is an ongoing and reciprocal connection between these two factors, a sort of continuous policy feedback-loop. Going forward, this "loop" should more routinely be examined as a mutual and dynamic relationship than as a merely static and one-directional connection.

One evident conclusion here must be that the suitability and durability of Israel's nuclear strategy will impact not only the Middle East, legally as well as strategically, but also specifically American security risks and benefits. Accordingly, to the extent that Israel's nuclear strategic policies could have <a href="https://sectech.tau.ac.il/sites/sectech.tau.ac.il/files/PalmBeachBook.pdf">certain "spillover" effects</a> for the United States, this country would be the unintentional beneficiary of Israel's own strategic scholarship and planning. It also follows that should Israel's nuclear posture somehow fail to meet that beleaguered country's most urgent or existential security expectations, the derivative effect upon the United States would be correspondingly negative.

Simultaneously, of course, this effect would strongly concern appropriate international law.

Any Israeli scholarship focused on nuclear war avoidance will primarily be<em> in response </em>to certain world security configurations shaped by the United States. In this connection, Jerusalem will need to pay special attention to the growing importance of "Cold War II," an adversarial expansion between Washington and Moscow with more-or-less conspicuous manifestations and reverberations throughout the wider world. If, for example, geopolitical competition between the superpowers should become more tangibly war-oriented in Asia—most notably in regard to ongoing North Korean nuclearization—that could have significantly determining effects upon Israel's nuclear posture and a Middle Eastern nuclear war.

It also ought to be recalled that earlier North Korea had helped Syria build a nuclear reactor, the same facility that was later destroyed by Israel in its <em>Operation Orchard,</em> on September 6, 2007. Although, unlike earlier <em>Operation Opera,</em> this preemptive attack, in the Deir ez-Zor region, was presumptively a second expression of the so-called "<a href="https://www.inss.org.il/publication/the-begin-doctrine-the-lessons-of-osirak-and-deir-ez-zor/">Begin Doctrine</a>." It also illustrated, because of the express North Korea connection, a much wider global threat to Israel in particular.

Effects would likely be most dramatic if there were any genuine nuclear exchange between the United States and North Korea, circumstances in which the nuclear war threshold had actually been crossed. Similar connections <a href="https://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://search.yahoo.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1318&amp;context=auilr">could obtain</a> in the aftermath of an India-Pakistan nuclear exchange, and would largely depend upon specific and still-ascertainable Russian/American alignments with either Delhi or Islamabad. In essence, in both of these conflict dyads—US-North Korea and India-Pakistan—any expression of authentically nuclear belligerence, however indirect, could immediately and gravely impact Israel's nuclear strategy and resultant regional security.

Here, a greater familiarity with certain jurisprudential principles could advance legal as well as strategic obligations, most plainly those that William Blackstone famously expressed in his <em>Commentaries on the Law of England</em> (Book 4 "Of Public Wrongs"): "Each state is expected, perpetually," noted Blackstone, "to aid and enforce the law of nations, as part of the common law, by inflicting an adequate punishment upon the offenses against that universal law."

Such ideas don't just pop up in a theoretic vacuum. Blackstone is ultimately indebted to Cicero's antecedent description of natural law in <em>The Republic:</em> "True law is right reason, harmonious with nature, diffused among all, constant, eternal; a law which calls to duty by its commands and restrains from evil by its prohibitions. . . ."

"Just wars," wrote Hugo Grotius, the unchallenged founder of modern international law, "arise from our love of the innocent." Now, however, it is plain, by definition, that a nuclear war could never be "just" and that certain earlier legal distinctions (e.g., just war vs. unjust war) must be continuously conformed to ever-changing technologies of destruction. The only sensible adaptation in this regard must be to acknowledge the persisting connections between international law and natural law, and then to oppose any retrograde movements by powerful nation states to undermine such vital acknowledgments. In the final analysis, to successfully prevent a nuclear war in the Middle East, it will be necessary to mightily resist any world system declensions toward further belligerent nationalism.

Now, more than ever, a core responsibility of international law must be to consciously undermine the relentlessly corrosive dynamics of <em>Realpolitik.</em>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In 2010, District Attorney Doug Evans tried to convict Curtis Flowers of the same murder charges for the sixth—yes, the sixth—time. Before the trial began, Evans did the same thing he had done before each of Flowers’ previous trials: he used his peremptory challenges <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-9572/77684/20181227104135863_17-9572%20Amicus%20Brief%20of%20NAACP%20LDF.pdf">to remove as many Black jurors as possible</a>. Evans managed to seat a jury with eleven white jurors and one Black juror, and the jury promptly convicted Flowers and sentenced him to death. Flowers appealed his conviction to the Mississippi Supreme Court, arguing that the Court should grant him a new trial because Evans had picked the jury in a discriminatory and unconstitutional manner.

When the Mississippi Supreme Court heard Flowers’ appeal, it had every reason to think that Evans struck the Black jurors because of their skin color. The facts of the case spoke for themselves: during Flowers’ trials, Evans <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-9572/77724/20181227144216381_Flowers%2017%209572%20Petitioner%20Brief.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">removed 41 of 43 possible Black jurors</a> and struck Black jurors 20 times more frequently than he struck white jurors.

Now the US Supreme Court will get a chance to weigh in. On March 20, 2019, the Court will hear oral arguments and have the opportunity to continue its <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-9572/78147/20190103134953020_17-9572tsacFormerJusticeDepartmentOfficials.pdf">long-standing commitment</a> to the principle that racial prejudice has no place in jury selection—especially when the defendant’s life is on the line.

Following jury selection in two of the previous trials, courts determined that Evans had struck Black jurors because of their race and then given courts “pretextual” reasons for the strikes. In plainer language: he lied about why he removed them. One of the courts called Evans’ efforts “as strong a case of racial discrimination” as it had ever seen. If this were not enough to call Evans’ credibility into question, in two of Flowers’ other trials, Evans committed acts of flagrant prosecutorial misconduct entirely distinct from his penchant for jury discrimination. Despite this track record, the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled that Evans’ history of lies and discrimination were irrelevant and accepted his denials of discrimination at face value. In so doing, the court defied both the Constitution and common sense.

The right to serve on and be tried by an impartial jury selected in a nondiscriminatory manner is as integral to full participation in our democracy as the right to vote. Since 1880, the US Supreme Court has been clear that racial discrimination in jury selection violates the Constitution. But the devil is in the details. Each time the Supreme Court has prohibited states from discriminating in jury selection, state officials have found new ways to circumvent the law. Indeed, even when the Court ruled in <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1985/84-6263">Batson v. Kentucky</a> that prosecutors could not use their peremptory challenges to discriminate, Justice Thurgood Marshall warned that the Court’s decision would not end the practice.

It’s hard to find a better example than <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2018/17-9572">Flowers v. Mississippi</a><i>.</i> The transcript from Flowers’ sixth trial is clear: Evans struck Black jurors because of their race. After seating a single Black juror at the start of jury selection, Evans used his peremptory strikes to remove every other Black prospective juror. Out of a jury pool that had been 42 percent Black, Evans managed to whittle the final jury down to a group of 11 white jurors and one Black juror. Despite the dubious and circumstantial nature of the prosecution’s case, Evans’ mostly white jury convicted Flowers in less than half an hour.

When the Supreme Court barred the use of racially-biased peremptory challenges three decades ago in <i>Batson v. Kentucky</i>, it instructed lower courts on how to enforce the law. Courts must conduct a robust, searching review of prosecutors’ superficially neutral reasons for striking Black jurors. <i>Batson </i>specifies that the inquiry must be both “sensitive” and “cumulative.” Common sense, along with other Supreme Court decisions, tell us that in any situation concerning purposeful discrimination context and history matter.

The Mississippi Supreme Court conducted no such sensitive inquiry, ignoring both the context of Evans’ strikes and his history of discrimination and deceit in this case. Though the court acknowledged a disparity in the number and complexity of questions that Evans asked white and Black jurors, the court found that neither factor “alone” proved discrimination. But those facts should never be considered alone. They must be considered against the backdrop of Evans’ well-established pattern of misconduct in Flowers’ case.

Since Evans was first elected district attorney more than a quarter century ago, he and his office have removed Black jurors 4.4 times more frequently than white jurors. In this case, Evans’ jury selection practices produced six all-white or predominantly-white juries to decide Curtis Flowers’ fate. With his current conviction and death sentence tainted by an unconstitutional process, Mississippi cannot be confident that the system got it right and that Mr. Flowers should be put to death.

Like every American, Curtis Flowers has the constitutional right to a representative and impartial jury of his peers chosen without racial discrimination. And Black Mississippians have the right to serve on juries and to participate as full citizens in the administration of justice. Just as the Supreme Court has done many times since 1880, it must again intervene to ensure that equal rights prevail.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On June 17, 2015, Dylan Roof burst into a prayer service at Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston, South Carolina with a .45 caliber Glock. He killed nine churchgoers and injured another. In the aftermath of the shooting, the FBI <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/statement-by-fbi-director-james-comey-regarding-dylann-roof-gun-purchase">explained</a> that Roof "should not have been allowed to purchase the gun he allegedly used that evening."

Congress is currently considering a bill to close the "loophole" that allowed Roof to have a gun. Whatever the merits of that bill are as a matter of policy, it does not appear to directly conflict with the Second Amendment.

Roof had purchased the Glock two months earlier at a firearms store in West Columbia, South Carolina. The store contacted the FBI to run a background check on Roof, but the FBI did not finish the check within three business days. Under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/922">existing law</a>, when the government does not complete the background check in this time period, the gun dealer is permitted to proceed with the sale.

In 2017, the FBI reported that gun dealers had completed more than 4,800  of these "default proceed" sales to persons the FBI later determined were prohibited from possessing firearms. In this case, Roof had been arrested several months before his purchase for admitting to illegal possession of narcotics. <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/922">Federal law</a> prohibits firearm possession by anyone "who is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance."

<a href="https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/2017-nics-operations-report.pdf/view">Most</a> background checks are processed quickly, since it is called the National <em>Instant</em> Criminal Background Check System ("NICS") after all. In some cases, the three-day time limit can prove difficult. As one federal judge <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/charleston-shooting-ruling.pdf">said</a> in reviewing lawsuits that arose from how the FBI handled Roof's background check, the "tight time window is imposed on a system incredibly stressed by the huge volume of daily inquiries received by NICS, which totaled on average 22,000 per day and 8.2 million per year in 2014."

Only a few weeks ago, the House of Representatives <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2019/03/us-house-passes-follow-up-bill-to-increase-background-checks-for-gun-sales/">passed</a> one of the first major changes in the background check system in decades. H.R. 1112, the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019, closes what has been called the "Charleston Loophole" which allowed Dylan Roof to purchase the weapon. The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1112">Act</a> now gives the FBI ten business days to clear a background check. If the FBI has not concluded its review in that time period, a purchaser can petition the FBI to review the request. After another ten days, if no conclusion has been provided the dealer may proceed with the sale.

Supporters of the legislation <a href="https://www.bradyunited.org/press-item/brady-celebrates-house-of-representatives-passage-of-h-r-1112">celebrate</a> it as an important step toward ensuring that dangerous individual cannot access firearms. Some critics, on the other hand, <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2019/02/17/hr-1112-gives-feds-unfettered-power-to-block-gun-sales/">contend</a> that the Act promotes inefficiency and gives the FBI the "sort of discretion [that] poses a danger to Second Amendment rights." Whether H.R. 1112 represents sound policy or not, the constitutional argument seems to be an uphill battle for those opposed to the legislation.

In <em>District of Columbia v. Heller</em> from 2008, the Supreme Court declared for the first time that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to keep and bear firearms in the home for private purposes, such as self-defense. However, the Court <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/554/570/#tab-opinion-1962738">pointed out</a> that nothing in the ruling "should be taken to cast doubt on . . . laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of firearms." While the Court found these laws should be presumed lawful, it did not provide a framework of how courts should assess whether a given commercial regulation passes constitutional muster.

There has never been serious debate within the courts on whether the existing federal background check system may itself violate the Second Amendment. Many <a href="https://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/56-5-13.pdf">commentators</a> have noted that the Court went out of its way to ensure that the basic framework of existing federal law was not threatened by its <em>Heller </em>decision. Nonetheless, gun-rights advocates may argue that H.R. 1112's time extension could lead to delays impinging on the right in a way the Supreme Court did not envision in 2008. However, <a href="https://lawcenter.giffords.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Default-Proceeds-Factsheet-Giffords-Law-Center.pdf">eighteen states</a> already have laws that either mirror or are broader than the Act, by imposing a waiting period for firearms purchases or extending the time to purchase until a background check is complete. States already require a more robust background check than that mandated under federal law. For example, New York law gives law enforcement authorities <a href="http://ypdcrime.com/penal.law/article400.htm">up to six months</a> to complete investigations.

Given state legislation, along with the current practice in federal appellate courts, any constitutional argument against the Act faces substantial hurdles. One major example is the court of appeals' treatment of an analogous regulation: waiting periods for firearm purchases. In 2016, in <em>Silvester v. Harris<span style="text-decoration: underline">,</span></em> the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld a California law instituting a ten day waiting period for firearm purchases, even as applied to those individual who have already purchased a firearm via a timely background check. Challengers denied there was any legitimate interest in a "cooling off" period once the purchase was completed.

The Ninth Circuit recognized that the law strained the Second Amendment right, but declared there was a "small" impact since the delay is short and the law "does not prevent, restrict, or place any conditions on how guns are stored or used after a purchaser takes possession." The Court proceeded to follow a regular practice in federal courts, applying intermediate scrutiny to judge whether the law is constitutional. The state argued that the law was adopted to allow time for California authorities to conduct thorough background checks and to provide a "cooling off" period. The Court held that the law was narrowly tailored to meet the government interest of public safety.

Whether the Ninth Circuit decision was correct as applies to those plaintiffs, the case illustrates how courts have upheld laws broader than H.R. 1112, even when not as closely tied to the public-safety rationale in allowing full completion of background checks. Supporters of the Act may argue that allowing the FBI additional time to conduct investigations helps ensure complete vetting of the small number of checks that exceed three days. Since the law itself does not create any additional waiting time once the investigation is finished, a court confronting a constitutional challenge would likely conclude there was a reasonable fit between the law's means and its ends.

That is not to say, however, that there will not be times where the courts need to intervene in individual cases. In fact, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/925A">federal law</a> expressly provides that anyone denied a firearm under the background check system, and who otherwise is not prohibited from owning a gun, can sue the government in federal court "for an order directing . . . that the transfer be approved." If the suit is successful, the law gives the court discretion to order the government to pay all legal fees. Courts have used this provision to <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20120808810">compel</a> the FBI to approve a transfer for a specific purchaser when the system is not functioning properly. There is no reason why this provision could not be successfully employed in the (likely) rare case in which a purchaser had exhausted his options under H.R. 1112.

In short, while the policy arguments surrounding the wisdom, efficacy, and need for the Act are fraught and contentious, existing constitutional doctrine would make a Second Amendment challenge to H.R. 1112 extremely difficult.

Casey</em></a> (1992), which protect a person’s right to an abortion up to fetal viability. The obvious answer is that the proposed law is in conflict with Supreme Court precedent. Proponents of the bill in Georgia, as in other states, aim to overturn the right to an abortion by passing a statute that directly contravenes current Constitutional law.
<div class="mceTemp">

But the bill’s proponents <em>do</em> try to justify it under <em>Casey</em>—adopting the language of “compelling interests and “narrowly tailoring” and by proposing a new definition of “viability.” The legislature’s justifications fail because they contradict science, medicine, and common sense.

As the name suggests, the bill asserts that a fetus is “viable” when a heartbeat can be detected. It locates the basis for this claim in “modern medical science, not available decades ago.” Legislative findings quote the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjc3sDox4ThAhUyx1kKHYQ6CqIQFjACegQICBAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.acog.org%2F-%2Fmedia%2FPractice-Bulletins%2FCommittee-on-Practice-Bulletins----Gynecology%2FPublic%2Fpb150.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw2kHOO4UmrSfrT0x95RvotA">2015 guidelines</a> of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) identifying ultrasound as “the preferred modality to verify the presence of a viable intrauterine gestation.” But ACOG’s guidelines referred to “Early Pregnancy Loss,” or miscarriage management. The ACOG guidelines cited by the legislature address how to determine whether a pregnant patient has a <em>viable pregnancy</em>, not whether a fetus could survive outside the womb. A fetus surviving outside the womb is the <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/505/833/#tab-opinion-1959105">meaning of viability</a> in abortion jurisprudence and popular understanding, not when a heartbeat can be heard.

Members of ACOG would likely be distressed the guidelines are being misused to support the proposed legislation. The organization has strongly <a href="https://www.acog.org/About-ACOG/News-Room/Statements/2017/ACOG-Opposes-Fetal-Heartbeat-Legislation-Restricting-Womens-Legal-Right-to-Abortion?IsMobileSet=false">condemned</a> fetal heartbeat legislation, emphasizing that viability of a fetus “occurs much later in pregnancy.” Bills such as the one being considered in Georgia would, according to ACOG, serve as an “outright ban on abortion for most women” and thus prevent clinicians from “providing ethical, necessary care to their patients.” In a strongly worded 2017 <a href="https://www.acog.org/About-ACOG/News-Room/Statements/2017/ACOG-Opposes-Fetal-Heartbeat-Legislation-Restricting-Womens-Legal-Right-to-Abortion?IsMobileSet=false">press release</a> condemning a proposed federal fetal heartbeat bill, ACOG warned that it would “turn[] back the clock to … a time where women seeking to terminate a pregnancy were forced to resort to self-induced and back alley abortions, which often resulted in serious complications and death.”

The second misuse of scientific knowledge is the bill’s reliance on the Uniform Determination of Death Act (UDDA). The UDDA, a model state law created in 1981, has been adopted in Georgia and <a href="https://www.uniformlaws.org/committees/community-home?CommunityKey=155faf5d-03c2-4027-99ba-ee4c99019d6c">nearly all states</a>. It sets out two methods for determining death—when a person’s heart irreversibly stops (“irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions”) and when a person succumbs to “brain death”—when all brain function has irreversibly stopped. The proposed law assumes that we can and should use the same method to determine when a fetus becomes a baby as we use to determine the end of life. This requires a leap from determining death to declaring human being status.

But the bill also reveals a deep misunderstanding of how modern science and law understand death. The bill tells us that “the UDDA affirms that a consistent human heartbeat, independent of life support, is a core determining factor in establishing the legal presence of human life.” But the fact that a person with a consistent heartbeat, independent of life support, is alive is not a modern scientific discovery. In fact, when artificial ventilators became available, we consistently treated all persons whose heartbeat could be maintained by artificial aid as alive. The UDDA recognized that sometimes persons are <em>not </em>alive though their heartbeat is maintained.

Oddly, the bill suggests the UDDA expanded the class of persons we understand as living, when in fact it expanded the class of persons we understand <em>as dead</em>. An assisted heartbeat does not by itself make a person alive. Arguably, the UDDA shows that detecting a heartbeat of a fetus in no way means it is alive because a fetus is dependent upon the body of another person for its heartbeat.

Anti-abortion activists increasingly <a href="https://marchforlife.org/mfl-2019/2019-mfl-theme/">claim</a> that “pro-life is pro-science.” Mary Ziegler, Florida State University law professor and an expert on the history of abortion law, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/opinion/abortion-roe-science.html">writes</a> that “Over the past few decades, the abortion wars have become as much a fight about science and medicine as they are about the law and the Constitution.” She cites as examples activists’ claims that fetuses can feel pain—about which “there is very little consensus”—and that abortion increases a person’s risk of breast cancer—a link that has been clearly refuted.

It is tempting to gloss over the bill’s purported “findings” and simply label them specious. They are. And it’s clear what the bill is about—overturning <em>Roe </em>and <em>Casey</em> to eliminate the right to an abortion. If the proposed law passes, it will likely be immediately blocked by a court as unconstitutional, as courts have blocked similar <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/16/us/kentucky-fetal-heartbeat-abortion-law.html">laws.</a>

But those opposing abortion access have longer-term goals. Arguments found in the Georgia bill may find traction if not rebutted. These arguments can seem powerful because they are cloaked in the language of science and medicine, replete with references to esteemed professional organizations and widely accepted laws. Such arguments might convince some people who do not have the background or resources to critically examine them.

The bill’s sponsor, Representative Ed Setzler <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/hearing-georgia-heartbeat-abortion-bill-draws-emotional-crowd/bzSaSrOublQ7V8wIZIk93O/">said</a><span> about the bill</span>, “Protecting life in the womb with a human heartbeat is what science, law and human conscience would suggest.”

We can debate what human conscience suggests. But let’s get the science and law right. These scientific claims are wrong and not subject to debate. They must be called out for what they are, misrepresentations to manipulate emotions and move agendas.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On February 11, 2019, the President of the United States signed an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-maintaining-american-leadership-artificial-intelligence/">Executive Order</a> (EO) directing the federal government to promote artificial intelligence (AI). President Trump’s EO <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2019/02/trump-signs-order-encouraging-ai-development/">aims</a> to stimulate basic research in AI, reduce barriers to innovation, train AI technologists, and protect America’s advantage in AI such as it is. The EO also directs U.S. agencies to look for ways to make federal data more accessible and AI-friendly, i.e., to “prioritize improvements to access and quality of AI data and models.”

I applaud the White House for joining the previous Administration, and governments across the world, in recognizing the importance of AI to contemporary society and the need to establish federal and international policy. I also appreciate the EO’s repeated nods to civil liberties and privacy. Nevertheless, I see at least two issues with the EO: it’s mostly rhetoric, and that rhetoric isn’t ideal.

The EO doesn’t actually accomplish anything of substance. As counterintuitive as this may seem, Presidents are limited in their ability to control federal agencies. Yes, with respect to the military, the President is the Commander in Chief. And yes, the President can remove the heads of non-independent agencies at will. But the President generally cannot force agencies, which after all are creatures of Congress beholden to organic statutes, to adopt particular policies. And indeed, the EO is replete with language such as “consistent with applicable law” and “as appropriate” for this reason.

More fundamentally, the President does not control the national budget. Agencies such as the National Institutes of Health or the National Science Foundation have some programmatic discretion and could in theory channel certain resources toward AI research. But unless the President successfully declares an AI emergency, any significant investment in AI research and development (R&amp;D) will have to come from Congress. That is why the EO directs agencies to “take this priority into account when developing budget proposals.” With a mere proposal, though, there is no guarantee of funding or further action.

Not only is the EO mostly rhetoric, some of its rhetorical choices are far from ideal. The EO makes repeated reference to something called “American AI.” I have no idea what this means. AI is not a specific technology but rather a <a href="https://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/51/2/Symposium/51-2_Calo.pdf">set of techniques</a>, aimed at approximating some aspect of human or animal cognition. While many innovations in this broad and diverse field originated in the United States, others did not. Arguably, machine learning owes its recent renaissance to advances by French and Canadian computer scientists.

The construct of American AI—and the attendant notion that America is involved in an AI “race” or “competition” with rival nations—has consequences for AI policy and for the development of AI itself. Consider a recent <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/11/19/2018-25221/review-of-controls-for-certain-emerging-technologies">Department of Commerce proposal</a> to restrict the export of machine learning to other nations. The notion that we should restrict not only the export of AI-enabled weapons, but the very flow of ideas around machine learning, only makes sense—really, is only coherent—if we buy into the rhetoric that artificial intelligence represents a high stakes competitive enterprise with winners and losers.

Similarly, consider the EO’s suggestion that agencies prioritize American citizenship in supporting students and faculty to conduct AI research. Setting aside meritocratic or constitutional values, such talk reveals a wide disconnect between a nativist Administration and the realities of higher education. I cannot think of a serious engineering department that is not replete with, and enriched by, faculty and students from abroad. The same is true in industry, which is why our technology companies <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/visa-and-immigration/us-lobby-group-echoes-indian-its-h-1b-worries/articleshow/66563396.cms">fear visa restrictions</a>.

I agree that AI should be a national priority. Were I, unlike the President, able to bend federal agencies entirely to my will, there are certain clear priorities I would set. The first would be to direct agencies to accrue additional expertise in AI and cyber-physical systems. I am not alone in observing that government lags behind academy and industry in technologically expertise at its peril.

The second would be to overhaul procurement. No government should purchase AI-enabled technology of any kind without <a href="https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1166&amp;context=law_lawreview">understanding how it works</a>, and without insisting upon mechanisms by which to audit and challenge AI-enabled decision-making. It defies imagination that a federal, state, or municipal governments would purchase and deploy algorithmic products without obligating the vendor to <a href="https://review.law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/06/70-Stan.-L.-Rev.-1343.pdf">waive trade secret protection</a> in the event of a challenge. We should also recognize the extent to which <a href="http://btlj.org/data/articles2015/vol30/30_3/1899-1966%20Whittington.pdf">governments make markets</a>; by insisting on transparency and accountability in the services they procure, our elected and appointed officials can drive industry in an overall more responsible and responsive direction.

Ultimately, however, the real audience for AI policy is the legislature. It is Congress that can allocate funding for AI R&amp;D. It is Congress that can direct agencies to accrue expertise and adopt new technology. And it is Congress that can thicken the social safety net, require safety standards, and, along with the courts, safeguard our civil liberties and values in a time of great technological change. Arguably the most significant feature of the recent EO is to remind us that the ball is in Congress’ court.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The clock is ticking on the deadline set by the Constitutional Court of Taiwan to amend the law to allow same-sex couples to marry. On May 24, 2017, the court <a href="https://www.judicial.gov.tw/constitutionalcourt/p03_01_1.asp?expno=748">declared</a> Taiwan’s existing marriage law unconstitutional on grounds of discrimination and gave parliament two years to amend it to include same-sex couples. If the government fails to act, the existing marriage provision in the civil code will be extended to same-sex couples starting May 24, 2019.

This ruling <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/05/24/first-asia-taiwan-legalize-same-sex-marriage">was hailed</a> at the time as a ground-breaking step in Asia, paving the way for Taiwan to become the first place in the region to achieve marriage equality. But for activists in Taiwan, the road toward marriage equality has been strewn with obstacles. <span> </span>

In November 2018, the government held a <a href="https://www.cna.com.tw/news/firstnews/201811250035.aspx">referendum</a> on whether the civil code should restrict marriage to a man and a woman. Of the 55 percent of eligible voters who participated in the referendum, 67 percent voted against marriage equality.

Nevertheless, the Constitutional Court ruling is binding and legislators have proposed a draft law to Parliament that would legalize marriage between same-sex couples. The bill, if passed and enacted into law, would function as a separate statute that amends the relevant provisions in the civil code to allow same-sex couples to marry.

With only a couple of months left until the end of the two-year period prescribed by the Constitutional Court, uncertainty remains as to what the government will do.

Should the legislature enact the proposed bill into law? Yes.

<span>To meet the requirements of Taiwan’s </span><a href="https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flaw.moj.gov.tw%2FENG%2FLawClass%2FLawAll.aspx%3Fpcode%3DA0000001&amp;data=02%7C01%7Crosek%40hrw.org%7C09845e7087a74ae1136608d6af2c6b8f%7C2eb79de4d8044273a6e64b3188855f66%7C1%7C0%7C636889002683717391&amp;sdata=bPadz8FXMsp%2FobgJta5tTtmM744zCyRJSvF%2BZD%2FwRpE%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Flaw.moj.gov.tw%252FENG%252FLawClass%252FLawAll.aspx%253Fpcode%253DA0000001%26data%3D02%257C01%257Crosek%2540hrw.org%257C09845e7087a74ae1136608d6af2c6b8f%257C2eb79de4d8044273a6e64b3188855f66%257C1%257C0%257C636889002683717391%26sdata%3DbPadz8FXMsp%252FobgJta5tTtmM744zCyRJSvF%252BZD%252FwRpE%253D%26reserved%3D0&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1554412595418000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHJjlSvoiDVkCdorwVibXSDNfGqig"><span>Constitution</span></a><span>, as determined by the Constitutional Court, Taiwan’s lawmakers should pass the bill. Restricting the right to marriage between a man and a woman contradicts the right to equality and dignity and the right to marriage, in violation of Article 7, Article 22, and Article 23 of Taiwan’s Constitution. Regardless of their personal views on this matter, legislators committed to upholding the Constitution cannot neglect the court’s ruling.</span>

Does the result of the referendum matter? Yes – the result reflects popular opinion on allowing same-sex couples to get married and the social progress on this issue in Taiwan.

But does the result of a referendum override a Constitutional Court ruling? No.

This case is not only about same-sex relations. It is fundamentally about discrimination, as the Constitutional Court rightly pronounced.

The court’s decision prohibiting discrimination is consistent with international law and human rights. <span> </span>Prohibition of discrimination is a fundamental human rights doctrine in international law, reflected in the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>, the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a>, and the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/cescr.aspx">International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</a>. Many United Nations treaty bodies and regional tribunals have authoritatively interpreted sexual orientation as a prohibited ground for discrimination.

While referendums can be an important component of democracy, the manner in which they are construed and invoked should not step beyond the boundaries of international human rights law. Article 30, the final article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, makes it very clear – the Declaration prohibits any state, group or person from engaging in any activity “aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms.” Here, any contention that the referendum result has the legal effect of overriding the doctrine of non-discrimination is a blunt violation of international law and human rights.

The <a href="https://www.ey.gov.tw/Page/9277F759E41CCD91/5edd0f9a-0d45-4069-a94c-6a5485ef9915">draft law</a> before the legislature is not without problems. The clause on adoption for homosexual couples, as it is now framed, seems to suggest that homosexual couples can only adopt biological children of one of the married parties. In the event that marriage is open to same-sex couples, the existing adultery law that provides for up to one-year in prison for violations would apply equally. A similar provision has been abolished in many jurisdictions in the world. These discrepancies and anomalies should be addressed in the current bill after the readings before the legislature.

Taiwan’s legislature should implement the ruling of the Constitutional Court and enact the same-sex marriage bill into law. This is a clear course of action under both Taiwan’s Constitution and its international legal obligations. This is not a bill seeking special treatment or additional rights, but one that seeks to provide overdue dignity and equal rights to all.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In January 2009, an unknown person or persons using the name Satoshi Nakamoto announced the creation of <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/">Bitcoin</a>, the first peer-to-peer electronic cash system—or, cryptocurrency. Now, 10 years later, Nakamoto is still a mystery, but Bitcoin is the most prominent cryptocurrency, and, as of December 2018, <a href="https://www.bitcoinmarketjournal.com/how-many-people-use-bitcoin/">almost 32 million Bitcoin wallets have been set up globally</a>.

In the last year, cryptocurrency has captured a great deal of investor interest and media attention. And while the technology underlying cryptocurrency is still not widely understood, “it’s becoming less fringe every day,” says Alan Cohn, a partner in the Washington, D.C., office of Steptoe &amp; Johnson LLP, and the co-chair of Steptoe's cryptocurrency and blockchain practice. Cohen explains, “Blockchain [the technology that powers cryptocurrency] has three key pieces: the ability to conduct digital, peer-to-peer transactions; a decentralized ledger function; and a decentralized consensus validation mechanism to prevent fraud and double-spending of assets.”

The main premise of cryptocurrencies is that they make it easier to digitally transfer funds directly between two parties without the need for a central authority or ledger-keeper, such as a bank or credit card company. Thus, no third party has access to your money or personal information. “The person or persons who created cryptocurrency were spurred on by the 2008 financial crisis, when in their view, banks lent out people’s money in wildly irresponsible ways, and with the full visibility of governments and central banks,” says Cohn. “Blockchain provides an internet overlay for the electronic transfer of value where everyone knows the rules and no single entity can change them.” (<a href="https://litecoin.org/">Litecoin</a>, <a href="https://www.ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a>, <a href="https://z.cash/">ZCash</a>, and <a href="https://www2.dash.org/">Dash</a> are other popular cryptocurrencies.)

As might be expected, this new technology has introduced a new breed of regulatory issues, crimes, and lawsuits. There are currently two types of court proceedings that cryptocurrency litigators are seeing, according to Cohn. The first is criminal cases where litigators must determine who exactly is behind specific wallet addresses and dark web marketplaces (not easy information to uncover). The second is government enforcement investigations, such as regulatory requirements, money laundering, securities law, tax information reporting, and related class-action lawsuits. Cohn cites the growth of a third type of court proceedings as more companies begin to dabble in cryptocurrency and experiment with technologies like smart contracts. “We are also beginning to see general business disputes, involving garden-variety business relations gone wrong,” he says.

Since this technology is cutting edge, expert witnesses with expertise and experience in blockchain and cryptocurrency are highly desired. According to Cohn, two types of expert witnesses are needed: those who can simply explain the complex technology to judges and juries and those who can analyze transactions between various parties (typically from third-party analytics and tracing companies). “These companies, like <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/">Chainalysis</a>, <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/">Elliptic</a>, and <a href="https://ciphertrace.com/">CipherTrace</a>, have experts with a variety of backgrounds — including, tech, financial, and cybersecurity — who have been doing this work for several years,” says Cohn. “They can authenticate the data that underpins blockchain analytics and set the foundation for evidence to supplement the case put on by federal prosecutors and agents, though now more state and local agencies are getting involved.”

The pool of expert witnesses who are experienced, impartial, and articulate is quite small. “Most of the experts were known by name and face in 2015,” says Cohn. “There are more people now, but generally there is a small group that is seen as credible.”

Cohn and his practice have seen huge changes in cryptocurrency and blockchain in less than four years. “What’s so fascinating is that this whole area of technology — its uses and what is possible, as well as its legal and regulatory settings — changes every six to nine months,” he says. Cohn started his practice counseling companies on how to handle cryptocurrency while complying with regulatory anti-money laundering, know-your-customer, and economic-sanctions compliance standards. The practice now spans cryptocurrency tax returns, compliance with securities and commodities laws, and launching investment funds and new trading platforms. “Our work evolves and changes by the demands,” he says. “Something becomes the new thing, like offering cryptocurrency-based banking services, and that changes the legal and regulatory landscape.”

Don’t expect the pace at which this technology expands and changes to slow down anytime soon. As more businesses and individuals begin to adopt cryptocurrencies, there will be more changes and, as one would expect, more lawsuits. Expert witnesses who can explain the complexities of cryptocurrency in easy-to-understand ways or who have the technological prowess to trace and analyze blockchain transactions will continue to be invaluable to litigators worldwide.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The leading law-based news these days has been the 'Mueller Report' and its more-or-less exculpatory <a href="https://games-cdn.washingtonpost.com/notes/prod/default/documents/9048a12b-2332-4645-a1be-d645db216eb5/note/6f3248a4-4d94-4d5f-ad42-8ff6ccb1a89e.pdf">conclusions</a> about U.S. presidential "collusion." Even if evolving clarifications of this controversial report should further support the absence of presidential illegality in this specific matter, illegality that could involve certain corollary allegations concerning "obstruction of justice," the Trump administration would remain willfully indifferent to a broader variety of pertinent legal norms. Drawn from both national and international law, these peremptory rules are essential to the security of the U.S. and to the nation's immutably core obligation to uphold worldwide human rights and justice.

This article will explain these ongoing U.S. presidential derogations, in the proper jurisprudential and historical context.

In vital matters of U.S. national security, certain truths may sometimes be counter-intuitive. Although the American president's constitutionally core obligation is to "preserve, protect and defend" the U.S., Donald Trump has become a conspicuous impediment to America's safety in world politics and to the wider patterns of global security within which this country must inevitably operate.

As a plausibly expected result, Trump's foreign policies, especially in their meager intellectual underpinnings, have placed the U.S. into a prospective whirlwind of geopolitical and jurisprudential decline.

Where should one even begin to itemize such a far-reaching juridical indictment? Shall we start with the President's gratuitous disregard for expanding <a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2018/11/beres-nuclear-treaty-termination/">nuclear threats</a>, or with his proudly relentless indifference to worldwide human rights? This indifference, similar to Trump's open unconcern for the nuclear arms race, has legal implications and is not merely a volitional or narrowly partisan policy decision.

Should we now be more urgently concerned with President Trump's continual discrediting of America's institutionalized foreign policy and national security establishment, or with his derivative and corollary <em>legal</em> impairments? Is this even a realistic or meaningful bifurcation? Are the mutually underlying programs here not overwhelming intellectual?

How else should we assess Trump's undisguised willingness to accept the "insights" of talk show hosts, foreign tyrants and assorted think-tank scholars over the refined and data-based conclusions of the U.S. intelligence community?

There are more distinct core questions that must also be raised. How long can this country or the wider world continue to endure a U.S. president who elevates "attitude over preparation" and freely draws his operational "attitude" from the commercial worlds of real estate and casinos?

However we choose to respond, the most basic tenets of international law plainly oppose Trump's view of "America First." In essence, this corrosive posture of "everyone for himself" defines a shoot-from-the-hip national security policy that is not only inherently deformed, but founded upon largely visceral celebrations.

If left in place and unmodified by well-reasoned obligations of national and international law, the "America First" view will prove incrementally injurious to both U.S. national interest and worldwide stability. This is probable when referencing narrow trade-related issues and more broad security-focused ones. If left in its extant form, "America First" will propel certain countries (including the U.S.) toward significant infringements of fundamental legal obligations.

As for a timely law-based remediation, only a serious eleventh hour attempt to understand global interrelatedness can rescue the U.S. from Trump's security and human rights policies from being built upon sand.

To ultimately succeed in meaningfully tangible ways, U.S. national security policy must steer clear of Realpolitik-based presidential calls for geopolitical belligerence, and instead embrace a well-reasoned commitment to global cooperation. Only then, along with other nations, could American become ascertainably "first."

In 1758, Emmerich de Vattel, a favored jurisprudential source for the American Founding Fathers, <a href="http://lf-oll.s3.amazonaws.com/titles/2246/Vattel_1519_LFeBk.pdf">noted</a>, "[T]he laws of nature being no less obligatory on nations than on individuals, whatever duties each man owes to other men, the same does each nation . . . owe to other nations." Later, a corroborating assessment was offered by William Blackstone <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk4ch5.asp">saying</a> that each state is expected to "enforce the law of nations, as part of the common law: inflicting an adequate punishment upon offenses against that universal law."

Notwithstanding these authoritative assessments, the current U.S. President is <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk4ch5.asp">persistently indifferent</a> to egregious human rights violations committed by America's allies and unconcerned about preserving the rights of noncombatants under binding humanitarian international law.

In the same text, the Emmerich de Vattel continues, saying, "The first general law tat we discover in the very object of the society of nations, is that each individual nation is bound to contribute everything in her power to the happiness and perfection of all others." In other words, we learn directly from a legal scholar consulted by Thomas Jefferson and other authors of the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution, that thinly nationalistic or nativist foreign policies can never succeed. Over time, they must necessarily represent the diametric opposite of what is required.

In U.S. national security politics, implementing any appropriately durable and legal policies will demand a more penetrating depth of analytical thought. At the beginning of any much-needed conceptual turnaround, the President will quickly have to accept a more robustly imaginative and global set of security policy postulates. Since the outer worlds of law, politics and statecraft are a mirrored reflection of our private selves, this newly challenging collection would express a subtle yet indispensable awareness. Always.

It follows that even in complex national security matters, everything must begin with the "microcosm." Ultimately, it is within the deeply opaque mysteries of individual human morality - mysteries focused on the timeless and universal preoccupation with power over death - that we must seek the most <a href="https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1317&amp;context=jil">elementary truths</a> of human legal interdependence and American national security. By extrapolation, whenever we look toward a more lawful policy management of terrorism, war and genocide, a continuous posture of "America First" would inevitably undermine America's national security objectives. Any such posture would reflect the most rudimentary human disregard of any serious intellect and learning.

To begin fixing these urgent and relevant legal matters at their core, President Trump should not draw any credible hopes for improved U.S. national security policy by clinging to the clichéd claims of American "exceptionalism." Though gleefully unacknowledged in even the best educational institutions, there remains a palpably yawning gap between their nation's steadily-advancing technical understanding and its ongoing attractions to elements of anti-science dogma. While Donald Trump cheerfully and somewhat literally wraps himself in the American flag, his endlessly mindless encouragement of intra-national belligerence and international hatred will never correctly serve our national security interests.

The only plausible result of any such visceral encouragement will be steadily-expanding global lawlessness, including international <a href="http://legal.un.org/avl/pdf/ha/da/da_ph_e.pdf">aggression</a> and growing violence against the human environment.

Where do we go from here jurisprudentially? <em>Exeunt omnes</em>? This president has demonstrated few original ideas and, correspondingly, a never-ending panoply of retrograde and law-violating policy proposals. Among the latter are various manifestly unhelpful distortions of global trade policies and a counter-productive interference with <a href="https://today.law.harvard.edu/harvard-releases-first-report-effect-trumps-executive-orders-asylum-seekers/">law-based immigration</a>.

We have learned from <a href="http://cdn.loc.gov/service/ll/usrep/usrep023/usrep023066/usrep023066.pdf">key decisions</a> by U.S. Chief Justice John Marshall that most authoritative international law - no matter what its source - is <em>ipso facto</em> a part of this country's law. Constitutionally, such incorporation was originally limited to treaties per Article 6, or the "Supremacy Clause."

We should return to the "microcosm," which by definition represents the heart of any legal system. Leaving aside certain obvious intellectual advantages, we are clearly not the same as other species. There remains rampant killing among the "lower animals" of course, but is only residually willful or gratuitous. Mostly, it is survival driven and such killing may simply be "natural." Biologically at least, it seemingly makes sense.

However, a question must be posed. What human species can tolerate or even venerate purely maladaptive sources of personal gratification? To what extent, if any, is this expressly venal quality related to our disappearing prospects for constructing modern civilizations upon the ancient premise of human <em>oneness</em>?

Often as individuals, we still cleave desperately or opportunistically to various sacred promises of "redemption." The Swiss psychologist Carl G. Jung defined civilization as "the sum total of individual souls seeking redemption." This need is not, by itself, a global-survival or national-survival issue. However, it has become a truly existential problem that we may convincingly associate with war, terrorism or genocide, whenever these promises are reserved to designated segments of humanity while simultaneously denied to other "less-worthy" segments.

In such jurisprudential matters, applicable truths can often be complicated. Whatever our divergent views on what happens after death, the basic morality that we share could still represent the last chance we have for global coexistence and secure world community. This can only be the case if we first accomplish the difficult leap from simply acknowledging a shared common fate to actually "operationalizing" our individual feelings of empathy.

Legal foreign policies will always require serious intellectual thought. Americans can still care for one another as human, but only after they have first accepted that the judgment of a resolutely common fate will not be waived by deliberately inflicting harms upon allegedly inferior "others." While plainly inconspicuous to most, contemporary crimes of terrorism, <a href="https://treaties.un.org/doc/publication/unts/volume%2078/volume-78-i-1021-english.pdf">war and genocide</a> are often "just" sanitized expressions of atavistic religious sacrifice. In the most starkly egregious instances, ritualized violence could effectively represent determinable human hopes of overcoming private mortality through the mass killing of certain "others."

Americans and all other residents of our legally interconnected planet have a palpable right to expect that any U.S. president would seek to understand such intellectual problems. U.S. foreign policies must build a more regularly insisted upon intellectual form of understanding. Presumptively expedient wars, counter-terrorism operations and anti-genocide programs must be conducted with just cause, just means, and as intricate contests of "<a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2019/03/beres-mideast-nuke-2/">mind over mind</a>."

Although the U.S. must continue to function within a "Westphalian" system of international law, the earlier wisdom of Emmerich de Vattel and William Blackstone concerning reciprocal national legal obligation is still valid. Accordingly, since international law remains an integral part of U.S. law, any apparent vindications of the President by the 'Mueller Report' must be judged partial and transient. Indeed, as has just been summarized, Donald Trump's continuous derogations on utterly core obligations of U.S. national security and worldwide human rights law remain far-reaching and consequential.

Even in our persistently "Westphalian" system of international law, these derogations cannot be rationalized or properly justified in terms of "America First."

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The U.S. Supreme Court will soon consider whether to hear the case of Charles Rhines, who claims that the South Dakota jury that sentenced him to death harbored anti-gay bias. Such bias has no place in our criminal justice system because “our law punishes people for what they do, not who they are.” The Supreme Court recently reaffirmed this in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-8049_f2ah.pdf">Buck v. Davis</a>, a case in which a jury may have imposed capital punishment based on a powerful racial stereotype “of black men as violence prone.”

Mr. Rhines was convicted of a heinous murder and was facing a sentence of either death or life in prison without parole. During jury deliberations, according to evidence submitted by Mr. Rhines’s attorneys, jurors expressed homophobic bias that impacted their decision. According to one juror, “[t]here was lots of discussion of [Mr. Rhines’] homosexuality . . . there was a lot of disgust . . . this is a farming community.” Another juror recalled that the jury “knew that [Mr. Rhines] was a homosexual and thought that he shouldn’t be able to spend his life with men in prison.” One juror commented that, “if he’s gay, we’d be sending him to where he wants to go” if the jury sentenced Mr. Rhines to a life term. The notion that Mr. Rhines, as a gay man, would enjoy spending the rest of his life in a men’s prison—rendering a life sentence not punishment enough—reflects a pernicious stereotype that gay men are hypersexual. This faulty yet powerful belief has long been used to unfairly justify discrimination in a variety of settings such as employment and housing.

Such biases and stereotypes should have had no bearing on the question the jury needed to decide. In 2016’s <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-606_886b.pdf">Peña-Rodriguez v. Colorado</a>, the Supreme Court concluded that evidence that a juror relied on racial stereotypes or animus can invalidate a jury’s verdict. Mr. Rhines is asking the Court to similarly rule with respect to stereotypes about or animus toward gay people.

Prejudice against gay people in the justice system is a significant concern. In 2009, a researcher <a href="http://thejuryexpert.com/wp-content/uploads/TJEVol21Num2_Mar2009.pdf">analyzed</a> questionnaires from thousands of mock jurors and found that 45% of them believed that being gay “is not an acceptable lifestyle.” While certainly some jurors can set aside conscious biases, as they should be instructed by judges to do, others do not. Last year, for example, the Florida Supreme Court concluded in <a href="https://cases.justia.com/florida/supreme-court/2018-sc16-801.pdf?ts=1528988564">Patrick v. State</a> that a defendant’s constitutional rights were violated when his attorney failed to challenge a juror who had said during voir dire that gay people are “morally depraved” and that his prejudice would affect his deliberations. The jury on which this juror sat sentenced the defendant—whose same-sex sexual behavior was raised at trial—to death.

Anti-gay prejudice in the justice system is not limited to jurors. Judicial councils, bar associations, and community organizations have found that ridicule, jokes, and other negative comments about gay people’s sexual orientation are common in court proceedings. A 2011 <a href="https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/1/49.full">study</a> indicated that “nonheterosexual adolescents, especially girls, suffer punishments by school and criminal-justice authorities that are disproportionate to their rates of transgressive behavior.”

Our own research shows that lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) people are disproportionately incarcerated. In 2017, we <a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Meyer_Final_Proofs.LGB_.In_.pdf">analyzed</a> federal data and found that LGB people were three times more likely than straight people to be held in prisons and jails. Another study <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5844288/">found</a> that nearly three-fifths of girls in juvenile detention facilities identify as lesbian, bisexual, or not completely straight. Both studies also found that LGB people receive more severe punishments, reflected in longer prison and jail terms, compared with straight inmates. LGB people were also more likely than their straight counterparts to be sexually victimized while in custody, and were more likely to be put in solitary confinement (sometimes, ostensibly, for their own safety).

In addition to the role that anti-gay prejudice, and possibly ignorance, may play in policing, prosecutions, trials, and sentencing, prejudice leads to many LGB people being rejected from their families, fired from their jobs, evicted from their homes, or unable to finish school – all of which can propel people toward poverty, mental health problems, and the criminal justice system.

For more than two decades, the Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that our Constitution prohibits state-sanctioned bias against gay and lesbian people for their sexual orientation. Such bias is contrary to the equal dignity of all humans and, in the context of criminal trials, the guarantee that juries be impartial. The persistence of prejudice against sexual minorities in society should concern judges, lawyers, policy makers, and the public as it threatens the integrity and constitutionality of our jury system. We must do better to prevent conscious and unconscious biases of all types from playing any role in criminal proceedings, and one important step would be for the Supreme Court to extend its ruling in Peña-Rodriguez to anti-gay bias. Mr. Rhines should be punished for his crime, but not for being gay.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400">Congressional consideration of <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/Save%20the%20Internet%20Act%20Legislative%20Text.pdf">“Save the Internet Act”</a> is the most recent battlefront in ongoing legal warfare since the early 2000’s within what is called the network neutrality debate.  On April 10, 2019, the<a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2019/04/us-house-votes-to-reinstate-net-neutrality-rules/"> U.S. House of Representatives passed the “Save the Internet Act.”</a> In response, Senate Majority Leader <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/438133-mcconnell-net-neutrality-bill-dead-on-arrival-in-senate">McConnell has claimed that this legislation is “dead on arrival”</a> in the Senate. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">There has been much misinformation in the public discourse as to what this war is about, thereby confusing the public as to what is really at stake.  The real battle is over legal classification of broadband Internet access service (BIAS) under federal law – is BIAS a “telecommunications service” or “information service” under the <a href="https://transition.fcc.gov/Reports/tcom1996.pdf">Telecommunications Act of 1996</a> (which amended the <a href="https://transition.fcc.gov/Reports/1934new.pdf">Communications Act of 1934</a>)?  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Why is there a battle over legal classification?  Because legal classification determines the scope of federal regulatory authority, which Congress has delegated to the<a href="https://www.fcc.gov/"> Federal Communications Commission (FCC)</a>.  In turn, the scope of federal regulatory authority determines the legal limitations that may be placed on BIAS providers’ business practices as well as the legal protections provided to BIAS customers.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Under the federal statutory framework, if BIAS is a telecommunications service, then the service is a </span><b>common carriage service</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and subject to certain regulatory obligations under both federal and state laws -- this is referred to a shared federal-state jurisdiction whereby, consistent with the U.S. Constitution, federal law regulates interstate commerce and the states regulate intrastate commerce.   However, under the federal statutory framework, if BIAS is deemed to be an information service, then BIAS is </span><b>not a common carriage service</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and the scope of FCC regulatory authority is not only weak but also ill-defined.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">What is the defining characteristic of a common carriage service?  </span><b>It’s the functionality of the service – both technically and commercially.</b><span style="font-weight: 400">  In the context of telecommunications under federal law, the technical functionality consists of providing “the transmission, between or among points specified by the user, of information of the user’s choosing, without change in the form or content of the information as sent and received.”  The commercial functionality consists of providing such service to the public for a fee – which makes the offering “common” and not “private.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Why is it important whether BIAS is considered a common carriage service or not?  Because if BIAS is a common carriage service, then BIAS providers bear the fundamental obligations of common carriers.  These common carriage obligations are:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">To provide service upon reasonable request (i.e. may the carrier may not selectively refuse to serve),</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Without unreasonable discrimination (i.e. similarly situated customers must be treated similarly),</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">At just and reasonable rates, and</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">With adequate care.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400">These obligations arise from the functionality of the service – whereby, in order to provide the transmission function, the carrier exercises control over the information.   Such control renders the customer vulnerable to how the common carrier conducts its business and to economic exploitation. Recognition of a common carrier’s inherent power to economically exploit customers is longstanding, with the above obligations originally imposed under the English common law of tort.  The regulatory mechanisms for enforcing these obligations in the U.S. have evolved over time – initially only through lawsuits brought by customers in court, but since the late 19</span><span style="font-weight: 400">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> century through regulatory oversight by federal and state regulatory agencies.   In this respect, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 further modified the means by which the FCC and state commissions exercised regulatory authority over telecommunications (common carriage) services.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">If BIAS is deemed an information service, then the above-described common carriage obligations do not apply -- and the FCC does not have the authority to impose them.  Furthermore, the scope of permissible regulatory authority over information services is unclear as a legal matter, and resultant efforts to test that scope can fluctuate over time as the political party (Democrat or Republican) maintaining a majority of FCC commissioners shifts back and forth.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Thus, the differential impact of legal classification on BIAS’s providers’ regulatory obligations is the key to understanding what is really at stake.  In essence, the legal classification battle leads us to a fork in the road – one traversed by classification as a telecommunications service, and the other traversed by classification as in information service.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">As a result, it now becomes clear why the interests of BIAS providers and customers are not co-aligned.  In the pursuit of maximum freedom to exploit new business models and revenue streams, including through discriminatory practices and selective refusals to provide service, many BIAS providers seek classification as an information service.  On the other hand, in order to prevent ever-evolving forms of economic exploitation and unreasonable forms of discrimination and denials of service, BIAS customers as well as the content &amp; application providers that seek access to such customers through BIAS providers seek classification as a telecommunications service.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">So where does Congressional consideration of the “Save the Internet Act” fit within this battleground over legal classification of BIAS service?  The “Save the Internet Act” would restore the legal classification of BIAS as a telecommunications (i.e. common carriage) service, as declared by the FCC in its </span><a href="///Users/briannabell/Downloads/FCC-15-24A1.pdf"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Open Internet Order</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> of 2015.  It would also restore </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Open Internet Rules</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> imposed on BIAS providers that were adopted by the FCC in its 2015 Order, including prohibitions on blocking, throttling and paid prioritization of traffic.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Why is this restoration of legal classification necessary?  Because in 2017, after the Presidential election of 2016 and a new majority of Republican-appointed FCC Commissioners, the FCC repealed the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Open Internet Order</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> and most of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Open Internet Rules</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> based on legal classification of BIAS as an information service.  The underlying justification for this repeal is both legally and historically flawed, and reflects much of the misleading public discourse about network neutrality.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The flawed justification is the argument that BIAS providers are not monopolies, and should not be considered public utilities.  But these arguments are proverbial red herrings. The federal statutory definition of common carriage is based on functionality, not the (non)existence of monopoly.  Moreover, public utility is a different body of law from that of common carriage, which arose under state law and is based on the grant of a franchise (whether exclusive or non-exclusive) to provide a service.  The Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, already provides the legal framework for coexistence of federal and state law in competitive markets.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Similarly, in Canada, it is noteworthy that some telecommunications companies attempted to distract the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission with such monopoly and public utility arguments -- arising from what I call the </span><b>false monopoly theory argument</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> -- in the context of network neutrality proceedings in Canada, but fortunately were unsuccessful.  BIAS service has consistently been considered a common carriage, telecommunications service in Canada.  Such classification needs to be restored in the U.S., and the “Save the Internet Act” is a means of doing so with greater political stability through Congressional legislation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Informed by my participation in the network neutrality policy debates in both the U.S. and Canada, I have published an article comparing the differential efficacy of the false monopoly theory argument in the U.S. and Canada: </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0308596115000099"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Technology Transitions within telecommunications networks: Lessons from U.S. v.

One can better understand the mischaracterizations and distractions in the U.S. debate by comparison with the experience in Canada.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>             </em>“<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=trial%20is%20a%20window%20zeid&amp;src=typd&amp;lang=en">A trial is a window into the soul of a country</a><em>.</em>”

<em>                                  </em>     --Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights

Under the <a href="http://www.gov.cn/english/2007-06/14/content_649468.htm"><em>Sino-British Joint Declaration</em> of 1984</a>, China agreed to govern Hong Kong under the principle of “one country, two systems,” which guarantees that the city’s capitalist system and way of life will remain unchanged for 50 years following 1997. In pressing for genuine universal suffrage and political reforms, the individuals prosecuted for their roles in the 2014 Occupy Central movement were exercising rights protected by the <a href="https://www.cmab.gov.hk/doc/en/documents/policy_responsibilities/the_rights_of_the_individuals/human/BORO-InductoryChapterandBooklet-Eng.pdf">Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance</a>, and the right to engage in peaceful demonstration under Hong Kong’s <a href="https://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/index.html">Basic Law</a>.

<em>The convictions</em>

On April 9, 2019, a Hong Kong district court convicted three leaders of the civil disobedience campaign “Occupy Central with Love and Peace” (OCLP) and six other local pro-democracy activists on various public nuisance-related charges. To determine whether the obstruction was “unwarranted by law,” the judge applied a<em> lower threshold of reasonableness</em> and considered the obstruction of the public roads, the duration of the obstruction from September 27 to December 11, 2014, and the common injury to the public. The judge also referenced the Court of Final Appeals’ judgment in <em>Secretary for Justice v. Wong Chi Fung</em> (2018) on the proportionality of the behavior of the protesters to the “excessive damage or inconvenience” caused, noting the “sincerity of their beliefs by accepting the penalties imposed by law.”  Balancing the right of citizens to peaceful assembly with the “excessive inconvenience” caused to the public, the judge concluded the defendants had conspired, incited or incited to incite others to cause a <em>public nuisance</em>.

Law professor Benny Tai Yiu-ting, sociology professor Chan Kin-man, and Baptist minister Chu Yiu-ming (the OC Trio)—were convicted of conspiracy to commit public nuisance. Tai and Chan were also convicted of incitement to commit a public nuisance.  Legislative Council (LegCo) members Tanya Chan and Shiu Ka-chun, former student leaders Tommy Cheung and Eason Chung, and social activist Raphael Wong were found guilty of incitement to commit a public nuisance and incitement to incite public nuisance.  Lee Wing-tat, a public servant for more than thirty years, was convicted of incitement to commit a public nuisance.

Citing a 2017 <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2107474/read-hong-kong-court-appeals-ruling-joshua-wong-nathan-law">Court of Final Appeals decision</a> (that imposed harsher prison sentences on three student leaders after they had already completed their community service sentences), the district judge <em>specifically rejected civil disobedience</em> as a defense to a criminal charge. While acknowledging that civil disobedience is a long-standing and recognized jurisprudential notion, the judge stated it was not a function of the court to adjudicate the merits of the political cause behind the civil disobedience in the trial.

In response to the defense challenge to the constitutionality and appropriateness of bringing a common law charge of public nuisance instead of an appropriate statutory offense, the judge stated that the choice of charges is the sole prerogative of the Prosecutor. He further concluded that the common law offense met the requirement of legality, and that it was clear, precise, and based on rational discernible principles.

The defense also argued that the use of the public nuisance charge together with the concept of criminal conspiracy in cases concerning freedom of expression, freedom of speech, freedom of procession, and freedom of demonstration could have the effect of curtailing a free exercise of these rights.  The judge stated that since the court is required to give substantial weight to the protection afforded to peaceful demonstration under the Basic Law, he could not understand how the charge of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance could have a chilling effect on civil disobedience or suppressing rights.

<em>Punishing peaceful exercise of rights</em>

On April 24, 2019, the district court sentenced Benny Tai and Chan Kin-man to 16 months in prison, to begin immediately. Noting Reverend Chu’s “impressive” three decades of service to society and his commitment to social justice, and his age and health, the judge gave Reverend Chu a suspended sentence of 16 months. The judge sentenced legislator Shiu Ka-chun to eight months, noting he was sure Shiu Ka-chun would receive proper treatment in prison for his diabetes.  Raphael Wong, the only defendant with a criminal record (related to a long history of social activism), was sentenced to eight months. The court granted a two-year suspension of the eight-month sentences for Eason Chung and Lee Wing-tat, in consideration of Chung’s relative youth and lack of experience at the time, and of Lee’s public service. The judge, noting Tommy Cheung’s young age at the time of the offense, sentenced him to 200 hours of community service and counseling and guidance. Legislator Tanya Chan’s sentencing was postponed until June 10, in consideration of a medical emergency she is facing.

The district court also highlighted the lack of expression of regret by the defendants and the lack of an apology to the members of the public, in particular, for the “excessive damage and inconvenience” that the protests caused for “ordinary folks.”

<em>Civil disobedience and “public nuisance” in context</em>

Inspired by several articles published by Professor Benny Tai on civil disobedience in early 2013, the OCLP civil disobedience movement aimed to promote a “civic awakening” to fight for genuine universal suffrage and to send a strong message to the central government and the HK SAR government about the people’s demands for electoral and political reforms. The movement developed along a process that included extensive public consultations, discussion, and debates.  The civil disobedience occupation of the neighborhood of Central, Hong Kong’s central business district, was a step of last resort. On August 31, 2014, the National People’s Congress Standing Committee issued a decision on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Hong_Kong_electoral_reform">Hong Kong electoral reform</a> that essentially restricted the choice of future Chief Executives to a slate of Beijing vetted candidates (the “831 Decision”). The October 1 start date of the occupation of Central as originally planned by OCLP was effectively preempted when, the <a href="https://twitter.com/HKFS1958">Hong Kong Federation of Students</a> (HKFS) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarism">Scholarism</a>, initiated civil disobedience actions in late September to protest the controversial decision.

Starting on September 26 and lasting 79 days until the police cleared all the sites by December 15, 2014, the Occupy Central movement—led by students and actively supported by the original OCLP leaders—grew into the largest-scale sustained citizen protest in Hong Kong history, drawing over 100,000 people at its height. This peaceful protest, later also called the Umbrella Movement for the signature yellow umbrellas protestors used to protect themselves from tear gas and other attacks by the police, drew wide attention and support from people around the world. Despite official censorship of the movement, even netizens inside mainland China posted messages of solidarity.

<em>Rule of law or rule by law?</em>

Mainland China’s party-state authoritarian <em>rule by law</em> is casting its shadow over the long tradition of Hong Kong’s independent legal system. In the context of the serious developments that undermine the rule of law in Hong Kong in recent years (extensively examined in a new <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N6xXIR99zp_lG1dxWltlMyA80B_VUgFP/view?fbclid=IwAR1XIQXGLiy9tunQap_OZmeY_hjry82p27sGW0RlNbfq1Zw3lAe9UZEW6xg">report by the Progressive Lawyers Group (March 2019)</a>), the convictions and sentences in OC9 cases are further warning signs of intensifying attacks on the rights of Hong Kong people protected under local law and international agreements. As the PLG report specifically calls out, the “resort to criminal proceedings to criminalize the pro-democracy movement to an unprecedented extent in Hong Kong has given rise to serious concerns of political persecution through prosecution.”

The PLG report also concludes there are no signs of genuine universal suffrage in accordance with international standards. In fact, an independent body of experts, the UN Human Rights Committee, has consistently raised its concerns during its periodic reviews of the Hong Kong SAR government’s implementation of its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and of the lack of meaningful progress in ensuring genuine universal suffrage and the right to participate in public affairs and to stand and run for election.

Yet against this seemingly inexorable erosion of basic rights in Hong Kong are also the unmistakable signs of the resilience, creativity, and persistence of individuals who choose to stay the course. Hong Kong is the last stand. Despite everything they have endured and will have to endure, the OC9 hold a stubborn hope for the future. Their voices are testaments to the true soul of the city, and they are not alone. When Benny Tai, Chan Kin-man, Raphael Wong, and Shiu Ka-chun reported to the Lai Chi Kok Reception Center for processing on April 24, a large crowd of supporters holding a candlelight vigil was waiting outside.

This year also marks the 30th anniversary of the June Fourth military crackdown on the 1989 Democracy Movement in mainland China. In contrast to the enforced amnesia on the mainland, Hong Kong is the only city in China where for almost three decades annual June Fourth memorials continue to draw huge crowds. In his <a href="https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/04/11/full-dont-get-used-dark-shiu-ka-chuns-umbrella-movement-speech-ahead-sentencing/">pre-sentencing speech (translated by HKFP)</a>, Legislator Shiu Ka-chun declares:
<blockquote>“As a member of the June 4 generation, I etched the incident into my life because it determined what I believe or disbelieve, to whom I am loyal or disloyal, what I love or hate…. At this moment, I want to remind those who live in dark not to get used to the dark, not to defend darkness out of habit, and not scoff at those who search for the light. … [O]n the path to justice, today’s judgment can be a comma, a semi-colon, even a question mark or an exclamation mark – but definitely not a full stop.”</blockquote>
Beijing runs the risk again of underestimating the Hong Kong people—Hong Kongers will not go quietly into the night. With faith that the long arc of history bends towards justice, they know they have to play the long game. They will curse the darkness—and light a candle.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In what may have been one of the most consequential decisions since the notorious <em>Korematsu</em> case of 1944, when the Supreme Court upheld the incarceration of Japanese-Americans during World War II, the Court (in June 2018) voted 5-4 vote to uphold President Donald Trump’s travel ban. Like the <em>Korematsu</em> judicial ruling, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/17-965_h315.pdf"><em>Trump v</em>. <em>Hawaii</em> </a>raises questions about procedural formalities while avoiding questions of discrimination and prejudice.

In January 2017, when President Trump’s so-called Muslim ban was first declared, it was one of the most alarming executive orders issued by a president in the recent memory. Trump signed a controversial executive order on January 27, 2017 stumbling all refugee admissions and temporarily barring individuals from seven Muslim-majority countries. President Trump’s second attempt to bar refugees and immigrants (or even non-immigrants) from several mostly Muslim countries has faced months of legal to-and-fro. The original travel ban included Iraq but an exception was made after it – in the second executive order – was pointed out to the administration that numerous interpreters and others who assisted US troops during the war would have been banned from entering the US also in assisting in fighting radical Islamists and defeating terrorist radical groups like <em>alQa</em>‘<em>daa</em> and <em>Da</em>‘<em>esh</em> (ISIS). And now, the Supreme Court’s fresh decision means that individuals from six mainly Muslim nations and refugees will be temporarily banned from the US unless they have a “credible claim of <em>a bona fide</em> relationship with a person or entity” in the country. This offers a main exception to the ban that specialists say will significantly reduce the number of people who can be denied entry. It should be noted that the first version of the travel ban appears to have been envisioned to troll liberals; obviously discriminated based on belief and religion. The very fact of being Muslim was the main reason(s) for inspection and scrutiny. One clause effectively forced a religious test. Thus, refugees facing religious oppression could be admitted but only if “the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual’s country of nationality.”

This revised version, issued in September 2017, seems to be designed to provide legal cover to justify the ban on the other countries that are covered, as Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the president’s order was “neutral on its face.” The Supreme Court in <em>Trump v. Hawaii</em> held that President Trump’s ban on travel from a set of mainly Muslim countries could for now be executed, ignoring reams of evidence that it was motivated by religious animus rather than genuine national security concerns, and the Court’s decision doesn’t entirely exclude legal challenges to the policy. In holding that the ban could go into effect, though, the Court raised the bar for a successful constitutional test by putting forward a legal norm that is extremely deferential to the government. The Court did not adopt a test often implemented when it’s assumed that the government has pursued a religiously discriminatory strategy in violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the US Constitution. That test asks the Court to consider whether “<em>a reasonable observer would view the government action as enacted for the purpose of disfavoring a religion</em>.” Under the umbrella of the “reasonable observer” test, it is problematic to see how the Court would have permitted the ban to go into effect given the rich record of President Trump’s anti-Muslim statements, including those associated with the ban. Instead, the Court adopted a standard that basically requires claimants to show that animus is the only way to explain the ban.

The president’s motive is undoubtedly not neutral in intent. Trump and some of his senior aides have openly expressed animus toward Muslims, Islam, or both. Thus, how much should intent matter? Constitutional law scholars – and the Supreme Court <em>per se</em> – are divided. For instance, Justice Sonia Sotomayor in her dissent cited Trump’s rather long paper path to argue that “taking all the relevant evidence together, a reasonable observer would conclude that the Proclamation was driven primarily by anti-Muslim animus.” But the extent to which specific inspirations factor more than others is always hard to prove. Further, it’s conceivable that someone’s intent or motive changes over time. What we do know of the original order is no longer evident in its revised version, so what might have originally been an unambiguously discriminatory “Muslim ban” is something else at the current moment.

Chief Justice John Roberts’ majority opinion in favor of the ban draws upon instead on the president’s legal authority to block immigration in the name of national security. In this respect, the ruling continues a long tradition of ceding authority over foreign policy to the executive. Yet, the discriminatory origins of the ban do matter. Roberts’ opinion focuses on the <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/legal-resources/immigration-and-nationality-act">Immigration and Nationality Act</a>, which gives the US president the power to reject or exclude foreigners if he/she finds that their entry "would be detrimental to the interests of the United States." Yet, to focus entirely on that is, treating one of the most discriminatory acts in the modern history of the U.S. as if it was exercises of presidential power taken by a president acting in conscience.

Roberts’ opinion does not entirely ignore Trump’s anti-Muslim declarations and its connections to the travel ban. However, he also maintains that the “issue before us is not whether to denounce the statements." Rather, Roberts claims, the court’s focus must be on “the significance of those statements in reviewing a presidential directive, neutral on its face, addressing the matter within the core of executive responsibility.” That is attorney-speak for saying that, regardless of its clarity, the court is choosing disregard Trump’s anti-Muslim bigotry or racism. Justice Roberts' view is that, the court should accept it at face value no matter what attitudes lie behind it.

That’s exactly what the Supreme Court did in the <em>Korematsu</em> case. Justice Hugo Black denied that the orders to inter necessitating the custody of Japanese-Americans was based on racial bias. The dissenters, particularly Justice Frank Murphy, emphasized that this was outrageous. The Court limited its decision to the validity of the exclusion orders: "the provisions of other orders requiring persons of Japanese ancestry to report to assembly centers and providing for the detention of such persons in assembly and relocation centers were separate, and their validity is not in issue in this proceeding." During the case, the Solicitor General is alleged to have suppressed evidence by keeping from the Court a report from the Office of Naval Intelligence that there was no evidence that Japanese Americans were acting as spies or sending signals to enemy submarines and based on this prosecutorial misconduct.

In the case of the travel ban, Justice Sonia Sotomayor played Murphy’s role. Her dissent, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, states that any reasonable observer looking at Trump’s record would conclude that the ban was "motivated by anti-Muslim animus." She appeals to the <em>Korematsu</em> case in explaining that the government then also evoked national security to justify discriminatory practices. She concluded that "our Constitution demands, and our country deserves, a Judiciary willing to hold the coordinate branches to account when they defy our most sacred legal commitments." In addition to the president’s anti-Muslim remarks, the recent complaint offers a substantial amount of public information that destabilizes the administration’s story about the policy’s genesis. It should be noted that dissenting in <em>Trump</em>, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote: “[I]f the Government is not applying the Proclamation’s exemption and waiver system, the claim that the Proclamation is a “Muslim ban,” rather than a “security-based” ban, becomes much stronger.” Legal scholars and political scientists suggest that the waivers from the ban are not being granted to eligible people. Also, the text in the first Muslim ban – a policy functionally equal to the current version – was lifted verbatim from an August 2016 speech then-candidate Trump gave entitled “<a href="https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/DJT_Radical_Islam_Speech.pdf"><em>Understanding the Threat</em>: <em>Radical Islam and the Age of Terror</em></a>.”

Pragmatist Justice Stephen Breyer was joined by Justice Elena Kagan in a thoughtful dissent focused on the system of immunities or exemptions that the executive order authorizes. If those exceptions were to be used, Breyer wrote, it would lend some credibility to the notion that the ban was in fact inspired by national security. The administration’s “worldwide review” to recognize insufficiencies in the vetting practices of the world’s nearly 200 countries, and inform which to target with travel restrictions, was in fact a mechanism to reverse engineer the original Muslim ban. The current ban substantially overlaps with previous iterations released before the review. However, it excludes people from many countries that meet the review’s requirements and permits travel from those that don’t. Currently, the government’s inclusion in the ban of non-predominantly Muslim countries is a red herring. In practice, very few people will be affected from those countries. Practically, one can imagine that Breyer hopes the travel ban won’t really be imposed in practice, and so needs to boost the exemptions to be used. Regrettably, the injustice of the travel ban lies as much in its emblematic (symbolic) outcome as in its barring of individuals from five Muslim-majority countries. This wasn’t the right case for Breyer and Kagan to be quite so rational and maybe Breyer also didn't want to alienate Kennedy – the retired justice, succeeded recently by Justice Brett Kavanagh nominated by Trump – whose votes the liberals will need on future matters. Courts may be great places to bend the arc of history toward justice, but they’re only great places for that when they agree with whatever we already think is just.

Because the case was before the Supreme Court as the result of a preliminary injunction, not after a trial – according to the general rules within the US procedural legal system – it is still tentatively possible for the lower courts to hold a trial to consider further indication of presidential prejudice. The dilemma is that evidence of Trump’s bias has already been acknowledged, realized, and found inadequate by the justices. Hence, without some substantial new piece of evidence, it’s complicated to see how a lower court could find that the proclamation was motivated – in real terms – by anti-Muslim bias. To President Trump’s supporters, this decision was an affirmation by the highest court in the land of his right to secure United States territorial borders and protect it from terrorism or radical Islamic terrorism, as he always refers to. To opponents, the ruling validated an anti-Muslim agenda that betrayed American values, undermined the Constitution and dashed at the hopes of thousands of families affected by war, persecution, and deprivation. But no deadly terror attacks have been conducted on US soil post-9/11 by any people from the countries on the travel ban list – according to research from the New America Foundation – and none of the perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks were from any of the countries on the travel ban list. Along these lines, critics continue to argue the ban is motivated by anti-Muslim sentiments rather than any real threats to US national security.

The timing of the judgment only reinforced a climate of hostility toward migrants in the West. Three of the Muslim-majority countries affected by Trump’s order – Syria, Libya, and Yemen – have known only war for years, while Somalia has suffered through variable degrees of chaos for decades. Though Trump’s order ostensibly allows for permits for exemptions on a case-by-case basis. The administration has argued that courts have no role to play because the president has broad powers over immigration and national security, and foreigners have no right to enter the country. Legal scholars have said in written arguments that Trump’s September proclamation laying out the current policy comports with immigration law and does not violate the Constitution because it does not single out Muslims. The challengers have said that Trump is flouting immigration law by trying to keep more than 150 million individuals, most of them Muslim, from entering the country. They also argue that his policy amounts to the Muslim ban that he called for as a candidate, violating the Constitution’s prohibition against religious bias.

The practical effects on the two non-Muslim majority nations covered by the travel ban –Venezuela and North Korea – are negotiable. The limitations on Venezuelans apply only to a narrow group of public officials. North Koreans for their part, have never been allowed to travel outside their country by their own repressive government. “Most people have forgotten that North Korea was added to the list of countries subject to the ban, mostly as a way of making it look less like an anti-Muslim measure,” according to Evans J.R. Revere, a former State Department diplomat who is an expert on North Korea. Also, Sung-Yoon Lee, a professor of Korean studies at Tufts University, said “the inclusion of North Korea is likely to be reversed by the administration – that is, used as a chip in further advancing the illusion of rapprochement.”

Iranians are especially affected by the ban. Approximately one million American citizens of Iranian origin live in the United States. Jamal Abdi, Vice President of Policy at the National Iranian American Council, a Washington-based advocacy group, said that “Iranians cannot travel here [US] unless they get a waiver. The waiver process is unpredictable, with no explanation of how it will be implemented.” The impact of the ban, as well as Trump’s decision to withdraw from the 2015 nuclear deal with <em>Korematsu</em> and <em>Trump vs</em>. <em>Hawaii</em> are both cases where the Supreme Court relinquished its moral leadership.

Trump’s opinions are obnoxious and hateful to logic and human experience. Trump’s speeches, declarations, and comments cannot be elapsed or ignored and perhaps now is as good a time as any for the current President to absorb the age-old concept that a person’s uncontrolled statements can come back to haunt them. The debate over the Trump White House’s attitude toward Muslims is more than merely academic. Previous presidents have gone out of their way to say their problems are not with Islam as a faith, if only to serve as a public counterbalance to their use of US military power in or against Muslim nations. “The face of terror is not the true faith of Islam,” President George W. Bush said shortly after the 9/11 attacks, “that’s not what Islam is all about. Islam is peace.” President Obama has made comparable remarks, noting that “it’s very important for us to align ourselves with the 99.9% of Muslims who are looking for the same thing we’re looking for, order, peace, prosperity.” There’s an old saying, “one bad apple spoils the bunch.”

This holds true when we discuss both the historical and current general perspective of Americans or Westerns towards Arabs and Muslims. Why have I stated Arabs and Muslim throughout this essay? They are separate and diverse peoples. Not every Arab is a Muslim and not every Muslim is an Arab. What have we seen by tracking U.S. immigration policy throughout history? We have seen that the general attitudes of the U.S. towards non-white, non-Christian people to be extremely negative and highly deserving of the word “animus.” U.S. courts of the past adopted and supported these same points of view. Animus against Arabs and Muslims was very obvious in the opinions of U.S. courts who classified them among the “undesirables.” The U.S. must accept some of the blame for allowing these radical groups to promulgate and commit the terrorist acts against humanity which have stricken so much fear and distrust into western society. Is U.S. immigration policy in the Arab region necessary policy or racial animus?

I think it is a combination of both – but the animus is winning right now. The “extreme” tactics and rhetoric promulgated by President Trump and his supporters is a complete showing of animus guised in the veil of legitimate policy. However, given that these groups do exist and that they are a real threat to all persons – not just westerners – legitimate, intelligent policies must be in play to minimize the damage they cause until humanity learns to live with itself peacefully. These policies must be consistent across all races, faiths, and classes of immigrant. The “extreme vetting” of persons from certain states only serves the message of extremists – the U.S. is racist beast that disdains all non-white, non-Christians. The U.S. is a beautiful place to live with so much promise. When American or westerns call themselves the “Melting Pot,” They must ask if they mean this sincerely or not. Do they really welcome all faiths and races or only those that conform to their certain points of view? In other words, must one assimilate to be part of the melting pot or will they forget animus of the past? I hope so. The world is a much more beautiful place when there is a plethora of colors, shapes, ideas, beliefs, and points of views.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Canadian government has introduced a bill in Parliament which expands the basis upon which people seeking refuge can be denied access to a hearing of their claim. This proposal has been widely <a href="https://ccrweb.ca/en/letter-prime-minister-regarding-refugee-measures-budget-bill )">condemned</a> by refugee advocates as putting at risk refugees who need Canada’s protection, simply because they have been entered into another country’s refugee determination system.

Understanding the motivation behind the proposed changes requires a brief understanding of the history of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board, Canada’s refugee decision making tribunal.

The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board is a quasi-judicial tribunal which determines whether claimants meet the definition of a Convention refugee or face risks described in the Convention against Torture. It consists of quasi-judicial decision makers who conduct hearings which guarantee procedural rights to claimants such as the right to counsel, opportunities to produce evidence and call witnesses, and rights of appeal against negative decisions.

The RPD was established in response to a ground-breaking Supreme Court of Canada decision in 1985 known as <em>Singh. </em>The <em>Singh</em> decision is known for giving birth to the current refugee determination process in Canada. It found that whenever facts are in dispute and credibility is an issue in a refugee claim, a full oral hearing is required in order to meet the principles of fairness.

The RPD’s role is to comply with the standards set out by the Supreme Court in <em>Singh</em>.  In its early days, the tribunal’s proceedings resembled a court more than an administrative tribunal. Hearings were conducted by two decision makers who had equal authority to accept a claim. Full disclosure of all of the government’s evidence was provided to the claimant. Claimants’ counsel was given the opportunity to define the issues and examine the claimant in chief. A non-adversarial Refugee Hearing Officer was also present in hearings to ensure that all necessary evidence was place before the decision makers.

As one of Canada’s largest and most expensive administrative tribunals, the Refugee Protection Division has consistently been the subject of public debate.  In particular, backlogs that develop before the RPD are criticized for enabling claimants to benefit from a lengthy stay in Canada and undermining the fairness of the system. These backlogs have developed when numbers of claimants entering the system have unexpectedly spiked.

In response to these concerns, procedures before the RPD have been diluted. Decision makers have been reduced from two to one, Refugee Hearing officers are no longer present during hearings, and claimants’ counsel are no longer permitted to present the case first. These efforts have been aimed at increasing the efficiency of proceedings, effectively making the determination process faster.

However, access to the RPD – the criteria that allows someone to go from making a claim to appearing before the RPD – hasn’t been changed since the implementation of Canada’s Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) in 2002. Until now.

From the beginning, access to the RPD for a hearing has never been assured. Section 101 of IRPA contains a list of factors that make a claimant ineligible to proceed to a hearing before the RPD. These factors include being refused refugee status in Canada previously, being a serious criminal or security threat, or traveling through a country that Canada has designated as being safe (only the United States has been designated as such a safe country).

Bill-97, the Budget Implementation Bill, proposes to add an additional ground of ineligibility to refugee claims. This ground of ineligibility will block access to RPD hearings for claimants who have made a refugee claim in a country with whom Canada has an information sharing agreement, currently the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand.

It will not matter if a person’s claim has been refused or never decided in the other country. Simply making the claim will be sufficient to block access to a Canadian refugee hearing.

These proposed changes have raised concerns for two reasons. First, it will be possible for Canada to refuse to hold a hearing for a refugee claimant who has never had a hearing. This appears to offend the principles laid out by the Supreme Court in <em>Singh</em>. Second, if the claimant has had a hearing in the other country and has been refused refugee status, Canada’s refusal to grant a hearing is an implicit adoption of that decision. It is in some sense a reliance upon another country’s standards for granting refugee status into our system.

Ineligible claimants will have access to a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA). The PRRA is a process designed for a quick administrative review of risks for a person on the cusp of removal from Canada. It is procedurally weaker to a RPD hearing because it is designed to be conducted in writing, in the absence of the person concerned, with decision makers who are not subject to the decision-making standards of the RPD. The acceptance rate in PRRA applications has also been extremely low, approximately 3%, while the acceptance rate of RPD claims has fluctuated between 40-60%.

The government’s proposed changes will reduce the number of claimants and hearings before the RPD, reducing the tribunal’s administrative burden. But it is feared that this ground of ineligibility will increase the risk that people who need Canada’s protection will be returned to a place where they will face persecution or death. It is also the continuation of a worrying international trend toward off-loading the responsibility for refugee determination.

When <em>Singh</em> was being argued before the Supreme Court in 1985, the government tried to convince the Court that oral hearings are not necessary to ensure fairness to refugees. It argued that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees approved of Canada’s method of adjudicating refugee claims without hearings, and that many refugee-receiving countries processed claims in the same way. The government argued that a requirement to conduct oral hearings into every claim would impose a “considerable strain” on government resources.

The Supreme Court found that these considerations were not appropriate when dealing with the guarantee of rights to refugees under Canada’s <em>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>. As stated by Justice Bertha Wilson:
<blockquote>Certainly the guarantees of the <a href="https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11/latest/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11.html"><em>Charter</em></a> would be illusory if they could be ignored because it was administratively convenient to do so. No doubt considerable time and money can be saved by adopting administrative procedures which ignore the principles of fundamental justice but such an argument, in my view, misses the point of the exercise under <a href="https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11/latest/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11.html#sec1_smooth">s. 1</a>. The principles of natural justice and procedural fairness which have long been espoused by our courts, and the constitutional entrenchment of the principles of fundamental justice in <a href="https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11/latest/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11.html#sec7_smooth">s. 7</a>, implicitly recognize that a balance of administrative convenience does not override the need to adhere to these principles.</blockquote>
The proposed changes, if passed, will pose a challenge to these principles.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>"I believe" is the one great word against metaphysical fear. </em>Oswald Spengler, <em>The Decline of the West</em>

At least one thing is clear. Those terrorists who carried out the Easter Sunday attacks on certain Sri Lankan churches and hotels would have resonated with Oswald Spengler's urgent affirmation. "I believe" was plainly at the conceptual core of this catastrophic Jihadist assault (Islamic State or ISIS claimed responsibility for the carnage). As is generally the case with Jihadist terror attacks, the underlying and ultimate hope of the murdering perpetrators was to avoid their own personal deaths by choosing "martyrdom."

If any reminders should still be needed, Jihadist bombers risk killing themselves in order <em>not to die. </em>This strange and paradoxical calculus becomes still more compelling and even irrefutable whenever the planning terrorist attackers set out purposely and deliberately to die as "suicide bombers." Accordingly, in this connection, analysts and counter-terrorist operations should continuously bear in mind that from the reasoning standpoint of the operational terrorists - here, plausibly part of a larger and international terror network - the "death" they expect to suffer is quite easily endured.

Presumptively, it is, after all, merely a transient inconvenience, a momentary impediment on the promisingly sacred path to life everlasting- in paradise no less.

Are such terrorists normal or abnormal?  Does it matter? To some extent, of course, this is merely a question of definition, and one that could be applied usefully to virtually any adversary in war or at a minimum to assorted situationally defined enemy leadership cadres.

In fashioning national security policies driven by counter-terrorism, whether international (war and peace) or sub-national (criminal law) American analysts should prepare to face this utterly core question head on. Usually, perhaps even <em>prima facie,</em> terror-focused wars must be conceived with an expectation of enemy "normalcy." At the same time, the prospect of certain "abnormal" or irrational terrorist enemies ought never to be dismissed altogether, in law as well as in practice.

How best to accommodate all conceivable levels of adversarial normalcy?  This is the "bottom line" query of absolutely any sensible and cost-effective US policy on counter-terrorism. Moreover, in suitably determining any pertinent analytic differences between "normal" and "abnormal" terrorist foes, legal <em>and</em> operational, assessment standards must be applied to both adversarial <em>means </em>and adversarial <em>ends</em>.

Under the laws of war of "<a href="http://www1.umassd.edu/euro/resources/dutchrep/14.pdf">Westphalian</a>" international law (aka <em>humanitarian international law</em> or the <em>law of armed conflict</em>) this important distinction closely parallels certain already-settled jurisprudential contrasts.  These are contrasts between "justice in war" (<em>jus in bello</em>) and "justice of war" (<em>jus ad bellum</em>)<em>.</em> Always, whether in general war circumstances or specific counter-terrorism operations, both standards must be taken into account.

With particular reference to United States national security policy, the most immediately urgent question must be this: "Is it plausible to assume that all or several of this country's terrorist foes are "abnormal," and - if so - how should this assumption be incorporated into various lawful and law-enforcing counter-terrorism strategies"? By definition, in this connection, while all law-enforcing strategies must also be lawful, the reciprocal does not obtain. In other words, not all lawful counter-terrorist strategies need necessarily be law-enforcing.

There are assorted subsidiary questions for US policymakers. Would the criteria applied in any required analysis also be consistent with ubiquitous or universal standards of normalcy, or would they represent only the result of some transient and/or misapplied notions of "cultural relativism?" For example, Oswald Spengler's earlier observation concerning the words "I believe" -words representing an antidote to undiminished human death fears - speaks directly to Jihadist terror threats.

In such matters, logic has its pride of place. What else but "metaphysical fear" could convince terrorists that the calculated killing of certain "others" (unbelievers, apostates, blasphemers, etc.) is actually the best way for cheating personal death?  In the words of Nobel laureate (Literature) Eugene Ionesco: "I must kill my visible enemy, the one who is determined to take my life, to prevent him from killing me. Killing gives me a feeling of relief, because I am dimly aware that in killing him I have killed death…Killing is a way of relieving one's feelings, of warding off one's own death."

For the most part, the so-called "suicide bomber" kills himself or herself in order <em>not to die. </em>Significantly, there is nothing in law, either national or international, that can modify or remove such a determinedly murderous calculus, but both forms of jurisprudence can provide defenders with useful standards for operationalizing gainfully reciprocal conduct. Depending upon the adversary, this conduct would take place within the United States itself (as a recognizably criminal justice matter) or in some other country or countries (presumably as an integral   part of an American "just war").

Until now, America's  general posture on counterterrorism has often reflected the presumption that this country's insurgent enemies can't usefully be deemed normal. At the same time, of course, this posture has its principal legal justification in the national right to "self defense." This core right is a peremptory or <em>jus cogens</em> norm under authoritative international law. After all, haven't the most prominent of these enemies frequently exhibited a willful indifference to personal safety, an indifference incidentally that goes far beyond any of our "normally" established thresholds of heroism? Sometimes, accordingly, these terrorists have been willing to accept markedly high levels of personal suffering, including personal death. At the very same time, terrorist groups have displayed the most profoundly<em> unheroic</em> kinds of behavior, ways generally identified in law as "perfidious." Deception can be legal under the law of armed conflict, but the <em><a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl/INTRO/195">Hague Regulations</a></em> expressly disallow any placement of military assets or personnel in populated civilian areas.

Such sorts of consciously self-destructive behavior are plainly out of synch with what we would usually regard as "normal;" still, they are fully consistent with the preference hierarchies of <em>Jihadist </em>fighters whether they are operating in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, or elsewhere. From very recent news, we may now learn that ISIS Jihadist forces are (1) systematically re-grouping in Syria; and (2) being assiduously recruited by al-Qaeda.

In looking ahead, US government counter-terrorist planners should dispense with all extraneous or problematic ideological presumptions. Taken by itself, choosing to attack the United States is not reliable evidence of any tangible psychological abnormality, even where the prospective attackers would opt for lawlessly indiscriminate forms of terrorism. To automatically or routinely assume otherwise would be to confuse our imperative science-based analytic judgments with narrowly partisan or conventionally visceral kinds of national chauvinism.

At the same time, we do need to accept that certain terrorist foes will continue to become entirely willing "suicides" or "martyrs," and that our available arsenal of lawful deterrent remedies must be constructed accordingly. US counter-terrorist deterrence strategies may sometimes need to be re-imagined or reconfigured, both for operational and complementary legal reasons. These twin criteria of assessment, <em>operational</em> and <em>legal,</em> are conceptually separate or discrete, but they are also nonetheless inter-penetrating-and should therefore be considered <em>together. </em>Even if particular terrorist enemies should sometime be willing to die for their cause, they could remain subject to various alternative kinds of legal threats. For example, they may be perfectly willing or eager to die themselves, as individuals, but still  unwilling to accept too great a risk of an American retaliation launched upon certain cherished religious institutions.

In the end, to be both effective and lawful, US counter-terrorism strategies must modify any too-stark differentiation between normal and abnormal behaviors. To most appropriately understand and combat terrorist enemies, we should first capably acknowledge that "normal" individuals could potentially pose an equally significant security threat, or conceivably, an even greater one. At first glance, "normal" and "abnormal" would always appear to be mutually exclusive qualities. Yet, upon more subtle and nuanced examination, we would likely discover that they are more correctly thought of as different points along a common continuum of "civilized" human judgment.

Sigmund Freud wrote about the <em>Psychopathology of Everyday Life</em> (1914) while tracing variously intriguing connections between "the abnormal" and "the normal." In consequence, he was surprised to learn just how faint the line of demarcation could sometimes become. In exploring <em>parapraxes,</em> or slips of the tongue, a phenomenon that we now call "Freudian slips," he had concluded that psycho-pathological traits could also be routinely identified in "normal" persons.

After World War II and the Holocaust, American psychiatrist, Robert Jay Lifton interviewed Nazi (SS) doctors. Perplexed, as a physician, that the monstrous Nazi crimes (Primarily <em>crimes of war,</em> <em>crimes against peace</em> and <em>crimes against humanity</em>) had somehow been committed in pursuit of "hygiene," and that medicalized murders had been labeled "therapeutic," Lifton was determined to answer certain utterly basic questions. Most elementary of all his pertinent queries was this: How could Nazi doctors have managed to conform the large-scale medicalized killing of innocent and defenseless human beings with an otherwise normal private life?

Findings here were stunningly counter-intuitive. It was not unusual, researchers discovered, that Nazi doctors had remained perfectly good fathers and husbands. Indeed, like some of the most heinous concentration camp commandants, these physicians who were sworn to "do no harm" were still capable of supervising the systematic murder of Jewish children six days a week. On the seventh day, quite properly and conventionally, they went off to church with their families.

In Auschwitz, on Sunday, SS prayers were gratifyingly uttered in chorus. But how could this possibly be? And how can Professor Lifton's scholarly insights and answers from this earlier era of mass criminality now help us to better understand the thinking of anti-American terrorists? Lifton had carried on his unique examination of the Nazi "biomedical vision" as a Yale Professor and as a Fellow of the Max Planck Institute for Research in Psychopathology and Psychotherapy. This was not, therefore, just a random undertaking of some informal or unstructured curiosity. Rather, adhering to widely-accepted and distinctly impressive scientific protocols, Dr. Lifton embarked upon a rigorous academic study of the most meticulous and refined sort.

To the physician, the Oath of Hippocrates pledges that: "I will keep pure and holy both my life and my art." When asked about this unwavering duty, most of the interviewed SS doctors had felt no contradiction. "The Jew," after all, "was a source of <em>infection</em>." Ridding society of the Jews, it follows, was credibly and lawfully "anti-infective." In essence, they identified murder as a law-enforcing (not "merely" lawful) "obligation" of both "healing" and "compassion."

Here, it turns out, we must study nothing less preposterous than mass murder justified by metaphor. This historic case offers irrefutable evidence of just how easy it is to subordinate science, reason and law to the most outrageous and self-intoxicating analytic doggerel. With any such willful intellectual subordination, otherwise normal behavior can quickly and completely give way to once unimaginable levels of sheer criminality.

There is more. The duality of good and evil within each person is a very old and durable theme in western though.  It is most notably in German literature especially from Goethe and Nietzsche to Hermann Hesse and Thomas Mann. Always, in this remarkable literature, we learn that the most authentically critical boundaries of law and compassion are not between normal and abnormal persons, but instead <em>within each individual person</em>.  In short, the generally porous walls of normalcy and abnormality typically allow each single individual to oscillate more or less freely between altruism and cruelty.

Always, truth is exculpatory, in psychiatry as in law. Always, the contrived veneer of human civilization is thin. Always, it remains ready to crack. Inevitably, when it finally begins to fracture, as in the tale of the proper British schoolboys marooned on the island in William Golding's <em>Lord of the Flies,</em> a darkly ubiquitous human nature quickly rises. What is then so hideously exposed are various overlapping and primal layers of irremediable barbarism.

Predictably reminds Nobel laureate Thomas Mann that this uncivilized nature will "dare to be barbaric, twice barbaric indeed." After attending the 1961 Eichmann trial in Jerusalem, a landmark legal case for many important and overlapping reasons, political philosopher Hannah Arendt ventured a sobering hypothesis. Her hypothesis is that evil can be thoroughly ordinary or "banal” and that it can be generated by the literal (and seemingly benign) absence of authentic thought. Unsurprisingly, this novel interpretation of evil was widely challenged and disputed following the trial but it was, in fact, firmly rooted in certain classical views of individual human dualism, particularly the central themes of Johan Wolfgang von Goethe's <em>Faust.</em>

Hannah Arendt's controversial idea of evil as mundane was reinforced by still-earlier studies of nefarious human behavior in the<em> crowd</em>, or the <em>herd</em>, or the <em>mass</em>, especially the auspiciously intersecting works of Soren Kierkegaard, Max Stirner, Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche, Gustave LeBon, Carl G. Jung, Elias Canetti, and, of course, Sigmund Freud.

In all of these thematically-related writings, a common focus is explicitly placed on the potentially corrosive impact of group membership or identity upon individual behavior. In this challenging intellectual genre, Freud's own best contribution is his<em> Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego</em> (1921).

Robert Lifton likely knew all this. Yet, he was still seeking something more,  some other isolatable mechanism by which the evildoer could render himself (or herself) normal. Ultimately, he discovered this transformative mechanism in a dense or opaque intra-psychic process. Lifton called this inherently complex process "doubling."

Very different from the traditional psychoanalytic concept of "splitting," or what Freud himself had preferred to call "dissociation," <em>doubling</em>, says Lifton, is the means whereby an "opposing self" begins to replace portions of the "original self" , in effect, usurping and overwhelming that original self <em>from within.</em> When this happens, we learn further, the opposing self is increasingly able to embrace evil doing without restraint even while the original self remains determinedly "good." <em>Doubling,</em> therefore, permits prospective evil doers to avoid personal psychiatric guilt (though not legal guilt) and thus to live simultaneously at two discrete and normally contending levels.

As a tactical maneuver, however unwitting, <em>doubling </em>allowed the Nazi doctors to be murderers and decent family men at the same time. In a similar fashion, <em>doubling</em> is likely the way that various mass-murdering terrorists were able to reconcile the evident ordinariness of their lives with an otherwise unfathomable cruelty. It was (and remains) a way for them to disregard literally all pertinent law and morality.

As with the Nazi doctors and the Jews, it is plausible that terrorist mass murderers, including the suicide-bombers scattered among them, regard the indiscriminate destruction of selected "others" as both "legally" permissible and fundamentally sacred. Now, with nameless "Americans" among their targets, a healing-killing paradox could continue to be crucial to all such prospectively annihilatory calculations.

There is still more to consider. Paradoxically, there can be an abnormal side to normalcy. For the future, in thinking about how best to protect ourselves from assorted terror-crimes, Americans would be well-advised not to think of their possible tormentors in purely polar terms. Along specifically jurisprudential lines, moreover, they should remain aware of all permissible forms of national self-defense including (regarding international conflicts) "anticipatory self-defense." The customary right of anticipatory self-defense, which is the legal expression of preemption, has its modern origins in the <em>Caroline Incident, </em>unsuccessful rebellion of 1837 in Upper Canada against British rule. On <em>intra-</em>national counter-terrorism conflicts, Jewish law is instructive. More precisely, the Torah exonerates from guilt a victim of robbery with expected violence if in self-defense he struck down and, if necessary, even killed the attacker before any violence was actually used against him. In the words of the Rabbis: "If a man comes to slay you, forestall by slaying him."

<em>Doubling </em>was not the only reason certain Nazi criminals were able to become actively complicit in mass murder. Elements of "groupthink", especially an overwhelming need to <em>belong</em>, also became a dominant influence. At least clinically, despite whatever sorts of explanation might ultimately emerge as most persuasive, we must still accept that the most conspicuously odious terrorist killers were clinically considered "normal."

Such more-or-less grudging acceptance should become a critical component of various US national counter-terrorism policies. To the extent that these policies would need to be focused on preventing mass-destruction terror attacks against the United States, including instances of nuclear terrorism, its cumulative national security benefit could prove invaluable. In the final analysis, the true task of relevant US national security efforts must be not to delineate any operational distinctions between "normal" and "abnormal" terrorist enemies, but instead to best ensure that all considered remedies correspond to all plausible terrorist preferences.

Among other things, this would mean correlating vital US national security remedies with presumptively rational and irrational terrorist foes. Recalling Oswald Spengler, the key distinction here would focus expressly upon each particular terrorist group adversary's orientation to personal death. Which is what the determinable extent to which "I believe" could represent the underlying mainspring of certain future violent actions against the United States.

At absolutely every stage of operationalizing a lawful/law enforcing and effective American counter-terrorism strategy, one derived in part from certain antecedent distinctions between rational and irrational adversaries, legal norms must be carefully respected. <em>Inter alia,</em> under no circumstances should critical national security decision-makers conclude that successful counter-terrorism requires the United States to act contrary to international and/or national law. To be sure, philosophers and jurists have been troubled for several thousand years by assorted presumptive tradeoffs between power and justice, but in the terrorism- security matters immediately at hand, there are ample opportunities for mutual reinforcements or reconciliation.

Whether our most feared terrorist adversaries are thought to be "normal" or "abnormal", there will generally be available both lawful and effective forms of policy response.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On April 16, 2019, Governor Jarod Polis <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2019/04/colorado-enacts-sweeping-oil-and-gas-law/">signed</a> into law <a href="http://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb19-181">SB19-181</a>, a bill that reforms oil and gas regulation in Colorado in several important ways.  It’s a remarkable achievement for House Speaker <a href="http://leg.colorado.gov/legislators/kc-becker">KC Becker</a> and other supporters who bent but did not break in the face of strong opposition from the oil and gas industry.  And it is notable too because it comes on the heels of the defeat of <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Colorado_Proposition_112,_Minimum_Distance_Requirements_for_New_Oil,_Gas,_and_Fracking_Projects_Initiative_(2018)">Proposition 112</a>, which would have required that any new oil and natural gas development be located at least 2,500 feet from any occupied structures or other “vulnerable” areas.  This last phrase might well explain the Proposition’s defeat, since vulnerable areas were defined broadly to include such ubiquitous land features as irrigation canals and intermittent streams.  The Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (<a href="https://cogcc.state.co.us/#/home">COGCC</a> or Commission) estimated that 85% of the non-federal land subject to the law would have been off-limits to development if Prop 112 had passed.

SB19-181 takes a very different approach from Prop 112. In fact, it does not address setback requirements at all – at least not directly.  Rather, the new law focuses primarily on three specific aspects of the oil and gas regulatory program -- administration, air pollution, and land use.  The most notable administrative change involves language that effectively overturns the Supreme Court’s recent <em><a href="https://cases.justia.com/colorado/supreme-court/2019-17sc297.pdf?ts=1547483081">Martinez</a> </em>decision.  In <em>Martinez</em>, the Court addressed the statutory mandate that the COGCC foster oil and gas development in a manner consistent with the protection of public health.  At issue was whether the language requires that public health take precedence over development. The Court found that the statute promoted multiple policy goals, and contemplated some adverse impacts because it required the Commission’s rules to <em>mitigate</em> significant adverse environmental impacts to protect public health while “<em>taking into consideration cost-effectiveness and technical feasibility</em>.”  As amended, the statute now makes clear that the focus of the law is on public health and environmental protection. Gone is any reference to fostering development as well as the reference to cost-effectiveness and technological feasibility.

Consistent with this new direction, the statute changes the make-up of the Commission to reduce the influence of the oil and gas industry.  The new Commissioners will be full-time state employees and, as of 2020, will consists of 5 voting members, plus two ex-officio members, with only one voting member representing the oil and gas industry.  Other Commissioners must be experts in planning, environmental protection, sound decision processes, and public health.  Currently, the Commission has nine voting members with three from the oil and gas sector.

The new law also requires the Air Quality Control Commission to promulgate new rules to minimize air pollution, enhance inspections for leak detection and repair, and requires large facilities to install continuous methane emissions monitors. While Colorado already has relatively strict air emissions standards for oil and gas facilities, air emissions from oil and gas facilities remain a significant public health and environmental problem and these more stringent requirements are a welcome and much needed addition to the regulatory program.

The most creative aspect of the new law concerns land use and planning. SB19-181 recognizes that unconventional oil and gas development, which now dominates the industry, presents an opportunity for smart planning that was impractical with conventional development. Unlike conventional wells, the long horizontal wells that characterize unconventional development afford developers and planners substantial flexibility in siting well pads and other facilities to minimize community impacts.

The land use provisions of the law operate largely through the auspices of affected local governments. The relevant provisions begin by clarifying the authority of local governments to “regulat[e] the surface impacts of oil and gas operations … and to protect and minimize adverse impacts to public health, safety, and welfare and the environment.” The statute goes on to make clear that local governments have broad planning authority and can regulate land use, well siting decisions, infrastructure impacts, air and water quality and related impacts, and bonding and insurance requirements. It further grants local governments the authority to inspect and enforce its standards.  These provisions appear to limit the two recent decisions from the Colorado Supreme Court striking down the fracking bans enacted by the Cities of <a href="https://cases.justia.com/colorado/supreme-court/2016-15sc667.pdf?ts=1462203032">Longmont</a> and <a href="https://www.courts.state.co.us/userfiles/file/Court_Probation/Supreme_Court/Opinions/2015/15SC668.pdf">Fort Collins</a> on state preemption grounds.  While the statute does not specifically refer to fracking, and it does not appear to allow local governments to ban oil and gas development outright, local governments are granted the power to impose standards that are more stringent than state standards, even if they might inhibit development.

The most interesting planning provision in the new law requires the Commission to promulgate rules that “adopt an <em>alternative location analysis process</em> and specify criteria used to identify oil and gas locations and facilities proposed to be located near populated areas….” The success or failure of the new law could very well hinge on how well the Commission carries out this task. A big problem with the current regulatory regime is its tendency to be reactive to applications submitted by developers. But a well site that might seem best from the perspective of a developer may be highly problematic for local residents.  Moreover, asking a local government or the COGCC to respond to a specific application for a single well site or facility can obscure the broader planning issues surrounding regional oil and gas development.  Typically, these issues are not about a single well, but rather about the hundreds and even thousands of wells and support facilities that eventually populate an area.

Advance planning with an alternative location analysis has the potential to ensure safe and efficient development at the best possible locations while minimizing impacts to people and the environment. It will also facilitate an assessment of cumulative impacts, and the new law directs the Commission to promulgate rules that establish a process for evaluating and addressing these impacts.  Finally, it better accommodates adaptive management strategies that should be built into every planning decision. Adaptive management recognizes that decisions involving future events necessarily come with uncertainty. It responds to that uncertainty by requiring monitoring of specific, measurable performance standards and committing the affected parties to modifying the approved activity as necessary to meet the standards.

Such advance planning with an alternatives analysis as required by the statute will necessarily involve consultations among local governments, the industry, and the public to evaluate alternative well pad locations, rights-of-way corridors, and locations for ancillary facilities. A thorough alternative analysis that includes meaningful public engagement will likely take some time, and for that reason strict rules demanding such an analysis may be resisted by the oil and gas industry.  But the ambitious goal of improving oil and gas regulation in Colorado will not be met without a strong alternatives location analysis rule.

Local siting decisions will also be supported by the establishment of a Technical Review Board. An operator seeking to locate or site an oil and gas facility must apply to the relevant local government. Once the local government has made a preliminary or final determination on that application the local government may ask the COGCC Director to appoint a Technical Review Board. Alternatively, if the local government does not act within 210 days after an application is filed the operator may request a Technical Review Board. In either case, the Director appoints a Board with appropriate expertise, including in land use planning and oil and gas exploration and production. Although the statute is unclear, presumably, the application process will be preceded by the comprehensive alternative location analysis. Otherwise, that analysis would play no role in the decision process. The Commission’s rules should nonetheless clarify this point.

The Technical Review Board’s primary function is to review the preliminary or final site determination and to address disputes about siting between the operator and the local government. These may include questions involving technological feasibility and best practices, but the Board cannot consider economic factors.  The Board must issue its report within 60 days. Even assuming the Board does not gather new evidence, this seems like an absurdly short period of time to evaluate the evidence in the record, confer with the affected parties, and issue a report. S<span>uch a short timeline may encourage rote reports that fail to fully resolve disputes and confront the site-specific issues that are the hallmark of smart planning for oil and gas development</span>. While the statute does not seem to impose consequences for failing to meet the 60-day deadline, a decision that relies on a late report could be vulnerable to a challenge on those grounds.

The above described provisions reflect key changes to the law, but the law prescribes other changes as well.  Perhaps most importantly it requires the Commission to adopt new rules to ensure that abandoned and inactive wells do not pose risks to public health and safety. It also limits the Commission’s authority to approve compulsory pooling orders to parties who own or control at least 45% of the mineral interests to be pooled.

The oil and gas industry and its allies are predicting dire consequences to Colorado and its economy as a result of the bill’s passage.  But, the industry should welcome legislation that avoids the overreach that characterized Prop 112 and they should embrace the challenge of designing oil and gas development to minimize their impact on communities.  If they do, the public and the industry will both end up in a much better place and Colorado will burnish its reputation as a leader in the field of oil and gas regulation.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last month, tenants at a rent-stabilized apartment building called Atlantic Plaza Towers in Brooklyn <a href="https://www.legalservicesnyc.org/storage/PDFs/%20opposition%20to%20facial%20recognition%20entry%20system%20app.pdf">filed a formal protest</a> against their landlord’s plan to replace key fobs with facial recognition technology. The landlord claimed the new system would enhance security. The tenants, primarily women of color, countered that access to their homes should not hinge on giving up biometric information.

Facial recognition technology is particularly inaccurate when it comes to minorities and women, raising the risk that the tenants could be barred from their homes or penalized for the conduct of other individuals. Moreover, the landlord cannot ensure the security of the data and remains free to sell the data to police, ICE, and other governmental agencies. One long-time resident, Icemae Downes, was <a href="https://www.citylab.com/equity/2019/05/facial-recognition-tech-surveillance-security-amazon-ring/588436/">reported to have said</a> that: “We should not feel like we’re in a prison to enter into our homes.”

As this tenant protest reveals, the experiences and perspectives of low-income communities with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/opinion/privacy-poverty.html">data privacy differ</a> from those of wealthier Americans. For instance, <a href="https://www.datainnovation.org/2019/01/survey-few-americans-want-government-to-limit-use-of-facial-recognition-technology-particularly-for-public-safety-or-airport-screening/">most Americans</a> are less concerned about facial recognition technology, viewing it as a reasonable tradeoff for supposed safety. This gap in perception explains why the voices of marginalized communities must be included in ongoing policy discussions about data privacy and emerging legislation.

The Brooklyn tenants are keenly aware that marginalized communities have long been subject to <a href="https://tcf.org/content/report/disparate-impact-surveillance/?agreed=1">higher levels of government surveillance</a> as a means of social control. And they are part of a history of resistance to this oversight. Consider the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article-abstract/112/3/896/29542?redirectedFrom=fulltext">welfare rights movement</a> in the 1970s, when poor mothers organized against <a href="https://scholarworks.law.ubalt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=2255&amp;context=lf">intrusive state policies</a> such as welfare investigators rummaging through their closets and trash cans to ferret out supposed fraud.

Today, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2930247">technology has turbo-charged</a> the ability of the state to control its poor citizens, often with disastrous consequences. People seeking government assistance are increasingly subject to <a href="https://ainowinstitute.org/aap-toolkit.pdf">automated, algorithmic decision-making</a> in which computers use data to make eligibility decisions previously entrusted to humans and then monitor how people use their benefits.

Yet replacing people with machines has not erased human error nor has it ended discrimination because humans program computers and they <a href="https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2018/02/07/algorithmic-bias-software-recommendations-000631">code mistakes and biases into our software</a>. As a result, thousands of <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2018/01/the-digital-poorhouse/">needy people are being cut off</a> from life-sustaining supports without adequate explanations or avenues for recourse.

Middle-class Americans could ignore the privacy deprivations suffered by the poor -- until the issue spread to them. For instance, in 2017, hackers stole the data of 145 million Americans held at <a href="http://fortune.com/2018/09/07/equifax-data-breach-one-year-anniversary/">Equifax</a>, the credit reporting company. In 2018, Americans learned that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/facebook-cambridge-analytica-explained.html">Cambridge Analytica had harvested the data</a> of about 87 million people from Facebook in order to target people with pro-Trump campaign ads.

Americans are waking up to the reality that a thriving industry of big tech companies and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bjpx3w/what-are-data-brokers-and-how-to-stop-my-private-data-collection">data brokers</a> is collecting, aggregating, and selling consumers’ data for profit, without their knowledge or meaningful consent. Even less visible is that personal data is combined with data from <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2930247">users’ social networks</a> to create highly granular reports about our lives.

Still, the harms of this data ecosystem tend to be worse for people who are materially poor. Based on their digital dossiers, poor people are targeted for predatory financial products and for-profit educational scams. Their access to jobs, education, and housing can hinge on the determinations in these reports, with no way to learn about or correct often misleading or discriminatory data outcomes.

Moreover, while identity theft is a nightmare for any victim, its consequences are particularly <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/legal_services/publications/dialogue/volume/17/winter-2014/identity-theft--a-lowincome-issue/">harsh for low-income people</a>. They often lack the financial resources, expertise, and time to untangle a stolen identity. Meanwhile, they can face wrongful arrests, utility shutoffs, and aggressive debt collection as a result of someone committing wrongdoing in their name.

Not surprisingly, <a href="https://datasociety.net/output/privacy-security-and-digital-inequality/">a major survey</a> on digital inequality discovered that low-income people report higher concerns about their data security, but less confidence in how to manage their online usage. Moreover, they are at greater risk of data breaches because they tend to access the internet from mobile devices, which are less secure than computers and which offer data brokers extensive geo-location tracking.

For all these reasons, their perspectives are essential to creating effective data privacy laws. Congress is finally considering comprehensive privacy legislation after years of neglect. Currently, our privacy law regime is scattershot and random. For instance, an existing law protects your video rental history (when was the last time you visited a Blockbuster?), but no laws control how Facebook uses your data.

Congress is trailing the European Union, which enacted a comprehensive privacy law regime effective May 2018, as well as California, whose new privacy law goes into effect in 2020. Big technology companies are jumping on board. They prefer a single federal bill to state variation; meanwhile, states are actively getting into the privacy regulation game.

While there are <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/breaking-down-proposals-for-privacy-legislation-how-do-they-regulate/">competing bills in Congress</a>, with varying degrees of consumer protections, the proposed laws generally promote greater transparency in data collection and usage, along with stronger enforcement tools to promote data security and user consent.

Yet if we do not include people from all socio-economic backgrounds in the conversation, we will create a regime that makes privacy a luxury for the rich. We need to hear the voices of marginalized groups during lawmaking, and then pass laws that include processes for ongoing dialogue in privacy regulation regimes. For instance, the EU’s data privacy law contains a <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-35-gdpr/">provision requiring public participation</a> in setting certain data policies established by large companies.

To be sure, there are challenges to generating participation by low-income citizens–or anyone without a lobbyist–in privacy debates. Many of the harms wrought from automated decisionmaking are invisible. Technological issues can be complex without a computer science degree. Low-income people can face logistical challenges to citizen participation, such as lack of time or transportation or childcare.

Yet the activism of the Atlantic Plaza Towers tenants and other <a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-lapd-predictive-policing-big-data-20190405-story.html">big data resistance protests</a> demonstrates that impacted communities have sophisticated understandings of the surveillance state–and the wherewithal to advocate for their rights.

The key going forward is generating more spaces for <a href="https://www.odbproject.org/">hearing the voices of marginalized communities</a>, relying less on “experts” to identify big data harms and solutions, and connecting with other on-the-ground <a href="https://civilrights.org/2019/02/13/over-40-civil-rights-civil-liberties-and-consumer-groups-call-on-congress-to-address-data-driven-discrimination/">civil rights</a>, <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-governments-use-big-data-to-violate-human-rights-109537">human rights</a>, and <a href="https://theconversation.com/data-insecurity-leads-to-economic-injustice-and-hits-the-pocketbooks-of-the-poor-most-116231">economic justice</a> activists to explore and unpack how data privacy intersects with those movements.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span>Targeted killing campaigns are still accelerating under the Trump administration, with fewer constraints and even less transparency. More precisely, it seems that the Obama-era</span><i><span> </span>Presidential Policy Guidance</i><span> has been relaxed in two very meaningful ways: targets of "kill missions" are being expanded to include more Jihadist "</span>Foot Soldiers<span>" (rather than just identifiable terrorist leaders) and directed drone attacks will no longer go through any high-level vetting. In this connection, the pertinent theaters of active hostilities are primarily Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Somalia. The latest</span><i><span> </span>Authorization for Use of Military Force (</i><span>AUMF) permits the president to target ISIS, al-Qaeda, or "associated forces" at any time. Significantly, there is no corollary obligation for the president to define publicly either the targeted terrorist forces or the geographic areas of targeted attack. Also worth noting is the undeclared United States war on terror now underway in West Africa. There are good legal reasons to recall that President Trump has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/12/02/politics/donald-trump-terrorists-families/index.html">openly</a> urged the targeted killing of terrorist </span><i>families<span> </span></i><span>(wives, mothers, children, etc.) as well as alleged terrorists themselves. </span><span> To this point, there is little if any reliable data to support the tactical benefit of any Trump-era <a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/targeted-killing-donald-trump-style/">targeted killings</a>. </span><span>Finally, especially worth noting here is that President Trump recently designated the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist group. Should he begin to authorize targeted assassinations of these official regime military forces, it could be taken </span><i>prima facie<span> </span></i><span>in Tehran and elsewhere as an instance of US aggression.</span>

Under the protective tutelage of <em>any</em> American president, "We the People" should expect basic safety in world politics. At a minimum, we should be able to assume that wider and capable circles of public authority remain ready to thwart terrorist attacks.  More specifically, such assurances should apply with special clarity to mega-terrorist attacks involving chemical, biological or nuclear threats. In terms of United States law, the authoritative roots of any such presumptive and indispensable assurances go back to the seventeenth century English philosopher, Thomas Hobbes.

Though unfamiliar to America's current president, <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Leviathan_Or_The_Matter_Form_and_Power_o.html?id=8-QtAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Thomas Hobbes' <em>Leviathan </em></a>was plainly integral to the education of Thomas Jefferson. The duly celebrated author of the <em>Declaration</em> was himself widely read; he cared very considerably about serious and dignified learning. In contrast to Donald J. Trump's current inversion of US policy-making priorities, our third president believed expressly in the primacy of "preparation", and not of mere "attitude".

Regarding US counterterrorist preparation, America's national security establishment must get ready for absolutely all contingencies. This includes, of course, building the conceptual foundations for any future Osama Bin-Laden "<a href="https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1088&amp;context=jil">elimination-type</a>" operations. During the Obama years, one major targeted killing of a Jihadist terrorist was the September 2011 US <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/10/targeted-killing-flexibility-doctrine-flout-law-war">drone-assassination</a> of Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen. That particular case was notably "special" in one frequently overlooked aspect: The Jihadist al-Awlaki was born in New Mexico, and was <em>ipso facto </em>a US citizen.

Notwithstanding the <em>US Constitution's</em> Fifth Amendment protections concerning "due process," it was a tactical posture that might sometimes need to be repeated.

What then? In relevant jurisprudential terms, what precise legal guidelines would we Americans want followed? To respond properly (among several other related and also intersecting concerns), Mr. Trump and his designated counselors would then need to inquire: <em>"<i>Is it sufficiently legal to target and kill such terrorists if suitably precise linkages between prospective targets and discernible attack intentions can be documented</i>?"</em>

To meaningfully answer this core question, it will first be necessary for Mr. Trump's national security officials to ask whether a proposed terrorist killing plan would be <em>gainfully preemptive</em> or just <em>narrowly retributive</em>. If only the latter, a judgment wherein national self-defense was not in any way the underlying action rationale, authoritative determinations of legality could become substantially more problematic.

It gets even more complicated. Under <a href="https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/12333.html#2.11">Executive Order No. 12333</a> assassination is explicitly prohibited.  It is also generally a crime under international law which, though not widely understood, is a tangible part of American domestic law as we learn from <em><a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/175/677/">The Paquete Habana</a></em>. Still, at least in certain more-or-less residual circumstances, the targeted killing of Jihadist terrorist leaders could be correctly excluded from ordinarily prohibited behaviors. Thereby, such peremptorily protective actions could still be defended as a permissible expression of national law-enforcement.

A similar defense might sometimes be applied to the contemplated killing of terrorist "rank-and-file," especially where such selective lethality had already become part of an already-ongoing pattern of US counter-terrorism. For example, the United States had earlier widened the scope of permissible terrorist targeting in parts of Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria. In part, such a widened arc of permissibility - one which now modifies more stringent prior rules of engagement that had once required specific human target identifications - has represented a byproduct of continuously developing technologies.

Most obvious, among these newer technologies, is growing US reliance upon drone-based assassinations, and also on certain other related forms of long-range or distant killing.

In the best of all possible worlds, of course, there would be no need for any such decentralized or “vigilante” expressions of international justice.  Conspicuously, of course, we don’t yet live in such an ideal world. Instead, enduring uneasily in our present and still-anarchic world legal order - a context that we international law professors prefer to call "<a href="http://oer2go.org/mods/en-boundless-static/www.boundless.com/definition/westphalian-sovereignty/index.html">Westphalian</a>" - the only real alternative to precise self-defense actions against terrorists is likely to be worsening battlefield instabilities. Ultimately, such expanding hyper-instabilities could include even more flagrant and consequential escalations of Jihadist terror-violence.

At some indeterminable point, such escalations could lead to unprecedented instances of chemical, biological or nuclear attack. These attacks might be undertaken by assorted sub-state adversaries or instead, by certain "hybrid" combinations of state and sub-state foes. Ironically, in policies of US ally Israel, the dominant concern remains Iran-Hezbollah and/or Iran/Hamas combinations.

The evident irony here stems from the fact that one Iranian surrogate (Hezbollah) is Shiite, while the other (Hamas) is Sunni.

At the most basic level of such issues and calculations, the very idea of assassination or targeted killing as remediation seems paradoxical, almost an oxymoron.  Seemingly, this understandably objectionable idea must preclude the input of all the more usual due processes of law. Yet, since the current or "Westphalian" state system’s original inception in the seventeenth century, international relations have never been governable by the same civil protections that are potentially available within democratic states.

In this persistently anarchic and prospectively chaotic world legal system, one which still lacks any duly-constituted and effective supra-national authority, assorted Jihadist leaders (ISIS, Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad, al-Qaeda, etc) are already responsible for the mass killing of noncombatant men, women, and children of many different nationalities. It follows that wherever such leaders are not suitably "terminated" by the United States or by any of America's key allies (e.g., Israel, in the tumultuous Middle East), blatantly egregious terror crimes will almost certainly (1) continue and (2) be left unpunished. Any such predictable <em>de facto</em> impunity would be inconsistent with the universal legal obligation to punish international crimes, a <em>jus cogens</em> or peremptory obligation reaffirmed at the original Nuremberg Tribunal and subsequently in the <em><a href="http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/draft_articles/7_1_1950.pdf">Nuremberg Principles</a></em>.

More formally, this <em>lex talionis</em> obligation, which comes to us from both ancient Roman law and the Hebrew Bible, is known formally and correctly as <em><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/nullum_crimen_sine_lege">Nullum crimen sine poena</a></em>, or "No crime without a punishment."

Inevitably, complex considerations of law and tactics must inter-penetrate. In this particular connection, the glaring indiscriminacy of most jihadist operations is rarely if ever the result of enemy inadvertence. Rather, it is typically the intentional outcome of violent terrorist inclinations, unambiguously murderous ideals that lay deeply embedded in the Jihadist terrorist leader’s operative view of insurgency.

For Jihadists, there can never be rendered any meaningful distinction between civilians and non-civilians, between innocents and non-innocents. For these active or latent terrorist murderers, all that really matters are certain unassailable and immutable distinctions that distinguish between Muslims, "apostates", and “unbelievers.”

As for the apostates and unbelievers, it is all quite simple.  Their lives, believe the Jihadists, have no value. <em>Prima facie,</em> that is, they have no immunizing sanctity.

In law, international and national, every government has both the right and the obligation to protect its citizens against external harms. In certain circumstances, moreover, this coincident right and obligation may extend derivatively to targeted killing. This point has long been understood in Washington, where every president in recent memory has given nodding or substantially more direct approval to “high value” assassination operations.

Generally, assassination is a certifiable crime under international law. Yet, in our essentially decentralized system of world law, self-help by individual states is still often necessary, and is more-then-occasionally the only real alternative to passively suffering terrorist crimes. In the absence of certain particular targeted killings, terrorists could continue to create havoc against defenseless civilians almost anywhere, and with complete impunity.

A basic difficulty here is that Jihadist terror criminals are usually immune to the more orthodox legal expectations of extradition and prosecution <em>(<a href="http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/reports/7_6_2014.pdf">Aut dedere, aut judicare</a></em>). This is not to suggest that the targeted assassination of terrorists will always “work" - there is literally nothing to support the logic of any such suggestion - but only that disallowing such targeted killing <em>ex ante</em> could not be operationally gainful or legally just.

If carried out with aptly due regard for pertinent "rules", assassinating terrorist leaders could remain consistent with the ancient legal principle of <em>Nullum crimen sine poena</em> ("no crime without a punishment"). Earlier, this original principle of justice had been cited as a dominant rationale for both the Tokyo and Nuremberg war crime tribunals. Accordingly, it was subsequently incorporated into law through international custom, consistent with <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/en/statute">Article 38(1)(b) of the <em>Statute of the International Court of Justice</em></a>.

By both the codified and customary standards of contemporary international law, all terrorists are <em><a href="https://definitions.uslegal.com/h/hostis-humani-generis/">Hostis humani generis</a>,</em> or "Common enemies of humankind."  In the fashion of pirates, who were to be hanged by the first persons into whose hands they fell, terrorists are international outlaws who fall within the scope of "universal jurisdiction." But choosing precisely which terrorists ought to be targeted remains a largely ideological rather than jurisprudential matter.

In some current circumstances, tyrannicide could be seen as the logical "flip side" of American counter-terrorism. Historically, limited support for expressing assassination as a form of tyrannicide is not hard to discover.  It can be found for example in classical writings of Aristotle, Plutarch and Cicero.

Overall, in his consideration of assassination or targeted-killing as counter-terrorism, President Trump (or more realistically his designated counselors) should consider the clarifying position of Swiss scholar Emmerich de Vattel in his most famous work, <em><a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/Lieber_Collection/pdf/DeVattel_LawOfNations.pdf">The Law of Nations, or the Principles of Natural Law (1758)</a></em>: "The safest plan is to prevent evil where that is possible. A Nation has the right to resist the injury another seeks to inflict upon it, and to use force and every other just means of resistance against the aggressor."

Earlier, a similar view had been presented by Samuel Pufendorf in his text,<em> <a href="https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/4412156/mod_resource/content/0/Pufendorf.pdf">On the Duty of Man and Citizen According to Natural Law (1682)</a></em>:
<blockquote>"Where it is quite clear that he is engaged in planning violence against me, even though he has not fully revealed his design, I shall be justified in immediately initiating self-defence by force, and in seizing the initiative against him, while he is still making preparations.....The aggressor will be taken to be the party which first conceived the intention to harm the other....To have the name of defender, it is not necessary to suffer the first blow, or merely to elude and repel the blows aimed at one."</blockquote>
Even earlier, the right of self-defense by forestalling an attack had been established by the foundational Dutch scholar, Hugo Grotius, in Book II of <em><a href="https://oll.libertyfund.org/pages/grotius-war-peace">The Law of War and Peace (1625)</a></em>. Recognizing the need for what later jurisprudence would reference as threatening international behavior that is "imminent in point of time" (See <em><a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/br-1842d.asp">The Caroline Case, 1837</a></em>), Grotius indicated that self-defense must be permitted not only after an attack has already been suffered, but also in advance, where "the deed may be anticipated."

Further on, in the same chapter, Grotius summarized: "It be lawful to kill him who is preparing to kill."

Interestingly, Vattel, Pufendorf and Grotius were all taken into primary account by Thomas Jefferson, in his critical fashioning of the <a href="http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/">American <em>Declaration of Independence</em></a><em>.</em>

In a far better world than this one, assassination could have no defensible place as counterterrorism, either as a preemptive measure or <em>ex post facto</em>, that is, as a permissible retribution. But, as if anyone should still need a reminder, we do not yet live in the best of all possible worlds, and the obviously negative aspects of targeted killing should never be evaluated apart from the foreseeable costs of all other available options. More precisely, such aspects should always be closely compared to what could be expected of all plausible alternative choices.

International law is not a suicide pact. <em>Ubi cessat remedium ordinarium, ibi decurritur ad extraordinarium</em>; "Where the ordinary remedy fails, recourse must be had to an extraordinary one."

President Trump is correctly expected to comply with the rules and procedures of humanitarian international law, yet he must also continue to bear in mind that Jihadist enemies will remain unaffected by these or any other jurisprudential expectations. Assassination and other still broader forms of preemption may sometimes be not only allowable under binding international law, but also indispensable. Conversely, however, there are occasions when strategies of assassination could be determinedly legal but remain operationally ineffectual.

Recalling the close connections between international law and US law - connections that extend to direct and literal forms of "incorporation" - an American president can never choose to dismiss the law of war on grounds that it is "merely international."  Always, President Trump should consider decipherable connections between assassination, counter-terrorism and United States Constitutional Law.  Recall that the targeted killing of Anwar al-Awlaki had been approved by US President Barack Obama and by a still-secret committee of advisors based in the US Department of Justice.

Under US law, we are now bound to inquire whether an American president should ever be authorized to order the extra-judicial killing of a United States citizen - even one deemed an "enemy combatant" - without any at least perfunctory reference to "due process of law?" On its face, any affirmative response to this necessary query would be difficult to defend under the <em>US Constitution</em>.

Of necessity, such approval would need to be based upon a reasonably presumed <em>high urgency</em> of the terror threat posed by the prospective victim. Any such allegedly "authorized" targeted killing of US citizens would express a potentially irremediable tension between theoretically indissoluble individual citizen rights and the increasingly peremptory requirements of public safety.

US policy on assassination or targeted killing will have to reflect a very delicate balance. Most important, in any such calculation, will be the protection of civilian populations from Jihadist terror-inflicted harms. In those circumstances where such harms would involve unconventional weapons of any sort - chemical, biological or nuclear - the legal propriety of targeting Jihadist terrorists could be patently obvious and effectively "beyond reasonable doubt."

Nonetheless, such proper legal assessments ought never be undertaken apart from corresponding operational expectations. This means, <em>inter alia,</em> that before any "extraordinary remedies" should be applied, those presumptive remedies should be not only legal, but also tactically sound. In the end, we may now be reminded by Cicero, "The safety of the people shall be the highest law."

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In April, the Pre-Trial Chamber (PTC) of the International Criminal Court (ICC) <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/itemsDocuments/190415-afg-qa-eng.pdf">refused</a> to authorize an investigation into alleged war crimes that have been committed in Afghanistan since 2003. The Prosecutor’s 20,000-page request, issued in November 2017, would have opened a broad investigation, including a probe into possible war crimes committed by U.S. military personnel. The three-member Chamber was unanimous in deciding not to proceed.

The PTC recognized that both the admissibility and jurisdictional requirements set forth in the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/resource-library/documents/rs-eng.pdf">Rome Statute</a> were met. It also found that the Prosecutor’s request established “a reasonable basis to consider that crimes within ICC jurisdiction have been committed in Afghanistan.” However, the judges ruled that the requested investigation “would not serve the interests of justice.”

The most troubling issue is determining the threshold at which to invoke the <em>interests of justice</em> because prosecution would itself be unjust or counterproductive. There is an ancillary debate about whether such a determination falls within the purview of the Chamber or lies solely with the <a href="https://dovjacobs.com/2019/04/12/icc-pre-trial-chamber-rejects-otp-request-to-open-an-investigation-in-afghanistan-some-preliminary-thoughts-on-an-ultra-vires-decision/">Prosecutor.</a> There is also a question of whether the Court can refuse an investigation on the basis of limited resources or expectations of difficulty.

As it is commonly known, an “admissibility test” is part of the court review process that arises from an investigation. This “test” refers, in part, to an <em>interests of justice</em> threshold that all ICC situations must meet (see Article 53(1)(c)). In my opinion, this part of the test is shouldered by the Prosecutor when deciding whether to institute an investigation.

The <a href="http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm#art.53" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rome Statute</a> gives neither a definition nor “clear guidance” on the meaning of <em>interests of justice,</em> and the concept is complex. In 2007, the OTP issued a policy paper in which it expounded its own interpretation of the concept. At the outset, the OTP <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/772C95C9-F54D-4321-BF09-73422BB23528/143640/ICCOTPInterestsOfJustice.pdf">recognized</a> that, as a policy document, it remains subject to subsequent authoritative interpretations of law from the Court. Clearly the OTP recognizes that there is a role for both its office and the judges in dealing with this issue. Still, it is not the job of the Court to independently consider whether a situation meets the interests of justice threshold.

There has always been a presumption in favor of prosecution and an unwritten rule that the Prosecutor should embrace the <em>interests of justice</em> principle only in exceptional circumstances and only “as a course of last resort.” When weighed against the gravity of a crime and victims’ interests, there has never been a situation where the Prosecutor determined that there was no interests of justice to investigate.

Moreover, the Court (Pre-Trial Chamber II) considered the <em>interests of justice</em> provision in March 2010 when ruling on the Prosecutor’s request to investigate the 2007 post-election events in Kenya. In a majority decision upholding his request, the Court <a href="https://www.legal-tools.org/doc/338a6f/pdf/">concluded</a> that the interests of justice provision imposes no positive requirement for the Prosecutor “to establish that an investigation is actually in the interests of justice”, and, therefore, “the Prosecutor does not have to present reasons or supporting material in this respect." The Court stated that:
<blockquote>It is only when the Prosecutor decides that an investigation would not be in the interests of justice that he or she is under the obligation to notify the Chamber of the reasons for such a decision, thereby triggering the review power of the Chamber.</blockquote>
In the 2011 Libyan situation, the Prosecutor adhered to this line of reasoning when deciding to institute proceedings. Prior to the formal opening of an investigation into the situation in Libya, the Prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/EA019818-B8C1-44C8-8C7B-4398F33FF029/283045/StatementLibya_03032011.pdf">evaluated</a> the available information and held that the statutory criteria for opening an investigation had been met. As part of this evaluation, the OTP found no evidence that there was any genuine national investigation or prosecution of the alleged perpetrators. Consequently, it <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/63682F4E-49C8-445D-8C13-F310A4F3AEC2/284116/OTPReportonPreliminaryExaminations13December2011.pdf.">found</a> that the situation “clearly appeared to meet the threshold of gravity required," and that there were “no substantial reasons to believe that [an ICC] investigation would not serve the interests of justice.”

More recently, the PTC authorized investigations into the situations in Georgia and Burundi. In both cases, the Chamber did not undertake its own independent assessment of whether the investigations would serve the interests of justice. It also did not impose any positive obligation on the Prosecutor to do so. The judges agreed that since the Prosecutor had found no reason to believe that an investigation would not serve the interests of justice, the PTC also <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/CourtRecords/CR2016_00608.PDF">found</a> no reason to think otherwise.

Therefore, it is clear that the PTC’s decision to review the interests of justice in this case was based on a reinterpretation of Article 53(1) that is not found anywhere in prior case law.

The PTC focused on “feasibility,” questioning whether the Court could undertake the case given the reality of limited resources. In the eyes of the judges, it would be better to focus on “activities that have a better chance of success." As Professor Kevin Heller has correctly <a href="http://opiniojuris.org/2019/04/13/one-word-for-the-ptc-on-the-interests-of-justice-taliban/">noted</a>, this is contrary to the OTP’s position that feasibility should not play a role in the interests of justice assessment. Its own policy paper from 2013 <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/OTP-Policy_Paper_Preliminary_Examinations_2013-ENG.pdf">warned</a> that “weighing feasibility as a separate, self-standing factor … could prejudice the consistent application of the statue and might encourage obstructionism to dissuade ICC intervention.”

Evidently, the OTP’s warning was valid, as among the factors deemed relevant to the feasibility assessment, the Chamber listed the current lack of cooperation from states and the bleak prospects of future cooperation, essentially determining that an investigation would not be in the <em>interests of justice</em> because the alleged perpetrators of war crimes do not wish to be investigated. This position has justifiably received widespread condemnation for the message it sends, which is that states can escape accountability for international crimes by simply refusing to cooperate. Furthermore, the lack of cooperation from <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/63746/deconstructing-the-intl-criminal-courts-decision-on-afghanistan/">states</a> “is not a selection criteria” under the Rome Statute (Article (87)(7)). In my view, this case serves as an example of why <em>interests of justice</em> should not be reduced to a matter of feasibility.

The perception is that the Afghanistan decision was highly <a href="https://www.ejiltalk.org/afghanistan-and-the-interests-of-justice-an-unwise-exercise/">politicized</a>, and that the Court succumbed to political pressure from international power brokers, like the United States. Following the election of President Trump, attacks on international bodies, including the ICC, have been belligerent, relentless and brutal. Trump’s National Security Advisor, John Bolton, used <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/in-first-major-address-john-bolton-attacks-old-foe/">inflammatory rhetoric</a> to declare the ICC “illegitimate” and threatened the arrest of Court personnel if criminal charges were brought against U.S. military and intelligence staff for alleged war crimes committed in Afghanistan. The U.S. also <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2019/04/us-revokes-visa-of-icc-prosecutor-over-afghanistan-investigation/">revoked</a> the Prosecutor’s visa.

Rightfully, the PTC’s decision has caused an outpouring of scorn from prominent NGOs. The Center for Constitutional Rights in New York <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/the-international-criminal-court-crashes-and-burns-over-afghanistan">said</a> the Court was sending a “dangerous message” that “bullying wins and the powerful won’t be held to account." Amnesty International similarly <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-47912140">construed</a> the decision as a “craven capitulation to Washington’s bullying,” as did the Coalition for the International Criminal Court, which <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-za/news/other/icc-accused-of-e2-80-98political-considerations-e2-80-99-over-afghanistan/ar-BBW0dXL">stated</a> that “political considerations [had] overridden legal precedents.”

For some, the Court’s decision was welcome. John Bolton <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bolton-claims-victory-as-international-criminal-court-rejects-investigation-into-alleged-u-s-war-crimes/">said</a> the decision marked “the second happiest day of my life” – the first being when the US “un-signed” the Rome Statute. The Trump administration celebrated the decision as “a victory for the rule of law.” Israeli President Netanyahu also lauded the decision for “correcting an injustice” and blocking “a move that would have upended the original goal of the establishment of the international court.” He <a href="https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Netanyahu-Its-absurd-for-ICC-to-put-US-or-Israeli-soldiers-on-trial-586805">accused</a> the ICC of unfairly targeting the US and Israel, despite these countries “having the best legal systems in the world.”

International justice is not equitable. International justice is not perfect. A major part of the problem is that instruments of justice do not receive universal support. The United States, Russia, China, and Israel are not State Parties to the ICC. The powerful often escape accountability, while the powerless cannot. This has long been the perspective of many African countries, and underlies their challenges to the Court.

The African Union <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-22681894">accused</a> the ICC of unduly targeting Africa. The consequences have been real. In 2017, Burundi became the first country to withdraw from the ICC, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/oct/28/burundi-becomes-first-nation-to-leave-international-criminal-court">condemning</a> it as “a weapon used by the West to enslave other states.” Kenya has denounced the ICC as a tool of Western imperialism. While alternative explanations are offered for the seemingly disproportionate focus on Africa, the Court cannot escape the <a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/kenya-and-international-criminal-court">perception</a> it has created of itself. Thirty-three of its member states are African (making Africa the largest regional bloc in the ICC). With the Court dependent on the support and participation of its members, maintaining credibility is imperative.

Former ICC Prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo got it right when he <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-37750978">called</a> on the Court to investigate alleged US war crimes in Afghanistan for the precise purpose of  “developing a level playing field with the world’s superpowers.” The Prosecutor’s request to investigate provided an opportunity for the Court to demonstrate its universality and impartiality. The Court’s decision merely shows that justice may be partial after all.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On May 21, 2019, at the annual meeting of the <a href="https://www.ali.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Law Institute</a>, members considered a proposal to approve a <a href="https://www.ali.org/projects/show/consumer-contracts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Restatement of the Law of Consumer Contracts</a> (RLCC). Members discussed the draft for over four hours and ultimately had to defer the vote for a later meeting due to a lack of time. The subject of “consumer contracts” sounds about as interesting as reading fine print. So what stirred up such passions?

The proposed RLCC is an attempt to unsnarl the messy strands of contract law that have sprung up with the rise of all things digital. For contracts professors, nothing less than the soul of contract law (and the UCC) is at stake. As a general matter, the objective of contract law is to promote individual autonomy. A contract is a tool of autonomy. It allows parties to allocate their rights (to property) in a way that they think best. Accordingly, the traditional role of courts in adjudicating contract disputes has been to fulfill the “reasonable expectations” of the parties. Reasonable expectations is itself a compromise in the sense that it may not give a party exactly what that party intended or expected. Courts generally have navigated the “reasonable expectations” territory between two poles – consent and paternalism. They will not find a contract without consent and they will not make a contract for the parties or save the parties from making a bad bargain if that is something to which they consented. If, however, the terms are against public policy or the court suspects consent was not actually knowing or voluntarily, then they will refuse to enforce it under a doctrine such as unconscionability, duress, mistake or fraud.

Contracts allow parties to get the most out of their property by allocating rights in a way that they see fit. Accordingly, another objective of contract law is to reduce transaction costs. Parties get more value from property ownership by being able to exchange rights to that property. Efficiency in the context of contract law does not mean making choices for the parties; the law does not impose contracts on parties even if doing so would increase their welfare. Courts enforce contracts because the parties have consented, and consent is the heart of autonomy. Consequently, efficiency is a goal of contract law only to the extent that it is in the service of autonomy.

The proposed RLCC, however, favors efficiency over autonomy. It adopts as its foundational tenet the framing established in two cases, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11811009805458694240&amp;q=procd+v.+zeidenberg&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39&amp;as_vis=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ProCD</a><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11811009805458694240&amp;q=procd+v.+zeidenberg&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39&amp;as_vis=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> v.</a><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11811009805458694240&amp;q=procd+v.+zeidenberg&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39&amp;as_vis=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Zeidenberg</a> and <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/contract/cases/hill.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hill</a><a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/contract/cases/hill.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> v.</a><a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/contract/cases/hill.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Gat</a><a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/contract/cases/hill.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eway</a>. These two cases espoused the theory of “rolling contract” formation, which is much reviled by contracts professors because it makes a hash of the orderly world of contract law and the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UCC</a>. Without any support in the case law, Judge Easterbrook (unabashedly part of the law and economics movement) claimed that <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Section 2-207</a> did not apply to single form transactions and created a parallel universe of contract law which upended the traditional rules. In Judge Easterbrook’s contracts wonderland, someone could consent without knowing to what they were consenting and consent was presumed unless the party took active steps to show non-consent. As long as the adhering party had “reasonable notice” and manifested consent by not showing non-consent (i.e. by doing nothing), a contract was deemed formed. That fact that Easterbrook was a federal judge trampling on state law made the doctrinal wreckage all the more galling.

Courts generally used the rolling contract theory only with certain types of transactions. They didn’t use it when consumers signed their contracts or when they negotiated the terms. They used it when the adhering party acted in bad faith or when statutes allowed them to present terms in this way (the UCC, for example, allows warranty disclaimers provided they are conspicuous). Importantly, the use of mass consumer form contracts was contained by the limits of the physical world. A consumer would be suspicious if forced to sign a twenty-page document for a seemingly trivial transaction. Consequently, businesses reserved lengthy contracts for the most important transactions, such as buying a house or taking out a loan. Consumers generally expect warranty terms will arrive in a box with the product, and companies usually kept other restrictions and limitations to those that would fit on the two sides of a single sheet of paper. That single sheet of paper was precious real estate and so accommodated only the most important terms. Furthermore, some of these terms often had to be “conspicuous” so they took up more of that precious space on the page. All in all, it wasn’t ideal, but it worked reasonably well. Companies restrained themselves because to send a thirty-page document to every customer for every trivial transaction would have been costly in terms of both money and customer goodwill. Furthermore, if a company overreached with egregious terms, consumers could always have their day in court and try to get out of the contract.

But as the marketplace changed from tangible goods to intangible ones, the form of contracts also changed. As the world moved online, so did contracts. Digital contracts were weightless and invisible to the consumer. Businesses no longer paid a price in terms of paper or customer goodwill if they imposed too many terms. The intangibility of contracts gave rise to their ubiquity. The nature of reasonable notice changed. What was reasonable to notice on a single sheet of paper became undetectable when it required clicking on a link (or two). What was reasonable to notice when it fell out of a box or was handed to you in the form of a claim ticket became invisible if it required scrolling on a phone screen. The warranty disclaimer might be in all caps but if the user is unlikely to visit the page where the disclaimer resides, it might as well not exist. As digital contracts became ubiquitous, consumers became habituated to clicking without even reading adjacent terms. Courts, however, following ProCD’s twisted logic, considered the “reasonableness” of the notice from an ex-post perspective, which usually meant that they would notice the terms because they were looking for them. They ignored the problem of inattentional blindness and how Internet users develop tunnel vision and often don’t see links to lengthy TOS that are frequently updated.

The change in contracting form resulted in a change in the substance of contract terms. Now, the terms were no longer solely about warranty limits and disclaimers. Now, businesses claim rights to collect and sell personal information, impose mandatory arbitration clauses and obtain perpetual rights to user generated content. As a result, customers are being bound to more oppressive terms often with no ability to challenge them in a court of law.

But change is in the air. The beauty of the common law is that it usually self-corrects when it goes too far. Recent cases addressing electronic adhesive contracts have a more sophisticated and nuanced discussion of what meets the standard of “reasonable notice,” reflecting an understanding that the context and format in which a contract is presented matters. Courts are starting to view the terms from an ex-ante perspective, experiencing the consumer’s encounter with the terms the way the consumer experienced it rather than by looking at the terms in acontextual, ex-post isolation. Some courts have started to question whether a manifestation of assent is enough to show consent to all the terms, showing signs of requiring specific assent to important, rights-altering terms like mandatory arbitration or recurring fee provisions. (<a href="https://casetext.com/case/berkson-v-gogo-llc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Berkson v. Gogo</a>; <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-7th-circuit/1730191.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sgouros v. Transunion Corp</a>; <a href="https://casetext.com/case/adwar-casting-co-v-star-gems-inc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adwar Casting v. Star Gems</a>; see also <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2911220" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Online Contracting: New Developments</a>.) In other words, recent cases seem to be swinging the pendulum back toward reasonable expectations, or at least away from unconsented-to terms. Courts are, as always, attuned to opportunism on the part of the consumer and abuse on the part of the business. A consumer who takes the benefit of offered services is less likely to get away with claiming lack of notice than a consumer who does not. Similarly, a business which charges customers fees will have a higher bar to show reasonable notice than one that does not.

The RLCC would forcibly stunt the development of the law of consumer contracts at this very dynamic period, and it would do so by endorsing an approach which runs counter to the common law of contracts. More alarming, it would extend the application of this errant strand of law, which was developed for a particular type of consumer contract in a particular environment and apply it to all consumer contracts.

Critics have other objections as well, ranging from the methodology used by the Reporters and their interpretation of the cases to the precise language employed in the rules. The fight over the soul of contracts was reflected in the methodology employed by the Reporters in supporting their conclusions. They employed an empirical analysis of the cases as part of their “<a href="http://yalejreg.com/nc/reporters-statement-concerning-research-methods-by-oren-bar-gill-omri-ben-shahar-and-florencia-marotta-wurgler/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">systematic formulation of the common law rules</a>.” The proposed RLCC’s finding were challenged in two law review articles and were the subject of an <a href="http://yalejreg.com/volume36-issue1/#Klass and http://yalejreg.com/volume36-issue1/#Levitin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online symposia</a>.  Counting cases to determine the majority rule prioritized the result over the rationale and overlooked the many factual distinctions that influenced holdings. The RLCC was (and continues to be) the subject of a thoughtful and energetic discussion on a list serve of contracts law professors who care about making sure that the next generation of lawyers gets the law right.

Most disconcerting, perhaps, about the RLCC is its lack of social responsibility. Wrap contracts – shrinkwraps, clickwraps, browsewraps, scrollwraps, etc. - have been the subject of public scorn and dismay. They contribute to the sense of helplessness and the gnawing collective belief that institutional forces are working against the interest of consumers. Standard form contracts are no longer limited by paper and so they are no longer bound by convention. One<a href="https://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2456&amp;context=plr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> academic study</a> showed that companies had more onerous terms for their customers who bought products online than they had for their in-store customers.

Standard form contracts can turn the sale of a product into a license of one, and in doing so, change the very nature of property ownership. Standard form contracts also have a role in whether devices, such as Alexa, are permitted to spy on us in our homes and sell that information to others. Companies can learn much about us by collecting, buying and selling personal information that we “agreed” to give them (even if we did so without knowing it). We are only at the tip of the iceberg as far as where that will take us. The more information that a company has about us, the more vulnerable we are to manipulation.

As our ability to control our data becomes more critical to our individual freedom, our ability to refrain from contracting away our rights becomes more important. The RLCC essentially shrugs its shoulders and claims it can do nothing about the social problems created by contracts run amok. Yet, that claim is untrue. Contract law was designed to do this, and it has done so by protecting the reasonable expectations of the parties. Instead, of feigning helplessness, the RLCC should help rebuild the public’s faith in the law by rehabilitating contract doctrine and restoring it to its former glory.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On Tuesday, May 21, the Serbian National Assembly passed the Criminal Code amendment which introduced significant changes into the criminal justice system, out of which the most controversial one is the sentence to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole (LWOP). The LWOP is now prescribed as a possible sentence for some of the most serious offences prescribed by the Criminal Code:
<ol>
 	<li>Aggravated murder (art. 114, par. 9 (1));</li>
 	<li>Rape which resulted in death. (art. 178 (4))</li>
 	<li>Sexual intercourse with a helpless person which resulted in death. (art.179(3))</li>
 	<li>Sexual intercourse with a child which resulted in death. (art.180(3))</li>
 	<li>Sexual intercourse through abuse of position (art.181(5))</li>
</ol>
These legal novelties were triggered by the citizens’ petition, so-called “Tijana’s Law Initiative” which was a public response to the egregious case of rape and violent murder of a 13-old girl back in 2014. In the Rationale of amending the law, the Serbian legislator stated that this amendment derives its legitimacy from the will of 158.460 citizens who signed the petition, demanding the most severe punishment for the sex offenders. The citizens of Serbia welcomed this law as an act which would finally bring justice to the victims of the most serious crimes and their families. Nevertheless, the judiciary, academia, and eminent human rights institutions (NGOs such as Autonomous Women’s Center, Yucom Lawyers’ Committee for Human Rights, Belgrade Center for Human Rights) have tried to draw attention to the discordance of this amendment with the international human rights standards and Serbian constitution, but also to bring to the public attention the dangerous outcomes this law may lead to in the future.

The first and obvious issue which needs to be addressed is that the life imprisonment sentence was proposed in the citizens’ initiative only in regard to the murder of a child or a pregnant woman and sexual offences which resulted in death. Nevertheless, the legislator in the Law’s rationale stated that “it doesn’t make sense to have both life imprisonment and the max. 30-40 year sentence in the Criminal code”, so article 40 of the Amendment extended the application of this law to all the criminal offences for which there was earlier a 30-40 year sentence prescribed. The problem is that the range of the criminal offences for which the courts can now impose the life sentence goes far beyond the one proposed by the Initiative. (E.g. criminal offences against the constitutional order and security of the state, genocide, crimes against humanity, crimes against the civilians, planning of murder and murder of the highest state officials). There are two serious problems with this legal solution: first, even if it is true from the perspective of legal certainty that there should be only one maximum sentence, the life imprisonment, being the replacement of the capital punishment, should it be proved as justified and necessary in regard to each particular criminal offence. The National Assembly failed to do so. Secondly, the legislator introduced LWOP in relation to the previously mentioned sexual offences and aggravated murder, but left the option of parole for genocide and crimes against humanity, which is unreasonable from the aspect of the proportionality of the sanction. It seems as the law was introduced as a strong emotional response to a hard case, which leading Serbian criminal law experts defined as not so useful strategy of crime prevention. In addition, this legislative framework can lead to many problems in practice which the legislator didn’t take into consideration.

For example, NGO Autonomous Women’s Center tried to warn the National Assembly that the introduction of the life imprisonment would actually lead to lower and not higher sentences for those who commit the most serious offences, taking into consideration the Serbian courts’ sentencing policy. Statistics from 2017 which this organization provided show that in 51 cases of the aggravated murder, the courts delivered only two maximum year sentences. The second highest sentence after the previous max. 30-40 year sentence in the Serbian criminal law is 20 years in prison (art.45 (1) of the Criminal Code). If courts in future will be able to apply only life imprisonment or the second highest sentence (20 years), statistics show that the courts would most likely go for the less severe option, which will be completely against the rationale of this amendment.

Additional controversial provision of this amendment concerns the repeat offence which seriously restricts the competencies of the judiciary in the criminal proceedings. If an individual commits a new crime within 5 years after he was convicted for another crime, the judge will have to apply the stricter sentence, regardless of the different nature of those two offences. This could lead to absurd and seemingly unjust consequences in practice.

The second aspect from which this law could be analyzed is the international human rights framework which Serbia obliged itself to, particularly European Convention on Human Rights. Serbia has been a Contracting state of the European Convention since 2003, which entails the state’s obligation to fully comply with the European Court of Human Right’s jurisprudence. Introduction of the life sentence without the possibility of parole is in discordance with the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights as it amounts to a violation of the Article 3 of the Convention (prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment). It is important to note that life imprisonment is not prohibited under the Convention as such, mostly because of the states’ wide margin of appreciation in the matters concerning criminal justice system and the lack of European consensus in relation to the punishment for the most serious crimes.

“It is well-established in the Court’s case-law that a State’s choice of a specific criminal justice system, including sentence review and release arrangements, is in principle outside the scope of the supervision the Court carries out at the European level, provided that the system does not contravene the principles set forth in the Convention” (See Vinter and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment (Grand Chamber) of 9 July 2013, §104 Kafkaris v. Cyprus [GC], no. <a href="https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#{">21906/04</a>, ECHR 2008, §99). In addition, the Court established that “it is not its role to decide what is the appropriate term of detention applicable to a particular offence or to pronounce on the appropriate length of detention or other sentence which should be served by a person after conviction by a competent court” (Vinter and Others v. UK, cited above, §105, also see T. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. <a href="https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#{">24724/94</a>, § 117, 16 December 1999; V. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. <a href="https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#{">24888/94</a>, § 118, ECHR 1999‑IX; and Sawoniuk v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. <a href="https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#{">63716/00</a>, ECHR 2001‑VI).

Thus, the life sentence would probably pass the ECthHR 3-tier test of rights’ restriction (The restriction of human rights has to be 1. prescribed by law. 2. proportionate. 3. necessary in democratic society).

Nevertheless, the life sentence without the possibility of parole would not, according to the Court’s standards set in the <em>Kafkaris</em> and <em>Vinter</em> <em>and Others v. UK judgements</em>.

Firstly, in <em>Kafkaris v. Cyprus</em>, the Court stated that the punishment has to be reducible de iure e de facto in order not to amount to a violation of the article 3 of the Convention. (<em>Kafkaris v. Cyprus</em> §98). Further, in <em>Vinter and Others v. UK</em>, the Court elaborated more on when the sentence would be regarded as irreducible and, thus, violate the article 3:
<blockquote>“... [I]n the context of a life sentence, Article 3 [of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment1,] must be interpreted as requiring reducibility of the sentence, in the sense of a review which allows the domestic authorities to consider whether any changes in the life prisoner are so significant, and such progress towards rehabilitation has been made in the course of the sentence, as to mean that continued detention can no longer be justified on legitimate penological grounds……..where domestic law does not provide for the possibility of such a review, a whole life sentence will not measure up to the standards of Article 3 of the Convention. ... Furthermore, ... [a] whole life prisoner is entitled to know, at the outset of his sentence, what he must do to be considered for release and under what conditions, including when a review of his sentence will take place or may be sought. Consequently, where domestic law does not provide any mechanism or possibility for review of a whole life sentence, the incompatibility with Article 3 on this ground already arises at the moment of the imposition of the whole life sentence and not at a later stage of incarceration.” (Vinter and Others v. the United Kingdom, cited above, §§ 119-122).</blockquote>
The rationale behind this Court’s approach is that the prisoner, regardless of the seriousness of the crime he committed, has to have the right to hope that he will eventually be released and reintegrated into society, if he no longer represent a public threat. The right to hope, of course, is not explicitly protected under the Convention, but the idea of protecting such right often appears within the ECtHR jurisprudence. For example, in his concurring opinion to the Vinter judgement, the judge Power Forde stated:
<blockquote>“Those who commit the most abhorrent and egregious of acts and who inflict untold suffering upon others, nevertheless retain their fundamental humanity and carry within themselves the capacity to change. Long and deserved though their prison sentences may be, they retain the right to hope that, someday, they may have atoned for the wrongs which they have committed. They ought not to be deprived entirely of such hope. To deny them the experience of hope would be to deny a fundamental aspect of their humanity and, to do that, would be degrading”.</blockquote>
Thus, under the ECHR standards, the LWOP would undermine the highest protection of human dignity, which all the Contracting states agreed upon. Since the Serbian amendment was introduced without taking into consideration these standards, we can expect a lot of pending cases in front of the ECtHR in regard to the LWOP in the future, which will most likely end up in Court finding a violation of the Article 3.

Other than European Convention on Human Rights, this law does not meet the standards of the other ratified conventions either, such as International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.

The Council of Europe (CoE) Commissioner for Human Rights Dunja Mijatovic  expressed her <a href="https://rm.coe.int/letter-to-nela-kuburovic-minister-of-justice-of-serbia-by-dunja-mijato/168094720c">criticism</a> in regard to the new law already at the drafting stage, but the Serbian Government disregarded it.

Finally, the Amendment to the Criminal Code is in discordance with the article 20 of the Serbian Constitution which prescribes that “attained level of human and minority rights may not be lowered.” Serbia was one of the rare countries which did not introduce the life imprisonment sentence after having the capital punishment abolished in 2002. Thus, introducing it after 17 years would hardly have a constitutional ground.

		<title>Jean-Pierre Bemba’s Request for Compensation for Damages from the International Criminal Court</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo (Bemba) is the leader of the Movement for the Liberation of Congo (MLC) and was the commander-in-chief of its military forces during the Central African Bush War from 2003-2004, during which the MLC was accused of committing war crimes, as well as, crimes against humanity.

Bemba was arrested on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role as the leader of the MLC  near Brussels in May 2008 and <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/car/bemba">was handed over to the International Criminal Court (ICC)</a> on July 3, 2008. Bemba was held by the ICC for over two years before his trial began in November 2010, throughout the duration of his trial which lasted until 2014, and still after the conclusion of his trial, until his convictions on March 21, 2016.

The ICC sentenced Bemba to 18 years detention for war crimes and crimes against humanity convictions, plus an additional year and a €290,000 fine for witness tampering.

Bemba appealed his convictions in 2016, citing procedural and legal errors in the lower court judge’s ruling, which Bemba’s counsel said should have resulted in a mistrial. The ICC chamber to which Bemba appealed found on June 8, 2018 that the trial chamber had ignored significant testimonial evidence proving that Bemba had a limited ability to investigate and punish war crimes in the Central African Republic during and after the violence in 2003 and 2004. This conclusion lead to Bemba’s acquittal.

Bemba submitted a request for compensation to the ICC on March 8, 2019. The ICC Prosecutor and Registrar asked the judges to dismiss this claim, but the Pre-Trial Chamber II judges presiding over the claim denied this request.

Bemba's claim totaled €68.8 million, including: €12 million for the period of his alleged unlawful incarceration, €10 million in aggravated damages, €4.2 million in legal fees, with the remaining €42.4 million being for property damage.

Bemba's request for property damage compensation stems from those losses consequent to Bemba’s arrest and detention as well as those losses caused by the ICC’s mistakes in managing Bemba’s frozen assets, as the assets seized by the ICC upon Bemba’s conviction were allowed to rot.

The provisions of the law are that <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/resourcelibrary/official-journal/rome-statute.aspx#article85">Article 85</a> of the ICC’s Rome Statute governs compensation claims by persons who have been arrested pursuant to the ICC’s jurisdiction or convicted by the ICC. The governing clause provides two primary bases for bringing claims for compensation: the first is found in Article 85(1) while the second is laid out in Article 85(3). Article 85(1) of the Rome Statute states that “[a]nyone who has been the victim of unlawful arrest or detention shall have an enforceable right to compensation.” Article 85(3) is vaguer and states that “[i]n exceptional circumstances, where the court finds conclusive facts showing that there has been a grave and manifest miscarriage of justice, it may in its discretion award compensation . . . according to the criteria provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, to a person who has been released from detention following a final decision of acquittal or a termination of the proceedings for that reason.”

Claims for compensation must follow the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/pids/legal-texts/rulesprocedureevidenceeng.pdf">ICC’s Rules of Evidence and Procedure</a>, specifically Rule 173(2), which requires that a request for compensation be submitted to the court no later than six months from the date the person making the request was notified of the decision of the court concerning unlawful arrest or detention; reversal of a conviction; or existence of a grave and manifest miscarriage of justice.

Any party seeking compensation on such grounds must submit a written request containing the grounds for and the amount of compensation being sought to the ICC’s Presidency. The ICC then designates a three-judge chamber to consider the request. Rule 174 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence provides that judges handling such requests<span> </span><i>may<span> </span></i>hold a hearing or determine the matter based on the request along with any written observations by the prosecutor and the party who filed the request.

In cases in which damages<span> </span><i>are</i><span> </span>awarded, judges shall take into consideration “the consequences of the grave and manifest miscarriage of justice on the personal, family, and social professional situation of the claimant.” However, it has been acknowledged that there is no exact formula for calculating such damages.

The ICC does not have precedent in awarding damages to those seeking compensation under the court’s jurisdiction, and there does not seem to be a set test to determine whether a party seeking compensation from the ICC will receive such damages – at this point, it is purely discretionary. However, it does seem as if the ICC tends to look to whether the claim for damages is viable under Article 85(1) or 85(3) of the Rome Statute and proper under Rule 173(2) before considering the amount of compensation requested.

The two previous requests for compensation failed: the first came from former Congolese militia leader <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/drc/ngudjolo">Mathieu Ngudjolo</a>, while the second was submitted by <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr969&amp;ln=en">Jean-Jaques Mangenda Kabongo</a>, Bemba’s former case manager.

Ngudjolo brought his 2015 claim under both Articles 85(1) and 85(3) after his 2012 acquittal of 2008 war crimes and crimes against humanity convictions. As the court acquitted Ngudjolo due to a lack of sufficient evidence from the prosecution, Ngudjolo sought compensation under the theory that he was unlawfully arrested and detained, and that the proceedings in his case resulted in a grave miscarriage of justice. Ngudjolo asked the court for a total of €906,346, which included €80 per each day of his 1,781 day-long prison stay; €360,000 in moral damages; €124,866 for childcare expenses; €9,000 for a vehicle; and €270,000 for a house.

The court rejected Ngudjolo’s request, stating that the defense lawyers in the case did not show that Ngudjolo had been unlawfully arrested or detained, and also failed to establish that Ngudjolo suffered a grave and manifest miscarriage of justice that resulted in a clear violation of fundamental rights and caused serious harm. This lead to the finding that there were no grounds for the chamber to exercise its discretion to award compensation to Ngudjolo.

Jean-Jacques Mangenda-Kabongo brought his claim for compensation to the ICC in April 2015. Mangenda submitted his request for compensation when he was kept in ICC detention for nine days after the trial judge in his corrupting witnesses case ordered him released pending his trial. Mangenda requested €3,000 from the ICC for each day he was allegedly unlawfully detained, totaling €27,000.

The trial chamber assigned to Mangenda’s request rejected the submission on February 26, 2016, stating that there was no basis for finding that Mangenda’s nine extra days of detention were unlawful, and thus did not consider the damages he requested.

In conclusion, it is unclear whether Bemba’s claim for damages from the ICC will succeed, due to the lack of case law surrounding the case and the ambiguity in the language of the applicable articles of the Rome Statute. Bemba’s extended detention, as well as substantial loss in assets due to the ICC’s alleged negligence, present compelling arguments for the ICC to consider.

However, the judge in Bemba’s appellate hearing indicated that she believed the trial chamber erred in many evidentiary areas during Bemba’s trial and the conviction that resulted in extended detention and many collateral consequences. These things taken together may result in at least some of Bemba’s claim being granted.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>"There is no longer a virtuous nation, and the best of us live by candlelight."</em> -William Butler Yeats

From the beginning of his presidency, Donald Trump has presumed a hard and fast distinction between America's national interest and the broader interests of our "state of nations." Rather than recognize the indissoluble interdependence of all states, he has mistakenly fashioned foreign policies on the long-discredited idea that one's state's gain is inevitably another state's loss. The cumulative result of such erroneous thinking has been injurious "beyond any reasonable doubt."

In essence, the tangible result of "America First" has been an increasingly debilitated nation. This debility can be meaningfully assessed not only in the usual political and geostrategic terms but also from the co-equally critical standpoints of national and international law. Though generally disregarded, these perspectives are potentially very important to the security and well-being of the United States.

Traditionally, world law has been based upon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reason-Realpolitik-Foreign-Policy-World/dp/0669077569"><i>Realpoliitk </i></a>or power politics. Although such thinking is normally accepted as "realistic," these acquiescent postures must ultimately prove shortsighted.  This means, <em>inter alia,</em> that the American president would be well-advised to acknowledge the inherent limitations of our current global threat system and seek to identify more durable configurations of international relations and international law.

Here, history deserves some evident pride. What might first still seem promising to Trump in the "state of nature" (the global condition of anarchy dating back to the <a href="https://pages.uoregon.edu/dluebke/301ModernEurope/Treaty%20of%20Westphalia%20%5BExcerpts%5D.pdf">Peace of Westphalia in 1648</a>) is apt to prove futile for our longer-term American prospects.  Moreover, this futility could sometime be experienced not merely as a casual debt in our national security calculus, but as an explosive and possibly irremediable set of existential costs.

It is high time, therefore, for Trump to think beyond "America First." The United States, in the fashion of every other state, is part of a much larger and complex world legal system.  This more comprehensive system of law has diminishing chances for success within our corrosively recalcitrant pattern of  "Westphalian" sovereignties.

"What is the good of passing from one untenable position to another," asks <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Samuel-Beckett">Samuel Beckett</a> philosophically in <a href="http://www.ricorso.net/rx/library/authors/classic/Beckett_S/Endgame.htm"><i>Endgame</i></a><em>,</em> "of seeking justification always on the same plane?" Though the celebrated Irish playwright was not thinking specifically about world politics or international law, his generalized query remains perfectly well-suited. As competitive power-politics has never worked, why insist upon maintaining it as a doctrine of presumed national interest?

In such matters, truth is exculpatory.  Facts cannot be suitably overridden by visceral chanting at presidential rallies or by substitution of empty witticisms for historical fact. In essence,  <em>Realpolitik</em> or balance of power world legal order can never succeed for longer than very brief and unpredictable intervals. In the uncertain future, this grievously unsteady foundation could be exacerbated by multiple systemic failures, ones sometimes mutually reinforcing or "<a href="https://harvardnsj.org/2015/06/core-synergies-in-israels-strategic-planning-when-the-adversarial-whole-is-greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts/">synergistic</a>," sometimes involving weapons of mass destruction.

Most conspicuously portentous, in this regard, would be the use of nuclear weapons.

There is more. By definition, any failure of nuclear <em>Realpolitik</em> could be not "only" catastrophic forms of <a href="http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/instree/GAres3314.html">aggression</a>, but forms that are unprecedented (<em>sui generis</em>) in the most starkly negative sense. This conclusion would hold true if the pertinent failure were judged in the full scope of its national and international declensions.

What is next? All states that depend upon some form of nuclear deterrence, especially the United States, must prepare to think more self-consciously and imaginatively about alternative systems of world politics and world law. They must think about creating prospectively viable legal configurations that are reliably war-averse and determinedly cooperation-centered. While any hint of interest in such patterns of expanding global integration (of what the Jesuit philosopher <a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/167">Pierre Teilhard de Chardin calls "planetization"</a>) could sound unacceptably utopian to "realists," an opposite interpretation would actually be more sensible.

Now, it is far more realistic to acknowledge that Trump's "every man for himself" ethos in world politics is endlessly degrading and sorely incapable of offering any serious legal reassurances.

Again and again - and at some point, irretrievably - <a href="http://oer2go.org/mods/en-boundless-static/www.boundless.com/definition/westphalian-sovereignty/index.html">"Westphalian"</a> world systemic failures could become tangibly dire and potentially irreversible. In the final analysis, therefore, it will not help to assert  "America First" or even to tinker tentatively at the ragged edges of our current world legal order. At that decisive turning point, stubbornly continuing to forge assorted <em>ad hoc</em> agreements between states or (as "hybridized" actors) between states and assorted surrogate or sub-state organizations could prove excruciatingly wrongheaded.

In the longer term, the only sort of legal realism that can make any sense for America and other leading states in world politics is a courageous posture that points thoughtfully toward some aptly "higher" awareness of global "oneness" and (however incrementally) toward still-greater world system interdependence.

In its fully optimized expression, such an indispensable awareness - a literal opposite of Trump's "America First" - would resemble what the ancients had called "Cosmopolis" or world city focused. For the moment, to be sure, <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/The_City_of_Man.html?id=ag4RTDv5DoQC">the insightful prophets of a more collaboratively legal world civilization must remain few and far between</a>,  but this consequential absence is not due to any intrinsic lack of need or to some witting forfeiture. Rather, it reflects a progressively imperiled species' retrograde unwillingness to take itself seriously -  that is, to recognize that the only sort of law-based loyalties that can rescue nation-states must embrace a redirected commitment (both individual and national) to an always connected humankind.

Going forward, the only reasonable mantra to guide the United States must soon become "World First, America First."

At its heart, this is not a bewilderingly complicated idea. To wit, it is hardly a medical or biological secret that the core factors and behaviors common to all human beings significantly outnumber those that differentiate one from the other. Unless the leaders of all major states on Planet Earth can finally understand that the survival of any one state must be contingent upon the survival of all, true national security will continue to elude every nation. This means even the purportedly "most powerful" states, including those that fitfully declare themselves "first."

The bottom line? The most immediate security task in the law-based state of nations must remain collaboratively self-centered, including all the traditional remedies of collective self-defense and collective security. Simultaneously, however, leaders of all pertinent countries, especially this one,  must learn to understand that our planet inevitably represents a recognizably organic whole, a fragile but variously intersecting legal "unity" that now exhibits steadily diminishing options for any successful war avoidance. (Because war and genocide are not mutually exclusive, either strategically or jurisprudentially, taking proper systemic steps toward war avoidance would plausibly also reduce the likelihood of egregious "crimes against humanity.")

To seize rapidly disappearing opportunities for longer-term survival, our national leaders must quickly learn to build upon the critical foundational insights of Francis Bacon, Galileo, and Isaac Newton, and upon the much more contemporary observation of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lewis-Mumford">Lewis Mumford</a>: "Civilization is the never-ending process of creating one world and one humanity." To be sure, these names will signify nothing to Trump, but perhaps there are still some capable advisors who can remember the incomparable dignities of serious study and established jurisprudential thought.

Whenever we speak of civilization we must also speak of law. Jurisprudentially, no particular national leadership has any special or primary obligations in this regard, nor could it reasonably afford to build any immediate security policies upon seemingly vague hopes. Nonetheless, the United States remains a key part of the community of nations, and Trump must do whatever he can to detach the palpably wavering state of nations from the time-dishonored state of nature.

Any such willful detachment should be expressed as part of a much wider vision for a durable and justice-centered world politics. Over the longer term, Washington will have to do its part to preserve the global system as a whole. "World First,  America First" must define our national policy trajectory. However silly or impractical this may sound at first, nothing could be more fanciful than continuing indefinitely on a gravely discredited course.

For the moment, there is no obvious need to detail any analytic or intellectual particulars.  There are, of course, bound to be many, but for now, at least, only a more evident and dedicated awareness of this basic civilizational and legal obligation should be expected. Interestingly, international law, which is an integral part of the legal system of all states in world politics, already assumes a reciprocally common general obligation to supply benefits to one another, and to avoid war at all costs. This core assumption of jurisprudential solidarity is known formally as a "peremptory" or <em>jus cogens</em> expectation, that is, one that is not even subject to question. It can be found already in Justinian, <em>Corpus Juris Civilis,</em> Hugo Grotius, <em>The Law of War and Peace </em>(1625) and Emmerich de Vattel, <em>The Law of Nations or Principles of Natural Law </em>(1758).

In <a href="http://www.24grammata.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/The_Plague__Albert_Camus-24grammata.com_.pdf"><em>The Plague,</em> Albert Camus</a> instructs: "At the beginning of the pestilence and when it ends, there's always a propensity for rhetoric....It is in the thick of a calamity that one gets hardened to the truth - in other words - to silence." As long as the states in world politics continue to operate in narrowly zero-sum terms of engagement, they will be unable to stop the next wave of terror attacks, genocides, and catastrophic wars.

Until now, the traditional legal expectations of <em>Realpolitik</em> may have appeared generally sensible. Accordingly, there are no good reasons for expressing any still-lingering or retrospective regrets. Nevertheless, from the overriding standpoint of improving our longer-term security prospects, the American president must substantially expand his visionary imagination to include more promising forms of legal and logical understanding. By ignoring the complex interrelatedness of all peoples and all states, "America First" represents the literal opposite of what is most urgently needed.

Now more than ever, affirming the extremity of "everyone for himself" in world politics is a prescription not for realism and global law-enforcement, but for recurrent conflict and far-reaching despair. Should this perilous prescription stay in place, the costs to us all could sometime be nuclear. At that hard-to-imagine but still plausible point, it will be too late to discover that "America First" had once been a captivating but ultimately lethal presidential slogan.

Going forward, international law must be rendered compatible with more expressly cosmopolitan visions of human society. Instead of such harshly retrograde notions as "American First," we now require an expanded awareness of civilizational interdependence or "oneness." All of this represents an astoundingly tall order, but any necessary legal revisions must somehow be based upon a prior re imagining of world legal arrangements.

Without such an imperative re-imagining, our Westphalian world legal order would have literally no chance of long-term survival. Therefore, isn't more creative and virtuous legal conceptualization at least worth a try? Recalling the great Irish poet W.B. Yeats, why should even "the best of us" deliberately choose to "live by candlelight?"

		<title>Accounting for Missing Migrants: Civil, Criminal, and Humanitarian Law Perspectives</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In The Hague last week at the Headquarters of the International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP), policymakers and stakeholders discussed a coherent international approach to accounting for people who have gone missing as a result of conflict and migration, including the conflict in Syria.

This is an issue that cuts both internationally and domestically across a swathe of civil, criminal, and humanitarian law.

Missing migrants may be victims of conflict or crime. They may have perished as a result of exposure to the elements or they may have fallen into the hands of human traffickers. When migrants go missing, governments have a legal obligation to investigate what may have happened to them, and to bring those responsible to justice, if, for example the disappearance is related to human trafficking or other aspects of crime. To fulfill this obligation, governments have to contend with a series of challenges such as locating and identifying deceased migrants, minors, and victims of arbitrary detention. Compare the documentation that accompanies a passenger plane, for example – passports, passenger manifests, online bookings, credit card details – with that which might accompany the people on an overcrowded inflatable dinghy struggling to cross the Mediterranean, and you get an idea of the challenge.

Likewise, in Syria, where the regime and opposition groups have employed arbitrary detention as a systematic policy, thousands have been “disappeared” through the willful destruction of documentation and evidence.

Globally, almost 31,000 migrants are reported to have died or to have gone missing since the beginning of 2014, of whom nearly 18,500 were lost on the Mediterranean route. Around 2,300 migrants died trying to cross the Mediterranean in 2018 and more than 490 have died in the first five months of this year. In 2018, almost 20,000 unaccompanied children applied for international protection in the European Union. European governments have reported that child migrants have disappeared in significant numbers after their arrival in Europe. The authorities believe some of these children may be victims of trafficking, slavery, sexual exploitation, and other criminal activities.

This issue has a direct bearing on the difficult relationship between the global South and the global North. Throughout Central and South America and across sub-Saharan Africa there are tens of thousands of families who do not know the fate of a relative who set off on one of the dangerous migration routes a week, a month, a year, or ten years ago. The breadth of this time-frame is itself an indication of the nature of the missing persons phenomenon. When a loved one dies, there is a time for grief and a time for recovery; when a loved one disappears there is an indefinite and irresolvable anguish. This must not be compounded by a perception of indifference on one side of the geopolitical fault line.

ICMP has been at the forefront of developing a new way of addressing the issue of the missing, particularly following conflict and disasters with the context of mass migration. This approach is supported by international efforts to foster peace and stability through good governance and transitional justice and rule-of-law strategies. ICMP’s data-management, DNA-led identification capacity, legislative and institutional initiatives, and civil society support are all premised on cooperation with responsible agencies and institutions in partner countries, ensuring that the process of accounting for the missing contributes to and supports good governance and democratic responsibility.

Participants at last week's meetings reviewed legal and institutional frameworks and discussed solutions, including the creation of centralized data systems capabilities. The obligation of states to account for non-citizens who go missing was a common theme, together with the resources that are available to help states fulfill this obligation.

At the conclusion of the 2nd meeting of the Joint Process to account for missing migrants in the Mediterranean, the representatives of Cyprus, Greece, and Malta issued a Joint Statement in which they stressed that "Locating missing migrants requires effective cooperation among States in a range of fields, including improving the utility of available data forensic and other technical aspects, and support to families of the missing. Efforts also have to be coordinated more efficiently with international and other organizations, and the assistance of intergovernmental specialized organizations has to be secured."

The Joint Process represents a modest but hard-headed beginning. The aims are realistic and the means to achieve those aims are available and I believe this initiative can be extended to more countries in the Mediterranean and also to other parts of the World, including Africa. The key premise is to make use of existing resources in a more efficient way – streamlining databases, for example, so that the information they contain can be exchanged securely and in a manner that protects individual privacy.

I believe the discussions that took place in The Hague can go beyond ad hoc measures and begin the process of developing a systemic approach based on the rule of law. By doing this, they will make a significant contribution to resolving one of the major issues facing the international legal community today.

<em>Sanji Monageng has been an ICMP Commissioner since 2017. ICMP is a treaty-based intergovernmental organization with Headquarters in The Hague, the Netherlands. Its mandate is to secure the cooperation of governments and others in locating and identifying missing persons from conflict, human rights abuses, disasters, organized crime, irregular migration and other causes and to assist them in doing so. It is the only international organization tasked exclusively to work on the issue of missing persons.</em>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Indian Judiciary faced an unprecedented problem when a former junior court assistant alleged sexual harassment by the current Chief Justice of India, Ranjan Gogoi. After the publication of the affidavit of the complainant in media, an urgent hearing was convened in the court of the CJI, comprising of the Chief Justice and Justices Arun Mishra and Sanjiv Khanna. The notice of registry stated that it was a matter of "great public importance touching upon the independence of the judiciary." By taking <em>suo moto</em> cognizance of the matter, the Supreme Court bench of Justices Arun Mishra, R F Nariman, and Deepak Gupta was constituted. Further, the CJI constituted an in-house committee consisting of Justices S A Bobde, N V Ramana, and Indira Banerjee to look into the matter. The complainant protested against this bench due to the close relations between the CJI and Justice Ramana. The latter then recused himself from the committee saying that he did not want any suspicion in the matter regarding the standards of judicial propriety and wisdom that the Supreme Court holds as an institution. The complainant accused the in-house committee of being biased and said that she would not participate in the proceedings of the committee any further as she was not even allowed to have her lawyer present. The committee proceeded <em>ex parte</em> and gave a cleared the CJI after careful "examination" of the allegations.

The committee and the Supreme Court have faced severe criticism as a result of its order and the handling of the allegations in general. The criticism was not based on the allegations but the fact that the accused himself, "very graciously" became a part of the bench that examined the matter which is a clear violation of the Principle of Natural Justice “Nemo judex in causa sua” which translates to “one should not be a judge in his own cause.” Further, the authority of the Supreme Court was questioned on several occasions, viz., when the complainant was not allowed a lawyer, when the 3 judge bench of the Supreme Court continued with the proceedings even though the complainant had accused the bench of being discriminatory against her and had therefore denied to be a part of any such proceedings. Further, even after a lot of recommendations from various legal jurists for an external committee to be constituted to look into the matter, none was created and the matter stayed within the Supreme Court.

Against the various criticisms that the Supreme Court and the CJI were subjected to, there is a need to look at the legal provisions available. Firstly, the CJI is not above the other judges of the Supreme Court but the ‘first among equals’ and the other judges are neither answerable to him nor under any authority of the CJI. Therefore, the allegation that an in-house bench of the Supreme Court violates principles of natural justice is invalid as the CJI was not a judge in his own case, nor did he exert any undue influence on the other judges. Second, as to the question of constituting an external committee to look into the matter, another question that arises is who would constitute this committee. In the case of any other judge of the Supreme Court, the CJI would have the power to constitute a committee, but in the present scenario, who had the authority to do so? Thirdly, when the complainant refused to take part in the proceedings of the Supreme Court, she lost the right to obtain the copy of the Final Report. Moreover, what the committee did was investigation and not adjudication. The committee had to gather evidence, take statements from witnesses, scrutinize all valid documents, and then prepare its report with all the findings. This does not require the complainant remaining present at all stages of the investigation, therefore, the question of <em>ex parte</em> does not exist. Moreover, it was a fact finding committee, and therefore, the assistance of an advocate is not required, since it is a mere narration and noting down of facts. The rule of <em>audi alteram partem</em> would apply when the Complainant would have been the accused and not the way it has been construed here, leading this allegation to be misplaced.

There may be further arguments that the committee to look into the matter could have consisted of retired Supreme Court judges, but we cannot fail to acknowledge the vacuum in law here. The law does not provide for any provision delegating authority to constitute such a committee in the case of sexual harassment allegations against the Chief Justice of India, as compared to other cases where it is the Chief Justice who has the power to constitute committees. The Final Report should also have been presented to a full bench of the Supreme Court with the CJI and the members of the investigating committee being recused from the same, but that did not take place, which could be well placed as a violation of procedure.

The whole scenario is being viewed from a myopic point of view which points towards all the allegations being proved, but we cannot simply ignore the the facts and legal ambiguities involved in the other side.

		<title>On “No-No Boy,” Penguin is Right</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When John Okada wrote “No-No Boy” in 1957, no one cared. An obscure novel published by a Japanese press, it told the story of a Japanese-American man who chose to resist the draft and go to prison, rather than fight for a country that had forced his family and friends into concentration camps. But today, it is widely considered the first important Japanese-American novel and a classic work of American literature.

Okada owes his surprising success primarily to the efforts of Shawn Wong, an English professor at the University of Washington. When Okada unexpectedly died of a heart attack in 1971, Wong got the Okada family’s permission to republish “No-No Boy.” And it was a hit. Initially, Wong self-published the novel and sold it to members of the Japanese-American community, who were hungry for stories of their wartime experience. In 1979, Wong transferred the copyright in the novel to the University of Washington Press, which published a new edition. To date, “No-No Boy” has sold more than 157,000 copies and is a staple in Asian-American Studies classes.

Until recently, the University of Washington Press was the only publisher of “No-No Boy.” But last month, Penguin Classics published a new edition of the novel, in honor of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. Penguin realized the novel is in the public domain, so anyone can publish it without asking permission or paying licensing fees.

Some people were upset by Penguin’s decision to publish Okada’s novel without the permission of the Okada family. Wong called it a “moral outrage.” And novelist Viet Thanh Nguyen accused Penguin of “appropriating” Okada’s book.

We disagree. Penguin didn’t “steal” or “appropriate” anything. It’s honoring Okada and confirming his place in the canon of American literature. Okada’s book is important because it powerfully expresses the experiences of Japanese-Americans at a critical moment in American history. Penguin is making it more available to more people at a lower price. We should applaud that decision, not condemn it.

Penguin’s ability to publish Okada’s book is a perfect example of why the public domain is so important and worth promoting. “No-No Boy” is in the public domain only because of an unusual accident. Essentially, Okada published his book in Japan, but not in the United States. Under the copyright law of the 1950s, that made it public domain. The happy result of Okada’s mistake is that anyone can publish his book, without asking permission.

The public domain isn’t a “quirk” or a “loophole.” It’s the reason we created copyright in the first place. The purpose of copyright is to encourage people to create works of authorship. Copyright gives authors certain exclusive rights to use the works of authorship they create for a limited period of time. But eventually, copyright ends and works enter the public domain.

The copyright in “No-No Boy” expired unusually quickly, in comparison to other works. But it nicely illustrates how copyright can impose costs, without generating benefits. Among other things, Okada wrote “No-No Boy” because he wanted to make a political point. Surely, he would be delighted by its unexpected success and large readership.

The public domain will help introduce Okada’s novel to even more people. Because “No-No Boy” is in the public domain, anyone can publish or distribute it in any way they like. That is a great thing for everyone. Not only can Penguin Books publish a new edition of Okada’s classic novel, but also others can do the same, from hobbyists to professionals. Websites like Project Gutenberg can even distribute free electronic editions. Everyone can read, live, mark, and breathe the text as they see fit.

We can and should have free PDFs of Okada’s novel on the Internet, as well as websites with the full text and commentary. We should have passages from the book presented with links to videos of the concentration camps and audiobooks by multiple readers. We should encourage a new generation of Americans to fully understand the story Okada was trying to tell us.

Penguin Books was right, legally and morally, to publish a new version of “No-No Boy.” These efforts should be applauded, not condemned. We should give Okada’s literary classic the respect it deserves as a milestone of American culture, and the public domain only helps. The real tragedy is that so many other classic works still languish under copyright protection. Ideally, the copyright term would be much shorter than it is today, and the public domain could work its magic on public access far more quickly.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>I. American Border Concentration Camps and the Family Separation Policy as a Crime Against Humanity</strong>

As noted by Ben Ferencz, the last surviving Nuremberg Prosecutor, the intentional and unnecessary suffering under the family separation policy can easily be viewed as a crime against humanity under <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/resourcelibrary/official-journal/rome-statute.aspx#article7">Article 7(1)(k)</a> of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court:
<blockquote>For the purpose of this Statute, "crime against humanity" means any of the following acts when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack:...

(k) Other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health.</blockquote>
As we learn more everyday about the depraved conditions in which these persons and children are being held under the family separation policy, we begin to appreciate the systemic unnecessary suffering at the very heart of that policy. So we have the crime against humanity.

Of course the United States is not a signatory to the Rome Statute but to the extent that expression of an international crime would codify customary international law (hard to imagine otherwise) it would be opposable to the United States.

But whether it is opposable to the United States or not, can we find routes in US domestic law to vindicate this international criminal law rule in the current state of US domestic law in order to end the abomination of these concentration camps and put the perpetrators behind bars? This note suggests yes and how.

In suggesting this approach, we look at the facilities, of course, but more broadly at all the actors that come together to put this system of concentration camps in place.

For example, just on the technology front, well worth a read these days is Edwin Black’s IBM and the Holocaust (2001) which describes the Nazis early exploitation of the new thing then: card punch and sorting technology to make the selection of Jews and others for detention. This book came to mind when I saw the report on the ten city ICE effort to deport families originally slated to start June 23. One question is always where do the authorities get the lists?

No doubt today there are massive databases that are keyed to do a selection to provide the lists. Then the persons are rounded up and detained. These database creation and selection service tools are the same service IBM card punch and sorting technology provided to Germany starting in 1933 - long before the Wannsee Conference and the Final Solution. These technologies were used in Germany and occupied Europe (but fortunately found some resistance in at least the French statistical office) with ruthless efficiency to create the lists for deportation and ultimately death. So let us think broadly of who to go after, not just an individual guard in a private concentration camp.

Let us look broadly for the perpetrators of this abomination.

<strong>II. State and Federal Criminal Law</strong>

A. State law

Under state law, with sufficient evidence of these events at their facilities, a state or local prosecutor might indict and charge the concentration camp guards managers and/ or owners for, at a minimum:
<blockquote>1. Murder
2. Manslaughter
3. Felony child abuse
4. Criminal Negligence
5. Conspiracy to Commit 1,2 or 3.
6. Aiding and abetting 1, 2 and 3.</blockquote>
If there were federal officials involved, they would no doubt, once indicted, seek removal of the case from state court to federal court under the federal officer removal act or a habeas action and hope that the federal court would grant qualified immunity and dismiss the case under some <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/135/1/">In Re Neagle</a> type argument or other federal doctrine.

Just as significantly under state law, the providers of the technology to make the lists (analogizing from what IBM did and National Statistical Office employees did to a greater or lesser degree in Occupied Europe) could be charged with conspiracy or aiding and abetting 1, 2 and 3.

B. Federal law

Federal murder and manslaughter and the <a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb/capta.pdf">Federal Child Abuse Prevention Act</a>, federal criminal negligence should be researched. Conspiracy and aiding and abetting statutes should also be looked into.

Federal prosecutions will, of course, run into the problem we have seen in the torture cases: convincing US attorneys to prosecute anyone (let alone high-level civilians or military) for doing illegal things at the bidding of a President. But that problem is a problem of will not law.

The point is not the result but imagining what could be done.

<strong>III. Defenses</strong>

If such a case was to go to trial one can expect the panoply of criminal defenses that will be asserted as to mens réa or actus reus which an excellent criminal defense attorney would bring. Each set of facts will certainly be particular but it may be possible to discern a common plan or strategy in all this (a wheel and spoke conspiracy so to speak). That pattern might lead to implication of the higher ups and the broader group of perpetrators including the providers of services to the effort in terms of technology or otherwise. The point here is not to focus on the defenses, but to begin to imagine the criminal prosecution and to note the concurrent jurisdiction of state and federal courts.

<strong>IV. Success</strong>

With successful prosecution of individuals and/or entities will come pressure to reform these facilities and the policy. For the private entities involved, liability would open them to losing their charter and, if so listed, they could be delisted from stock exchanges. One can imagine the forms of “civil death” that could be imposed on these actors so willing to participate in this evil.

Maybe we could then move up the sordid chain and prosecute some of the leaders too.

We should keep in mind the artful prosecutor would go through the entirety of the state or federal criminal code and maybe come up with even more criminal charges than indicated here. All it takes is the will.

Just thinking out-loud and remembering the 250 years of state family separation policy of non-citizens that we more usually call slavery. Nothing new under the sun.

Companies including General Motors, Tesla, Uber, and Google are some of the major automakers and researchers who have already begun to implement this revolutionary technology. But for all the confidence surrounding self-driving cars, there’s an equal amount of skepticism and concern. Various regulations and barriers are hampering the growth because, as with anything that becomes digitized, the threat to cybersecurity increases rapidly.

Currently, there are no legally operating, fully-autonomous vehicles in the U.S. However, there are partially-autonomous cars and trucks with varying amounts of self-automation. The digitalization of the automotive industry seems to be in the most advanced stage and with growth increases the necessity to regulate and address the legal implications of their use.

In 2018, in the U.S., legislation was introduced at the <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/1fb8fa36-331b-4f0b-907a-6dededda4d31/37F56742A509A877F54FDF7389DFDAA7.s.-1885-av-start-act.pdf">federal level</a> to create a baseline for the testing and operation of highly automated vehicles. Although the statutes in Title 49, Subtitle VI of the US Code and the regulations in Title 49, Subtitle B, Chapter V of the Code of Federal Regulations fill entire pages with motor vehicle standards, many of them were drafted with human drivers in mind.

Today, more than 25 states have enacted legislation related to autonomous vehicles and their systems. In order to encourage technology and motor vehicle companies to create testing programs, some state governments have enacted permissive regulation for autonomous motor vehicles. Consequently, most states’ standards were drafted with human drivers in mind, but the specifics of how many of the vehicle’s tasks must actually be undertaken by the driver and which can be taken by the vehicle are not clear<em>. </em>These laws simply require the presence of a licensed driver who can be able to take control of the car in case of an emergency.

Florida, a leader in welcoming self-driving technology, declared the legislative intent to undertake any necessary steps to support the safe development, testing and operation of motor vehicles with autonomous technology on public roads of the state. The statute emboldens manufacturers that are developing autonomous cars to test their products all over the Sunshine State.  In accordance with state law, auto manufacturers’ liability will be limited if an accident or injury occurs related to an autonomously operating vehicle when the outfitted car is equipped with aftermarket parts, making the party that installed the autonomous technology liable instead. Taking autonomous cars to a new level and out of the legal gray zone, the laws enacted in Florida, California, and Nevada even include stipulations that anticipate autonomous vehicles driving without human drivers in them.

When trying to elucidate the new legislation regarding self-driving cars, there are many questions that must be answered. Most pressing include: <strong>Who is liable for the accident?</strong> What percentage are they responsible for? Who must provide compensation? The differences between semi and fully-autonomous vehicles lead to further questions concerning liability if an accident and injury occur.

One of the most important aspects to understand is the difference between semi-autonomous vehicles and completely autonomous vehicles. In a semi-autonomous vehicle, the human driver is always expected to share responsibility for any incident that occurs, while in fully-autonomous vehicles the self-driving software is in control and the human is considered an emergency backup at the wheel. <strong>Who is liable when a person is injured by one of these vehicles?</strong> In cases that involve self-driving vehicles, liability could rest with many parties, such as the driver, the vehicle’s manufacturer, the self-driving software developer, or the suppliers of individual car parts. In these cases, investigators will have new types of information available to determine that one of the aforementioned entities is responsible, such as data from the vehicle including video, GPS coordinates, sensor readings, and other new technology.

Accidents occurred due to unforeseen events, like deer running into the road or a weather event, will be covered by liability laws as they have been so far. Plenty of laws come from the rulings issued by the Supreme Court in cases that have already occurred.

The first recorded case of a pedestrian fatality involving Uber’s self-driving car in Tempe, Arizona, demonstrated that these vehicles can be involved in accidents just like human-driven vehicles can be, shattering some perceptions of safety regarding the software controlling this vehicle. The vehicle involved in the accident, a Volvo XC90 sport utility vehicle, was traveling at 40mph at the time of the accident and did not appear to have slowed down or detected the woman even though she was visible in front of the car prior the impact.  If the victim’s family were to pursue a civil case, attorneys could potentially make a range of negligence claims. Anyone from the driver to Uber to Volvo to the manufacturer of the parts could potentially have been held liable if litigation ensued from the Tempe accidents. Early this year, the prosecutors have ruled that ride-hailing Uber will not criminally be charged for the fatal self-driving crash. However, the <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/Pages/default.aspx">National Transportation Safety Board</a> and the <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a> are still investigating. The ‘safety’ driver who was behind the wheel but who appears not to have operated the vehicle could face criminal charges. If there had been passengers in the Uber car that were injured in the accident, they would have been entitled to file personal injury claims against the responsible driver.

Nine months after the tragic crash, Uber officially resumed testing its self-driving cars on public roads. However, questions about liability in the event of a death involving self-driving cars are still completely up in the air.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[No current or former President of the United States has faced criminal charges after leaving office. Two Presidents, Richard Nixon and William Clinton, have come close and one Vice-President, Spiro Agnew, plead nolo contendere to charges on the day he left office. With ten ongoing federal and eight ongoing state <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/05/13/us/politics/trump-investigations.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">criminal investigations</a> into Donald Trump, his campaign, or businesses, it is possible, even likely, that he will be the first former President facing criminal prosecution. The Department of Justice has a decades-old prohibition against indicting a sitting President, so any prosecution would occur after Donald Trump leaves office.

So what criminal acts have previous presidents allegedly or actually engaged in—and what can this tell us about what may happen to Trump?

Although it is likely that Richard Nixon had no prior knowledge of the burglary and attempted bugging of the Democratic National Committee offices located in the Watergate complex, he became immersed in the ensuing cover up and likely obstructed justice in the process. In February of 1974 the House of Representatives<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/93rd-congress/house-resolution/803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> authorized the Judiciary Committee</a> to begin investigating if sufficient grounds existed for impeaching President Nixon. On August 9th he became the first President to <a href="https://www.archives.gov/historical-docs/todays-doc/?dod-date=809" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">resign</a> from office. It was widely believed that upon leaving office Richard Nixon could be prosecuted for obstruction of justice for his role in the Watergate cover up.

Twenty-four years later, Bill Clinton was impeached for obstructing justice, lying under oath, and coaching a witness during the sexual harassment lawsuit filed by Paula Jones. In <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/520/681/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clinton v. Jones</a>, the Supreme Court held that a President can be held civilly liable for actions committed before they became president, so it is not hard to imagine that they would also be criminally liable. Two months after his acquittal by the Senate, Clinton was cited for contempt of court for lying during the proceedings and fined $90,000. In his final days in office, Clinton did agree to a five year suspension of his Arkansas law license and to pay a $25,000 fine for lying during a deposition for the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/20/opinion/mr-clinton-s-last-deal.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paula Jones investigation</a> in exchange for a promise that no criminal charges would be filed against him.

The only high executive branch official to actually have been convicted of a crime after assuming office is Vice President Spiro Agnew, who plead guilty to one count of tax evasion. The charge stemmed from Agnew’s involvement in a construction kickback scheme during his governorship of Maryland, but the payments continued while he was Vice President. Agnew, like Presidents Nixon and Trump, asserted that he could not be charged with a criminal offence while in office. However, after negotiations, Vice President Agnew plead guilty in exchange for a fine and probation. His guilty plea thus established that an executive officer may be held criminally responsible for acts committed during office, but—since Agnew resigned the same day he plead guilty—<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/11/archives/2-legal-procedures-resolved-the-case-legal-impact-of-plea-mystical.html?searchResultPosition=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">left open the constitutional issue</a> of whether a sitting executive could be charged while still in office.

The Nixon, Clinton, and Agnew scandals have established that a president can be held criminally liable for actions committed either before or during their term in office. However, this is only the start of the inquiry. The issues raised by such a prosecution will depend on whether the prosecution is conducted by state or federal prosecutors. If the prosecution is conducted under federal law, the outcome turns on the pardon power of the president and the applicability of any statute of limitations. If the prosecution is conducted under state law then the issue is the strain on federalism.

History suggests there are three pardon possibilities: Donald Trump pardons himself, he pardons all co-conspirators thereby removing all incentive for them to cooperate, or he resigns and President Mike Pence pardons him. The second scenario is the most likely because it is the least susceptible to challenge and does not rely on anyone other than President Trump himself.

We do not know if a President can pardon themselves because none of them have tried. Current <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/04/here-is-what-9-experts-say-about-whether-president-trump-can-pardon-himself.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">legal opinions are divided</a> on the issue, but forty years ago President Nixon was told by members of the Department of Justice that he could not pardon himself. Conversely, President Trump could resign and have Mike Pence pardon him upon assuming office, or Trump could bank on a Democratic successor pardoning him—an unlikely but not impossible scenario. Gerald Ford <a href="https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/speeches/740061.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pardoned</a> Richard Nixon shortly after assuming office in order to help the nation move beyond the Watergate scandal. However, President Trump seems very unlikely to resign his office.

A more likely scenario is that President Trump will use his <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Article II</a> power to pardon anyone who is connected with the investigation, thereby removing any leverage federal prosecutors have to flip them against him. Bill Clinton was accused by many of doing exactly this when he issued 140 pardons on his final day in office. But in fact, none of the pardons issued had any direct link to Bill Clinton, although a few were tied to his brother-in-law Tony Rodham. Thus, although the presidential pardon power has been questioned it has never been challenged when used to cover up potential presidential crimes. A mass pardon by President Trump would be a constitutionally, if not politically, acceptable way of handling the federal investigations. However, none of these scenarios would prevent a state from prosecuting Donald Trump once he left office.

The statute of limitations may bar prosecution for any offences that occurred before or early in President Trump’s term of office—this issue becomes more important if he wins a second term in office. A 2000 Justice Department <a href="https://www.justice.gov/olc/opinion/sitting-president%E2%80%99s-amenability-indictment-and-criminal-prosecution" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">memorandum</a> contemplated that the prohibition on indicting a sitting president would make it possible that the statute of limitations would prevent prosecution after the person left office. The memorandum reasoned that the risk was justified both to prevent a constitutional crisis that would accompany the indictment of a sitting president and because if the alleged crime was sufficiently severe, then impeachment would likely remove the person from office thus clearing the way for prosecution. The statute of limitations for obstruction of justice and the other crimes that have been alleged against President Trump are five years. Consequently, even if President Trump loses the 2020 election, the statute of limitations will likely have run unless charges are brought shortly after he leaves office.

In contrast, state district attorneys have no set policies against indicting a sitting president and could therefore indict at any time before the statute of limitations runs in their jurisdiction. Additionally, any federal pardon would not apply to state criminal liability. Of course, President Trump could request a delay in the trial until after he leaves office, but this would not stop the prosecution itself. If former President Trump is prosecuted under state laws the primary concern is one of federalism; the balance of power between the state and national governments.

The prosecution of a former president by a state would open the door for the future prosecution of other presidents by their opponents. Donald Trump’s situation is unique because of the wide ranging nature of his potential criminal liability, which extends from his business activities to his campaign, inauguration committee, and obstruction of justice during his presidency. Although Trump may be an unusual former president the normalization of prosecution of ex-executives would enable the states to threaten Presidents whom they disagree with so long as there is some activity that can be criminally investigated.

Ever since <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/17/316/#tab-opinion-1918127" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">McColluch v. Maryland</a>, the Supreme Court has worried about the ability of the states to directly oppose the legitimate functions of the federal government. Of course, the key difference is that if Donald Trump did commit felonies then his actions were obviously not legitimate governmental functions. Despite the danger of states prosecuting ex-presidents whom they do not like, this is the lesser evil as it can of course easily be avoided by presidents simply not engaging in criminal activities. The alternative—not prosecuting felonious former presidents—would place the president above the law and make the office closer to a king than the executive of a republic. It is a cornerstone of our criminal justice system that everyone is subject to the law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[June 26 is a day designated by the United Nations as International Day in support of victims of torture. The General Assembly <a href="https://undocs.org/A/RES/52/149">resolution</a> creating the date imagined this as a day stakeholders - member states and their citizens - would unite in support of those that have endured torture and cruelty and recommit to ending its scourge. As international legal experts on this matter, we are using this opportunity to remind member states of their commitments, specifically that victims have meaningful access to seek judicial redress. Access to justice is the key feature of the right to redress and is a critical part of the global fight against impunity to which we have all committed ourselves.

<a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/cat.aspx">Article 14</a>, of the CAT enumerates that signatories must provide in their “legal system that the victim of an act of torture obtains redress and has an enforceable right to fair and adequate compensation, including the means for as full rehabilitation as possible.” Even for countries that have a strong record against torture and cruelty and enacted domestic protections against their use, this requirement to open up their legal systems to victims, has proved more challenging. Our work has been undertaken in the context of these domestic challenges, to support the legal right to redress, compensation and rehabilitation for victims.

As a former International Chief Prosecutor and a Registrar before international courts, charged with seeking justice for victims of heinous human rights abuses, we have personally witnessed the importance of and healing effect that victims derive both from judicial redress and an opportunity for adequate compensation. The impact of meaningful judicial redress on both victims and their societies’ healing and reconciliation is profound. It also acts as a powerful deterrent for future human rights abuses.

The Rendition, Detention and Interrogation (RDI) program employed by the U.S. post 9-11, has seen scant judicial redress afforded to victims. Although the program was run by the U.S., many European countries, including the U.K., enrolled as junior partners. All governments involved in this shameful program have shied away from transparency and accountability, including providing victims with judicial redress options, but none has been able to completely bury their moral and legal responsibilities.

In the U.K. the government spent eight years trying to shirk responsibility for redress for its role in the rendition and torture of Libyans, Abdul-Hakim Belhaj and his wife Fatima Boudchar. Belhaj and Boudchar were on their way to the U.K. to seek asylum, and with the knowledge and assistance of MI6, they were detained and tortured in Thailand by the CIA. This torture included painful stress positions, drugs, and vicious beatings, despite Boudchar being several months pregnant. Finally, last year, after the case had made it to the Supreme Court and 11 million pounds had been spent avoiding this outcome, the U.K. Prime Minister offered the couple an unprecedented public apology.

It is not known what the U.S. has spent trying to avoid similar suits because so far, American courts have not proven meaningfully accessible to victims of post-9/11 U.S. counterterrorism abuses. The “state secrets” privilege has meant courts have routinely rejected attempts by victims to bring lawsuits against the government. The 2018 Supreme Court decision, <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/ziglar-v-turkmen/">Ziglar v. Abbasi</a>, has further rendered the federal courts seemingly powerless to act. As the Convention lays out, victims are entitled to and deserve their day in court--to have the cases judged on the merits, not dismissed at the pleadings stage--just as the victims we heard from did.

Notwithstanding some judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, victims of the RDI program have not yet been able to obtain judicial redress and the recent International Criminal Court <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2019/06/afghanistan-war-crimes-victims-appeal-to-icc/">decision</a> to reject the Chief Prosecutor’s request to investigate possible war crimes connected to the conflict in Afghanistan, means that options for international justice have now dwindled. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Report on the CIA RDI program lists at least 119 detainees whose treatment was acknowledged to have risen to the level of torture and cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment. In addition, others were subject to cruel and unlawful treatment by the Department of Defense or transferred to foreign governments. All these detainees and their families are owed their chance at redress, apology and compensation, by the U.S. and their many enablers.

This year will mark thirty-five years since the text of the Convention was adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations. Since this time, 164 members states have signed and ratified the treaty - the U.K. in 1987 and the U.S. in 1994. They have both developed strong traditions of global support to victims of torture, but these have not extended to victims of the RDI program. On this day to remember victims of torture, we hope that they both will acknowledge their obligation to torture victims and remove the barriers which prevent individuals from having a right to seek meaningful judicial redress, compensation and rehabilitation in their courts.

		<title>Hong Kong Ruling Strengthens Rights Protection on Same-Sex Relations</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Nearly 120 years after Hong Kong made sodomy punishable by a possible life sentence, a recent court ruling marks a further step toward completely decriminalizing same-sex relations.

In 2007, Hong Kong scrapped its British-era sodomy law. But, for over a decade, several remaining provisions in its Crime Ordinance continued to single out male same-sex relations, either through disproportionate sentencing or by specifically criminalizing sexual acts between men. In 2017, an activist, Yeung Chu Wing, brought a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of seven discriminatory provisions.

On May 30, the Hong Kong High Court <a href="https://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/public/pdf/2019/HCAL_753_2017e.pdf">struck down</a> the four offenses that applied specifically to sexual relations between men and eliminated the discriminatory aspects of three other provisions. With this ruling, the court consolidated the decriminalization process by eliminating residual discriminatory provisions in the criminal code.

The efforts form a part of the global trend toward abolishing discriminatory colonial-era laws that criminalize same-sex relations. In 2018, courts in <a href="https://www.sci.gov.in/supremecourt/2016/14961/14961_2016_Judgement_06-Sep-2018.pdf">India</a> and <a href="http://webopac.ttlawcourts.org/LibraryJud/Judgments/HC/rampersad/2017/cv_17_00720DD12apr2018.pdf">Trinidad and Tobago</a> both ruled that laws that criminalized same-sex relations are unconstitutional. This year, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/06/11/botswana-high-court-strikes-down-sodomy-laws">Botswana</a> decriminalized same-sex conduct, but there was a setback in Kenya, where the court upheld similar discriminatory laws.

Hong Kong’s justice secretary did not contest the four scrapped provisions. But she asked the High Court to retain the remaining three provisions by making them non-discriminatory.

The four uncontested provisions criminalized “procuring others” to engage in anal intercourse, “gross indecency” with or by a boy under the age of 16, “gross indecency” between men otherwise in private, as well as “procuring gross indecency” between men. All four were struck down as unconstitutional by the High Court. By doing so, the court was mindful that sexual offenses against minors are covered by other provisions that are gender-neutral and non-discriminatory.

The court explained in detail why the four provisions were unconstitutional. Judge Thomas Au eloquently grounded his analysis in the fundamental principle of equality, invoking article 25 of the Hong Kong Basic Law and article 22 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights. He reasoned that these four provisions punished sexual intercourse between men, while there are no comparable offenses between women or between a man and a woman. The court held that the differential treatment targeting sex between men is discriminatory in nature and violates equal protections.

The remaining three provisions were challenged because they imposed either differential sentencing or age of consent provisions that disproportionately punished sexual relations between men.

For example, one of the provisions punished “gross indecency with the mentally incapacitated” only when it is between men. In dealing with this provision, the court held that all terms “a man” must be read as “a person” for purposes of this provision. Through such remedial interpretation techniques, the court rendered the three provisions gender-neutral or equalized the age of consent, making them compliant with the constitution.

Hong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal struck down the city’s sodomy law in the 2007 case Secretary for Justice v. Yau Yuk Lung, reasoning that the law only criminalized sexual intercourse between men and was therefore unconstitutional. Following the same principle in applying the doctrine of non-discrimination, this current ruling extends equal protection by scrapping or by judicially interpreting the remaining discriminatory provisions in the Crime Ordinance — thus completing the decriminalization process in Hong Kong.

The criminalization of same-sex relations contradicts the fundamental principles of equality and nondiscrimination under international law. Repealing laws that punish consensual same-sex relations from statute books is an essential step toward eliminating discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation.

The recent moves toward decriminalization demonstrate the significant role that the judiciary can play in safeguarding the rights of minorities, especially in communities with repressive and unjust laws. Despite residing in their different jurisdictions with different societal and cultural norms, a growing number of courts are in agreement that human dignity, autonomy, and equality must be afforded to all.

		<title>The Feasibility of &#039;Rotating&#039; Supreme Court Justices</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On June 27, 2019 during the second Democratic Primary Debate, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders proposed <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/450800-bernie-sanders-says-he-would-move-to-rotate-supreme-court-justices-if">rotating United States Supreme Court Justices</a> with judges from lower federal courts.  This solution was offered in response to the “court packing” occurring under President Trump’s administration, leading to the growing conservatism of the Court.  Additionally, the nomination and appointment of progressively younger Justices in recent years promises to only lengthen their tenure.

While Senator Sanders did not specify details of his proposal during the debate or subsequently on his <span>official campaign <a href="https://berniesanders.com/issues/">website</a>, he asserted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxUOEXiQ6eM">“that constitutionally we have the power to rotate Judges to other courts....”</a>. Sanders’ primary objective seems to be an effort to balance the Supreme Court’s current conservative majority to ensure the protection of women’s reproductive rights.</span>

<em>It is an interesting proposal, but is it viable</em>? An evaluation of the feasibility of his claim based on current constitutional interpretation lends some plausibility to Congress’s ability to restructure the U.S. Supreme Court, but perhaps not in the way Senator Sanders intended.

Under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii">Article III</a> of the U.S. Constitution, life appointments of Justices to the U.S. Supreme Court is not specifically granted, nor is there anything that prevents Justices from being rotated to lower courts. Instead, the language of Article III §1 merely clarifies that “[t]he judges both of the supreme and inferior courts, shall hold office during good behavior, ...”

Pursuant to current interpretations of this language, Justices can be removed in one of three ways: (1) impeachment by Congress, (2) voluntary retirement, or (3) death. Lifetime appointments of U.S. Supreme Court Justices are also supported by the Constitutional Framers’ failure to designate a term limit or maximum age. However, a textualist reading of the US Constitution could allow for alternate tenure lengths subject to adequate restructuring of the Supreme Court by Congress.

Congress’ role in setting the structure of the Supreme Court is reflected in changes over time of the Court from its original foundations. Under the Judiciary Act of 1789, Supreme Court Justices were commonly authorized to take on roles in lower courts, effectively called “<a href="https://www.fjc.gov/history/timeline/circuit-riding">riding circuit</a>.” Thus, Supreme Court Justices were assigned to hear cases on the lower circuit courts alongside a designated district court judge. Outcries over the travel requirement eventually led to the displacement of Supreme Court Justices in these roles, ceding to circuit court judges via the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/41st-congress/session-1/c41s1ch22.pdf">Judiciary Act of 1869</a>, though the practice was not fully abolished until 1911.

Congress’ passage of the Judiciary Acts is indicative of its power to control the structure of federal courts. This includes prospective, future changes to the Supreme Court. Thus, the movement of Supreme Court Justices to lower courts would be possible provided legislative authorization from Congress.

Passage of such sweeping changes to longstanding Supreme Court practices faces significant political hurdles depending on the composition of Congress following the upcoming 2020 election. However, a greater barrier lies in the second component of Senator Sanders’s proposal: exchanging lower court judges for Supreme Court Justices. Two significant constitutional challenges arise that would prevent the swift replacement.

First, a Justice could not likely be “rotated out” of the Supreme Court without a formal impeachment proceeding or voluntary withdrawal. Either would be necessary to make room for a new Justice, unless the number of Justices, currently capped at nine per the Judiciary Act of 1869, is also up for consideration. Impeachment of a Supreme Court Justice requires a majority vote of the House and two-thirds majority of the Senate via Art. II §4 of the Constitution. This is unlikely to occur absent egregious behavior.

Second, a new Justice “rotated in” would need to be properly nominated and appointed. Under the Appointment and Removal Power designated in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii#section4">Article II</a>, §2 of the Constitution, the executive branch has the sole responsibility for nominating Judges to the Supreme Court. While Congress can certainly remove a Justice via the impeachment process without Presidential approval, it has no designated power to unilaterally place Judges on the Supreme Court without first receiving this nomination from the President. Any attempt by Congress to wield this sort of authority would constitute a separation of powers violation. Congress must instead rely on traditional nomination and hearing processes for an appointment of a Supreme Court Justice to be considered constitutionally valid.

Therefore, Congress would remain bound to appoint Justices via the standard, time-consuming nomination process. Even if Justices were allowed to be moved to lower courts under a new Judiciary Act, the lower court Judges must still be nominated and appointed if they hope to serve on the Supreme Court.

Given the aforementioned constitutional barriers, Senator Sanders’ proposal to rotate Supreme Court Justices with lower court Judges lacks practicality for changing the current make-up of the Court. While it is possible to assign Supreme Court Justices to lower courts temporarily, ‘rotating’ them with lower court judges is not without initiating the impeachment process and the subsequent nomination and appointment of a new Justice.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Glyphosate, a non-selective herbicide, is found in many weed killing products and sold every day around the world. Roundup, the most popular herbicide in the United States, contains glyphosate and is purchased by consumers to use on their residential properties, gardens, public parks, sports fields, as well as other outdoor areas.

Recently, Roundup has been looked at more closely as consumers are coming forward with cancer diagnoses they attribute to long-term Roundup use. Since the <a href="https://www.iarc.fr/featured-news/media-centre-iarc-news-glyphosate/">potential dangers associated with glyphosate</a> were first announced in 2015, Roundup's manufacturer has been embroiled in litigation <a href="https://www.consumersafety.org/legal/roundup-lawsuit/">with plaintiffs claiming they developed cancer</a> from the use of the product.

While there have been reports of B-cell lymphoma, leukemia, and other blood-related cancers, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma is the most reported cancer consumers are attributing to consistent Roundup use. In fact, all three of the major lawsuits that Bayer has faced as a result of Roundup have involved the development of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma by various consumers who have used the product for years.

Alva and Alberta Pilliod, <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2019/05/jury-awards-couple-with-cancer-2-billion-against-monsanto/">the most recent winners</a> in the courtroom battles against Roundup’s current manufacturer, Bayer, are a California couple who used the weed killer on their residence regularly without any form of protective gear. Both diagnosed with terminal non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, they were awarded the largest amount out of all three trials Bayer has faced on this at more than $2 billion in damages. Legal experts assume this will be reduced, but the awarded amount sent a message to both the defendant and plaintiffs awaiting their day in court.

According to the <a href="https://usrtk.org/monsanto-roundup-trial-tacker/monsanto-ordered-to-pay-2-billion-to-cancer-victims/">U.S. Right to Know report</a>, Monsanto, the previous Roundup manufacturer now owned by Bayer, “engaged in conduct with malice, oppression or fraud committed by one or more officers, directors or managing agents of Monsanto,” resulting in the $2 billion loss. Bayer has announced its plans to appeal this verdict, along with all other losing decisions they face in court on this matter.

<a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2019/03/jury-awards-80-million-in-roundup-cancer-case/">The predecessing case of Edwin Hardeman</a> was also deemed a loss for Bayer when the jury awarded the California resident $80 million in damages in the very first federal case against Bayer for Roundup. Hardeman was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and blamed Roundup for his cancer development. After several days of deliberation, the jury ruled in favor of the plaintiff attributing Roundup to his cancer diagnosis after years of consistent use of the product to treat poison oak, overgrowth, and weeds on his residence.

Hardeman’s case, as well as that of the Pilliod couple, were both deemed “bellwether trials” by the presiding judge, Vincent Chhabria. <a href="https://www.consumersafety.org/resources/multidistrict-litigation/">Bellwether trials</a> are test trials used as an example for lawyers with similar cases to decide whether or not they should proceed, and both presented interesting findings.

The Hardeman case took a deep dive into the science behind Roundup and its chemical makeup. The jury was presented with a few studies that not only compared the effects of Roundup on the cells of other living creatures but also how the specific chemical concoction affects cells.

The first study brought to the jury showed the <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/tx015543g">effects of Roundup on sea urchin cells</a>. According to the study, Roundup was able to disturb normal cell divisions in sea urchins. This led to the belief that the same thing could happen to the cell division as well as cell cycles of humans, which can cause cancer.

“The research around glyphosate and cell cycle disruption is concerning,” medical writer, Dr. Katy Moncivais, PhD, tells us. “Every human really has to hope that the carcinogenic effects observed in a lab would require high dose, long-term exposure in the real world.”

The next couple of studies that were discussed in Hardeman’s trial showed the negative effect of Roundup on human embryonic, placental, and umbilical cells. One of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19105591">the studies states</a> that the Roundup formulations killed all of the cells within 24 hours and caused multiple cell malfunctions, each individually capable of inducing cell death. It was also revealed through these studies that Roundup’s chemical makeup including glyphosate was more toxic <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16263381">than glyphosate alone</a>.

As a result of these two cases, Judge Chhabria initiated a formal order of mediation. This brings a confidential, unbiased opinion into the legal proceedings to hopefully help the plaintiffs and defendant come to a settlement. In May 2019, Judge Chhabria <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/05/22/725844827/kenneth-feinberg-to-mediate-roundup-settlement-talks-between-bayer-and-plaintiff">appointed attorney Kenneth Feinberg</a> into the position to meet with future plaintiffs and the defendant to help negotiate.

<a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2018/08/jury-orders-monsanto-to-pay-289-2-million-in-cancer-liability-case/">The first case brought against Bayer</a> for its Roundup product was that of Dewayne Johnson. The California school groundskeeper used Roundup on a regular basis for his job and, on a few of these occasions, the product was accidentally spilled on him. Johnson was diagnosed with terminal non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and his case was presented early due to the severity of his illness.

The San Franciscan jury unanimously ruled that the manufacturer failed to warn consumers of the potentially harmful ingredients in their product, awarding Johnson $289 million in November 2018. After this win for the plaintiff, thousands of consumers began to file against Bayer, with lawsuit numbers climbing up past 13,000.

Shortly after this ruling, Johnson’s jury award was reduced to $78.5 million, because it was decided that the compensatory and punitive damages should match 1:1 at $39.25 million each. Johnson plans to appeal this reduction and Bayer <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bayer-glyphosate-lawsuit/bayer-asks-california-appeals-court-to-throw-out-78-million-roundup-verdict-idUSKCN1S02DV">plans to appeal this verdict</a> completely.

Following this case, it was brought to the public's attention that Monsanto had possibly once had their research on glyphosate <a href="https://www.ehn.org/monsanto-effort-to-skew-science-2581194459.html?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1">“ghostwritten” by various scientists</a>. When research came out that was not in favor of glyphosate, Monsanto spoke internally about publishing research of their own showing that there were no health risks of Roundup and paying outside respected scientists to put their names on it. The company also worked with officials from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to have a review on glyphosate by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, the toxicological portion of the Department of Health and Human Services, suppressed.

Although the majority of cases have taken place in the United States, the legal happenings surrounding Roundup are starting to pick up around the globe. An Australian man has sought legal recourse after being diagnosed with leukemia and attributing it to his Roundup use. In Canada, a class-action lawsuit has been filed by a man with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma after using the product since the 1990s.

The next case in the series of Roundup trials will take place in St. Louis, Missouri in late August as Sharlean Gordon tries to convince the jury that her 15 years of Roundup use attributed to her development of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The future of these trials and the pushback by Bayer is uncertain, but the thousands of filed cases tell us it’s far from over.

		<title>Why the 1963 Sino-Pakistan Boundary Agreement Is Unlawful in Light of the Recent ICJ Advisory Opinion on the Chagos Archipelago, 2019</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Pakistan and the People's Republic of China concluded a boundary agreement in 1963 ceding a substantial territorial part of the state of Jammu and Kashmir (J&amp;K) to China. Pakistan also believes in the self-determination of the people of J&amp;K, while India denies this and claims that the entire territory of the J&amp;K is an integral part to Indian Territory. However, the 1963 boundary agreement is contrary to the rules of international law related to the right to self-determination as understood and pronounced by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in its recent <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/169/169-20190225-01-00-EN.pdf">advisory opinion</a> on the Chagos Archipelago.

<strong>Relevant facts of the case</strong>

On September 23, 1965, an agreement between the colony of Mauritius and the UK Government was concluded (the Lancaster House Meeting) detaching the Chagos Archipelago from the colony of Mauritius. On March 12, 1968, Mauritius became an independent State. In light of this, the ICJ was asked to answer the following question, <em>inter alia</em>: “Was the process of decolonization of Mauritius lawfully completed when Mauritius was granted independence in 1968, following the separation of the Chagos Archipelago?”

To answer this question, the Court heavily relied on the UNGA resolutions <a href="https://www.un.org/en/decolonization/declaration.shtml">1514</a> of 1960, <a href="https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/218/29/IMG/NR021829.pdf?OpenElement">2066</a> of 1966, <a href="https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/005/35/IMG/NR000535.pdf?OpenElement">2232</a> of 1966, and <a href="https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/236/92/IMG/NR023692.pdf?OpenElement">2357</a> of 1967, and concluded that, as a result of the Chagos Archipelago’s unlawful detachment and its incorporation into a new colony, known as the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT), the process of decolonization of Mauritius was not lawfully completed when Mauritius acceded to independence in 1968.

The underlying rationale of the Court’s opinion is that the Lancaster House Meeting which led to the unlawful cession of Chagos Archipelago was negotiated and concluded without taking into account the ‘free and genuine expression of the will’ of the Chagossians; thus it violates the customary norm of right to self-determination of the Chagossians. However, right to self-determination, under customary international law, does not impose a specific mechanism for its implementation. The Court mainly relied on paragraph 6 of UNGA resolution 1514 which says that any disruption of the national unity and territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter. The Court said that it is incompatible with the right to self-determination for the administering power to effect any detachment of part of any territory unless such detachment is based on the freely expressed and genuine will of the people of the territory concerned.

<strong>Kashmir Issue</strong>

India’s claim regarding the J&amp;K (including Pakistan occupied Kashmir-PoK, Shaksgam Valley, and Siachen Glacier) has consistently stated since 1947 that the entire territory of the J&amp;K is an integral part of the Republic of India. Pakistan, however, denies and claims otherwise that the J&amp;K is an issue of ‘difference’ between the two countries, and that since the Kashmir issue is yet to be resolved, the people of J&amp;K must be allowed to exercise their right to self-determination. Pakistan believes that the integration or accession of J&amp;K to India was not done according to the law. However, India’s official position is clear and unequivocal that the principles of self-determination are meant to apply to colonial territories and not to integral parts of countries. So far as accession of J&amp;K to India is concerned, it is, <a href="https://mea.gov.in/in-focus-article.htm?18971/The+Jammu+and+Kashmir+Issue">according to India</a>, “completely valid in terms of the Government of India Act (1935), Indian Independence Act (1947) and international law and is total and irrevocable.”

For India, J&amp;K is an integral part to Indian Territory, and while India is prepared to resolve all diﬀerences with Pakistan through bilateral talks as envisaged in the <a href="https://mea.gov.in/in-focus-article.htm?19005/Simla+Agreement+July+2+1972">Shimla Agreement</a>, the issue that remains on J&amp;K to be resolved is the vacation by Pakistan of illegally occupied territory.

<strong>Legality of the 1963 Boundary Agreement in the light of the ICJ Advisory Opinion, February 2019</strong>

<a href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pakistan-occupying-indian-territory-in-kashmir-says-sushma-swaraj-in-parliament-1961665">India asserts</a> that Pakistan concluded a <a href="https://fall.fsulawrc.com/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS085.pdf">boundary agreement</a> with China in 1963 where Pakistan illegally ceded 5180 sq. km of Indian Territory in PoK (known as Shaksgam Valley) to China. The Shaksgam Valley or the Trans Karakoram Tract is part of Hunza-Gilgit region and is a disputed territory claimed by India but controlled by Pakistan. This agreement was condemned and highly objected to by the Government of India. According to India, Pakistan has been in illegal and forcible occupation of approximately 78,000 sq. km of Indian Territory in the state of J&amp;K.

In the light of the law related to the right to self-determination as propounded by the ICJ above and the facts about the transferring of the territory of Shaksgam Valley to China, Pakistan has violated rules of international law applicable to the right to self-determination. The 1963 Agreement was concluded by Pakistan – an administrating power – in violation of the customary norms of self-determination. The agreement was not concluded with the ‘free and genuine will’ of the people of J&amp;K. Thus, the detachment of 5,180 sq. km of the Shaksgam Valley by the 1963 Boundary Agreement was unlawful as the obligations arising under international law and reflected in UNGA resolution 1514 require Pakistan, as the administrating power in PoK region, to respect the territorial integrity of that region.

Article 6 of the 1963 Agreement, however, says that “the two Parties have agreed that after the settlement of the Kashmir dispute between Pakistan and India, the sovereign authority concerned will re-open negotiations with the Government of China… so as to sign a Boundary Treaty to replace the present agreement.” Even though the 1963 Agreement was conditional, it does not change the legality of the Agreement being concluded unlawfully. The Lancaster House Meeting was also subject to one condition similar to that of 1963 Boundary Agreement. The Lancaster House Meeting in principle was adopted on the condition that the archipelago could not be ceded to any third party and would be returned to Mauritius at a later date once it was no longer needed for defense purposes, a condition which was accepted at the time by the UK. Finally, the ICJ noted that the Lancaster House Meeting was unlawful as devoid of the free consent and genuine will of the Chagossians. Thus, the detachment of the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius to the UK was unlawful. Similarly, the 1963 Agreement was concluded without the ‘free and genuine will’ of the people of J&amp;K and without the consent of India. In this way, the 1963 Agreement was concluded in violation of norms of international law, as it amounted to disruption of national unity and territorial integrity of the J&amp;K and its people.

Pakistan concluded this agreement while legally believing that the ‘difference’ over J&amp;K between the two countries (India and Pakistan) is not fully resolved in a legal sense. By concluding the boundary agreement and ceding 5180 sq. km of Shaksgam Valley to China, Pakistan has not honored the territorial integrity of the J&amp;K which must be otherwise respected and protected to uphold the sanctity of international law.

However, it does not undermine India’s understanding regarding the right to self-determination of Kashmiri people. India not only legally believes that the J&amp;K including Shaksgam Valley is an integral part of India, which Pakistan is unlawfully occupying, but it also claims that the ‘freely expressed and genuine will’ of the Kashmiri people has been subsumed in the Constitution of J&amp;K adopted by the constituent assembly of the J&amp;K in 1956. Article 3 of the Constitution says that the “State of Jammu and Kashmir is and shall be an integral part of the Union of India.” Moreover, in several subsequent local, State, and national elections, the people of J&amp;K have repeatedly exercised their democratic choice.

Finally, Pakistan cannot be legally allowed to argue from one side that it still believes in the self-determination of the people of J&amp;K, but on the other side, that Pakistan may conclude an international agreement with a third country ceding a substantial territorial part of the J&amp;K to China.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>"Any attack by Iran on anything American will be met with great and overwhelming force. In some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration."-</em><em>US President Donald Trump, June 23, 2019</em>

<em>"The United States has great strength and patience, but if it  is forced to defend itself or its allies we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea with fire and fury."- </em><em>US President Donald Trump, Speaking at UN General Assembly (2017)</em>

&nbsp;

If push comes to shove, any US presidential decision to attack Iran would likely be based upon some notion of lawful preemption or "anticipatory self defense." The right of national self-defense, both anticipatory and post-attack, is a "peremptory" or <em>jus cogens</em> norm under international law. This is not to suggest that pertinent legal standards would in some significant way actually determine the cost-effectiveness or rationality of any such American military action, but only that they would be conveniently invoked after the fact, as a more-or-less appropriate retroactive justification.

Realistically, launching a defensive first strike against Iran would stem solely from various American operational considerations. To be sure, it would be better if US foreign policy making were authentically mindful of relevant law, but any such principled expectation in the "Trump Era" would be sorely naive.

This means, <em>inter alia,</em> that even if supportive criteria for anticipatory self-defense could be discovered in pertinent international law, any considered preemptive strike that had seemingly poor odds of tactical success would be dismissed out of hand. In this connection, moreover, it would be difficult to expect promising odds of tactical success so long as Trump continues to claim that "I need no exit strategy" and to remain distant from the intellectual antecedents of "escalation dominance."

In any upcoming crisis with Iran concerning preemptive US military force, the president would face a simultaneous obligation to dominate escalation processes and avoid catastrophic war. This obligation, furthermore, would need to be contextualized within a re-emergent bipolarity between the two original superpowers - that is, between the United States and Russia.

On all such vital policy matters, the critical facts are both plain and daunting. Already, it is unreasonable to expect that a preemption against Iran could plausibly succeed. In part, at least, this is due to what Carl von Clausewitz famously called "friction," or the difference between "war on paper" and "war as it actually is." Rather, beyond any reasonable doubt, the probable costs of any such strike would exceed the probable gains. Among other things, therefore, a preemptive first strike by the United States against Iran would likely be <em>irrational.</em>

Notwithstanding the evident primacy of strategy and tactics, an American president should remain fully aware of all related legal considerations. But before he could ever manage this gainfully heightened level of awareness, he would first have to clarify much more precisely what he is after in Iran. Accordingly, is he "simply" seeking the right to inflict certain more-or-less proportionate harms upon Iran if that state should once against shoot down an American drone or become tangibly responsible for some similar "unfriendly action?" Or, as he has been musing publicly, is Mr. Trump thinking primarily about preventing a nuclear Iran, and staving off that understandably fearful development at all apparent costs?

Right now, of course, it's hard to tell. After all, as had been the case earlier with North Korea, the president's assorted comments concerning American security vigilance are less than specific and very conspicuously disjointed.

What next?  To begin, Mr. Trump and his policy counselors will need to better understand and further elucidate their specific military objectives vis-à-vis Iran. Here, considerations of law will necessarily follow more fundamental considerations of objective.

There is more. International law is never a suicide pact. Designed, in its coherent totality, to ensure the safety of states in an anarchic and conflict-driven "Westphalian" world, its binding or "peremptory" rules include the “inherent” right of individual and collective self-defense. After the seventeenth century (1648) <em>Peace of Westphalia,</em> which ended the Thirty Years' War and created our anarchic legal system of independent states. At times, this national prerogative may be exercised not only after an armed attack has already been suffered (the legal expectation codified at Article 51 of the <em>UN Charter</em>, a treaty to which the US is an original party), but also, on occasion, <em>in advance</em><em>.</em>

What more exactly are these exceptional permissible times? The answers to such such questions are potentially urgent for US President Trump to master, especially in the persistently ambiguous case of Iranian nuclear weapons development. Is Tehran expanding its efforts in such a palpably worrisome development? If so, are these expansions in any verifiable violation of authoritative international law, or even prospectively genocidal (in view of expressed Iranian regime <a href="https://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://search.yahoo.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1151&amp;context=ilr">statements</a> calling for the destruction of Israel), or are they now genuinely allowable - perhaps in part because of a prior and willful US Trump withdrawal from the 2015 JCPOA agreement?

In examining such complex matters, analysts may reason from the general to the particular. What does world law say about preemption in general? Here, complexity includes the possible convergence of genocidal crimes and "crimes against humanity," which antedate the conventional criminalization of genocide. Although the settled rules of the <em>UN Charter</em>  reserve the right of self-defense exclusively to states that have already suffered an armed attack, an equally valid <em><a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/en/statute">customary</a> </em>legal norm may still permit a first use of force if  the danger posed is "instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means and no moment for deliberation." The essential significance of a norm's customary character under international law is that the norm binds even those states that are not parties to the pertinent codifying instrument or convention. Drawn from an 1837 incident in military history known as the <em>Caroline </em> (concerning the unsuccessful rebellion in Upper Canada against British rule), this usually inconspicuous doctrine builds upon the foundational seventeenth-century legal writings of jurist Hugo Grotius.

Self-defense, proclaims the Dutch scholar in <em>The Law of War and Peace</em> (1625), may be permitted "not only after an attack has already been suffered, but also in advance, where the deed may be anticipated."  In his later text of 1758, <em>The Right of Self-Protection and the Effects of Sovereignty and Independence of Nations</em>, Swiss jurist Emmerich de Vattel similarly affirms: "A nation has the right to resist the injury another seeks to inflict upon it, and to use force and every other just means of resistance against the aggressor."

But where is there any discoverable evidence that Iran seeks to "inflict injury" upon the United States? Even if such evidence were capably produced by the Trump White House, any subsequent US defensive strikes would still need to meet the standard "Law of War" criteria of “discrimination," "proportionality" and   "military necessity." In other words, even a US invocation of "anticipatory self defense" would not automatically allow President Trump an operational <em>carte blanche</em> in fashioning any allegedly remediating uses of American force.

International law has multiple, overlapping and sometimes even contradictory sources. Significantly, article 51 of the <em>UN Charter,</em> limiting self-defense to circumstances following an armed attack, does not override the equally valid customary legal right of <em>anticipatory self-defense.  </em>As for customary international law in general, it is most prominently explained at article 38 of the (UN) <em>Statute of the International Court of Justice.</em> The actual conditions under which an expression of anticipatory self defense could conceivably be lawful require enemy threats that are “instant," "overwhelming" and "imminent in point of time."

Unsurprisingly, assessing these criteria in any particular setting or decisional circumstance could prove overwhelmingly subjective.

I first taught international law at Princeton in 1970. While I was still a "working professor" of international law, I instructed my students at the very first course lecture about the importance of "Article 38." One can only hope that today, Donald Trump's legal advisors have some sense of this importance themselves.

There is more. In rendering this country's indispensable strategic judgments, President Trump and his advisors should expressly recall the <em>US</em> <em>Constitution </em>and certain assorted US Supreme Court decisions. Both sources proclaim unambiguously that international law is part of the law of the United States. This "incorporation" dates back to the eighteenth century English common law, which quickly became the <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/175/677/">literal foundation</a> of subsequent US law.

In reaching verdicts, state courts applied this "law of nations" even prior to adoption of the <em>Constitution</em>, and it was well familiar to most participants at the Federal Convention. While the current President of the United States cannot recall the title of a single book he has read apart from the Bible, the Framers were more or less learned in the complex jurisprudential treatises of Grotius, Pufendorf and Vattel.

Jurisprudentially, in this country, the times have very surely changed.

The US <em>Constitution </em>stipulates at Article 6, <em>inter alia,</em> "...all treaties made or which shall be made....shall be the supreme law of the land." The confirming Supreme Court case here is the <em>Paquete Habana</em> (1900). In still broader connections, William Blackstone's seminal <em>Commentaries</em> became the principal foundation of all early United States law. Incontestably, his<em> Commentaries</em> <em>on the Law of England</em> effectively represented the original legal system of the United States.

Moreover, the <em>Federalist Papers,</em> especially No. 3 (Jay), and Nos. 80, 82 and 83 (Hamilton) clearly reference the universal authoritativeness and worldwide jurisdiction of international law.

To wit, Chief Justice John Marshall declared that all international law, whatever its source, was binding upon the courts of the United States

To be in compliance with his own oath of office, President Trump  must finally understand international law an integral part of US law, and, correspondingly, as similarly binding.

In connection with US President Donald Trump's plans for a presumptively nuclearizing Iran, there remains one more important clarification . The <em>Caroline </em>case decision makes an implicit distinction between preventive war (which is never legal) and preemptive war, which can conceivably be lawful. As a justification for military action, anticipatory self-defense is never permitted to protect one's state against some merely emergent threat, and is potentially permissible only when the "danger posed" is judged both "instant" and "overwhelming."

Using such a classical jurisprudential framework, it is doubtful that this US president could presently construct even a minimally valid legal argument for preemption against Iran. This would be the case even if the considered American operation were somehow based on authentically valid considerations of national self-defense and if it were limited meticulously to certain presumptively nuclear military targets in Iran. For certain, in law, a more <a href="http://www.acpr.org.il/ENGLISH-NATIV/03-ISSUE/daniel-3.htm">compelling case</a> for preemption could be made by the State of Israel, which is substantially more vulnerable to any forthcoming Iranian nuclear developments than is the United States.

Israel is half the size of an American lake (Lake Michigan) and could face sudden and complete annihilation from almost any still-considered Iranian nuclear attack.

A related and sometimes derivative danger to Israel is posed by terrorist group surrogates. If not kept from receiving nuclear weapons or fissile materials from Iran, such proxies could sometime inflict starkly grievous harms upon variegated Israeli targets. In principle, at least, such harms could be nuclear, including determined rocket attacks against the Israeli nuclear reactor at Dimona. This attack plan was already attempted by Hamas several years back, but without any success. (This is discussed by Professor Beres in his latest book,<em> Surviving Amid Chaos: Israel's Nuclear Strategy https://www.israeldefense.co.il/en/content/surviving-amid-chaos-israels-nuclear-strategy)</em>.

In the future, at least in principle, a non-nuclear insurgent adversary such as Hamas or Hezbollah could still visit significant nuclear harms upon Israel. Of  course, even by definition, any nuclear harms would be significant.

Where does all of this leave US President Donald Trump? Among other things, any observable use of preemptive force against Iran would almost certainly initiate a wider regional cycle of attack and counter-attack, destabilizing the entire area and very calculably expanding Israel's overall strategic vulnerabilities. The actual likelihood of such markedly unwelcome  consequences would likely increase in some rough proportion to US inflicted harms.

This suggests, <em>inter alia,</em> that if the president's determined military objectives were designed to halt Iranian nuclearization, these American efforts could have some limited success but only at a much greater overall strategic cost. As for any capable legal assessments, it is almost certain on its face that a preemptive strike against Iranian targets ordered by Donald Trump - even if exclusively military or hard-target oriented - would represent a <em>prima facie</em> act of US aggression.

It follows that Mr. Trump should now be looking in other operational directions and be seeking for altogether different remedies. As an overarching predictive concern, the president ought to be reminded that he is dealing here with unprecedented decisional circumstances, and that no logically reliable judgments could ever be made about prospects that are literally <em>sui generis. </em>Indeed, in meaningfully scientific terms, no useful probability estimations could be made about preemptive attack outcomes before the actual occurrence of a two-party nuclear war.

Best that we should all remain unable to offer any such estimations.

		<title>&quot;Penal Order&quot; in Greece: a New Era for the Rights of the Defendant?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400">On June 11, 2019, the Hellenic Republic published in the Government Gazette laws 4619 and 4620 that ratified respectively the new Criminal Code and Criminal Procedure Code. The provisions of these two new laws apply for all criminal court proceedings beginning July 1, 2019. There are many changes that create a new reality in the way criminal trials will be held from now on, with scholars, judges, and lawyers arguing in favor of or against the new system. One change that is worth highlighting is the introduction of the “Penal Order” («Ποινική Διαταγή»), as defined by articles 409-416 of the new Criminal Procedure Code.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The inspiration for this measure comes from the German Criminal Procedure and the “Strafbefehl” (articles </span><a href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stpo/__407.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">407</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">-412 of the German Code of Criminal Procedure), which is </span><span style="font-weight: 400">a more simple procedure because it is without the obligation of a hearing that can be </span><span style="font-weight: 400">followed for minor criminal cases</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In Greek law, such a “fast-track” court order-decision already exists for debt cases in civil law procedure called “Order for Payment” («Διαταγή Πληρωμής»). According to article 409 of the new Greek Criminal Procedure Code, the “Penal Order” can be issued </span><span style="font-weight: 400">for Single-Member Court in first instance jurisdiction offenses that are punished with imprisonment of up to one year or with a fine or with both penalties. In such cases, if the prosecutor handling the case considers that the existing evidence does not require a live hearing of the defendant for the further verification of the facts leading to guilt, he submits an application for the issue of a penal order drawing an indictment. What follows, according to article 410 </span><span style="font-weight: 400">of the new Criminal Procedure Code, is a Judge can either </span><span style="font-weight: 400">consider the evidence submitted not sufficient for the guilt of the accused (and refer the case to the ordinary procedure), or considering the evidence sufficient and without a hearing he or she can issue a criminal order imposing a fine reduced at a minimum of two-thirds of what is prescribed in the legal framework or an imprisonment of up to 3 months on conditional suspension. Against the “Penal Order” the convicted person can submit “Objections” (article 412) within 15 days of the date the “Penal Order” has been served to him (and this can be the very point in time that a person finds out he was accused, tried and a decision was taken against him, without any prior knowledge, ways to be heard and defend himself). If the “Objections” are submitted timely the “Penal Order” is overturned and the case gets to be tried in the ordinary procedure (article 413).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The measure of “Penal Order” as introduced in Greece and without the relevant safeguards of the German model regarding the defense counsel (only when the accused has a defense counsel can a penalty of imprisonment- not exceeding one year and suspended on probation- be imposed)</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> is not compatible the domestic principles of criminal law and it contradicts the rights protected by the European Convention of Human Rights. More specifically, among the most essential rights of an accused person are the following: knowing the accusation, being heard by the court and having a lawyer (still defined in articles 89-108 of the new Code of Criminal Procedure). All the previous and of course the presumption of innocence are guaranteed under the notion of a “Fair Trial” by article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">With the “Penal Order” what we have in the new criminal procedure reality is a defendant who can be convicted without knowing the accusations against him, without been heard and without been represented by a lawyer. The remedy of “Objections” cannot be considered as an adequate safeguard, because the accused starts his defense after conviction, to try to overturn a decision against him. This is a blow to the presumption of innocence. A decision that can mean imprisonment for up to 3 months (with conditional suspension) taken against a defendant, without representation by a defense lawyer, is a blow both to the rights of the accused person and the institutional protective role of the defense lawyer in the criminal justice system. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Furthermore, it cannot be predicted how many defendants will be able to launch “Objections” for “Penal Orders” against them and then follow the regular procedure, even from the point of view of the budget needed. Not all can financially bear trying to overturn a “Penal Order” whose fine could be lower than the money required to go against it in courts.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">One of the reasons behind the changes in the Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure Law has been the quest for speedy justice. While undeniably delayed justice can result in no justice at all, attempts to achieve speedy procedures cannot be carried out at the expense of the rights of the defendant. Yes, there is a need for measures to relieve the heavy backlog of Greek courts, yet changes should not challenge the rights an accused person should enjoy given his vulnerable situation. The new criminal justice reality in Greece will be tested in practice and it will be shown if the new era will bring more justice, or just speed at the expense of the defendant.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), a political party that has ruled the country off and on in the past three decades, has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpVfgLxi5OM">released</a> an audio-video montage claiming that the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) judge, who convicted and sentenced former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif for owning unexplained properties in London, delivered his decision under coercion.

The video shows the NAB judge sitting in his own living room, sharing soft drinks, chatting with a well-known and criminally convicted political worker of the Nawaz political party. In the audio, recorded separately from the video, the judge points out the defects in his own judgment and shares the points that Sharif can argue in the appeal still pending before the Islamabad High Court.

As a response to the audio-video, the Nab judge released a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1492663">memo</a> to the public, denying that he convicted Sharif under pressure, calling the audio-video a distortion, but admitting close acquaintance with the Nawaz political worker appearing in the video. To make matters even more scandalous, the judge claims that the Nawaz representatives attempted to influence him with money and threats during the trial, but he remained loyal to evidence and law.

The government spokesperson <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1492759">asserts</a> that the audio-video is fake and has been concocted to malign this judge and the NAB as an anti-corruption state institution. (Prime Minister Imran Khan, scheduled to meet President Trump in a few days, has vowed to go after “corrupt” political leaders and retrieve “stolen monies.”) The Press regulatory agency has prohibited the electronic media from re-playing the audio-video, even though the TV commentators and print media are gingerly permitted to discuss the scandal.

Last month, another scandalous video was <a href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/1980457/1-nab-files-references-blackmailers/">aired</a> on a pro-government TV station. The video secretly recorded a conversation between the NAB chairman, a retired judge of the Pakistan Supreme Court, and a woman, the wife of another convicted criminal. In the video, the NAB chairman expresses a sexual desire to meet the woman. According to the Nawaz political party, this embarrassing video was released to force the NAB chairman to resign so that the government may appoint a more reliable head of the bureau to prosecute politicians. The chairman has not resigned.

Since the promulgation of the <a href="http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/">1973 Constitution</a>, the independence of Pakistan judiciary has been the prime target of political and military forces. In the 1990s, the Nawaz government was caught calling a Lahore High Court Justice to demand punitive verdict against Benazir Bhutto. In 2007, General Pervez Musharraf summoned the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, who was perceived to be anti-government, to demand his resignation as the Chief Justice – an episode I <a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2007/04/pakistan-chief-justice-story-personal/">reported</a> in JURIST.

In 2018, an Islamabad High Court Justice impugned the state intelligence agencies for disappeared persons. He <a href="https://www.geo.tv/latest/203843-judges-phones-are-tapped-lives-not-safe-justice-shaukat-siddiqui">stated</a> that the phones of the judges are tapped, that their lives are unsafe, and that the military manipulates judges for obtaining favorable verdicts in the cases of missing persons. The Justice was <a href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/1823529/1-sjc-recommends-removal-ihc-justice-shaukat-aziz-siddique/">fired</a> for maligning the armed forces, conduct prohibited under the 1973 Constitution (article 19 limiting free speech to protect “the integrity, security, or defense of Pakistan).

Much like the U.S. courts, the Pakistan courts are drawn into resolving various institutional controversies. However, the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/political_question_doctrine">“political question doctrine”</a> does not exist in the Pakistan jurisprudence. Consequently, the Pakistan courts undertake to resolve all sorts of complicated and contentious political cases. The Supreme Court has written several controversial opinions legitimizing military coups, disqualifying elected prime ministers for being “dishonest,” and sometimes <a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2018/02/l-ali-khan-pakistan-supreme-court/">intervening</a> in decisions that properly belong to other branches of the government.

Despite politicization, the Pakistan Supreme Court enjoys a broad-based reputation of judicial integrity. However, the lower courts do not. The administrative courts, such as the NAB courts, are particularly vulnerable to political pressure. In fact, the politicians smear the NAB as a tool of oppression that splits political parties, maligns elected officials, and concocts cases against anti-government elements. The media and the politicians accuse, though only in whispers, the military establishment for most political convictions.

Unfortunately, there is no easy solution for fixing the degradation of judicial ecology in Pakistan. A culture of military coups, election tampering, corruption, horse trading in the national and provincial legislatures, ethics-free politics, obsessive patriotism that treats critics as traitors, these and other factors vitiate the dynamics of justice. Under these social burdens, good faith judicial neutrality appears unavailable. Much like politicians, judges and generals are perceived to have been forced into partisanship.

The broader legal culture will take time to develop respect for viewpoint tolerance and judicial integrity at all levels. Meanwhile, the Pakistan Supreme Court could stringently enforce the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/page.asp?id=435">judicial code of conduct</a> for all judges, and not just for the judges of higher courts.

Article -II of the judicial code states:
<blockquote>A Judge should be God-fearing, law-abiding, abstemious, truthful of tongue, wise in opinion, cautious and forbearing, blameless, and untouched by greed. While dispensing justice, he should be strong without being rough, polite without being weak, awe inspires in his warnings and faithful to his word, always preserving calmness, balance and complete detachment, for the formation of correct conclusions in all matters coming before him.</blockquote>
This rule, under the current epidemic of scandals, carries good instructions for all judges, including the NAB judges. The word “abstemious” is a bit enigmatic, as its conventional meaning warns against excessive alcohol use, something strictly prohibited under the laws. Yet the word abstemious discourages judges from indulging in immoderate activities.

The rule of “detachment” demands that the judges avoid contacts with partisan political groups and individuals. There is no excuse for the judges at any level of judicial hierarchy to nurture close associations with individuals convicted of crimes or their spouses.

If there is any silver lining to the current judicial scandals, it is that, in addition to being “God-fearing,” as the code requires, the judges will also fear cell cameras and other secret recording devices that the people may use to document judicial misconduct.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On the last day of its 2018-2019 Term, the Supreme Court decided in <em><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/18-966_bq7c.pdf">Department of Commerce v. New York</a> </em>that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross could not add a question about citizenship to the 2020 Census solely on the basis of the “contrived” and “pretextual” reason he cited (the need to better enforce the Voting Rights Act).  Since then, most observers focused on whether the Administration would be able to thread the decisional needle on remand and justify the citizenship question on a non-pretextual basis.

Now, after flirting with ways to do that, the Administration has (apparently) thrown in the towel.  So, the focus can be on what the Census decision means for governmental integrity, access to the courts, administrative rationality and the Court’s role in promoting the rule of law.

<u>An Important Stand for Integrity</u>

First, the Census decision is a crucial commitment to minimal honesty in government.  Thanks to extensive district-court-ordered document production and meticulous fact-finding, the administrative record revealed, as Chief Justice Roberts’ majority opinion put it, “a significant mismatch between the [Secretary’s] decision and the rationale he provided.”  Roberts’ opinion credited “evidence…that the Secretary had made up his mind to reinstate a citizenship question ‘well before’ receiving” a logically dubious Justice Department request instigated by Ross’ staff.

In part of the opinion joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, the Chief Justice sent an important signal that government officials can’t just lie to reviewing courts and the public.  Roberts didn’t explicitly say that the Secretary’s real interest was causing a significant undercount among noncitizens and Latino-citizen households and skewing the number and districting of House seats in a Republican direction; but between the lines the judicial reviewers shared the widespread skepticism of others.  As Roberts’ opinion put it, if judicial review of administrative action is to be “more than an empty ritual,” deference to administrative officials does not require courts to exhibit “naivete’.”

<u>Not Avoiding the Merits</u>

A second, important aspect of the Census decision is the Court’s declining to endorse either of two rationales that would have avoided the merits, yet green lighted the citizenship question.  The Administration urged the justices to hold that challengers lacked standing to sue or that the Commerce Secretary’s discretion was so wide that no reviewable law applied.  Rejecting both invitations reinforced the availability of judicial forums.

The consensus that the challengers had standing is especially important because it declined to add mass to a previous decision (<em><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-1025_ihdj.pdf">Clapper v. Amnesty International</a></em>) reflecting a cramped view that litigants can’t access federal courts with “self-inflicted” injuries even if they legitimately suspect that governmental actors will adversely target them.

<u>Too Much Deference Elsewhere</u>

A third, but in my view unfortunate, facet of the Census case is portions deferring too much to other aspects of Secretary Ross’ decision-making.  The Chief Justice seemed to discount Census staff concerns about the gravity of the Census undercount.  And Roberts seemed too quick to credit as rational the Secretary’s overruling of his expert subordinates’ view that alternative methods would produce better citizenship data without risking suppressing participation.

Justice Breyer’s concurring opinion provided a more nuanced and persuasive assessment.  But Roberts discounted Breyer’s careful analysis as “subordinating the Secretary’s policymaking discretion to the Bureau’s technological expertise.”

In one sense, this dispute is nothing new.  It reflects two positions on a deference-versus-hard look continuum underlying decades of administrative-law cases.  But opinion portions taking such a deferential view – and an unfortunate sentence stating that administrative decisions “are routinely informed by unstated considerations of politics,” along with other policy concerns – could, in such a high-profile case tainted with pretext and partisanship, send the wrong signal to lower courts.

<u>The Chief Justice as Institutional-Reputation Enhancer</u>

The fourth, and probably most important, dimension of the Census case is its example of Chief Justice Roberts acting contrary to political or ideological expectation.  Although appointed by a Republican president and typically labelled as “conservative,” Roberts cast a critical fifth vote on the ultimately decisive pretext issue by aligning with “liberal” justices.  (The quote marks reflect my continued attempt to point out that, although politics and ideology play important parts in judicial decision-making, they are often not a solely sufficient explanation.)

Roberts’ choice to create a five-justice truth squad standing up for the role of courts in promoting the rule of law is yet another example of how the Chief Justice at critical junctures has placed decisive importance on the Court’s legitimacy and stature as an honest broker among polarized partisans.

Both in structure and in spirit, the Census decision resembles the Chief Justice’s 2011 decision (in <em><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf">NFIB v. Sebelius</a></em>) to save the Affordable Care Act from a constitutional challenge to its individual mandate – and avoid a perception that the Court was reflecting crass politics.  In the Obamacare case, Roberts joined four other “conservatives” to hold that the individual mandate exceeded Congress’ Commerce Power.  Then, Roberts shifted gears and joined four “liberals” to validate the mandate via an alternative Taxing-Power theory.

So, too, does the Census case start by suggesting that the basis on which the Administration later sought to shore up the Secretary’s decision to add a citizenship question would be rational and non-arbitrary -- only to switch gears (and changing concurring justice partners) and hold that Ross’ stated rationale was not authentic.

Thankfully, the Chief Justice is periodically willing to be a swing voter in cases posing special danger that the justices will be perceived as mere politicians who wear black robes.  And this may suggest how Roberts can be persuaded to join a less-ideological approach in future cases -- for example, if four other colleagues were inclined to overrule, as opposed to just incrementally weaken, the 1972 <em><a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/410/113/">Roe v. Wade</a></em> assertion of strong abortion-choice rights.  The Census case further illustrates how another change in the Court’s personnel could alter the current delicate balance on institution-critical matters.

But, whatever the future holds, the Census case shows many important sensibilities (albeit, with some regrettable insensibilities) toward rationality and the rule of law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Though rarely understood, there can be no greater form of power on this earth than <em>power over death.</em> Ominously, this always-preeminent form of power in world politics remains unrecognized by American foreign policy-makers. The perilous result is that this country's counter-insurgent strategies will become less and less adequate.

It’s not an enviable situation for the United States. But it is also apparent and unhidden. Increasingly, and in starkly foreseeable circumstances, US strategies will find themselves detached from potentially indispensable forms of pertinent knowledge. On occasion, of course, these portentous discoveries could coincide with bewildering derivatives of an extant nuclear crisis.

Improved counter-terrorism policy is not just about <em>ad hoc</em> strategies and tactics. In all urgent national security matters, there obtain converging but still-divergent elements of relevant law. Accordingly, those far-flung jihadist insurgents—the embodiment of <em><a href="https://definitions.uslegal.com/h/hostis-humani-generis/">Hostes humani generis</a></em> under international law<em>—</em> who would seek to justify violent attacks on Americans or American allies in the name of “martyrdom” are manifest defilers of authoritative international law.

Always.

The rules are plain. Insurgents, even those with a defensible "just cause," must satisfy longstanding jurisprudential limits on (1) permissible targets and (2) permissible levels of violence. These codified and customary limits are interpenetrating and sometimes even synergistic.

On the other hand, <em>prima facie,</em> all United States policies that are intended to thwart jihadist terrorism, whilst existing discretely, are manifestly supportive of codified and customary international law, as defined in <a href="https://nyulaw.libguides.com/c.php?g=773832&amp;p=5551673">Article 38(1)(b)</a> of the Statute of the International Court of Justice.

It's not at all ambiguous. Binding international law has always been a part of American domestic law, since as early at <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/175/677/">The Paquette Habana</a>; and amidst it, even the "sacred" rights of insurgency exclude the deliberate targeting of civilians and/or force used to inflict gratuitous suffering. Popularly empty witticisms aside, e.g., "All is fair in love and war," there do exist longstanding binding rules to suitably <a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl/INTRO/190?OpenDocument">govern the latter</a>.

In law, any insurgency that blurs the line between combatant and non-combatant populations is impermissible. Irrespective of any "just cause," therefore, it is "terrorism" whenever insurgents murder noncombatants, and whether by guns, bombs, knives or automobiles. In these matters, there are <em>no</em> legal exceptions.

<a href="https://www.icrc.org/en/doc/resources/documents/faq/5zmgf9.htm">Absolutely none</a>.

But terrorists can still play skillfully at "lawfare." Sometimes, insurgent foes will advance a purported legal argument known formally as <em>tu quoque.</em> This already-discredited position stipulates that because the "other side" is guilty of similar, equivalent or allegedly greater kinds of criminality, “our side" is necessarily free of any legal wrongdoing.

<em>Ipso facto.</em>

Jurisprudentially, such a disingenuous argument is always wrong and always invalid - especially after the landmark judgments handed down at the Nuremberg (Germany) and Far East (Japan) post-World War II <em>ad hoc</em> <a href="https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.2_Charter%20of%20IMT%201945.pdf">criminal tribunals</a>.

For both conventional armies and insurgent forces, the right to armed force can never supplant the peremptory rules of humanitarian international law. Such utterly primary or <em>jus cogens</em> rules (rules that permit "no derogation") are correctly referenced as the <em>law of armed conflict </em>or the<em> law of war. </em>Attentiveness to this basic law remains an integral part of any civilized nation's counter-terrorism operations. Historically and conceptually, this law has its doctrinal roots in the Hebrew Bible, the Law of Athens and also Roman Law (notably the Emperor Justinian's well-known <em>Institutes</em>).

Nonetheless, diversionary legal manipulations endure. Endlessly, various supporters of terror-violence against noncombatants still adamantly insist that "the ends justify the means." Leaving aside the ordinary ethical standards by which any such argument must be recognized as inherently corrupt and indecent, the ends can never justify the means under modern international law.

For more than two thousand years, unassailable legal principles have specified that intentional violence against the innocent is always prohibited.

Always.

In law, one person's terrorist can never be another one's "freedom-fighter." Although it is true that certain insurgencies can sometimes be judged lawful or even law-enforcing (consider for example the American revolutionaries of the 18th century), even such presumptively allowable routes to force must always conform to the settled laws of war.

By definition, whenever an insurgent group resorts to manifestly unjust or indiscriminate means, its actions constitute terrorism. Even if certain adversarial claims of a hostile "occupation" were to be accepted as reasonable, any corollary claims of entitlement to "any means necessary" would remain morally disfiguring and patently false.

International law cannot be invented and reinvented according to particular situations. Rather, it maintains specific and determinable form and content. It cannot be defined and redefined by terror groups or terrorist patron-states to justify selective interests. This is especially the case wherever terror violence intentionally targets a designated victim state’s fragile and vulnerable civilian populations.

Reciprocally, national liberation movements that fail to meet the test of <em>just means</em> can never be properly protected as lawful or legitimate. Even if compelling law were somehow to accept the factually questionable argument that certain terror groups had fulfilled the broadly accepted criteria of "national liberation," (e.g., Iran-supported Hamas), they would still not satisfy the equally relevant legal standards of <em>discrimination</em>, <em>proportionality</em>, and <em>military necessity</em>. Authoritatively, these standards are expressly applied to insurgent or sub-state armed forces by the <a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/INTRO/375?OpenDocument">common Article 3</a> of the four <em>Geneva Conventions</em> of 1949 and <em><a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/INTRO/470">Protocols I</a> &amp; <a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/INTRO/475?OpenDocument">II</a> </em>of 1977 to these key <em>Conventions</em>.

All war and insurgency is governed by indisputably common standards of "humanity." These overarching criteria are also binding upon all combatants by virtue of a still more comprehensive customary and conventional international law, including the <em><a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/Article.xsp?action=openDocument&amp;documentId=BD48EA8AD56596A3C12563CD0051653F">Preamble to the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907</a></em>. This foundational rule, called the "<em>Martens Clause</em>," makes <em>all persons</em> responsible for upholding the "laws of humanity" and the associated "dictates of public conscience."

Under relevant international law, the ends can never justify the means. As in the case of war between states, every use of force by insurgents must be judged twice, once with regard to the justness of the objective and once with regard to the justness of the applied means.

Under compulsory international law, terrorist crimes mandate universal cooperation in both apprehension and punishment. As punishers of "grave breaches" under international law, all states are expected to search out and prosecute or extradite individual terrorists. In absolutely no conceivable circumstances are states permitted to regard terrorist “martyrs” as legitimate "freedom fighters."

This is unambiguously true for the United States, which incorporates all international law as the "supreme law of the land" at <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">Article 6 of the <em>Constitution</em></a> and was formed according to timeless principles of Natural Law. Although generally unrecognized, early authority for maintaining the American republic was derived largely from William Blackstone’s justly famous and legally constitutive <em><a href="https://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/blackstone.asp">Commentaries</a></em>.

In law we say <em>'ex injuria jus non oritur,'</em> which means rights can never stem from wrongs. Even if US adversaries continue to insist on treating the most recalcitrant jihadist insurgents as "martyrs," such treatment could have no exculpatory or mitigating effect on attendant terrorist crimes. Despite any alleged justness of cause, and this includes frequently-cited adversarial references to "self-determination," nothing in international law can justify the deliberate targeting of non-combatant populations.

America's jihadist foes are ultimately in search of the preeminent form of power on planet earth. This means <em>power over death.</em> Accordingly, Washington's counter-terrorism policy-makers ought never lose sight of this power and its primal place in certain enemy decisional calculi. In the end, <em>power over death</em> could trump every other more tangible form of power, including those that are based upon aircraft carriers, missiles or other technologically advanced weapon systems.

The explanation here lies at the very heart of what it means to be human. The philosopher Alfred North Whitehead would say that in world politics, any deeply felt promise of immortality must inevitably be of "<a href="https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.523707/page/n3">transcendent importance</a>."

All this signifies, among other things, that the primary American orientation to wage battle in counter-terrorism must focus on "mind over mind," not "mind over matter." In essence, whenever our enemies assign an absolute primacy to the words "I believe," it should become an "automatic" signal to Washington that the best US response must be undertaken at an intellectual level. Though intangible and not easily understood by politicians or planners, enemy searches for <em>power over death</em> can be (1) decisively all-important and (2) unresponsive to ordinary threats of military harm.

To blithely dismiss such a distressingly complex reality will be tempting, especially by political candidates of either party, but that dismissal could sometime prove catastrophic for the United States. When a determined enemy is driven by presumptively existential notions of "I believe," the US arsenal of plausible counter-measures must be made correspondingly flexible and creative. This analytic imperative becomes even more obvious and overriding whenever that enemy is endowed (directly or indirectly) with nuclear or certain other weapons of mass-destruction.

For American counter-terrorist strategists, it will be vital to understand that even an adversary who does not fear cessation of life could remain subject to various alternate fears. For example, a “martyrdom” seeking jihadist might still be deterred by assorted threats of humiliation, operational failure, incompetence, emasculation, community derision, or - most terrifying of all - rejection by God. Significantly, these variegated apprehensions could sometime resemble what Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard famously termed the "Sickness unto Death.” This means a sense of despair so utterly devastating that it would seem even more unbearable than imminent physical annihilation.

Going forward, to more capably challenge terrorist expectations of immortality – far-flung expectations of achieving power over death by launching violent attacks against the innocent -  is a <em>sine qua non</em> of US national security policy. In this connection, there may be little available theoretical guidance for designated decision-makers. Nonetheless, comprehensive theories will soon have to be fashioned.

There is no conceivable alternative.

		<title>After Mueller: A High Crimes and Misdemeanors (But Not Necessarily an Impeachment) Investigation</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the wake of Special Counsel Mueller’s largely uneventful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFIoVAMSLX0">testimony</a> Wednesday, no-one can envy House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s impeachment dilemma. Presented with ample evidence of offenses justifying President Trump’s removal (the appalling violations of immigrants’ human rights are sufficient on their own) she also knows that no matter what he has done and no matter how compelling the evidence offered against him, Mitch McConnell’s Senate will never vote to remove this President from office.

Ms. Pelosi is also rightly loath to do anything that could sabotage the imperative of preventing a second Trump term. With a very winnable election a year and a quarter away, and with polls showing only a minority of Americans favoring an impeachment trial of Mr. Trump, attempting it may amount to a political death wish.

Finally, and sadly, an impeachment proceeding against the President seems unlikely even to focus the country’s attention on his misdeeds the way the investigation of President Nixon did forty-five years ago. In light of Mr. Trump’s, so far, largely successful obstruction of the House of Representatives’ various oversight efforts to secure the testimony of crucial witnesses and the production of relevant documents, public impeachment hearings may do little more than revisit evidence that, however under-appreciated, is already in the public domain. This scarcely makes for the kind of compelling television that galvanized the nation in 1973 and 1974.

And yet, Mr. Trump’s brief record as President is already the most lawlessly dangerous in our country’s history. His mistreatment of immigrants is only his most egregious offense. Special Counsel Mueller’s report details ten instances of obstruction of justice by the President in connection with the Russian election interference investigation. Mr. Mueller's investigation also adduced direct proof of Mr. Trump’s pre-election offers of bribes to women to purchase their silence about his sexual activities. Additionally, there is the accumulating evidence of Mr. Trump's systematic efforts to profit from his Presidency, and his posture of total resistance to Congressional oversight, an offense for which the House Judiciary Committee voted an Article of Impeachment against President Nixon. If Ms. Pelosi decides that this unparalleled array of unconstitutional and criminal misconduct doesn’t merit an impeachment inquiry, she may be remembered as the Speaker who effectively surrendered Congress’ constitutional power to protect the country from a lawless and tyrannical President.

If there is a workable way forward for the Speaker, one which serves her electoral interests while respecting her constitutional duty, she might find it by recognizing that the impeachment of a sitting president authorized by the Constitution involves two determinations by the House of Representatives: one legal, the other political. The legal predicate for impeachment is a judgment by the House of Representatives that the President has committed “High Crimes and Misdemeanors” in the exercise of executive power (or, perhaps also, in the effort to attain that power). However, this legal conclusion does not compel a decision to impeach. As a political institution, the House must also ask whether the country would be well served by the impeachment of the President. Only if the House answers yes to both questions should it trigger the President’s trial and possible removal by the Senate.

In order to make the first of these decisions responsibly, the House must thoroughly investigate what the President has done and then assess the constitutional significance of any misconduct it finds. Such investigation and assessment are surely long past due in the case of Mr. Trump, and ought to be commenced immediately. But a resulting determination that the President has likely committed High Crimes and Misdemeanors is not enough to warrant his trial in the Senate, even if the evidence against him is compelling. Because the impeachment decision is also political, House members may quite properly take account of popular sentiment, the prospects for conviction of the President in the Senate and the possible impact of an impeachment trial on the upcoming Presidential election. These prudential considerations might lead to a judgment not to impeach or, perhaps more significantly, not to take up the question at all. Presidential High Crimes and Misdemeanors are both legally necessary, but also politically insufficient, to justify impeachment.

A House investigation of possible High Crimes and Misdemeanors by President Trump will be a service to our country even if it does not result in his impeachment and trial by Mr. McConnell’s Senate. First, because a High Crimes and Misdemeanors investigation is an exercise of the House of Representatives’ constitutional Impeachment Power, it may strengthen the House’s ongoing efforts to enforce its subpoenas of Executive branch witnesses and documents in the federal courts. Second, a timely High Crimes and Misdemeanors investigation now will redeem the honor of the House of Representatives and give life to the “constitutional processes for addressing Presidential misconduct” to which Mr. Mueller deferred in lieu of recommending the President’s criminal indictment. And third, whatever it may lack in televised drama, a timely High Crimes and Misdemeanors investigation now will establish the kind of official record of Mr. Trump’s misconduct while in office and during his campaign that Special Counsel Mueller’s Report (and testimony) and other, narrower Congressional investigations so far have not. This kind of record may prove especially useful if President Trump is reelected and faces Democratic majorities in the House and Senate. The political context for impeachment then may look quite different than it does now.

		<title>The Return of the Federal Death Penalty</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Attorney General William Barr’s decision directing the Bureau of Prisons to resume execution of inmates sentenced to death by the federal government is so inconsistent with recent developments with respect to the death penalty that it makes plain how the action is driven more by electoral politics than public safety or penal policy.

Nine states have abolished capital punishment in this century, New Hampshire being the latest. A total of 21 states have now abandoned the death penalty and four more have governor-imposed moratoriums. Not only has the number of executions decreased mightily (23 in 2017, 25 in 2018, compared with 98 in 1999), but the number of death sentences handed down by juries has plummeted.   Jury panels that heard often gruesome evidence handed out only 42 death sentences last year, compared to to 315 in 1996.

A recent report of the United States Bureau of Justice Statistics found that the national death row population had declined for the 17<sup>th</sup> consecutive year. Only ten people have been put to death so far in 2019. Federal death penalty cases are few. Only about sixty (the number shifts due to court decisions) of the 2,703 nationally subject to execution were federal prisoners, making clear that in terms of Barr’s order—which glosses over that the lethal drug to be used may not be obtained from a reliable manufacturer—was more symbol than substance.

A closer look suggests what’s really going on behind the Department of Justice’s statement: “We owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system.”

The federal government has not conducted an execution since 2003. Indeed, only three men have been put to death by Washington since 1998. The present formal moratorium was put in place five years ago by President Obama, which may be another instance of what many have noted has been the President Trump’s efforts to undo every instance of his predecessor’ policies. President Trump has previously called for the resumption of the death penalty and famously called for the execution of the later exonerated Central Park Five.

More fundamentally, the pattern of executions in the United States has for decades largely been a red state phenomenon. Of the eight states that carried out executions in 2017, only Virginia voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Additionally, Ohio might be regarded as a battleground state in the 2020 election. The rest are all Southern or border states that would be expected to line up in the Trump column.

Justices like Kennedy and Stevens, opponents of the death penalty once expected abolition would come from an eventual Supreme Court decision but confirmation of Trump’s nominees, Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, have dashed those hopes.

The world’s democracies have abandoned capital punishment. In this country, the decline in support has been steady but partial, spurred by the innocence movement and the substitution of life without parole sentencing statutes for death verdicts.  In recent years, the move toward restricting and ultimately abolishing capital punishment has come from the states, which carry the burdens and the expense of maintaining the sanction.

The traditional justifications for capital punishment, such as deterrence, have fallen away. The death penalty survives largely because attention is often directed to individual cases of horrible violence, rather that the operation of an error filled, bureaucratic system that metes out the penalty in arbitrary and racially biased fashion. Barr’s announcement may attract some votes, but it is unlikely to change the dynamics that have increasingly turned the death penalty into a national embarrassment.

<i>Michael Meltsner is the George J. and Kathleen Waters Matthews Distinguished University Professor of Law at Northeastern University Law School, and has handled many civil rights cases including Furman v. Georgia - the 1972 Supreme Court case that first restricted the death penalty.</i>

		<title>An American War with Iran: Legal and Strategic Implications for Israel</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In apparent response to US President Donald Trump's unilateral American withdrawal from the <a href="https://2009-2017.state.gov/e/eb/tfs/spi/iran/jcpoa/index.htm">July 2015 Iran Pact (JCPOA)</a>, the Islamic Republic has seemingly reinvigorated its active nuclear program. In turn, this has led to a more-or-less continuing cycle of threat and counter-threat between the two adversarial countries, and has been reinforced by both US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Advisor John Bolton. In upcoming months, it is entirely plausible that a precipitating event (e.g., another commercial ship seizure by Iran) would set the spark for an Iran-US war. Inevitably, as the following article makes clear, such a war could quickly involve US ally, Israel. What then?

For the most part, if US President Donald Trump goes to war with Iran, core policy issues will center on pertinent matters of strategy and tactics, and not law. Nonetheless, these complex issues are frequently overlapping and interpenetrating. At times, wittingly or unwittingly, operational war decisions could be jurisprudentially determinative.

For example, depending upon which country were to strike first in the increasingly adversarial and belligerent US-Iran context, American military actions could become either law-violating or law-enforcing.

Similar legal judgments would necessarily follow from the particular types of weapons used and from their corresponding regard or disregard for non-combatant (civilian) populations.

None of this is meant to suggest that any first use of force by either party must be prima facie illegal. This is the case, inter alia, because customary international law (defined at <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/en/statute">Article 38</a> of the UN's Statute of the International Court of Justice) expressly allows for certain residual resorts to "anticipatory self defense." Following <a href="https://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/br-1842d.asp">The Caroline (1837)</a>, international law need never be taken as some form or other of a suicide pact.

There is more. International law is always a part of each state's domestic or municipal law, an authoritative incorporation most conspicuous for the United States at <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">Article 6</a> of the US Constitution (the Supremacy Clause) and in various US Federal Court decisions, especially the <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/175/677/">Paquete Habana (1900)</a> and <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/517/542/2386834/">Tel Oren v. Libyan Arab Republic (1981)</a>.

But there are certain antecedent questions. What, precisely, does US President Trump have in mind for any prospective armed conflict with Iran? And what would this presumptive American expectation really mean for US ally, Israel?

Once a war were genuinely underway between Iran and the United States, full-scale military engagements could quickly and substantially involve Israeli armed forces (IDF). In certain plainly worst case scenarios, these clashes would involve assorted unconventional weapons and could directly impact Israel's vulnerable civilian populations. The most fearful worst case narratives, of course, are those that would involve nuclear ordnance.

In anticipation, capable strategic and jurisprudential thinking are both required. Even during a potentially fleeting time that Israel remained the only regional nuclear power, an American war with Iran could still elicit Israeli nuclear deterrence threats and/or Israeli nuclear <a style="cursor: help" title="Nonetheless, the legal problem of reprisal as a permissible rationale for the use of force by states is identified and explained in the U.N. Declaration of Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States (1970). Additionally, a possible prohibition of reprisals is deducible from the broad regulation of force expressed in the UN Charter at Article 2(4); the obligation to settle disputes peacefully at Article 2(3); and the general limiting of permissible force (codified and customary) by states to necessary self-defense.">reprisals</a> for enemy-inflicted harms. For Israel, moreover, such threats or reprisals could be entirely <a style="cursor: help" title="In authoritative studies of world politics, rationality and irrationality have now taken on very precise meanings. In this regard, a state is presumed to be rational to the extent that its leadership always values national survival more highly than any other conceivable preference or combination of preferences. Conversely, an irrational state is one that would not always display such a markedly specific preference ordering. On expressly pragmatic or operational grounds, ascertaining whether a particular state adversary such as Iran would be rational or irrational could become a problematic and daunting task.">rational</a>.

How might such dissembling circumstances emerge, as a "bolt-from-the-blue" spasm of violence, or in less blatant stages, that is, in difficult to fathom increments of harm? Most credibly, perhaps, a "collateral war" would come to Israel as a catastrophic fait accompli, a multi-pronged belligerency wherein even the most comprehensive security preparations in Jerusalem/Tel-Aviv could suddenly prove inadequate. What could happen next, both operationally and legally?

The only meaningful answer to such inherently problematic queries must be candid affirmations of strategic unpredictability. In science and mathematics, accurate statements of probability must be drawn systematically from the discernible frequency of relevant past events. Significantly, however, in those increasingly dense <a style="cursor: help" title="'Everything is very simple in war, but the simplest thing is difficult.' says Clausewitz, in his classical discussion of 'friction' in On War. Herein, this concept refers to the unpredictable effects of errors in knowledge and information concerning intra-Israel (IDF/MOD) strategic uncertainties; on Israeli and Iranian under-estimations or over-estimations of relative power position; and on the unalterably vast and largely irremediable differences between theories of deterrence, and enemy intent 'as it actually is.'">strategic matters</a> currently before America and Israel, there are no relevant past events.

<em>None at all</em>.

Strategically, there is more to ponder. For the moment, at least, Donald Trump has favored no tangible military doctrine. Accordingly, once confronted with a "no doctrine" war launched against Iran by this American president, whether as a defensive first-strike or as a retaliation (both could conceivably be lawful), Israel's senior strategists would need to fashion their own corresponding doctrines ex nihilo.

How precisely should Jerusalem/Tel Aviv most accurately anticipate Iranian or Iranian-surrogate attacks on Israeli targets? As an antecedent question, how should these decision-makers and planners best identify which of these vulnerable targets would be judged presumptively "high value"? At some point, such an Intelligence Community/Ministry of Defense (MOD) operational challenge could even include the small defending country's Dimona nuclear reactor.

Israel is less than half of the size of America's Lake Michigan.

<em>Literally</em>.

In both 1991 and 2014, the ultrasensitive facility at Dimona had already come under rocket and missile attack from deliberate Iraqi and Hamas aggressions respectively.

In any upcoming war with the United States, Tehran would likely (but incorrectly) regard direct attacks upon selected Israeli targets as proper "retaliations" for American strikes - whether these strikes were an initial move of war against the Islamic Republic and its surrogates or a more-or-less foreseeable response to Iranian first strikes. Here, too, Iranian forces could potentially gain operational access to hypersonic rockets or missiles. Should this access be obtained, Israel's critical capacity to shoot down hypersonic glide vehicles (HGVs) and/or hypersonic cruise missiles (HCMs) might subsequently prove inadequate.

What would happen next? Plausibly, any considerations of law and justice would only be anterior to national considerations of victory and survival.

In essence, when the pertinent options are examined dialectically, as they should be, it could be to Tehran's perceived advantage to ostentatiously drag Israel into any US or Iran-initiated war. Striking the US homeland itself would prove vastly more difficult for Iran, and also more likely to elicit variously intolerable reprisals. Clearly, a Trump-initiated war against Iran would strengthen Saudi military power specifically and Sunni Arab military power in general. While such an expected strengthening might now seem less worrisome to Israel than expanding Iranian militarization, this delicate strategic calculus could change very quickly.

In this case, Israeli planners would need to investigate a number of previously disregarded military options against specific Sunni Arab adversaries, including pertinent legal questions of both jus ad bellum and jus in bello.

Should the Trump-led American military find itself in a two-front or multi-front war - a complex conflict wherein American forces were battling in Asia (North Korea) and the Middle East simultaneously - Israel could unexpectedly find itself fighting on its own. For such an exceptionally complicating scenario to be suitably appreciated, Israeli strategists would first need to bear in mind that the "whole" of any deterioration caused by multi-front engagements could effectively exceed the <a href="https://harvardnsj.org/2015/06/core-synergies-in-israels-strategic-planning-when-the-adversarial-whole-is-greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts/">sum of constituent "parts."</a>

This means, among other things, that Israeli strategists and planners will need to remain aptly and persistently sensitive to all conceivable synergies. In this connection, it goes without saying that the Trump administration is unaccustomed to such challenging intellectual calculations. Somehow, for these planners in Washington, complex strategic decision-making can best be extrapolated from the commerce-driven worlds of real-estate bargaining and casino gambling.

It would be far better for Washington and Jerusalem to recall the timeless insights of Carl von Clausewitz. For the author of On War, the determining standard of reasonableness in any military contest must always lie in its presumed political outcomes. For a state to get caught up in war - any war - without any clear political expectations is a mistake, always, or prima facie.

For more years than we may care to recollect, futile American wars have been underway in Iraq and Afghanistan. In time, for both Iraqis and Afghans, once-hoped-for oases of regional stability will regress to what seventeenth-century English philosopher Thomas Hobbes would have called a <a style="cursor: help" title="Apropos of Hobbes' argument that the state of nature is worse among individuals than among states, the philosopher Spinoza suggested that '...a commonwealth can guard itself against being subjugated by another, as a man in the state of nature cannot do.' ">"war of all against all."</a> At best, what eventually unravels in these severely fractured countries will be no worse than if these wars had never even been fought.

This will not be a desired political outcome.

Shouldn't we now inquire, accordingly: Shall Americans sacrifice so much blood and treasure merely to bring about a status quo ante bellum?

Over the years, with the now obvious exception of <a style="cursor: help" title="Here it also ought to be recalled that North Korea had once helped Syria build a nuclear reactor, the same facility that was later destroyed by Israel in its Operation Orchard, on September 6, 2007. Although, unlike earlier Operation Opera (June 7, 1981) this preemptive attack, in the Deir ez-Zor region, was presumptively a second expression of the so-called 'Begin Doctrine.' It also illustrated, because of the North Korea-Syria connection, a wider global threat to Israel in particular.">North Korea</a>, America's principal doctrinal enemy has changed, dramatically, from "communism" to "Islamism" or "Jihadism." This time, however, the ideological adversary is palpable, real and not merely presumptive. This time, also, it is a formidable and finely-textured foe, one that requires serious analytic study, not ad hoc responses or seat-of-the-pants presidential eruptions. At times, to be sure, real or contrived bellicosity can helpfully serve American national security policy objectives, but not where it is wholly detached from any previously-constructed theoretical <a style="cursor: help" title="At the same time, we cannot be allowed to forget that theoretical fruitfulness must be achieved at some more-or-less tangible cost of 'dehumanization.' As Goethe reminds us in Urfaust, the original Faust fragment: 'All theory, dear friend, is grey, And the golden tree of life is green.' Translated here by the author, from the German: 'Grau, theurer Freund, ist alle Theorie, Und grun des Lebens goldner Baum.' ">foundations</a>.

There is more. The Jihadist enemy of Israel and America remains a foe that can never be fully defeated, at least not in any tangibly final sense. To wit, this determined enemy will not be <a style="cursor: help" title="Under international law, terrorist movements (of which Jihadist groups are a current manifestation) are always Hostes humani generis, or 'Common enemies of mankind.'">immobilized</a> on any of the more usual or traditional military battlefields.

<em>Never</em>.

If at some point a particular Jihadist adversary has seemingly been vanquished by US military forces in one country or another, it will likely re-group and reappear elsewhere. After Iraq, after Afghanistan, even after Syria (which now winds down with US and Russian support of a genocidal regime that has been historically hostile to Israel), America will face resurgent adversaries in hard-to-manage and geographically far-flung places. These locales include Sudan, Mali, Nigeria, Yemen, Somalia, Egypt, and perhaps even Bangladesh or (in the future) <a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2017/07/louis-beres-palestine-fiction/">"Palestine."</a>

Daily, in the Middle East, an American president and his National Security Advisor are sounding alarm bells over Iran - and this after the United States, not Iran, withdrew from an international legal agreement that was less than perfect, but (reasonably) better than <a style="cursor: help" title="International law remains in essence a 'vigilante' system, sometimes also called a 'Westphalian' system. Such history-based reference is to the Peace Of Westphalia (1648), which concluded the Thirty Years War and created the now still-existing self-help 'state system.'">nothing at all</a>.

When all these intersecting factors are taken into suitable intellectual account, there remains a residual argument (one that might quickly be anticipated in Israel) that a US generated war with Iran would de facto amount to an anti-nuclear <a style="cursor: help" title="Such a 'life-saving' preemption option could be entirely permissible under international law. Known jurisprudentially as anticipatory self-defense, this potentially lawful option can be found not in conventional law (art. 51 of the UN Charter supports only post-attack expressions of individual or collective self-defense), but in customary international law. The most precise origins of anticipatory self-defense in customary law lie in the Caroline, a case that concerned the unsuccessful rebellion of 1837 in Upper Canada against British rule. Following this case, the serious threat of armed attack has generally justified certain militarily defensive actions. In an exchange of diplomatic notes between the governments of the United States and Great Britain, then U.S. Secretary of State Daniel Webster outlined a framework for self-defense that did not require an antecedent attack. Here, the jurisprudential framework permitted a military response to a threat so long as the danger posed was 'instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation.'">preemption</a> or to some similarly purposeful act of <a href="http://www.acpr.org.il/ENGLISH-NATIV/03-ISSUE/daniel-3.htm">"anticipatory self-defense."</a> Here, and with little reasonable doubt, the American war would be widely regarded as "cost-effective" or <a style="cursor: help" title="Historically, preemption has figured importantly in Israeli strategic calculations. This became most glaringly apparent in the wars of 1956 and 1967, and in the destruction of the Iraqi nuclear reactor in 1981. It was essentially the failure to preempt in October 1973 that contributed to heavy Israeli losses on the Egyptian and Syrian fronts during the Yom Kippur War, and almost brought about an Israeli defeat. Back during January, May, and October 2013, Israel, understandably apprehensive about Damascus' supply of military materials to Syria's Hezbollah surrogates in Lebanon, preemptively struck selected hard targets within Syria.">"net gainful"</a> in Jerusalem/Tel Aviv. This visceral assessment, however, could become more a matter of what Sigmund Freud called "wish fulfillment" than of any serious strategic assessment of risks and benefits.

Plausibly, there could be only a tiny likelihood that American bombs and missiles would be adequately targeted on widely multiplied/hardened/dispersed Iranian nuclear infrastructures.

In reality, at least at present, a US war against Iran would be contrary to Israel's core national security interests and obligations. Glib reassurances to the contrary from Jerusalem or Tel Aviv or Washington (or from both capitals) could be prospectively lethal for Israel. Though assuredly genuine, the threat from Iran should never be taken as an opportunity for simplifying political rhetoric. Instead, this threat should be assessed and calibrated <a style="cursor: help" title="The term 'dialectic' originates from the Greek expression for the art of conversation. A common contemporary meaning is method of seeking truth by correct reasoning. From the standpoint of shaping Israel's strategy vis-à-vis Iran, the following operations could be regarded as essential but nonexclusive components: (1) a method of refutation conducted by examining logical consequences; (2) a method of division or repeated logical analysis of genera into species; (3) logical reasoning using premises that are probable or generally accepted; (4) formal logic; and (5) the logical development of thought through thesis and antithesis to fruitful synthesis of these opposites.">dialectically</a>, as reliably as possible according to normally verifiable standards of enemy force posture <a style="cursor: help" title="The de facto condition of Hobbesian anarchy within which Israel must make its pertinent assessments and calibrations stands in stark contrast to the legal assumption of solidarity between states. In essence, this idealized assumption concerns a presumptively common struggle against both aggression and terrorism. Such a 'peremptory' expectation, known formally in law as a jus cogens assumption, was already mentioned in Justinian, Corpus Juris Civilis (533 CE)">estimations</a>.

If, at any point during crisis bargaining between Iran, Hezbollah, Israel and the United States, one side or the other should place too great a value on achieving <a href="https://www.israeldefense.co.il/en/node/28931">"escalation dominance"</a> and too little on parallel considerations of national safety, the expanding conflict could quickly turn "out of control." Such consequential deterioration would be especially or even uniquely worrisome if Israel threatened or actually launched some of its presumptive nuclear forces. This is the case, moreover, irrespective of any promised strategic support for Israel from the United States.

In sum, if Israel should look to the United States for seamlessly capable geo-strategic leadership, it would be taking very great and genuinely unprecedented national security risks. At a minimum, Israel has the incontestable right (and also the obligation to its own citizens) to expect fully decipherable expressions of US military doctrine. Going forward, unless it should insist more firmly upon maintaining this critical right, Israel could sometime have to face starkly injurious security outcomes. Here, the prospect of a fully-sovereign <a style="cursor: help" title="Some supporters of a Palestinian state argue that its prospective harms to Israel could be reduced or even eliminated by ensuring that new Arab state's immediate 'demilitarization.' ">Palestinian state</a> would need to be taken as a potentially important "intervening variable."

Every state's first responsibility is to assure and maintain citizen protection, and citizen allegiance is therefore contingent upon such valid assurances. Most famously in pertinent political theory is the classic statement of seventeenth-century Englishman Thomas Hobbes, at Chapter XXI of his Leviathan: "The obligation of subjects to the sovereign is understood to last so long, and no longer, than the power lasteth, by which he is able to protect them. Later, Thomas Jefferson, third president of the United States, described this obligation as binding upon all the nations. Writing his Opinion on the French Treaties (April 28, 1793), Jefferson opined: "The nation itself, bound necessarily to whatever it's preservation and safety require, cannot enter into engagements contrary to its indispensable obligations."

There is more. In law, every state has an enduring obligation to oppose and (if necessary) suitably punish aggression. Indeed, punishment of aggression is a longstanding peremptory expectation of international criminal law. The foundational principle of Nullum Crimen sine poena, "No crime without a punishment," has its origins in the <a href="http://www.g2rp.com/pdfs/LawCollectionsFromMesopotemiaAndAsiaMinor.pdf">Code of Hammurabi (c. 1728 - 1686 B.C.E.); the Laws of Eshnunna (c. 2000 B.C.E.); the even earlier Code of Ur-Nammu (c. 2100 B.C.E.)</a> and the law of exact retaliation, or Lex Talionis, which is presented in three separate passages of the Jewish Torah.

For Israel, a uniformly continuous concern with certain basic jurisprudential principles could advance its legal as well as strategic objectives, most plainly those that William Blackstone had identified in his Commentaries on the Law of England (Book 4 "Of Public Wrongs"): "Each state is expected, perpetually," noted Blackstone, "to aid and enforce the law of nations, as part of the common law, by inflicting an adequate punishment upon the offenses against that universal law."

Such ideas did not arise in a theoretic or intellectual vacuum. Moreover, Blackstone is ultimately indebted to Cicero's antecedent description of natural law in The Republic: "True law is right reason, harmonious with nature, diffused among all, constant, eternal; a law which calls to duty by its commands and restrains from evil by its prohibitions...." Natural law lies at the very heart of United States Constitutional law, and all that is derived therefrom.

As for "just wars" pertaining to both jus ad bellum and jus in bello criteria, Hugo Grotius wrote that they "arise from our love of the innocent." Though it is most unlikely that such legal high-mindedness could ever factor into US President Donald Trump's possible decision to encourage or initiate war against Iran, it remains a promising standard for Israel to bear closely in mind. This will prove especially good advice if American military actions against Iran should sometime prod the Islamic Republic to "retaliate" against Israel.

		<title>The Yazidi Massacre Five Years On-The Shadow of an Atrocity</title>
		<link>https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2019/08/david-crane-yazidi-massacre/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>

This past Saturday was the Fifth Anniversary of the latest Yazidi genocide perpetrated largely by ISIS, as other actors in the region looked the other way. Today Yazidis in the region remain in limbo. As Nadia Murad, Nobel Peace Laureate, stated last Friday: The situation remains dire. Presently there are approximately 350,000 internally displaced Yazidis in the Northern region of Iraq, mostly living in squalor in IDP camps with little of the basic human necessities. Only 80,000 have returned. Unless the Yazidis can return to their ancient homeland and make a life for themselves, ISIS’s program of genocide will be a success.

Throughout history the Yazidi people have tried to maintain a life in and around the Mt. Sinjar region in Northern Iraq. Throughout history, various groups have nipped at their heels for not being “people of the book”. The Yazidi practice a religion of pre-Islamic Assyrian traditions, Sufi and Shiite Islam, Nestorian Christianity, and Zoroastrianism. To the other peoples in the region, they have never fit in. For centuries they have been hounded and several attempts to exterminate them have been tried.

Though we live in a Global Village, cultural genocide still lingers in the dark shadows even in the 21st century. After an age of accountability, which I helped found, how could a belief of destroying a peoples in whole or in part still be a viable policy anywhere in the world? As an age of accountability slips away into the corners, with the rise of a dangerous nationalism/populism, the question posed above becomes harder to answer. The once leader in international accountability, America, has gone rouge, stepping away from its leadership role in basic human rights. It has enabled strongmen from around the world to thrive on a narrow ethnocentrism that allows for another attempted Yazidi genocide and a consequent lack of accountability as has been the case throughout history.

Though there is an awareness by the United Nations of this genocide and a review currently ongoing of those facts, little will be done as there is no appetite by a majority of the UN Security Council, led by countries who have strongmen as leaders, the United States, China, and Russia. <em>Leaders who are silent and do nothing are as guilty and do worse than those who commit these horrific attacks. -George Stamatis</em>

We are in a very precarious point in history, where the past seventy-five years of the United Nations paradigm is threatened and already ignored. In an age of the strongman where it seems “anything goes” at the diplomatic level, where new “truths” nibble away at international peace and security, where the Rule of Law is ignored or shaped to justify crimes, the cry of the Yazidi people echoes back and forth in the valley of the shadow of death. The Yazidi genocide that took place five years ago is an open and Festering Wound, like the unaccounted for Armenian genocide over a century ago, that will never heal without the cleansing waters of accountability. At a minimum let’s pause and reflect, are we not better than all this?
<blockquote>
<div><em>I WILL FOLLOW ANYONE...</em><em>AND BEG EVERYONE...</em></div>
<div><em>TO BE A HERO...</em></div>
<div><em>AND SAVE THE YAZIDI NATION</em></div>
<div>                                           -Widad Akrawi, Yazidi Activist</div></blockquote>
<em>David M. Crane was the Founding Chief Prosecutor, International War Crimes Tribunal in West Africa, called the Special Court for Sierra Leone; Founder of the Syrian and Yemeni Accountability Projects; Principal, Justice Consultancy, LLC; and a Distinguished Scholar in Residence, Syracuse University College of Law. His book about that time, Every Living Thing, will be published next month.</em>

		<title>India Complicated the Kashmir Dispute</title>
		<link>https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2019/08/l-ali-khan-india-kashmir-dispute/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the first week of August 2019, the <a href="http://newsonair.nic.in/Main-News-Details.aspx?id=369702">Indian Parliament passed</a>, and the President signed legislation to remove Articles 370 and 35A of the <a href="https://www.india.gov.in/sites/upload_files/npi/files/coi_part_full.pdf">India Constitution</a>. Article 370 preserves the autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir (J&amp;K), a princely state that has been forcibly divided up between India and Pakistan. Article 35A empowers the J&amp;K State to determine its permanent residents.

The constitutionality of the legislation revoking Articles 370 and 35A has been <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/national-conference-moves-supreme-court-challenging-presidential-order-on-article-370-1579444-2019-08-10">challenged</a> in the India Supreme Court.

By revoking Articles 370 and 35A, India has seemingly abandoned the notion of J&amp;K state as a special territory deserving autonomy. However, as discussed below, the revocation complicates matters more than it resolves. The revocation does little to lawfully change the autonomy of the State or alter the territorial dispute between India and Pakistan. Unfortunately, the revocation will foment domestic unrest and possibly an armed conflict between nuclear rivals, India and Pakistan.
<h3>The Kashmir Dispute</h3>
The <a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/08/The-Kashmir-Dispute-A-Plan-for-Regional-Cooperation.pdf">Kashmir dispute</a> surfaced soon after the 1947 partition of British India when the Hindu ruler of the J&amp;K princely state acceded to India without consent of the predominantly Muslim population. Within a year of the partition, Pakistani tribesmen invaded and captured a substantial portion of the J&amp;K state, which remains under their control.

At India’s behest in 1948 the U.N. Security Council, acting under <a href="https://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-vi/index.html">Chapter VI</a> of the UN Charter, passed a <a href="https://undocs.org/S/RES/47(1948)">resolution</a> proposing several measures, including “the withdrawal of tribesmen,” and the holding of “a free and impartial plebiscite” for determining “the question of the accession.”

Pakistan declined to give up its portion of the J&amp;K state.  India declined to hold a plebiscite. Since then, the J&amp;K state has remained divided between India and Pakistan.

In 1952, in view of the deadlock between India and Pakistan, India turned inward and entered into an agreement with the J&amp;K state, known as the <a href="https://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/states/jandk/documents/papers/delhi_agreement_1952.htm">Delhi Agreement</a><span>. The Agreement </span>reaffirms “that sovereignty in all matters other than those specified in the <a href="http://jklaw.nic.in/instrument_of_accession_of_jammu_and_kashmir_state.pdf">Instrument of Accession</a> continues to reside in the State.”  The Agreement also recognizes the State’s authority to define the rights and privileges for its permanent residents.

In order to give effect to the Delhi Agreement, Articles 370 and 35A were enacted and placed in the India Constitution. This constitutional enactment brought peace between India and the J&amp;K state.

Internationally, however, India and Pakistan continued to claim the entire J&amp;K state but made little headway to resolve the dispute. Under the 1972 <a href="http://people.unica.it/annamariabaldussi/files/2015/04/Simla-Agreement-July-2-1972.pdf">Simla Agreement</a>, India and Pakistan made a commitment to resolve the Kashmir dispute through bilateral negotiations.

In addition to the accession duality, a third option has also developed, which argues for the sovereign independence of the J&amp;K state, free from both India and Pakistan.

Far from offering a solution, the revocation of Articles 370 and 35A deepens the conflict even further since the Muslims of Kashmir, and the radicalized youth will protest the denial of autonomy. Pakistan will come under its own domestic pressure to “do something” while the Indian troops <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/10/world/asia/kashmir-india-pakistan.html">mistreat</a> the people of Kashmir.
<h3>The J&amp;K Constitution</h3>
The question remains whether the revocation of Articles 370 and 35A can lawfully change the autonomy of the State of Jammu and Kashmir (the “State”). In 1956, the J&amp;K Constituent Assembly drafted a <a href="http://jklaw.nic.in/the_constitution_of_jammu_and_kashmir_1956.pdf">constitution</a> for the State, reaffirming its own special status in the Union of India. The State constitution has incorporated the provisions of Articles 370 and 35A to preserve its own autonomy.

Part III (Sections 6-10) of the constitution lays out the qualifications, rights, and privileges of the “permanent residents” of the State. The residence provisions preserve the J&amp;K demographics and prevent the influx of people from other parts of India. They also limit who may lawfully vote in local elections, and own property.

The J&amp;K constitution empowers the legislature to redefine and regulate permanent residents. However, any change in the definition, rights, and privileges of the permanent residents requires “not less than two-thirds” of the “total membership” of each House of the State’s bicameral legislature.

Given that the people of the State do not support the revocation of Articles 370 and 35A, and given the local resistance to Indian troops, it is unlikely that the State legislature would expand the definition of permanent residents to permit immigrants from other parts of India. The “two-thirds” requirement poses a stiff barrier to any alteration of Part III of the State constitution.

This raises the question of whether the federal parliament can revoke the State constitution. However, there appears to be no such authority available under the Indian Constitution.

Furthermore, the territorial dispute between India and Pakistan over the J&amp;K State has also been enshrined in the State constitution. Section 3 proclaims that the State of Jammu and Kashmir “is and shall be an integral part of the Union of India.” However, Section 4 defines the territory of the State as “all the territories which on the fifteenth day of August, 1947, were under the sovereignty or suzerainty of the Ruler of the State.“  Since a substantial portion of the pre-1947 State is now under the control of Pakistan, the territorial dispute between India and Pakistan remains a lingering question under the State constitution.
<h3>Special Status</h3>
The India Constitution recognizes the special status of several states within the Union. In addition to the J&amp;K state, for example, Article 371A recognizes the “religious and social practices of the Nagas,” and protects the State of Nagaland’s “land and its resources” from the reach of federal legislation. Article 371G offers similar protections to the State of Mizoram.

As noted above, Articles 370 and 35A limit the power of the federal legislature to make laws for the J&amp;K state. The federal legislature can make laws only with respect “to matters specified in the <a href="http://jklaw.nic.in/instrument_of_accession_of_jammu_and_kashmir_state.pdf">Instrument of Accession</a>,” such as defense, external affairs, and communications (posts and telephones, etc.). On other matters, the Instrument of Accession retains the sovereignty of the State. This limit on federal powers forges the special status of the State.

Thus, Articles 370 and 35A are a federal commitment to safeguarding the terms of the Accession Instrument and the Delhi Agreement. By revoking these Articles, the federal government violates the terms of the Accession Instrument and the Delhi Agreement. The revocation takes away the sovereignty of the State that the Instrument and the Agreement confer on the State.

Furthermore, Section 147 of the J&amp;K constitution prohibits the State legislature from “changing the provisions of the constitution of India as applicable in relation to the State.”  Section 147 is a reference to Articles 370 and 35A, the only constitutional provisions of the India Constitution applicable to the State.

In view of the Accession Instrument and the Delhi Agreement, the India Supreme Court may rule that the federal government has no authority to revoke Articles 370 and 35A. The Court will most likely hold that the federal government cannot unilaterally amend or repeal any or all the provisions of the J&amp;K constitution, without the consent of the State legislature.
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
Domestically, the revocation of Articles 370 and 35A does not alter the J&amp;K autonomy protected under the Accession Instrument, the Delhi Agreement, and the State constitution. Internationally, the 1948 UN Security Council Resolutions and the 1972 Simla Agreement recognize the territorial dispute between India and Pakistan as an international dispute that cannot be unilaterally resolved but must be settled through a fair and impartial plebiscite or through some other bilateral agreement. Unfortunately, the heavily guarded border dividing the State, known as the line of control, continues to trigger skirmishes and threatens a possible all-out war with or without the use of nuclear weapons.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
Republic Act No. 11293, or the <a href="https://thecorpusjuris.com/legislative/republic-acts/ra-no-11293.php">Philippine Innovation Act</a>, was signed into law by the Philippine President on April 17, 2019.  However, the Act was <a href="https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1075147">released</a> to the public only on July 16, 2019.

The Philippine Innovation Act aims to promote a culture of strategic planning and innovation in the country through improving innovation governance and adopting long-term goals. The Act recognizes the richness of the country’s resources and culture and the ways these can be harnessed to further innovation and entrepreneurship. Among others, it seeks to explore, promote, and protect the potentials for innovation of traditional knowledge, traditional cultural expressions, and genetic resources.

Emphasis is placed on <strong>inclusive innovation. </strong> The Act seeks to promote the creation of new ideas that will be developed into new and quality products, processes, and services aimed at improving the welfare of low-income and marginalized groups. Women’s participation and skills development are also areas which the law aims to improve. The Act also provides for the advancement of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) through the development of a comprehensive support program which shall set forth strategies towards promoting MSME internationalization and participation in local and global value chains.

In order to effectively drive innovation across all areas of government policy and to achieve the innovation goals of the country, the Act has adopted a “<strong>whole of government approach</strong>” in order to facilitate coordination between and among different government agencies and between government and the private business sector.
<h4><strong>National Innovation Council (NIC)</strong></h4>
The Act established the National Innovation Council (NIC) which is tasked to develop innovation strategies as well as coordinate with various sectors and agencies pursuant to a whole-of-government approach. The NIC is also in charge of monitoring and assessing the country’s strategic innovation programs and of identifying agencies and local government units (LGUs) that will be tasked to implement specific strategies under a National Innovation Agenda and Strategy Document (NIASD). Most importantly, the NIC is responsible for the establishment and administration of so-called Innovation Funds that shall fund programs to be approved by the NIC.

The NIC shall have the President as Chairperson and the Director General of the <a href="http://www.neda.gov.ph/">National Economic and Development Authority</a> (NEDA) as Vice Chairperson. Secretaries of various government agencies will serve as members of the NIC. Aside from these officials, the President shall choose seven (7) executive members from the following sectors:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>MSME sector</strong> – at least one (1); recommended by a legally established and reputable business organization</li>
 	<li><strong>Business sector</strong> – at least one (1); recommended by a legally established and reputable business organization</li>
 	<li><strong>Academe and scientific community </strong>– at least seven (7) years of experience in the field of science and technology, research and development or innovation.</li>
</ul>
The Act requires that at least one (1) of the Executive Members shall be a woman. The NIC will be assisted by a Secretariat to be established within the NEDA.
<h4><strong>National Innovation Agenda and Strategy Document (NIASD)</strong></h4>
The National Innovation Agenda and Strategy Document (NIASD) shall serve as the framework for the implementation of the Act. It is meant to establish the country’s vision and long-term goals for innovation, provide a road map, and set forth the strategies for improving innovation governance. The Act mandates that the NIC identify strategies to stimulate regional capacity for development and take into consideration the competitive advantages and strengths of each province, region, and community. It is also required that the NIASD include innovation priority areas, and the strategies to be used to realize these priorities which shall have a ten (10)-year horizon at a minimum, subject to periodic review by the NIC. In identifying priority areas for innovation, issues and challenges in the following areas shall be considered:
<ul>
 	<li>Food security and sustainable agriculture;</li>
 	<li>Blue economy</li>
 	<li>Education and the academe</li>
 	<li>Health</li>
 	<li>Secure, clean and reliable energy;</li>
 	<li>Climate change and disaster resilience;</li>
 	<li>Resource efficiencies;</li>
 	<li>National and community-based comparative advantages in the context of global value chains;</li>
 	<li>Comparative strengths and advantages of sectors and communities;</li>
 	<li>Potentials for innovation of traditional knowledge, traditional cultural expressions, and genetic resources;</li>
 	<li>Infrastructure needs;</li>
 	<li>Governance;</li>
 	<li>Development of human capital;</li>
 	<li>Digital economy and</li>
 	<li>Transportation services</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Strategic Research, Development and Extension (RD &amp; E) Programs</strong></h4>
In order to attain a higher level of mission orientation in publicly funded research, the NIC is mandated to develop RD &amp; E themes as well as a “relevance criteria” which shall guide agencies in selecting programs and projects to be funded under the Innovation Fund. The Act aims to establish centers of research excellence and centers of collaborative research activity in order to further innovation in the country.
<h4><strong>Innovation Fund</strong></h4>
During the Act’s initial year of implementation, the NIC is provided with a revolving fund. This fund will be used in giving grants to qualified proposals for projects, as screened and approved by the NIC.
<h4><strong>Innovation Development Credit and Financing</strong></h4>
The Innovation Development Credit and Financing Program will serve as the loaning facility of the NIC for purposes of developing new technologies, product innovation, process innovation, organizational innovation, and marketing innovation. A <strong>credit quota </strong>has been established whereby all banking institutions are required to set aside at least four percent (4%) of their total loanable funds for innovation development credit.
<h4><strong>Removal of Barriers to Innovation</strong></h4>
The NIC and its member agencies are mandated to remove regulatory barriers to innovation and cut red tape, such as procurement rules and regulations, in order to boost innovation efforts. LGUs are encouraged to undertake reforms in their systems and processes such as reducing the number of days to process applications for and renewal of business licenses to three (3) working days. The processing of other government permits and clearances, and applications for patents, shall also be streamlined towards ensuring a business environment that fosters innovation.
<h4><strong>Implementing Rules and Regulation</strong></h4>
The NEDA, DTI and DOST are tasked to formulate and promulgate the Implementing Rules and Regulations and other issuances necessary to implement the statute within sixty (60) days from its effectivity.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The House Judiciary Committee has quietly announced--in a recent <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/FINAL%20PETITION.pdf" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/FINAL%2520PETITION.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1567779558943000&amp;usg=AFQjCNENMg-aMTdHDusoiRt91Gl-CyIthg">court filing</a> to obtain grand jury materials relating to the Mueller investigation--that it is “conducting an investigation to determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment” against Donald Trump.  While this is certainly a welcome development for those who care about the future of our constitutional democracy, there is no indication that the Judiciary Committee or House leadership is approaching this investigation with the commitment or urgency required by our current constitutional crisis and required to enable the House of Representatives to consider and vote on articles of impeachment before we are well into the 2020 election season.

In the effort to obtain grand jury materials, the Committee has apparently <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.209590/gov.uscourts.dcd.209590.5.0_3.pdf" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.209590/gov.uscourts.dcd.209590.5.0_3.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1567779558943000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEvttgDx_BUu_GlwwrtQyNgP16_Rg"><em>agreed</em></a><em> </em>to a two-month briefing schedule that guarantees there will not be a decision before October. Even if the Committee prevails, the Trump administration will likely be able to delay many more months with appeals.  And while the grand jury materials will presumably be interesting, the <a href="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2019/images/04/18/mueller-report-searchable.pdf">450-page Mueller Report</a> provides more than enough information to debate one or more articles of impeachment.

The Mueller Report describes a damning pattern of encouraging illegal foreign interference in the 2016 election, and then a coverup and obstruction scheme comprising at least ten separate instances of obstruction of justice. Trump’s ongoing obstruction and defiance of all congressional oversight investigations—including an apparent policy to fight every subpoena—is itself part of this pattern.

These are compelling topics for an impeachment inquiry, but the Committee should broaden its scope.  During the campaign and virtually every day since he took office, Trump has engaged in a smorgasbord of impeachable offenses that go well beyond the Mueller report.  Some of this conduct has already been established in separate judicial proceedings and much of it has occurred in public—from the president’s own mouth or <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Twitter feed.</a>

Quite apart from the Mueller report, Trump is an unindicted co-conspirator in <em>another </em>criminal effort to influence the 2016 election. Trump’s former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2018/11/former-trump-lawyer-michael-cohen-pleads-guilty-to-lying-to-congress/">pleaded guilty</a> to federal crimes for making illegal hush-money payments to influence the 2016 election. As Cohen told both a federal court and Congress, he made these illegal payments—for which he is currently serving time in federal prison—“in coordination with and at the direction of” Trump.  This conduct warrants impeachment not just to protect the country from further abuses during the remainder of Trump’s term, but to <em>protect the 2020 election</em>.  If Trump was willing to go to these criminal lengths to influence the 2016 election as a private citizen, <em>President</em> Trump, with vastly more power available to him, will do even worse. As George Mason <a href="https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_720.asp" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_720.asp&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1567779558943000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGZFIjZ627OuDaAZaf7fT1m9P6PYQ">asked</a> at the Constitutional Convention: “Shall the man who has practiced corruption and by that means procured his appointment in the first instance, be suffered to escape punishment, by repeating his guilt?”

If the hallmark of Trump’s campaign was criminal schemes to influence the election, his presidency has been marked by misuse of power for his own political, personal, and financial interests.  Since taking office, Trump has repeatedly pressured federal law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute political adversaries.  He has undermined the freedom of press by repeatedly demonizing critical reporting as “fake news” or the Stalinesque “enemy of the people,” while seeking or threatening to use the levers of government power (such as criminal punishment, merger review, and even postal rates) against critical media. In a unanimous <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-resolution/607/text" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-resolution/607/text&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1567779558943000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFlwdKIEvwW3KPW339kbTd8-EyBrw">resolution</a> passed last August, the U.S. Senate described Trump’s attacks on the press and stated that the Senate “condemns the attacks on the institution of the free press and <em>views efforts to systematically undermine the credibility of the press as an attack on the democratic institutions of the United States</em>.”  If attacking the democratic institutions of the United States is not grounds for impeachment, it is hard to imagine what might be.  Indeed, Congress has impeached three federal judges on charges <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/1974ImpeachmentInquiryReport.pdf#page=24" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/1974ImpeachmentInquiryReport.pdf%23page%3D24&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1567779558943000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGRxbowjdE6jJCBvWZotRcJZEhIEA">categorized</a> as “vindictive use of power,” and in 1974, the Judiciary Committee’s second <a href="https://watergate.info/impeachment/articles-of-impeachment" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://watergate.info/impeachment/articles-of-impeachment&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1567779558943000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEsdAKeKi5rka68OMwXALIXrBG7jQ">article of impeachment</a> against President Richard Nixon cited his “misuse of federal investigative agencies against political opponents."

Trump’s escalating efforts to foment racial hostility, hatred and violence, likewise violate his constitutional duty to ensure the laws are faithfully executed and violate principles of equal protection and other constitutional rights.  Trump is committing impeachable offenses when he urges government officials to violate the law, especially with violence; when he uses his position to sow racial hostility and encourage bigotry and violence; and when he enacts policies that have no constitutionally-legitimate justification but are rather motivated entirely by bigotry.  The reasons to impeach for this conduct are not just the risk of encroaching tyranny. In the <em>Federalist Papers</em>, Alexander Hamilton <a href="https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed65.asp" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed65.asp&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1567779558943000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEa9_GWyO9I80Ha_Oyo8c3eXkop7g">wrote</a> that impeachable offenses “relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.” Trump’s race-baiting—no less than his obstruction of justice—causes ongoing injury to American society. Social scientists have quantified the “<a href="https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/the_trump_effect.pdf" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/the_trump_effect.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1567779558943000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFCAwPyG0j-fj8Nhtg0H8m7aAgXXQ">Trump Effect</a>”: measurable increases in racial violence and hostility associated with Trump rhetoric. We are at the point in America where chanting the name of the president of the United States at an opposing high school basketball team is universally <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/trump-racial-jeers.html" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/trump-racial-jeers.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1567779558943000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEOJJTYSb1DaeDyPv75xZALDo3r_g">understood</a> as a racial taunt.

Yet another hallmark of the Trump presidency is his misuse of position for self-enrichment. It is a national embarrassment that, in plain sight and in violation of the constitutional emoluments clauses, for two and a half years Trump has continued to own (through the thinnest of veneers) companies that do extensive business with supplicants from foreign governments, state and local governments, and corporate lobbies. The Framers made clear that violation of the emoluments clauses was impeachable and Congress has impeached numerous federal officials for misuse of office for personal gain.

If the Democratic leadership in the House is serious about holding Trump accountable, as they promised they would after taking the majority, the Judiciary Committee needs to expand its investigation to include the full range of Trump’s impeachable offenses.  And it needs to act with a sense of urgency that matches their proclaimed outrage at Trump’s conduct. The Nixon impeachment inquiry took four months from the Watergate Special Prosecutor’s March 1974 release of materials to the Judiciary Committee to the July 1974 Committee vote on articles of impeachment. The Clinton impeachment inquiry took approximately three months from the September 1998 release of the Starr Report to the December 1998 Committee vote on articles of impeachment. It has already been more than three months since the Mueller Report was released; two more months is more than sufficient. The inquiry should continue through the August recess, the Committee should set an early October deadline for a final vote on whether to approve articles of impeachment to the full House, and the Committee should not permit obstruction or delay by the president or his allies to derail the schedule. The stakes are too high, and the hour is too late, for Congress to let Trump dictate the rules of his own impeachment.

		<title>9/11 Trials Will Shape Global Terrorism</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The 2021 trial of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the “architect of 9/11,” and the other accused will write an important page in the legal chapter of dealing with terrorism. What is not clear is if this page will solve issues, sustain them, or even create more. Ultimately, these trials will be essential not only for the U.S. and its war against terrorism but for counter-terrorism globally.

Courts should judge criminal terror attacks because they are the only responsible authority in civilized countries to decide upon the issues of guilt or innocence. People demand justice to be delivered, not only as recognition of the hurt endured but also to deter future terrorists from their deadly plans.

Mohammed and the others are accused of the World Trade Center attacks. The 9/11 terror operations changed the U.S. and the rest of the world.  Counter-terrorism measures <a href="https://www.hrw.org/topic/terrorism-counterterrorism">taken by many countries</a> have raised concerns regarding civil liberties and human rights. Discussions about torture (“enhanced interrogation methods”) made it evident that human rights are not a given. Anything can be accepted as necessary (hence considered and promoted as legal) by those who fear. And terrorism produces fear.

The trial will grapple with some purely legal issues. For instance, how fair can this trial be? After all, 18 years have passed since some of the crimes attributed to these defendants. Also, is it just they were incarcerated and underwent “enhanced interrogation methods” (which before 9/11, would most probably constitute torture)? It is not like there was a U.S. manhunt to arrest them, which is why the trial is taking place only after such a long period.

Whatever legal name we give to their detention, the accused were imprisoned and (it seems) tortured in Guantanamo. It should not be accepted that any state can hold people until it feels it has a case against them. No matter how serious the charges, holding the accused for such a long time without a trial is shameful.

Another legal issue the courts will face is determining if the court should accept the testimonies derived from the abusive treatment of the accused persons. Thus, the fairness of the trial is in question. The legal arguments behind why the testimonies should not be accepted range. From the presumption of innocence every defendant should enjoy (even those accused of the most horrible crimes), to the ethical and legal standards of the western legal civilization. Although it may be difficult to accept that every accused deserves rights, all trials ought to be carried out with all safeguards prescribed by the law.

Even those not concerned about protecting the human rights of these defendants should still care about security.  The Islamist extremist network can use these trials as propaganda, painting the defendants are martyrs. Any ill-treatment of the defendants or miscarriage of justice will be used to sustain Muslims’ collective trauma and sense of injustice. Islamists cultivate those feeling through their propaganda to create pools of recruits and sympathizers. Radicalization to extremist violence and terrorism is a process that feeds from conflict, trauma, and grievances (real or perceived). If this trial creates “martyrs,” then the fight against terror will undergo a communication defeat, regardless of if the trial convicts those behind the horrendous attacks.

We must also not forget that there is a new generation out there. Young people were not born when the World Trade or even the 9/11 attacks took place. The fear, the tragedy, the loss of lives, the pain, and the agony were narrated to them, but they have not lived it. So, these young people see just the response, the reaction of the system, and not what caused it. These young people are targeted by the Islamist extremist network to find new members and sympathizers. If they can use these trials to inflame the younger generations, it will just help their terror organizations survive and be ready to strike again.

The trial in question is not only a U.S. issue that will only affect Americans. Islamist terrorism threats are of international concern, and counter-terrorism is a global effort. So, these trials will not just stay in the U.S. These trials will affect the world. Some countries with lower security capacity to prevent and thwart terrorist attacks can be the next targets that the Islamists will choose to launch their revenge campaign. No solution is without problems and consequences. With such a delay in carrying out the trials, as well as the treatment of defendants, much of the damage has already been done.

It is hard to think of a way that everyone can be satisfied. On one side the victims and the world want to address terrorism legally, and on the other side, people fight for the principles of law and fear the repercussions of a trial that does not meet high legal standards. It is probably a lose-lose situation. At least we can learn for the future that successful counter-terrorism requires the delicate skills of a surgeon, not just the power of a bulldozer.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[According to recent reporting, “the European Court of Human Rights on Wednesday <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2019/09/ukraine-russia-directed-and-ran-military-coup-in-crimea/">heard</a> complaints from Ukraine about Russian involvement in the military coup and subsequent Russian annexation of Crimea. From Feburary 27, 2014, Russia has exercised control over the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. Ukraine alleges that there was a practice of killing Ukrainian military and officers of law enforcement along with civilians that was attributable to Russia.”

The norms established after the Second World War, based on the rule of law to ensure international peace and security are being challenged. International arrangements long established to ensure that aggression was minimized, such as the settlement of disagreements through diplomacy and not the use of force, have been ignored.

The drift from accountability to atrocity is apparent. Strongmen with a nationalistic world view look about and consider international order through a narrow regional lens that is myopic and dangerous to world order.

Not since the late 1920’s and early 1930’s has such world disorder been so prevalent. International organizations struggle to maintain relevance and respectability. World leaders stand by hapless as hatred and fear spill over borders, causing strife and discord.

The laws of armed conflict are ignored. Civilians become a military objective to instill terror and unsettle the populace. Women and children pay a particularly brutal price. War crimes are committed with impunity. Accountability is no longer a counter to the lawlessness.

Conflict is kaleidoscopic in nature where objectives and purpose are mixed into a boiling cauldron of pain and suffering. The beast of impunity nibbles on the edges of the conflict aided and abetted by nations and corporations profiting politically and financially in the misery they cause.

A case study in this kaleidoscopic world we now find ourselves in, is the annexation of the Crimea back into the Russian Federation. This annexation is similar to Hitler’s annexation of the Rhineland, the Sudetenland, and Austria in the 1930’s...naked aggression.

The United Nations and NATO chose not to go to war over this blatant assault on international peace and security as it was unable to in the United Nations case and unwilling in the NATO case. The world was not going to start World War III over a small peninsula in a far away land.

Regardless of the obfuscation, the legal basis of the annexation is just not there. No nation can seize territory from another nation. The international crime of aggression as promulgated in the Rome Statute which created our permanent criminal law system was designed to prevent such acts. Cynically Russia chose to ignore the law and act accordingly. Run by a dictator in all but name, President Putin knew he would not have to account for his actions.

Just like Hitler, Putin sensed a weakness and a malaise that he could exploit to Russia’s advantage. Other strongmen sat back and watched the result, licking their chops in admiration and expectation as to their next geopolitical moves.

The complaint recently lodged by the Ukrainian government over gross human right abuses after that annexation has strong merit and will undoubtedly find that the Russian government and its agents committed violations of regional and international law. Should this be so found, this ruling will give Europe and the world leverage politically to continue to put pressure on Putin through various sanctions and give Ukraine political, legal and moral standing to seek further redress.

It’s a world gone mad in this international circumstance of a weakened and distant United States, an irrelevant United Nations, and an addled NATO. Let the Crimea go into Russian hands permanently with the abuses that followed, and with little accountability, then we will wake up one morning with the Baltics seized. Appeasement never works in the face of aggression. Just ask the late former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Neville Chamberlain. There will never be peace in our time when aggressive acts go unsanctioned and accounted for.

		<title>The Public Charge Rule—How to Legislate Prejudice</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400">On August 12, 2019, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced a change to the interpretation of a statute known as the public charge rule. The statute under consideration, Section 212(a)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) states:</span>
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400">Any alien who, in the opinion of the consular officer at the time of application for a visa, or in the opinion of the Attorney General at the time of application for admission or adjustment of status, is likely at any time to become a public charge is inadmissible[…] In determining whether an alien is excludable under this paragraph, the consular officer or the Attorney General shall at a minimum consider the alien’s-(I) age;  (II) health; (III) family status; (IV) assets, resources, and financial status; and (V) education and skills . . .</span></blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400">Under </span><a href="https://www.uscis.gov/news/news-releases/uscis-announces-final-rule-enforcing-long-standing-public-charge-inadmissibility-law"><span style="font-weight: 400">the new rule</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, officers would consider the totality of the circumstances, weighing the positive and negative factors listed above, when determining whether an alien is likely to become a public charge. In announcing the new rule, Acting Director Cuccinelli stated, “[F]or over a century, the public charge ground of inadmissibility has been part of our nation’s immigration laws...Throughout our history, self-sufficiency has been a core tenet of the American dream.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">While Acting Director Cuccinelli is correct that a public charge ground has been on the books for over a century, he fails to mention that from 1776 to 1882 immigration to the United States was unrestricted at the federal level. More critically, he fails to recall the controversy of this clause from its inception. Now, as it was a century ago, the majority of Americans do not support highly restrictive immigration. President Wilson, citing America’s reputation as a land of opportunity and refuge, twice vetoed the bill that laid the foundation for the modern public charge rule. Congress had to override Wilson’s second veto for it to become law.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">It is no coincidence that the Trump administration and the nativist lawmakers of the early 20th century rely on this clause to target specific populations. The clause is inherently prejudiced. It requires the consular or immigration officer to prejudge the likelihood of a future event using a definition created by those seeking to exclude specific groups. The reason the Trump administration needs a new rule to strengthen enforcement of this clause is because over time legal challenges have limited the discretion available to consular and immigration officers, weakening enforcement. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The administration, seeking to further restrict legal immigration, relies on the model created by nativist lawmakers at the turn of the 20</span><span style="font-weight: 400">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> century. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400">1882 Immigration Act, authorized the inspection of migrants before ships could land in order to deny entry to “any convict, lunatic, idiot or any such person unable to take care of him or herself without becoming a public charge." For the first time, government officials would inspect immigrants to ensure they would not pose a long-term danger or burden to the United States. The initial version of the public charge rule was a response to the increasing political power of Irish immigrants, whom nativist politicians believed were changing American demographics for the worse. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In the aftermath of the First World War, restrictions tightened in an effort to prevent an influx of “undesirable Europeans”, specifically the Armenians, Jews, Persians and Russians displaced by war. The 1917 Immigration Act, restricted immigration for the first time by banning most immigration from a designated geographic zone and by creating categories of inadmissibility-- </span><span style="font-weight: 400">illiteracy, mental deficiency, physical deficiency, poverty, and certain political beliefs. The geographic restriction was explicitly designed to exclude Asians while the categories of inadmissibility targeted undesirable European populations. The following year a controversial Emergency War Measures Act mandated passports and visas for the first time in American history. This temporary war measure was made permanent with the 1924 law commonly referred to as the Quota Act, which made the likelihood to become a public charge a ground of inadmissibility. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The public charge clause is a very effective means of restricting targeted populations. In September 1930, President Hoover issued an order to American Consular Officers to stringently enforce the public charge clause and the impact was felt immediately. Public records show that in the two months after the order, the State Department only issued 22% and 15% of the immigration quota visas</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. In January 2018, the Trump administration revived this strategy by updating the Foreign Affairs Manual to widen the range of public benefits that consular officers can consider when determining whether visa applicants can be denied on the public charge ground.  </span>

<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/06/visa-denials-poor-mexicans-trump-1637094"><span style="font-weight: 400">Politico</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> reports preliminary data showing that 12,179 visa applicants were rejected on this ground in the first half of 2019. Comparatively, in the last fiscal year of Obama’s presidency, only 1,033 visa applications were denied on this ground. </span><a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/impact-dhs-public-charge-rule-immigration"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Migration Policy Institute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, analyzed US Census Bureau data and found that 69% of those admitted to legal permanent residence in the last five years had at least one negative factor. Unsurprisingly, given the administration’s rhetoric, immigrants from Mexico and Central America appear most vulnerable to these denials because 60%  had two or more negative factors and only 23% had the heavily weighted positive factor of median income of at least 250% of the Federal Poverty Level. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In a 1915 speech, President Wilson warned that limiting immigration through “arbitrary tests” would “reverse the policy of generations of Americans that have gone before.” The tests, according to Wilson, were tests of opportunity not of character. Wilson believed in America as the land of opportunity and argued that prior access to opportunity should not be a requirement for admission. For President Wilson, and most Americans, the US stands as a land of opportunity and refuge. As President Wilson rightly assessed,  “[T]he object of such provisions is restriction, not selection.” The public charge rule is legislated prejudice and, as history shows, it is sure to be challenged in the courts but until then damage will be done, just as it was a century ago. </span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[US President Donald Trump's expanding crises with both North Korea and Iran, and his apparent willingness to withdraw from a second <a href="https://www.armscontrol.org/print/2556">US-Russia nuclear arms control treaty</a>, are just some currently prominent examples of a longer standing problem with world politics and international law. This problem is the continuing US inclination to base American national security policies on the conspicuously failed dynamics of <em>Realpolitik </em>or power politics. To suitably overcome this core problem - a legal and strategic quandary common to all nations in the Westphalian "state of nature" since the end of the Thirty Years War in 1648 - the United States will finally need to understand what Roman Stoic Emperor Marcus Aurelius had earlier recognized in his <em>Meditations</em>: "What does not benefit the entire <em>hive </em>(here, world legal order) is no benefit to the <em>bee</em>" (here, the United States, representing the individual nation state).

Since the landmark <a href="https://avalon.law.yale.edu/17th_century/westphal.asp">Peace of Westphalia</a> in 1648, world politics and law have been shaped by sovereignty-centered belligerence, or <a style="cursor: help" title="This condition of Westphalian chaos stands in contrast to the legal assumption of solidarity between states. This customary assumption concerns a presumptively common struggle against aggression and terrorism. Such a 'peremptory' expectation, known in formal jurisprudence as a jus cogens assumption, was already mentioned in Justinian, Corpus Juris Civilis (533 CE); Hugo Grotius, 2 De Jure Belli ac Pacis Libri Tres, Ch. 20 (Francis W. Kesey., tr, Clarendon Press, 1925)(1690); and Emmerich de Vattel, 1 Le Droit Des Gens, Ch. 19 (1758).">chaos</a>. Over time, especially as the technologies of global destruction become more widespread and refined, this seventeenth-century system of competitive nationalism can never properly endure. Inevitably, like a face drawn in sand at the edge of a sea, it will be <a style="cursor: help" title="One may think here of the prescient warning by the High Lama in James Hilton's Lost Horizon: 'The storm...this storm that you talk of....It will be such a one, my son, as the world has not seen before. There will be no safety by arms, no help from authority, no answer in science. It will rage until every flower of culture is trampled, and all human things are leveled in a vast chaos....The Dark Ages that are to come will cover the whole world is a single pall; there will be neither escape nor sanctuary.'">erased</a>.

What next? It's not merely a difficult question; it is the single most bewildering and meaningful legal query of all. To begin, world leaders will need to plan rationally and self-consciously for nothing less consequential than global survival. Inter alia, this will mean an altogether new willingness to realign narrow judgments of national self-interest with the much wider legal interests of humankind.

Although this requirement will at first appear <a style="cursor: help" title="'The visionary,' says the Italian film director Federico Fellini, 'is the only realist.'">unrealistic</a>, nothing could be less pragmatic than simply remaining on the present global <a style="cursor: help" title="The reader may be usefully reminded here of Irish playwright Samuel Beckett's observation in Endgame: 'What is the good of passing from one untenable position to another, of seeking justification always on the same plane?'">collision course</a>.

In essence, if left unchanged "or merely "modified" by the usual kinds of token reform, world politics will experience more frequent and eventually catastrophic breakdowns. To argue otherwise, or even more foolhardy, to call for some further hardening of world tribal conflict - as is precisely the case with Donald Trump's plans for "America First" - would be to reject everything we have already learned about jurisprudence, civilization, and species survival.

<em>Absolutely everything.</em>

Fundamentally, it's not complicated. Unless we finally take tangible steps to implement an organic and cooperative planetary civilization - one based on the irremediably central truth of human "oneness" - there will be no civilization at all. To reject this conclusion would require plausible expectations of some already-ongoing evolution toward worldwide peace and denuclearization. Right now, of course, any such patently optimistic expectations would be out of the question.

The imperative nature of this assessment is clarified by our species' manifest advances in creating mega-weapons and infrastructures. Augmenting these fearful examples of "progress," major states are becoming increasingly committed to deterrent strategies of <a style="cursor: help" title="The most evident example of this dangerous posture is Pakistan (vis-à-vis India). Neither nuclear weapons state is a party to the 1970 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, or NPT.">nuclear war fighting</a>, cyber-warfare and/or "internet mercenaries." To a considerable extent, moreover, the steady spread of internet warfare surrogates is being undertaken on behalf of plainly authoritarian regimes.

Jurisprudentially, let us be candid, we are still at the beginning. Until now, in such primal matters, we humans have consistently managed to miss what is most important. Nonetheless, the central truth is as follows: <em>There is a latent but determinative "oneness" to all world politics. </em>

There is more. This critical dimension of human identity can be encountered in certain vital (but generally-ignored) literature, among such philosophic giants as Sören Kierkegaard, <a style="cursor: help" title="In this connection, noted Sigmund Freud: 'Wars will only be prevented with certainty if mankind unites in setting up a central authority to which the right of giving judgment upon all shall be handed over. There are clearly two separate requirements involved in this: the creation of a supreme agency and its endowment with the necessary power. One without the other would be useless.' (See: Sigmund Freud, Collected Papers, cited in Louis René Beres, The Management of World Power: A Theoretical Analysis, University of Denver, Monograph Series in World Affairs, Vol. 10 (1973-73), p, 27.) Interestingly, Albert Einstein held very similar views. See, for example: Otto Nathan et al. eds., Einstein on Peace (New York: Schoken Books, 1960).">Sigmund Freud</a>, Hermann Hesse, Carl Jung, Jose Ortega y' Gasset, Miguel de Unamuno and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. Its persistent rejection in "real life," even by the world's allegedly great universities and law schools, reflects an elemental threat to every nation-state's literal survival.

Antecedent questions should now arise. Why have we <em>made ourselves</em> existentially vulnerable? The lucid or correct answer must reveal a continuous worldwide willingness to seek personal identity in assorted <em>memberships</em>.

We humans generally fear solitude or "aloneness" more than anything else on earth, sometimes even more than death. Accordingly, amid the palpably growing chaos that is already stampeding across continents, we humans willingly abide a law-based loyalty to the primal claims of "tribe." Always, everywhere, and irrespective of various peremptory expectations of law, individuals desperate "to belong" more-or-less enthusiastically subordinate themselves to expectations of nation, class or faith.

More often than we might at first care to admit, such subordination carries with it an overriding acceptance of "martyrdom." Recalling the marooned English schoolboys in William Golding's <em>Lord of the Flies</em>, we are reminded here among other things that the veneer of human law and civilization is razor thin. Vastly impressive scientific and medical discoveries aside, whole swaths of humankind remain fiercely dedicated to the conspicuously ancient practices of "sacrifice."

In the end, such atavistic dedication lies at the very heart of both war and <a style="cursor: help" title="Under international law, terrorist movements are always Hostes humani generis, or 'Common enemies of mankind.' See: Research in International Law: Draft Convention on Jurisdiction with Respect to Crime, 29 AM J. INT'L L. (Supp 1935) 435, 566 (quoting King v. Marsh (1615), 3 Bulstr. 27, 81 Eng. Rep 23 (1615)('a pirate est Hostes humani generis')).">terrorism</a>.

Still, we remain determinedly irrational as a species? Why? The best answer lies in our shortsighted views of "realism." In the light of history, of course, these views are strange or incomprehensible. Not until the twentieth century, after all, did <a style="cursor: help" title="Under international law, the idea of a universal obligation to global solidarity is contained, inter alia, within the core principle of jus cogens or peremptory norms. In the language of pertinent Article 53 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969: 'A peremptory norm of general international law....is a norm accepted and recognized by the international community of States as a whole, as a norm from which no derogation is permitted, and which can be modified only by a subsequent norm of general international law having the same character.'">international law</a> even bother to criminalize <a style="cursor: help" title="For the crime of aggression under international law, see: Resolution on the Definition of Aggression, adopted by the UN General Assembly, Dec. 14, 1974. U.N.G.A. Res. 3314 (XXIX), 29 UN GAOR, Supp (No. 31), 142, UN Doc A/9631 (1975) reprinted in 13 I.L.M., 710 (1974).">aggressive war</a>.

Hope exists, we must naturally assume, but now it must sing more softly, with circumspection, inconspicuously, almost <em>sotto voce</em>. Although counter-intuitive, especially in the United States, the time for celebrating science, modernization, globalization and gleaming new information technologies is partially over. To survive, together, on this imperiled planet, all of us must sincerely seek to rediscover an individual life that is detached from patterned obligations "to belong." It is only after such a rediscovery that we could plausibly hope to reconstruct world politics and law on a sounder basis.

This must be a foundation of willing global interdependence and human "oneness."

In his landmark work, <em>The Decline of the West</em>, first published during World War I, Oswald Spengler had inquired: "Can a desperate faith in knowledge free us from the nightmare of the <a style="cursor: help" title="Continues Spengler: '&#096;I believe,'' is the great word against metaphysical fear, and at the same time it is an avowal of love.'' See: The Decline of the West, his Chapter on 'Pythagoras, Mohammed, Cromwell.'">grand questions</a>?" This remains a profound and indispensable query. The necessary answer would finally accept that the suffocating conflicts of life on earth can never be undone by improving global economies, building larger and larger missiles, fashioning and abrogating international treaties, replacing one sordid regime with another, or even "spreading democracy."

Most importantly, we might eventually learn that a persistently tribal Planet Earth lacks a tolerable law-based future not because we humans have been too slow to learn what has been taught, but because what has been taught has largely been beside the point. It won't be enough to assure survival even if great majorities of people can somehow acquire shiny new "personal devices," or own cars that impressively drive themselves. Once again, these are false and prospectively injurious goals that fully miss the main point.

<em>Entirely.</em>

These traditional "remedies" would be insufficient because the planet as a whole will remain on its unswervingly lethal trajectory of belligerent nationalism and tribal conflict. To wit, French Jesuit thinker Pierre Teilhard de Chardin reminds us in <em>The Phenomenon of Man</em>: "The egocentric ideal of a future reserved for those who have managed to attain egoistically the extremity of `everyone for himself' is false and against <a style="cursor: help" title="In a similar vein, see Emmerich de Vattel, The Law of Nations (1758), 'The first general law, which is to be found in the very end of the society of Nations, is that each Nation should contribute as far as it can to the happiness and advancement of other Nations.'">nature</a>." Today, the quintessential codification of this lethal and contra-legal falsity is "America First."

In the end, we will need to take more seriously that global survival requires prompt escape from the irremediably contentious spirit of competitive tribes and a corresponding law-based acceptance of human "<a style="cursor: help" title="A particular presumption of 'oneness' between states (in the common fight against crime) has already given rise to the principle of universal jurisdiction. It is mentioned in the Corpus Juris Civilis; Grotius, THE LAW OF WAR AND PEACE (1625), Bk. II, Ch. 20; and also in Emmerich Vattel, LE DROIT DES GENS, Bk. I, Ch. 19 (1758). The specific case for universal jurisdiction, which is strengthened whenever extradition is difficult or impossible to obtain, was also built into the four Geneva Conventions of August 12, 1949, which unambiguously impose upon the High Contracting Parties the obligation to punish certain grave breaches of their rules, regardless of where the infraction was committed or the ascertainable nationality of the criminals.">oneness</a>." For the moment, the odds of actually meeting such a difficult requirement may seem precariously low, but the evident risks are still worth taking. After all, what cannot benefit the world system as a whole can never benefit the individual nation-state.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400">President Trump </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/19/nyregion/trump-tax-returns-lawsuit.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">lodged a stunning claim</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in federal court last week when he<a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2019/09/trump-iseeking-injunctions-to-block-access-to-his-tax-returns/"> filed suit</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> against the Manhattan district attorney</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> to halt a criminal investigation into hush-money payments that he made in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The claim? That the President is absolutely immune from any criminal process, including a criminal investigation. In other words: the President is above the law.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In support of this sweeping claim, </span><a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6421822/1-Vance-Complaint-Pdfa.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">President Trump argued</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that the President is so busy doing the nation’s work that he can’t be saddled with a criminal investigation. He said that the “unique mental and physical burdens” of a criminal investigation would “undermine the President’s leadership and efficacy both here and abroad.” Quoting the Justice Department, he added that a criminal investigation would “hamstring the operation of the whole governmental apparatus, both in foreign and domestic affairs.” Because the D.A.’s criminal investigation impermissibly interferes with his duties as President, he asserted that it violates the constitutional separation of powers and federalism.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">But these contentions go far beyond the law. Our Constitution says nothing about presidential immunity from the criminal process. The Supreme Court has never ruled on it. And while the Department of Justice has long held the view that a sitting President cannot be prosecuted while in office, that opinion is limited to criminal prosecution (not criminal investigation). That opinion is also controversial because it contravenes the maxim that no person is above the law. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">If anything, current law suggests that a President can be subject to the criminal process. In 1997, the Supreme Court flatly rejected the exact same arguments that President Trump now asserts. In <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/520/681/#tab-opinion-1960129">that case</a>, the Court ruled that President Clinton was not immune from Paula Jones’s civil lawsuit. The context was different, to be sure, but the principle was the same: with some reasonable accommodations, even the President can make time to defend a lawsuit. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Nevertheless, President Trump’s claim shouldn’t surprise us. After all, this comes from a person who uses a simple, crude, and predictable negotiation strategy in nearly every situation: he offers an outlandish opening bid, and he bargains toward the “center.” But he knows that merely by starting with an extreme position, he already shifted the bargaining range, and pulled the “center” sharply in his own direction. This ensures that he ultimately gets a better deal than he would have gotten if he had started with a reasonable opening offer. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">This strategy may work in one-off real estate transactions. But it doesn’t work in long-term constitutional governance. That’s because by dramatically shifting the bargaining range of constitutional argument and pulling the “center” in his direction, President Trump is setting a precedent for all future presidents. He isn’t just making an extreme constitutional claim for his own presidency; he’s fixing a new constitutional standard for the future. And he isn’t just moving to shut down this criminal investigation against himself; he’s moving to shut down all criminal processes against all future presidents. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Whether he knows it or not, President Trump is giving his successors, including Democrats, a new range of constitutional arguments—including the claim that the President is above the law. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe you support President Trump in his effort to halt the Manhattan D.A.’s investigation. Maybe you don’t. Either way, we shouldn’t lose sight of the longer-term harm that his extreme positions work on our constitutional system.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Consideration of blockchain legislation is a growing trend amongst state legislatures. Blockchain, which is essentially a more secure form of internet, has been expanding into new markets. This has increasingly caught the attention of legislators, who hope to capitalize on the potential economic gains by allowing for the implementation of the technology within the state. To date, twenty-four states and Puerto Rico have enacted a bill on blockchain technology. See Figure 1, which displays the year that states first enacted blockchain legislation based on data provided by the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL). Additionally, the rate of proposed legislation on blockchain has increased rapidly, with fifteen states introducing legislation in 2018, compared to six states in 2017.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Figure 1: The year that states first enacted blockchain legislation.

&nbsp;

Congress is also actively considering blockchain legislation through bills such as the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/s553/BILLS-116s553is.pdf">Blockchain Promotion Act of 2019</a>, which is still working its way through Congressional committees. If enacted, the bill seeks to <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/senate-moves-blockchain-promotion-act-forward/">establish a working group</a> to evaluate the application of blockchain in various federal agencies. Against the backdrop of Congressional delays, states have <a href="https://www.nascio.org/Portals/0/Publications/Documents/2017/NASCIO Blockchains in State Government.pdf?ver=2017-05-16-090507-033">strong economic reasons</a> to lead in this area. The following questions and responses may aid state lawmakers and policymakers working in this critical area of law and technology.

<em>First, what is blockchain?</em> Blockchain was first developed after the 2008 financial crisis. It provided a means for achieving secure financial transactions through the exchange of cryptocurrency. While <a href="https://onlinebusiness.northeastern.edu/neu-msf/guide-to-the-rise-of-cryptocurrency-digital-currency-and-bitcoin/">cryptocurrency</a> exchange is no longer the sole use for blockchain, it is the most ubiquitous application of the technology with more than <a href="https://www.coinlore.com/all_coins">2700 unique digital currencies</a> existing globally to date.

In the past decade, blockchain technology has expanded into new markets within the private sector. Common uses include financial transactions, record keeping, contract formation, and secure messaging. The adoption of blockchain technology has been slower in the public sector, but the potential applications are similarly diverse, including digital voting, real estate and title transfers, tax compliance and monitoring, and public health surveillance activities.

At the base level, the foundation of blockchain is a “<strong>decentralized database</strong>,” which is a network of computers that individually verify the authenticity of transactions, documents, and records. A document or record within the blockchain network is never edited, only added to. Each new change in the record (a “<strong>block</strong>”), once verified as an authentic transaction, gets connected to the prior record (the “<strong>chain</strong>”). Blocks are encrypted using a “<strong>hash</strong>”, which is an encryption algorithm that sufficiently scrambles and condenses the document for secure storage within the network.

“<strong>Digital signatures</strong>” create an additional layer of security and provide the means for authenticating each block. These signatures, or keys, are specific to each individual accessing the blockchain network and are required to unscramble the hash. A “<strong>private key</strong>” allows access for a select individual, whereas a “<strong>public key</strong>” is used by anyone to access the blockchain network. For example, someone could send a document which requires the receiver’s private key. This allows only the receiver to access it and makes it incredibly difficult to hack, even by someone within the same blockchain network.

For more technical definitions of blockchain terminology, see the <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2018/NIST.IR.8202.pdf">Blockchain Technology Overview</a>, published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

Blockchain technology is considered a disruptive technology, meaning that it creates a new market within an existing industry and does not rely on existing third party hosts, such as a bank or credit agency in financial transactions. Third party hosts are effectively replaced by the decentralized database, which self-authenticates the transactions with no need for additional oversight.

As a result, most <a href="https://www.blockchain-expo.com/2018/10/blockchain/future-of-blockchain-technology/">experts predict</a> that blockchain technology will upend traditional business models across <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/industries-disrupted-blockchain/">multiple industries</a>. Legislation can be used to monitor these changes and encourage responsible use of the technology.

<em>Second, what does blockchain legislation cover?</em> State legislation typically addresses blockchain technology in four different ways.

First, a bill can create a <strong>blockchain task force</strong>, working group, or subcommittee to better understand the technology and how it can be best utilized within the state. Several states, including <a href="https://www.govops.ca.gov/blockchain/">California</a>, <a href="https://www.wyoleg.gov/Committees/2018/S3">Wyoming</a>, <a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/assets/Legislative-Reports/blockchain-technology-report-final.pdf">Vermont</a>, <a href="https://www2.illinois.gov/sites/doit/Pages/BlockChainInitiative.aspx">Illinois</a>, <a href="https://www.nj.gov/governor/news/news/562019/approved/20190808a.shtml">New Jersey</a>, and <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/ce/taskforce.asp?TF=20180726_Blockchain%20Working%20Group">Connecticut</a>, have legislatively created task forces to study blockchain technology.

Second, a bill can <strong>define blockchain</strong> or incorporate relevant terminology into existing statutory frameworks. This can be used to ensure that unwritten or electronically signed documents contained within the blockchain network, such as <a href="https://www.blockchainlegalresource.com/2018/09/state-smart-contract-legislation/">smart contracts</a>, are legally recognized under state law. Examples of this type of legislation can be found in <a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/53leg/1R/laws/0097.pdf">Arizona</a> and <a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/Documents/2018/Docs/ACTS/ACT205/ACT205 As Enacted.pdf">Vermont</a>.

Third, a bill can <strong>preempt or restrict local regulations</strong> of blockchain to encourage further development of the technology within the state. Examples of this type of legislation can be found in <a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/53leg/2R/laws/0208.pdf">Arizona</a>, <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/100/HB/PDF/10000HB5553lv.pdf">Illinois</a> (see Section 20), and <a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/79th2017/Bills/SB/SB398_EN.pdf">Nevada</a> (see Section 6).

Lastly, a bill can <strong>encourage the adoption of blockchain technology</strong> in certain industries or government agencies. This can be used to increase efficiency and security, and reduce costs for state government. Examples of this type of legislation can be found in <a href="https://legis.delaware.gov/BillDetail/26554">Delaware</a>, <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/100/HB/PDF/10000HB5553lv.pdf">Illinois</a> (see Section 10), and <a href="https://nebraskalegislature.gov/FloorDocs/105/PDF/Intro/LB695.pdf">Nebraska</a> (see Section 4).

<em>Finally, what are ways to mitigate possible harms caused by legislating on blockchain?</em> Due to the rapid rate of development, technology legislation typically becomes obsolete after a few years. As a result, it can be hard for legislatures to keep pace with the changing technology landscape. There are <a href="https://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/51/1/Symposium/51-1_Marchant_Stevens.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2y6LPL41ySYVL-LkORQs4SsLSe5fgGtAuZ7Jwbf8YAaL1O6ai7zn0Npr4">many ways</a> that this obsolescence can be avoided.

First, blockchain legislation should include <strong>uniform language</strong> and address the technology in <strong>broad terms</strong>. Generalized language is crucial to maintaining the law’s relevancy since blockchain itself is rapidly developing and highly variable depending on its application.

Second, legislators can incorporate <strong>sunset provisions</strong> into their bill that either nullify the bill after a period of time or allows the legislature to renew or revise the bill to adjust to changes that occurred during the interim.

Third, legislators can <strong>incorporate accountability schemes</strong> into their bills to ensure that the legislation is applied correctly and reaching the intended result. This can include delegating additional authority to specific agencies or increasing oversight on private entities adopting the technology.

In conclusion, blockchain technology has a wide range of diverse applications within both private and public sectors. Legislation encouraging blockchain adoption can allow states to tap into this growth and pave the way for future technology developments.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>“The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.” ~James Madison</blockquote>
In the years following the fall of the Soviet Union, Poland <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/03/world/europe/poland-supreme-court-protest.html">emerged</a> as a nation poised to embrace and fulfill the promises of Western democracy. However, since coming to power in 2015, Poland’s Law and Justice Party (hereinafter LJP) has attempted to secure authoritarian power by radically reforming the nation’s <a href="http://archiwum.thenews.pl/1/10/Artykul/385851">judiciary</a>. As a part of its attempted power grab, the LJP first overhauled the nation’s Constitutional Tribunal, which ensures that rules of law do not violate the Constitution. Additionally, the party took control of the National Council of the Judiciary, which is tasked with overseeing <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/polands-judges-boycott-supreme-court-posts-accusing-the-government-of-a-takeover-bid/2018/08/17/8a9a5590-943a-11e8-818b-e9b7348cd87d_story.html">judicial appointments</a> and safeguarding judicial independence in Poland. Since the takeover of the two delegating bodies, the party has packed them with judges who are sympathetic to the LJP, giving politicians near-complete control of the judiciary.

Most recently, the LJP has taken aim at the highest court in Poland - the nation's Supreme Court. In September of 2018, President Andrzej Duda signed into law judicial legislation lowering the mandated retirement age of Supreme Court justices from 70 to 65, thus forcing 27 of the 72 serving judges into retirement. Further, judges who wish to stay on the bench past the mandated age of retirement must <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/polish-supreme-court-turns-to-ecj-for-help-older-judges-retirement-eu-rule/.">seek approval</a> from President Duda. In response to the growing public outcry, the LJP justified the judicial overhaul as necessary to increase judicial efficiency and, ironically, force out judges held over from the pre-1989 communist regime. Party officials contend deep judicial changes are needed to restore justice and fairness to ordinary Poles, who are currently victim to a corrupt system that thwarts the will of the people.

Critics fear that the hostile judicial takeover threatens Polish democracy by abolishing <a href="http://www.thenews.pl/1/10/Artykul/370998">judicial independence</a> and that it will dismantle the rule of law in Poland. Dariusz Zawistowaki, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court’s civil division, describes the judicial reform as having “politicized” the judiciary, and fears democratic standards developed since 1989 will be “gone.” Opponents of the party contend that the governing party is building a judicial system that will be “subservient” to the LJP's political rule.

If the LJP can stack and control the Supreme Court, critics have argued that the party will be able to effectively govern Poland the way the old Communist Party governed the nation. Opponents fear the party will rig national elections, punish outspoken political adversaries, and rule without concern for judicial ramifications. The LJP’s strategy involves wearing down the Polish people with legal abstracts, such as judicial independence, so that the public is no longer resistant to the party’s judicial reform.

As the legal battle over Poland’s judiciary is coming to a head, both the European Union and Poland’s Supreme Court are fighting back against the LJP. The Polish Supreme Court decided to suspend President Duda’s law, and took the extraordinary step of appealing directly to the European Court of Justice, asking it to rule against the party’s attempt to forcibly retire over 40 percent of current Supreme Court justices. The Polish  Supreme Court insists the law is unconstitutional and refuses to comply with the judicial legislation.

However, President Duda rejected the Supreme Court’s ruling, and announced that the Supreme Court would have 27 new judges to replace the judges <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2018/10/poland-adds-27-supreme-court-justices-defying-eu/">forced to retire</a>. The appointment of the new Supreme Court justices took place in a secret ceremony in an attempt to circumvent European Union interference. The European Commission launched Article 7 proceedings against Poland, commanding President Duda reverse the appointments and reinstate the previously serving judges or risk the matter being sent to the European Court of Justice for further review. The European Union alleges the LJP’s judicial reform violates Article 19 of the Treaty of the European Union, read in connection with Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Read together, the European Union asserts that retiring Supreme Court judges must leave the bench independently and that the LJP’s judicial reform undermines judicial independence and the irremovability of judges.

The European Court of Justice issued an injunction stopping the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/poland-supreme-court-judges-eu-european-%20court-judge-ecj-a8592136.html">new law</a>. The European Union’s top court ordered Poland to freeze judicial appointments and reinstate the judges forced into premature retirement. However, Duda’s cabinet chief announced that “it’s impossible for law to work in reverse,” implying that the LJP would not plan on complying with the recently issued injunction, increasing tension between the European Union and Poland.

As the European Union struggles to deal with nationalist, populist, and anti-immigration movements arising under its jurisdiction, dealing with threats against democracy has never been more crucial. As countries in the region, such as Hungary, have recently turned to autocracy, adhering to the democratic standards of judicial independence and the irremovability of judges is critical to instilling public faith in the judiciary and further promoting Poland’s quest for complete democracy. If Poland’s judiciary falls under the control of the LJP, the ripple effect could be felt through former Soviet Union nations and may give way to political parties ruling in the manner that the Communist Party once did throughout Central Europe.

Furthermore, the democratic standards developed in Poland since 1989 may be undone upon the LJP’s seizure of legislative, executive, and judiciary power. If that happens, the words of James Madison will once more ring true and Poland’s authoritarian governing party “may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When I tell my friends that I developed an IOS app, they usually respond with a surprised, “I thought you were studying law and politics! Did you change to computer science?” When I explain that I did not switch but instead decided to study both, they often find the combination interesting but wonder how and if the two fields work together.

In a world of big data and social media, technology has unquestionably entangled itself in law and politics. Yet, as a society, we still tend to see fields like law and politics as the inverse of STEM. We think of entrepreneurs and software engineers driving society forward and of lawyers and policymakers slamming on the brakes. While people in tech seem to embrace innovation, lawyers and policymakers appear to cling to caution, prudence, and precedent.

From an early age, society nudges us to categorize ourselves. We relentlessly ask ourselves "am I more similar to an entrepreneur who likes numbers and innovation or a lawyer who enjoys reading and writing?" Our choices usually end up being self-fulfilling prophecies. The longer we travel our chosen paths, the more going down a new one feels like taking a dangerous mountain pass; you may never get where you want to go and, if you do, it will certainly take longer.

<span>But the views you get on that less taken road make it worthwhile. I want to use my experience developing an app to show why fields like law and politics can offer unique insights into tech and <em>vice versa</em>.</span>

<span>People apply technology to where they see problems, and the problems they see depend on their experiences. For example, Logan Green, the CEO of the ride-sharing company Lyft, served on the Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District's board in college. John Zimmer, the other co-founder of Lyft, was also involved in the carpooling businesses in college. While gridlock best explains certain parts of the tech-highway, the intersection of law, politics, and technology stands wide open. Social media, e-commerce, biotechnology, and logistics applications proliferate, but few technology practitioners have experience in law or policy and opportunities abound for people in these areas to apply technology to the problems they experience.
</span>

<span>In 2016, I worked as a free-lance journalist covering the presidential election. Through conversations at campaign rallies, I discovered that people, even those passionate about politics, did not have time to research candidates' platforms. This problem motivated me to develop <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/newselect/id1472897411">NewsElect</a>, an IOS app that makes it easy for voters to compare candidates in the 2020 election. Voters simply pick a candidate and an issue, and NewsElect puts relevant articles from a range of news sources at their fingertips. </span>

<span>When I first conceived of the idea behind NewsElect, I worried that my political science background would put me at a disadvantage compared to people who had devoted more time to studying computer science and software engineering, but as I worked this seeming disadvantage morphed into an advantage. My coursework in politics helped me to identify policy areas voters care about; it also enabled me to compile a list of keywords that capture a comprehensive range of articles within each policy area. </span>

<span>In today’s “move-fast-and-break-things” environment, where we rush to bring digital applications to the market, people with political science and legal backgrounds can help us to consider social good. Many app creators care only about increasing business utilities like user engagement rates and retention rates without considering how their products might detrimentally affect society. For example, while social media platforms have done a fantastic job of predicting what people like, they have been slow to find value in showing people ideas and arguments that challenge their beliefs. As the like-minded stick together, they create echo chambers and an ever-more polarized political environment. The tech industry urgently needs the prudence and long-term thinking that fields like law and political science teach.</span>

<span> My coursework in political science and experience in journalism made me particularly concerned about political polarization. In designing NewsElect, I deliberately made it hard for users to read articles that only reinforce their views. NewsElect’s algorithm aggregates articles from liberal and conservative-leaning media so that users are bound to see different narratives on the candidate they choose. In a competitive industry, designing an application that goes against the conventional wisdom of “always pleasing your users” requires level-headedness, professionalism, and conviction. Law and political science cultivate and encourage these traits.</span>

People with legal and political science backgrounds can help not just to theorize about social impact but also to better craft the details of digital applications. <span>For example, many people have run a search in an application only for no result to appear. Usually, the application replies, “no result has been found,” or “no information available.” While seemingly harmless, in the context of an app like NewsElect, standard responses like these could lead a user to believe that the candidate does not have a view on the issue. </span><span>When I developed NewsElect, my humanities background encouraged me to pay close attention to cases like this where a user could be misled or misinformed. So, when a NewsElect user’s search does not yield a result, NewsElect reminds the user that this does not necessarily mean the candidate has no stance on the issue searched for and asks if she or he would like to be redirected to Google to read more.</span>

Skills learned in computer science can also contribute to the betterment of fields like law and politics. Algorithms have gradually replaced humans in making important decisions that affect millions of lives. For example, some courts use algorithms to determine whether to release an individual on bail. With innovations like this, courts may shift to judging the actions of algorithms rather than people. With computer science backgrounds, lawyers and policymakers could truly understand how an algorithm works and form cogent arguments about the details of an algorithm, rather than relying solely on the opinions of tech professionals.

When I first started studying computer science alongside political science, I was curious about how the two disciplines could interact, but now I see a social responsibility to study them together. Society needs people proficient in technology, law, and politics to ensure that digital applications and technology more broadly is designed with social good in mind. Society also needs people to bring judicial oversight up to speed with rapidly developing technology. The challenge and responsibility are on us.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Chief Hinga Norman, head of the brutal Civil Defense Force, during the monstrous civil war in the West African country of Sierra Leone—part of larger unrest that engulfed neighboring Liberia and others—admonished his men to kill every living thing down to the ants in Pujehun. That they did. This was emblematic of the brutality that was West Africa in the 1990’s and early 2000’s.

In 2002 an international war crimes tribunal was set up to account for the murder, rape, maiming, and mutilation of tens of thousands of Sierra Leoneans. Charged with prosecuting those who bore the greatest responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity, the <a href="http://www.rscsl.org/">Special Court for Sierra Leone</a> did just that. In ten years, this highly efficient tribunal investigated, indicted, arrested, tried and convicted all those who destroyed Sierra Leone, to include a sitting head of state <a href="http://www.rscsl.org/Taylor.html">President Charles Taylor of Liberia</a>. He sits in a maximum security prison in the United Kingdom for the rest of his life.

A tragic aspect of the unrest in West Africa was the destruction of Liberia under the regime of now convicted war criminal Charles Taylor and his henchmen and family, many of whom still move about Liberia as elected officials. During the last decade of the 21st century over 500,000 Liberians may have died. Some of these officials are most certainly individually criminally liable for their deaths.

This lack of accountability in Liberia is an open sore for the region and the country. Liberia is politically and practically unstable as there has been no justice for the victims of the Liberian civil war concurrent with the conflict in Sierra Leone. Where Sierra Leone is stable and at peace after the work of the Special Court for Sierra Leone, Liberia teeters on the abyss of an uncertain future.

It’s time for justice and accountability for Liberia. Civil society in Liberia has kept the torch of hope alive, yet politically there is no real desire to set up a justice mechanism locally, regionally, or internationally. Though the people of Liberia demand justice, the vacillation of the current sitting President George Weah augers poorly for future initiatives.

Frankly, without prodding by key players such as the United States, among others, little will be done. It appears that a calculated plan to go slow on the issue of accountability in the hopes that the region and the world will lose interest in the fast pace of this kaleidoscopic world exists. There is some movement by the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-resolution/1055/text">US Congress</a> and the <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/09/17/liberia-president-backs-war-crimes-court">Liberian Congress</a> to try and push the issue of accountability, yet the true political will wanes regionally and internationally.

<a href="https://www.usip.org/publications/2006/02/truth-commission-liberia">The Liberian Truth Commission</a> clearly called for accountability and noted several persons as central figures in the destruction of Liberia. This is a cornerstone by which politically, legally, and practically a justice mechanism can be negotiated. Though some efforts exist, the time is now to begin that creative process. The ghosts of tens of thousands of the murdered dead and other victims cry out for justice. Liberia can never find a balanced middle ground politically without justice.

As I told the people of Sierra Leone in my many town hall meetings in our world famous <a href="http://www.rscsl.org/Documents/slfinalreport.pdf">Outreach Program</a>, that the rule of law is more powerful than the rule of the gun. The people of Sierra Leone understand this, the people of Liberia hear that echo from the country next door but languish in the dried blood of an atrocity without accountability. We must seek justice for them. The ultimate atrocity, in my mind, is that victims of atrocity disappear in the sands of time without accountability as if they never existed.

		<title>Pro Bono in Germany: A Hybrid Solution to the Justice Gap Between Legal Aid and Private Practice</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Institutionalized by big law firms since the 1980s in the United States, pro bono today has become a global phenomenon. Given its strong legal profession and market, a unique outlier is Germany, where pro bono is not completely legal. The challenge is not the lack of need or supply of pro bono, but the ambiguity of German laws coupled with a legal aid scheme (<em>Prozesskostenhilfe</em>) to which judicial pro bono appears superfluous.

Under Germany’s constitutional principles of democracy, federalism, republicanism, and the rule of law, the <a href="http://www.gesetz-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/index.html">Basic Law</a> guarantees access to justice, including the right to a fair trial and the right to effective judicial protection. The Federal Republic and its States (<em>Länder</em>) fund legal aid, which covers both civil and criminal court proceedings (<em>Prozesskostenhilfe</em>) as well as out-of-court legal advice (<em>Beratungshilfe</em>). Despite this comprehensive system, one entry point for pro bono is where individuals and legal entities, such as non-governmental organizations, fail to meet the exacting eligibility criteria for judicial legal aid (<em>Prozesskostenhilfe</em>).

In addition, complex cases risk unjust outcomes under the legal aid scheme because lawyers working on reduced fees may not allocate the requisite amount of time and effort. Furthermore, projects that require <a href="http://www.beck.de/rsw/upload/NJW/Pro_Bono_Legal_Services_in_Germany_-_An_Overview.pdf">special expertise</a>, such as advising on securitization of micro-credit loans, would be better handled pro bono than by legal aid lawyers, and the fees would otherwise be prohibitively high. Other extra-judicial projects that require greater manpower, such as conducting a multi-jurisdictional research on children’s rights in the EU for a client like UNICEF, could only be taken pro bono. Because legal aid falls short of meeting these legal needs in Germany, pro bono offers a creative, robust solution to closing the justice gap.

The German bar associations, however, do not consider pro bono necessary. In 2013, the regional regulatory bar (Rechtsanwaltskammern, “RAK”)’s resolution regarding amending the Act to Modernize the Law on Legal Costs (Kostenrechtmodernisierungsgesetz, “KostRMoG”) decided that there is no need to organize pro bono activities since the current law guarantees access to justice for the poor seeking legal advice, and <a href="https://www.rak-sachsen-anhalt.de/36-mitgliederderrechtsanwaltskammersachsenanhalt/mitglieder/113-gebuehrenrecht.html">it is up to the state</a>, not the individual lawyer, to provide access to justice. This is not only the public perception but also the opinion of German lawyers who oppose or remain neutral to pro bono.

What stands between theorizing and realizing pro bono in Germany is the regulatory framework that governs the legal profession. §49b of the Federal Lawyers’ Act, or Code (Bundesrechtsanwaltsordnung, “BRAO”) prohibits lawyers from charging clients lower than the minimum statutory fees required by the Lawyers’ Remuneration Act (Rechtsanwaltsvergutüngsgestez, “RVG”). The profession is also self-regulated by the Lawyers’ Professional Code of Conduct (Berufsordnung für Rechtsanwälte, “BORA”), which is silent on pro bono.

Within this regulatory framework German lawyers have advocated for pro bono as a responsibility to be fulfilled by the legal profession. However, more than a decade after 2008 when the provision of free extrajudicial legal advice became legal with the amendment of the Legal Services Act (Rechtsdienstleistungsgesetz, “RDG”), German laws still offer no absolute legal clarity on judicial pro bono.

The counterarguments that dispel fear and suspicion of legalizing judicial pro bono are reputational, grounded in the ethics and independence of the legal profession. On a national level, it would be a shame for the strongest economy and legal market in Europe to continue to ban pro bono. Germany should not have to consider or present herself as a developing country in terms of pro bono culture. On the individual level, the choice to represent a client pro bono should be the freedom of the lawyer. Lawyers act in their full professional capacity as members of the bar when they work pro bono, just as when they work commercially, because the lawyer’s professional activities (should) include pro bono services. Public service is at the core of the legal profession; a lawyer advocates not only for the interest of her client but also for the good of the public. Further, in Germany, legal advising is a reserved activity limited to lawyers (<em>Rechtsanwalt</em>) within the legal profession, and this reservation is called <em>anwaltsmonopol</em> (jurist monopoly). If the profession is to uphold <em>anwaltsmonopol</em> and its prestige, the profession must grant access to justice to those who need legal advice and representation where the legal aid scheme fails them.

Pro bono should be legalized by modernizing the Federal Lawyers’ Act (BRAO). But even if judicial pro bono is legalized, Germany will still have to deal with the cultural inertia that extrajudicial pro bono is currently having to overcome.

Ways to develop the pro bono culture in Germany include continuing to cultivate law students as problem solvers. First established in 2010, <a href="http://law.handels.gu.se/digitalAssets/1500/1500268_law-clinic-rapport.pdf">law clinics are becoming integral</a> to legal education in Germany. Since the refugee aid crisis in 2015, Germany has seen a surge of refugee law clinics where law students provide legal support to migrants. <a href="https://www.soldaninstitut.de/fileadmin/user_upload/AnwBl_2017-10__Artikel_2_.pdf">Today with more than sixty law clinics</a> across the country, young lawyers joining the profession with pro bono experience at law clinics are well-positioned to shape a sustainable pro bono culture.

As Germany has never done a legal needs survey, <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/sites/default/files/strengthening-access-to-civil-justice-legal-needs-surveys-20180409.pdf">conducting one to identify what legal needs</a> remain unmet will help clarify the role of pro bono in closing the justice gap. “<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231939661_Paths_to_Justice_What_People_Do_and_Think_About_Going_to_Law_By_HAZEL_GENN_Oxford_Hart_Publishing_1999_xvi_264_Appendices_118_and_Index_1_pp_Paperback_1500_net_ISBN_1-84113-039-7">Justiciable events</a>,” or experiences that raise legal issues, are key to understanding access to justice from the client’s perspective, which is not well incorporated into the German justice system because it is designed in favor of the courts.

Finally, Germany would benefit from a recommendation, rather than a mandatory policy, from its bar association to give lawyers the legal certainty with which to practice pro bono. The promise of comprehensively legal pro bono in Germany, when realized, would not only advance the national public interest by complementing legal aid, but also serve as a model for European and other jurisdictions where pro bono is met with similar apprehension or skepticism from bar associations and legal aid lawyers.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg rejected a request for referral under <a href="https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf">article 43 of the European Convention on Human Rights</a> (Convention) by Italy last week making the Chamber’s October 7th decision in the case <a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Judgment-Marcello-Viola-v.-Italy-no.-2-irreducible-life-sentence-breached-the-Convention.pdf">Marcello Viola v. Italy</a> a final judgment.

The ECHR has decided that an “irreducible life sentence” according to articles <a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/41-bis-Italian.pdf">41-bis</a> (<a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/41-bis-english-translation.pdf">English translation</a>) and <a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/58-ter-Italian.pdf">58-ter</a> (<a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/58-ter-english-translation.pdf">English translation</a>) of the Italian Penitentiary Act-Law no 354 of 26 July 1975, a measure known as “ergastolo ostativo,” in conjunction with article 22 of the Italian Criminal Code breaches the European Convention on Human Rights. <a href="https://www.giustizia.it/resources/cms/documents/Carta_dei_diritti_inglese.pdf">This law</a> grants specific benefits for offenders convicted of serious crimes unless the sentenced person has cooperated with justice and provided that there are no links with organized crime. Examples of include crimes perpetrated with aims of terrorism or subversion, mafia-type association and any crime committed with the purpose of facilitating the activity of mafia-type associations. More specifically, in the Marcello Viola case the Court recognized a violation of <a href="https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf">article 3</a> of the Convention accepting that:
<blockquote>“…it would be incompatible with human dignity – which lay at the very essence of the Convention system – to deprive persons of their freedom without striving towards their rehabilitation and providing them with the chance to regain that freedom at some future date”, and the same time it acknowledged that Contracting States enjoy “a wide margin of appreciation in deciding on the appropriate length of prison sentences, and the fact that a life sentence might in practice be served in full did not mean that it was irreducible. Consequently, the possibility of review of life sentences entailed the possibility for the convicted person to apply for release but not necessarily to be released if he or she continued to pose a danger to society”.</blockquote>
In this case, Mr. Viola was convicted on mafia charges. Based on the aforementioned article 3, as well as article 8 of the Convention, Viola complained his life sentence was with no prospect of release on license and that the Italian prison regime was incompatible with rehabilitation and social reintegration. Upon holding that “the finding of a violation could not be understood as offering the applicant the prospect of imminent release,” the judgment did not overlook the seriousness of Viola’s crimes but fell short of calling for his release. Choosing to uphold the prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment that is absolute according to the Convention:
<blockquote>“[t]he Court recognised the fact that the offences of which Mr Viola had been convicted concerned a particularly dangerous phenomenon for society. However, efforts to tackle that scourge could not justify derogating from the provisions of Article 3 of the Convention, which prohibited in absolute terms inhuman or degrading treatment”.</blockquote>
Therefore, Strasbourg has decided, within the scope of a modern prison, to value integration back to society and not retribution for the criminal act committed. This is openly reflected in the judgment’s wording:
<blockquote>“In the Court’s view, a convicted prisoner’s personality did not remain unchanged from the time of commission of the offence. It could evolve in the course of his or her sentence, as reflected in the resocialisation process, which enabled individuals to review their criminal past critically and rebuild their personality… By continuing to equate a lack of cooperation with an irrebuttable presumption of dangerousness to society, the rules in place effectively assessed the person’s dangerousness by reference to the time when the offence had been committed, instead of taking account of the reintegration process and any progress the person had made since being convicted. The presumption of dangerousness also prevented the competent courts from examining applications for release on licence and from ascertaining whether the person concerned had changed and made progress towards rehabilitation, such that his or her detention was no longer justified… Thus, the Court considered that the life sentence imposed on Mr Viola under section 4 bis of the Prison Administration Act (ergastolo ostativo) restricted his prospects for release and the possibility of review of his sentence to an excessive degree.”</blockquote>
This is not the first time that the ECHR has dealt with this Italian law. On the application <a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/AFFAIRE-ASCIUTTO-c.-ITALIE.pdf">Asciutto v. Italy</a> the ECHR recognized violations of <a href="https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf">articles 6 § 1 and 8</a> of the Convention. In Asciutto, the applicant’s complaint “entail[ed] restrictions on outside contacts, such as the requirement to give evidence in court proceedings by video link. He also complained of delays in the examination of his appeals against ministerial decisions and an infringement of his right to respect for his correspondence”. In the case <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-94072">Enea vs. Italy</a>, although the Grand Chamber dismissed the complaint about article 3 of the Convention, it recognized again breaches of articles 6 § 1 and 8. Moreover, in the famous case of <a href="http://questionegiustizia.it/doc/case_provenzano_v_italy_55080_13.pdf">Provenzano v. Italy</a>, involving a convicted Cosa Nostra boss who finally died in prison after complaining about inadequate medical care under the 41-bis regime, the Court decided that he was subjected to inhumane treatment. It should be noted that an American Judge also refused to extradite a mafia convict to Italy, ruling that the 41-bis system <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/fears-of-torture-for-italian-gangster-397064.html">“is not related to any lawfully imposed sanction or punishment, and thus constitutes torture.”</a>

The ECHR decision against the 41-bis regime has not been met with warm acceptance in Italy. Part of the public opinion and legal professionals argue that it weakens authorities in the fight against mafia and terrorism, both significant threats to the country’s national security. The turmoil of the “anni di piombo” and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/09/italian-leaders-decry-human-rights-ruling-on-mafia-prison-regimes">killings</a> in 1992 of the heroic Judges Falcone and Borsellino can be considered as pivotal behind the introduction and development of article 41-bis of the Prison Administration Act. Furthermore, it should be noted that this sensitive historical framework was also acknowledged by the ECHR in its decision in Viola, stating <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/fre?i=002-12494%20.">“the prison reform which had given rise to the regime in issue had been adopted in 1992, in the context of an emergency following an episode that had marked Italy deeply.”</a>

When it comes to organized crime, Italians have valid reasons to fight it with the most effective measures possible, to disrupt the functioning networks of mafia bosses and their links to segments of the Italian society. The same applies to terrorism, which is not a new security concern for Italy. Both phenomena have haunted Italian history. The Strasbourg judgment is interpreted by some Italians negatively, as interference from foreign judges who do not understand the seriousness of mafia and as opening the door for organized crime bosses—who remain connected to the mafia scene and remorseless for their crimes—to get out of prison and resume their criminal careers. In a period of Euroscepticism, the ECHR decision raises also a matter of Italy’s sovereignty in its domestic affairs and national security policy. Additionally, there are still victims and mourning families because of mafia violence. Vindication scores higher than the convict’s right to reintegration for those who have felt such loss. The arguments of those opposing the ECHR undoubtedly deserve attention and taking them into account before any development in laws, as they echo the tragic experience of crime.

The Italian school of Criminology has been focal in the development of theories about crime, criminals, penalties, and the prison system that have affected the western world. It is also one of the most famous case studies in organized crime and terrorism. On one hand a cradle of criminological theories, on the other hand a real battlefield against the most serious crimes.

The present ECHR decision poses a challenge. Will Italy defy it or will it take a new stance on security, despite the global trend of draconian laws against terrorism and organized crime? The second choice seems to be overlooking all alleged success in the fight against serious crime. However, should Italy choose this road, it is not a predestined lost war. The Italian judiciary and law enforcement are highly trained and capable to cope with difficulties. Now the authorities will have to build an even better, stronger network of intelligence to target mafia and implement effective programs of crime disengagement. Plus, the state will have to adopt measures that will estrange mafia from certain communities that are its oxygen of existence. It was an Italian, Cesare Beccaria, who was courageous enough to speak against torture, degrading, inhuman punishment of prisoners and above all oppose the death penalty that was seen as normal and even absolutely necessary to stop crime and criminals in his time. Thus, from Italy, centuries ago, started the wind of change that shaped all civilized criminal justice systems up to now.  We will see if once again Italy can inspire global criminal justice reforms through an ability to adopt regimes that are hard on crime, but humane enough to reflect current principles of the European Convention on Human Rights towards rehabilitating criminals, even the mafia ones.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the indictment against sixteen environmental activists now on trial outside Istanbul, George Soros and the Open Society Foundations (OSF) are mentioned over 300 times. <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/03/25/turkey-baseless-charges-over-landmark-2013-protests">Neither is in any way linked</a> to the defendants or to the 2013 public demonstrations that took place at Gezi Park, yet somehow George Soros is accused of being the mastermind and financier behind them.

Osman Kavala, a businessman and philanthropist, is the primary defendant in the case, and is referred to in the indictment as “Turkey’s Soros.” I observed the opening of the trial, and it is a show trial in every sense. The defendants are accused of orchestrating the overthrow of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and the 2013 civil unrest has been cast as a global conspiracy by Soros and forces of democratic liberalism. Turkey’s government-controlled media has fanned false allegations and called for Soros to be “taken down.”

Of Hungarian Jewish background, George Soros is an American investor, philanthropist and human rights champion that authoritarian governments love to hate. He is vilified by the far right, accused of being a puppet master behind a vast number of amorphous socialist movements. More often than not, attacks against Soros are smothered in propaganda and the anti-Semitic undertones are hard to miss.

Soros lived through the Nazi occupation and subsequent Soviet takeover of Hungary; he knows first-hand of the dangers and levers of authoritarian rule and has been an outspoken critic. After immigrating to the United States, Soros launched what was to be a highly successful career in finance. With the fall of the Soviet Union, Soros used his wealth to create the <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/">Open Society Foundations</a> (OSF), an international grant-making network supporting free press, democracy, and civil society. Initially focused on the former communist regimes of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, the OSF now has broad international reach. OSF expenditures since 1997 have exceeded $15 billion.

George Soros is now the principal antagonist of many new autocrats, and he has become a handy scapegoat. Authoritarian regimes make effective use of character assassination to stay in power, and this is nowhere more apparent than in Hungary.

Prime Minister Viktor Orbán passed a so-called “Stop Soros” law, criminalizing activities that support asylum applicants and their right to request it. Orbán has used the law to blame Soros for the “Muslim invasion into Christian Europe.” He expanded his aggressive attacks to target Soros’ Central European University located in Budapest.

The values of liberal democracy, the foundation of international order in the post-war period, are vanishing. Orbán has been clear in his intention to “make Hungary an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/hungarys-illiberalism-should-not-go-unchallenged/2014/08/16/b2dc72d4-1e5c-11e4-82f9-2cd6fa8da5c4_story.html">illiberal</a> state.” For today’s rising corps of illiberal, populist leaders, Soros personifies the “threat” of liberalism.

North Macedonia recently launched a similar “Stop Soros” campaign. The media portrays Soros as being instrumental in whatever ills face the country.  The “Stop Soros” movement <a href="https://balkaninsight.com/2017/01/18/macedonia-forms-anti-soros-movement-01-18-2017/#sthash.EfzB0UBK.dpuf">seeks to</a> “expos[e] the subversive activities of Macedonian NGOs financed by the billionaire.” However distant or superfluous, connections to Soros are used to discredit any politician who promotes civil liberties.

In Poland in 2016, the leader of the ruling party, Jarosław Kaczyński, <a href="https://brighterworld.mcmaster.ca/articles/scapegoating-george-soros-how-media-savvy-far-right-activists-spread-lies/">held Soros personally responsible</a> for undermining the state by promoting multiculturalism. In his bid to maintain power, Kaczyński has attempted to corrupt the very concept of liberal democracy by attacking the effigy of George Soros.

Even the current U.S. administration has found Soros a convenient scapegoat. Soros <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/30/billionaire-liberal-donor-george-soros-may-continue-midterm-investment.html">was a major contributor</a> in the 2018 U.S. mid-term elections, giving over $17 million in personal funds to democratic and progressive candidates. Not surprisingly, that earned the wrath of President Donald Trump, who accused him of financing opposition to Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation hearing and fabricated an outlandish story about Soros facilitating the movement of Central American migrants to the US border.

Now Turkey has joined the anti-Soros authoritarian club. <a href="https://guides.library.upenn.edu/c.php?g=475979&amp;p=3255408">The Gezi Park demonstrations</a> started as a small grassroots protest in May 2013 against Ankara’s plans to destroy a beloved park in central Istanbul. When the authorities responded with a brutal police crackdown, a wave of civil unrest throughout Turkey led to further suppression and police violence. President Erdogan <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/turkish-government-trying-to-blame-gezi-park-protests-on-foreign-actors-says-imprisoned-civil-society-leader/">claimed that the entire affair was a foreign-sponsored</a> attempt to overthrow his government. The indictment against the 16 activists is factually baseless.

While not new, the vilification of George Soros has assumed dangerous proportions, and events in Turkey should be a wakeup call for democracy. This is a moment to stand against lies and autocratic manipulation. As effigy, George Soros personifies the liberal values of civil society, freedom and democratic governance – values that are burning at the hands of autocrats.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400">Over the past several years, the use of e-cigarettes has increased greatly. While the original demographic for e-cigarettes was intended to be legal adults who already smoked traditional cigarettes, <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2019/03/fda-introduces-new-restrictions-on-flavored-e-cigarette-sales-to-teenagers/">these numbers seem to be higher amongst a younger population than expected</a>. </span><a href="https://www.consumersafety.org/product-lawsuits/e-cigarette/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Parents and guardians filed lawsuits alleging</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that the marketing campaigns lead by popular manufacturers, Juul Labs, promoted young adults and teens to take part in vaping.<a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2019/10/new-york-city-sues-e-cigarette-companies-for-selling-to-minors/"> People claim that the sleek design and sweet-tasting flavors</a> are appealing to younger audiences. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Due to minimal regulation of these products, not many are positive of the ingredients or how they affect consumers, let alone, the younger population using e-cigarettes. As the public health crisis escalates, children, who are not aware of what nicotine can do to the body, are becoming addicted to vaping and suffering from nicotine addiction.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The high concentration of nicotine in these products is not only causing nicotine addiction, but also nicotine toxicity. This occurs when the body has absorbed too much of the addictive chemical and begins to become poisonous. First signs of </span><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/nicotine-poisoning"><span style="font-weight: 400">nicotine toxicity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> occurs as early as 15 minutes after its onset and can be easily missed because the symptoms, like headache, queasiness, or confusion, are common. Later signs, however, can be more serious including seizures, the inability to control muscles, and a lethargic feeling. Nicotine poisoning can also be deadly. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Over the past several weeks, hundreds of consumers have reported that they have vaping-related lung illnesses and 26 people have succumbed to their illnesses, with the </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/08/nyregion/vaping-death.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">youngest so far being 17 years old</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. As these numbers continue to rise daily, the dangers associated with vaping are becoming more apparent to all consumers, resulting in increased awareness. 54% of those affected are under the age of 25 and </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html#map-cases"><span style="font-weight: 400">15% of this number are under 18</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, which alarms public health officials who have already coined e-cigarette use as an “epidemic.” </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">While these consumers are being diagnosed with respiratory illnesses as a result of using vaping e-cigarettes, consumers all over the world are also being physically harmed by their devices. Although each device can look different due to various “generations” of e-cigarettes, most run on lithium-ion batteries. As a result of this design, the devices themselves can sometimes overheat and explode, which can seriously harm users. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Earlier this year, a <a href="https://time.com/5521792/texas-man-dies-vape-pen-explodes/">Texas man was killed</a> when his e-cigarette exploded in his face, severing an artery and causing the 24-year-old to have a stroke. Three pieces of the device went flying and one lodged so deeply in his throat that a medically-induced coma was necessary. In June, <a href="https://www.registerguard.com/news/20190604/teen-burned-when-vape-device-explodes-in-springfield">a teen from Springfield, Oregon was rushed to the hospital</a> after suffering burns to his thigh after his vape device exploded. He suffered burns to around 18% of his body after the device exploded in his right pocket. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">These instances of illnesses and other health issues have encouraged communities to come together to take their own action against the manufacturers. Aside from the consumer lawsuits being filed against popular companies like Juul Labs, states are taking steps to ban the products to aid in the deterrent of young people using the devices. By taking these products off the shelves completely, the younger population will be less able to get their hands on the products and become harmed.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">New York, California, and Massachusetts are </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/health/vaping-illness-tracker.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">just three of the states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that have taken matters into their own hands and led the way toward banning the products in their cities. Although some of these state bans are still pending or only last for a few months, it is predicted that this will greatly decrease the number of users that are harmed by the products. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">While these communities stand together to fight the vaping epidemic, hundreds of Americans are still falling victim to the dangers. However, with these steps in place, the public health crisis is expected to decrease in size over the next several weeks. Right now, at least, it does not appear that vaping will be out of national headlines any time soon and we can expect a lot more legal and political action to be taken against Juul Labs. </span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[China is exerting an enormous amount of power and influence over American companies even to the point of potentially enforcing its own laws. This has been a slow and largely secretive expansion over a period of years. It is a circumstance modern law has not foreseen and seems largely ill-equipped to deal with.

Let’s start with a little context.

<strong>Chinese media influence</strong>

China’s influence in recent weeks begins and ends with the NBA. On Sunday night, Daryl Morey, the General Manager of the Houston Rockets, sent a tweet which said, “Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.” This tweet was in support of protesters currently rallying in the streets of Hong Kong who have been calling for the Chinese government to respect the island’s autonomy and their human rights. As a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-49995985">result</a> of this tweet, the government-owned national broadcast network CCTV ceased all broadcast of NBA games in China. Chinese digital media company, Tencent, then halted all online streaming of NBA games. In addition, Chinese media companies specifically stated that they would not broadcast any Houston Rockets games. The streaming deal between the NBA and Tencent alone is structured as a five-year deal that is expected to bring in roughly $1.5 billion in revenue to the NBA. As a result, the NBA issued a public apology to China that is being received as lukewarm by both sides with Americans saying that China is censoring the NBA and the Chinese government claiming that the NBA has offended national values, but this was only the beginning.

On October 2, the animated comedy show, South Park, which thrives on controversy, aired an episode entitled “Band in China.” The episode takes aim at Hollywood’s tendency to censor themselves for fear of offending the Chinese market which has become a huge consumer of Western films in recent years. Disney reportedly made some $200 million in the opening weekend of <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em> in 2018 at the Chinese box office which is just shy of the $257 million the movie brought in during the opening weekend in America. After the episode aired, the Chinese government censored the entire existence of South Park from Chinese media. They deleted thousands of social media posts, scrubbed entire seasons of the show from streaming services like Alibaba, and deleted all mention of it. The South Park Creators <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/south-park-banned-chinese-internet-critical-episode-1245783">responded</a> with a tongue-in-cheek apology mocking China as well as the NBA, but this is still an excessive effort by Chinese media companies to enforce the nation’s values.

Finally, there were the actions of Activision Blizzard, an American videogame company owned by Tencent. During a tournament held two weeks ago, a streamer and competitor, Chung Ng Wai who lives in Hong Kong expressed his support for the Hong Kong protesters on stream saying, “Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time”. That saying has been a rallying cry among the Hong Kong protesters. Activision Blizzard responded by issuing a one-year ban for the player, fining him thousands of dollars in prize money, and firing the commentators who conducted the interview. All of this was done nominally for violations of the company’s terms of service.

<strong>Money is Power</strong>

Chinese investment in American companies is being used to exert influence at unheard-of levels in the United States.

As one of the largest economies in the world, China has used its oligarchy of pseudo-capitalist companies to secretly invest in major foreign corporations. Tencent currently owns significant <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/every-game-company-that-tencent-has-invested-in/">stakes</a> in Riot Games (100%), Epic Games (40%), Ubisoft (5%), and several other North American game companies. AMC Entertainment is <a href="https://money.cnn.com/interactive/economy/chinese-acquisitions-us-companies/">owned</a> by the Dalian Wanda Group. Morgan Stanley is owned by China Investment Corp. Smithfield foods is owned by Shuanghui International. There is nothing necessarily wrong with these purchases by themselves, but these are just some illustrations of the massive holdings Chinese companies have over major Western corporations.

In some sense, a true global market seeks to encourage cross-border investment. There are a number of companies that likely would not have survived without key Chinese investment that occurred in the right place at the right time. But what happens when it goes beyond investment? What happens when those companies are not independent companies seeking growth but are in fact extensions of the nation they come from?

What happens is what we are seeing right now in America. China is imposing Chinese values on the products of American commerce and the law is unequipped to handle it.

China punished the NBA for statements made by an individual in support of a legitimate protest movement. China’s moves to ban South Park were surely designed to put economic pressure on an American entertainment company. China’s control over video game companies gives them massive power over a medium that has created some of the most far-reaching and incredible exchanges of ideas on a scale unprecedented before now.

We have already seen in 2016 the potential chaos that can occur when an external foreign media operation can buy media to affect a US election. China through these various holdings could potentially exert that influence from within. China could create massive media buys through American corporations with virtually no restrictions on that money. The Chinese government can continue to expand its holdings through further subsidiaries and “independent” companies and thoroughly avoid running afoul of antitrust laws.

There is nothing currently equipped to deal with this massive, profitable, and entirely legal influence. There is really very little to compare it to historically either. The East India Trading Company’s rule over India might be analogous, but that lacked the direct government influence we see here. Both the US and the Soviet Union exerted similar dollar diplomacy in the Cold War, but the US provided money and suggestion rather than direct control and the Soviet Union’s satellite states were autonomous in name only.

This is a 21<sup>st</sup> Century problem and will require a 21<sup>st</sup> Century solution, but the most important thing is that we acknowledge that this influence is building and growing and could have grave repercussions in the future.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Rule of Law and Transitional Justice: A New Islamic Discipline</strong>
"<em>The recompense for an injury is an injury equal thereto (in degree): but if a person forgives and makes reconciliation, his reward is due from Allah</em> [God] . . . <em>But indeed, if any show patience and forgive, that would truly be an exercise of courageous will and resolution in the conduct of affairs.</em>" (<em>The Qur'an</em> 42:40-43). Transitional Justice (TJ) is a growing field in Islamic law, being a comprehensive legal system, TJ has addressed in its primary sources, <em>The Qur'an</em> and <em>The Sunnah</em> (Prophetic traditions).

<strong>Politics of Transitional Justice in the Sharie‘a: Mechanisms of TJ</strong>
The mechanisms of Islamic TJ could be classified into three classes: criminal persecution, reconciliation and hybrid system. In the criminal persecution, all crimes are classified into one of three sorts; namely, <em>hudud</em> (God’s [fixed] boundaries), <em>qisas</em> (retribution) and <em>ta‘azir</em> (discretionary punishment). On the other hand, <em>sulh</em> (reconciliation) comprises elements of truth-seeking/fact-telling, compensation (monetary or real), <em>tuwbah</em> (repentance and forgiveness). The hybridity model combines some elements of both criminal prosecution and settlement and is the ideal option to evade a culture of impunity, although it depends on the changing situations and societal context.

<strong>[a] The Islamic Criminal Accountability (Punishment’s Personality)</strong>
Islamic criminal law is based on individual accountability for crimes, and collective punishment is not permitted as a general principle. Islamic jurisprudence among its several schools sets precise circumstances for criminal responsibility with subtle differences. These schools consider crimes “individual, non-transferable and based on [the] conscious intentional conduct of a person possessing his mental faculties who was not acting under extenuating circumstance.” In cases where a criminal activity has been committed, persons and communities are urged to come forth and tell the truth of their responsibility for the crime. Such <em>al-i‘tiraf</em> (confession of culpability) by the offender is the first positive step in any reconciliation process. The Qur’anic texts articulate this principle expressively underscoring to stand for justice regardless of race, religion, relationships, and class and the principle of justice is the cornerstone of the divine TJ, as truth-telling or seeking is fundamental in Islamic legal system.

When the criminal responsibility is established either through voluntary truth-seeking or via criminal investigation, including cross-examination and interrogation, the process of TJ follows the line of retribution or compensation, reconciliation, forgiveness or some other payment(s) based on mutual agreement. To attain the ultimate purpose of justice and community’s unity, offenders must seek regret, repentance, and forgiveness from the victims and this repentance and forgiveness may be accompanied by retribution and compensation.

Under Islamic TJ policy, it is a grave sin for a Muslim to take the life of another person Muslim or non-Muslim, thus, it is not permitted under Sharie‘a to carry out the death penalty either against a Muslim or a non-Muslim, except if the strict evidentiary rules (beyond reasonable doubt) had been fulfilled.

<strong>[b] Elements of the Islamic Criminal Punishment</strong>
An update of the criminal justice system in Islamic law is one of the major challenges that need to be taken up by Muslim scholars, leaders, and governments (who is in power). Punishment and transitional justice are justified in Islamic law by deterrence – either public and specific – retribution, and rehabilitation and to protect society by incapacitating the offender.

<strong>The Islamic Transitional Justice Model: Penalties of <em>Qisas</em> and <em>Ta‘azir</em> (Retributive Justice)</strong>
<em>Qisas</em> (or just retaliation) punishments deal with all forms of murdering and injuries that were committed intentionally. In contrast to the Western criminal laws, <em>Qisas</em> criminal deeds are dealt as civil cases, and four stakeholders should be involved, includes the state (authority), the community (tribe, clan, family), the victims, and perpetrators. On the other hand, the state granted the entire right to use additional sentences such as imprisonment, while the victim or his inheritors (family) in case of his death has the final word on whether to choose the option of retribution or compensation. As another choice, the victim [or] legal guardians may completely forgive and pardon the wrongdoer. According to the Islamic norms, retribution is applicable and allowed in case of intentional murder (homicide, killing) or injury, but accidental killing or non-intentional wounding is excluded, and that, <em>diyyah</em> (blood money or compensations) will be implemented. One should bear in mind that the head of state, judge, and the public prosecutor have no powers to grant amnesty over a private right in <em>qisas</em> per se or its <em>diyyah</em>, even if the victim or his relatives grant a pardon, it doesn’t – in any way – derogate from the government’s power of amnesty or prosecution regarding the public right aspect of <em>qisas</em>, which has obvious consequences on public peace order, and the punishment so imposed partakes in <em>ta‘azir</em>.

Only victims (their representatives) hold the right to prosecute the criminal; so public authorities have no supremacy to interrupt, unlike the Western legal model. For legal reparation, the victim’s family may entail payment within the time period when the exercise of reprisal is still adequate though any reward must meet the prerequisite of the perpetrator’s consent.

On the other hand, the <em>ta‘azir</em> punishment includes all laws that God left for human beings to make their judgment in changing time, space and circumstances, that subject to the discretionary power of the judge and it covers an extensive range of penalties as verbal reprimands, public exposure, corporal punishment, imprisonment, exiling or even execution for serious cases. Thus, most punishments are discretionary in nature and determined according to the society’s local culture, as crimes may infringe God’s rights and may violate an individual’s rights. Thus, all performances (not included in <em>hudud</em>, <em>Qisas</em> or <em>diyya</em>) invading private interests of people or public interests of the community fall under the <em>Ta‘azir</em> category, which imposes an obligation on public authorities to codify rules punishing such acts to match the <em>Siyasah</em> (Sharie‘a-oriented policy). For <em>siyasah</em> vests the authorities to act in accordance with the Sharie‘a spirit and <em>maqasid</em> (objectives) at the expense even of a certain departure from scholastic interpretations and <em>ijtihad</em>.

In the context of TJ and to guarantee a community’s protection and safeguard its welfare, public welfare philosophies permit harsh sanctions. Given the deterrent purpose of punishment, it is subject to specific restrictions, as (a) the culprit must have committed a crime which caused genuine damage to the public order and the harm done must represent an imminent risk or threat to the public interest or order; (b) the core of the punishment must justify the penalty per se, and (c) the reasoning of the sentence must permit for flexibility in each situation to create an adequate and proper protection of the public common good.

<strong>Islamic Restorative (Healing) Justice: <em>Sulh</em> and <em>Twabah</em> (Reconciliation and Forgiveness) </strong>
Restorative justice is about reinstating both the victim and perpetrator of the crimes back into agreement with the community. The spirit of Islamic law accords restorative justice, as it assigns reconciliation values, repentance, and forgiveness to the criminal sentences, in which the crucial objective of the Sharie‘a application is to attain justice among the <em>ummah</em> (community). In this regard, it should be noted that the first step in the <em>sulh</em> (settlement) process is the acknowledgment of accountability and confession by the aggressor, even if conveyed by an excuse for the invasion.

<em>‘afwa</em> (amnesty and pardon) would be irrelevant without the reality of an adverse consequence or punishment. Thus, for pardon without the capability to strike back is equal to vulnerability. Yet reconciling pardon and penalty in the sphere of criminal justice, particularly in a post-conflict setting, poses inquiries often of conflicting interests. In <em>fiqh</em>, <em>‘afwa</em> means a waiver of a duly necessary sentence for wrongdoing − as <em>‘afwa</em> does not always – lead to omission of punishment. Pardon may be granted by an individual or a group of individuals, and by extension also by a corporate body or institution. Also, it may employ amnesty and pardon when there is a substantial contribution of government authorities and forgiveness when the initiative belongs to an individual or a nonstate party, although pardon also stands good with reference to both.

Reconciliation represents the keystone of restorative Islamic TJ. It is used as a curative element of TJ that varies from the criminal proceedings and trials. Settlement under Islamic legal thinking involves three approaches: religious, human rights and communal, and the divine attitude means to reconcile and make peace with the opponent by reaching – in most cases – an agreement between the two disputant parties, as a well-known conflict-resolution mechanism in the MENA region. The Qur’an endorses reconciliation and promises great rewards of God for those who accept compromises and for those who are engaged in achieving them and mediating among individuals. Moreover, the Prophet Mohammad warns against relying only on adjudication, which occasionally includes errors because of the articulacy of one of the litigants.

In juristic terms, <em>sulh</em> is a contractual agreement, which must fulfill three conditions: (1) that the agreed sum is obviously quantified such that excludes ambiguity and ignorance; (2) that it precludes non-halal substances as alcohol; and (3) that it is not about something that cannot be waived or alienated, such as someone else’s share in inheritance.

Nevertheless, in the case of mutual violence or civil conflict, Islamic law offers inclusive mechanisms and clear attitudes. It highlights “peace with justice” as the vital goal, as one of the instruments of reconciliation is <em>al-tahkim</em> (arbitration), which occurs when a third person designated by the parties is involved to resolve their disagreements either through conciliation or adjudication. Accordingly, the conflicting parties use an arbitrator in order to work towards a compromise in case they fail to settle a deal by themselves. Arbitration differs from reconciliation, as the latter represents an amicable agreement that may be reached between the litigants with or without a third party, while in the former, the appointment of a third party is essential. Also, the reconciliation agreement is not binding unless it has taken place before the court, while arbitration is legally binding without court intervention.

Repentance and forgiveness are directly linked to each other. Feelings of regret and guilt are normal reflections of sinning if the person who has sinned has a spiritual-moral conscious, as after committing a sin, the individual who fears God would feel a sense of despondency. In the same vein, the Qur’an speaks of proportionality and equivalence in punishment but espouses it with a recommendation for forgiveness.

<em>Tawbah</em> (repentance) and amnesty are rationally connected, as amnesty is usually due when the criminal shows remorse and repents. Reconciliation, amnesty, and compassion in these passages fall under the Qur’anic principle of <em>ihsan</em> (benevolence), which are extremely considered and preferred, whenever suitable, to exacting and punitive attitudes, and even <em>‘adl </em>(justice).

Based on the general rule, in both the Islamic and modern criminal law, the criminal legislation should be interpreted in favor of the accused and on the side of leniency, and Muslim scholars are almost unanimous that a valid repentance must be indicative of remorse over what has happened; expressive of determination not to repeat the conduct in question; and that there is no actual recurrence. Regarding the <em>taqadum</em> (statute of limitations) in the reconciliation process, it could be practiced by the individual or government and expires, if at all, after a lapse of the time period in which no action is taken by any of the parties concerned. The major Islamic schools argue, however, on <em>ta‘azir</em> offences, which are subject to the discretionary powers of the public authorities who may decide not to prosecute them – based on the public interest – as they have powers to grant amnesty regarding either the punishment, crime, or both, at any time.

Modern scholars concluded that the head of state is within his rights to determine time limits for acceptance or otherwise of the witnesses’ testimony – if this be the sole means of proof – for the offence. It should be noted that the opening of Makkah (birthplace of Mohammad) is placed in the historical roots of the application of Islamic TJ in Islam. Subsequently, Prophet Mohammad applied the Islamic tools of TJ as he, (a) criminally persecuted five persons as of their heinous crimes were unforgiveable; (b) pardoned three individuals after declaring their criminal persecution as of community interference to request their pardon; (c) announced public amnesty to all the folks of Makkah, and (d) demanded for a complete reform of the institutions (military and security forces), as new institutions should be created on the achievements of Islamic <em>ummah</em>’s (community) welfare.

Therefore, any implementation of the Islamic Sharie‘a in the Muslim World – especially TJ mechanisms and processes – should only be made with a cognizance of the multiple schools of Islamic jurisprudence based on the principle of <em>ihktlaf</em> (legal pluralism) according to the Shaf‘i school of thought, as both religious and the political authority are fit to rule on difficult legal cases.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>
The Sharie‘a is often characterized as a ‘diversity within unity.’ Diversity is due to a degree of flexibility and openness in the textual language of the Qur’an, to moderate interpretation and ijtihad. Yet if it were to recall its vitality and significance, the Sharie‘a entails to be read side by side with the altering facets of social reality and the living conditions of the general public. It is vital to know the juristic details of <em>fiqh</em> and how Muslim scholars have tried to contextualize the source strategies of Islamic norms with their own conditions and realities. <em>Hudud </em>and <em>qisas</em> laws still establish the backbone of Islamic criminal law and can barely be dismissed altogether in the name of modernity and change, or of amnesty and reconciliation. Yet, the realities of criminal justice system and that of the nation that now prevail are symbolic of discontinuity, in some respects, with the <em>fiqh</em> details of <em>hudud</em> and <em>qisas</em>.

The prevalence of <em>taqlid</em> for several centuries and then of colonial rule interrupted the continuity of Sharie‘a, scriptural interpretation and <em>ijtihad</em>. But since the realization of public welfare, peace and normal order constitute the basic <em>maqasid</em> of Islamic law, all bona fide efforts that do not compromise the integrity of truth and justice and seek to put an end to conflict command Sharie‘a validity. It is suitable to the overwhelming mutual population and offers the best option if collective with traditional customs pragmatically and the belief must be in divine justice before earthly justice.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Everything old is new again, and court-packing is no exception. In 1937, faced with a conservative Supreme Court that consistently invalidated his <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/great-depression/new-deal">New Deal</a> legislation, President Roosevelt announced a plan to increase the size of the court and add justices who would rule in his favor. It was a bridge too far. While Roosevelt’s plan may have flipped the Supreme Court by encouraging Justice Roberts to vote in favor of New Deal legislation, its failure in Congress was a humiliating defeat that destroyed much of Roosevelt’s political capital.

Today, Democrats once again face a conservative Supreme Court, determined to invalidate progressive legislation and reverse progressive precedents. Many prominent Democrats have revived the idea of court-packing, including several presidential candidates. Senator Warren has suggested adding justices to the Supreme Court, and Senators Gillibrand and Harris are also willing to consider court-packing. As Warren explained, “It’s not just about expansion, it’s about depoliticizing the Supreme Court,” which could restore the Court’s legitimacy.

We disagree. Court-packing cannot solve our constitutional crisis, because it simply reinforces our fundamentally broken constitutional order. It is impossible to depoliticize the Supreme Court, because the Supreme Court is fundamentally a political institution. When people decry the politicization of the Supreme Court, they are really just upset that its decisions don’t reflect their political preferences. Democrats complain about the politicization of the Supreme Court only because it is currently dominated by Republicans, just like Republicans complained when it was dominated by Democrats.

Indeed, Republicans dominate the Supreme Court because of politics. For better or worse, Republican presidents have occupied the White House for 31 of the past 50 years. Unsurprisingly, they have nominated conservative judges and justices likely to make conservative rulings. And they have increasingly focused on populating the federal judiciary. President Trump nominated not only two of the current Supreme Court justices, but also <a href="https://www.acslaw.org/press_release/one-quarter-of-judiciary-has-now-been-nominated-by-trump/">a quarter of sitting circuit court judges</a>.

As a consequence, Republicans have won innumerable political victories in the Supreme Court and in the lower courts. In <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/dc-v-heller/">Heller v. DC</a>, the Court dramatically expanded the scope of the Second Amendment right to bear arms, in <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/citizens-united-v-federal-election-commission/">Citizens United v. FEC</a> it eliminated most regulations on political campaign spending, and in ruling after ruling courts have blocked antitrust enforcement, among many other things.

Of course, Democrats have scored some political victories as well. Most notably, in <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/obergefell-v-hodges/">Obergefell v. Hodges</a> the Supreme Court held that the Constitution protects same-sex marriage. But for every Obergefell there are countless conservative decisions weakening the Voting Rights Act, undermining labor unions, and gutting environmental regulations. As Mr. Dooley famously observed, the Supreme Court generally follows the election returns.

As a consequence, Democrats are in an ideological pickle. Decades of cultivating the power of the Supreme Court, when they controlled it, created a political institution of immense power, which they no longer control. As Samuel Moyn observed, “Because of the cult of the higher judiciary, Democrats find themselves facing an all-powerful institution set to impose its will on a majority of Americans who would decide things differently.” But what should they do now?

The court-packing plans on offer do nothing to mitigate the fundamental problem, and may even make it worse. Packing the Supreme Court with ideologically appealing justices only doubles-down on the cult of the judiciary and perpetuates the rule of what Sanford Levinson called “Our Undemocratic Constitution.” If we believe in democratic legitimacy, we should rely on democratic institutions to make political decisions, not jockey to fill an undemocratic institution like the Supreme Court with puppet judges. Important decisions about our public policy should come from the ballot box, not judicial fiat.

If we want to fix the Supreme Court, rather than simply score political points, we have to focus on the political institution it actually is, rather than the imaginary apolitical institution we pretend it can be. Hans Jonas described Gnosticism as the “acute Hellenization of Christianity.” One might describe the ideological history of the United States as the acute legalization of constitutionalism. We have come to fetishize the Constitution as the source of fundamental law and the Supreme Court as its ultimate exegete. But a court cannot make a constitutional decision, only the people can.

Ironically, Mayor Buttigieg is the only Democratic presidential candidate to propose an interesting plan for reforming the Supreme Court. His “Balanced Bench” plan would expand the Supreme Court to 15 justices, consisting of 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 5 justices selected by the unanimous agreement of the other 10 justices. According to Buttigieg, his plan would depoliticize the Supreme Court by introducing checks and balances.

Unsurprisingly, Buttigieg’s plan was met with well-deserved ridicule. It is both politically unrealistic and possibly unconstitutional, whatever that means. But it is still interesting, not because it could be realized, but because of what it says about the institutional role of the Supreme Court, and what it should be. As it stands, the Supreme Court enjoys public approval ratings far exceeding any other political branch. This is surely a function of a mistaken belief that the Supreme Court is an institution above politics. Transforming the Supreme Court into an explicitly political institution would destroy its undeserved credibility, probably for the better.

Notably, Buttigieg’s plan is based on one of the proposals advanced by law professors Daniel Epps and Ganesh Sitaraman in their forthcoming Yale Law Journal article “How to Save the Supreme Court.” Their thought experiments are intended to encourage us to think about the ideological role of the Supreme Court, and how we can square it with our political goals. Perhaps the only way to save the Supreme Court is by destroying it? Only when the Court’s reputation declines to single-digit approval ratings, like every other political branch, will we be able to wrestle public policy away from the tyranny of gavels.

After slaying Goliath in judges’ robes, we should also think critically about the roots of this crisis. Why have we failed to produce a political model that doesn’t include turns at trying to whack the other side with the full force of the state power after every election? Why do we tolerate federalism, a Senate that represents a shrinking minority of the American population, the electoral college, or gerrymandering? Perhaps the organizational principle of our politics is flawed. Our acutely legalized and historically unmoored Constitution appears to be buckling under the strain of current events.

That problem can’t be solved with court packing.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span>The most recent disciplinary order issued against a federal judge vividly demonstrates a major shortcoming of the federal judicial disciplinary system—transparency.</span>

<span>In September, the <a href="https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/ce/misconduct">Judicial Council of the Tenth Circuit</a> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_MZT26U0JzVOfLF8IOG66Vf5ljCZyBxt/view">publicly reprimanded</a> Kansas federal district court judge <a href="http://ksd.uscourts.gov/index.php/judge/carlos-murguia/">Carlos Murguia.</a> The judge’s offenses included “sexually harassing Judiciary </span><span>employees,” habitually tardiness, and an extramarital affair. To the detriment of public confidence in both the judiciary and the judicial disciplinary process, the disciplinary order provides few specifics about the judge’s misconduct.</span>

<b><span>Sexual Harassment</span></b>

<span>Only vague generalities accompany the Judicial Council’s finding that the judge subjected female employees to “unwanted attention.” The order states that Judge Murguia was guilty of "</span><span>sexually suggestive comments, inappropriate text messages, and excessive, non-work-related contact, much of which occurred after work hours and often late at night."</span>

<span>What was the precise nature and frequency of these acts of misconduct? Were the late-night contact visits at employees’ homes? How late is “late.” What did the judge say in his “comments [and] inappropriate text messages”? How explicit were the communications? Were the messages threatening in any way? The Tenth Circuit Judicial Council devotes more words to describing the ethics provisions violated by Murguia than to describing the misdeeds themselves.</span>

<b><span>Habitual Tardiness to Court</span></b>

<span>The Council also found that although he</span><span> was counseled about tardiness “fairly early in his federal judicial career,” </span><span>Judge Murguia “has been habitually late for court proceedings and meetings for years.</span><span>” Noticeably absent from the order is any mention of the frequency with which the judge left courtroom participants waiting. Since Murguia was sworn in as a federal judge in 1999, the misuse of lawyers, staff, witnesses, and jurors’ time could have continued for nearly two decades. The Council only identifies one cause of the judge’s lack of punctuality—</span><span>his regularly scheduled lunchtime basketball games. Nothing indicates the frequency of the games or how late the judge began afternoon court sessions. Nor do we know how often the judge was late for other reasons. In one bit of irony left unmentioned by the Tenth Circuit Judicial Council, the opening sentence of the “Guidelines for Counsel Appearing in Judge Carlos Murguia’s Courtroom,” posted on the court’s website states: “B</span><span>e timely for each court session. Trial engagements take precedence over any other business.”</span>

<b><span>Extramarital Affair</span></b>

<span>The Tenth Circuit found that the judge </span><span>engaged “in a years-long extramarital sexual relationship with a drug-using individual who was then on probation and is now incarcerated (because of probation violations) for state-court felony convictions.”</span>

<span>The Council hastened to add that an extramarital affair, even with a felon, does not always constitute judicial misconduct. Consistent with the other findings, the order fails to identify the circumstances that transformed Judge Murguia’s affair from a permissible personal relationship into sanctionable misconduct. Was it the fact that the paramour was a drug-user, or on probation, or incarcerated for a probation violation, or that the judge was married, or that the affair was secret rather than open?</span><span></span>

<b><span>Transparency and Disincentives</span></b>

<span>What makes the disciplinary order’s lack of specifics stick out like a sore thumb is the Council’s concluding statement that “misconduct that rises to this level calls for transparency and a powerful disincentive.” But the goal of transparency is defeated when the facts supporting the discipline are hidden. Even worse, there is no “powerful disincentive” other than an embarrassing, detailed description of the misconduct since the most severe sanction available to a federal disciplinary council is a public reprimand. The Council did send a “private letter” to the judge requiring him “to take certain corrective actions.” Unsurprisingly, the “corrective actions” are not described. Was the judge merely advised to join a basketball league that played later in the day, or was he required to undergo counseling, or complete education in employee harassment, or write letters of apology, or have no contact with certain court staff? Why is the public not entitled to consider this information in accessing the integrity of its judiciary and the effectiveness of the body charged with investigating and disciplining judges?</span>

<span>The explanation for the truncated disciplinary order seems to be the Council’s desire to avoid embarrassing the judiciary. Indeed, the Council laments that the order, even as vague as it is, may damage the reputation of the judicial branch.  And maybe that lament is inevitable when judges, rather than independent actors, control the judicial disciplinary process. Disciplinary bodies must recognize that no canon or rule of judicial conduct even </span><span>suggests that potential embarrassment should factor into a decision whether to discipline a judge, the nature of the discipline, or the content of the disciplinary order. Disciplinary orders must be written to inform the public and not to protect the reputation of the judicial branch.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There’s a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2011/oct/09/ten-best-woody-allen-in-pictures">joke</a> about a group of friends finishing up their meal at a local restaurant. One friend puts down the cutlery, pushes back the chair, and declares with conviction: “this food was bad and the portions were too small.” And so it is with the Paris Climate Change agreement. The Paris Agreement is bad in terms of doing much to mitigate climate change, and yet, it would be good to have more of the same. This might explain the relative quiet after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/climate/trump-paris-climate-agreement.html">President Trump began the process of withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement</a> on November 4<sup>th</sup>.

From a legal and scientific standpoint, the President’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement amounts to little. The Paris Agreement itself <a href="https://www.climatechangenews.com/2017/11/02/paris-climate-deal-legally-binding-not/">never required a reduction in climate-change-causing greenhouse gases</a>. Instead, the Agreement requires signatories merely to have plans for how they hope to reduce greenhouse gases. These plans are called <a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs">Nationally Determined Contributions</a> (NDCs). Every five years, nations that participate in the Agreement must revisit their NDCs and propose more stringent plans for reducing emissions. But, critically, while the plans must become stricter, <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/paris-climate-agreement-everything-you-need-know">the Paris Agreement nowhere demands that emissions actually decrease</a>. In fact, even the NDCs themselves are not binding. Each signatory country must propose NDCs, but there is no mandate that each signatory country also follow their own plans.

Why, then, did President Trump withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement or why, in the first instance, did President Obama join the Agreement? On both counts the answer is clearly not because the Agreement would transform domestic or international climate law. On both counts the answer is politics. There’s nothing wrong with that. Politics are important.

To President Obama, joining the Paris Agreement advanced <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2016/09/03/president-obama-united-states-formally-enters-paris-agreement">several political goals</a>. Joining the Agreement, but legally committing to very little, was nevertheless an important diplomatic advance, demonstrating that the United States and China could operate collaboratively as the world’s largest emitters, that the U.S. and China could be both economic competitors and collaborators. The Agreement further demonstrated the President’s commitment to environmental protection. Though the Paris Agreement did not bind the U.S. to any emissions reductions, it signaled to actors within the U.S., states, local governments, corporations, executive agencies, even Congress, that the issue of climate change was important and that there was a high-profile framework for recognizing and structuring action even as that framework did not mandate action. Had the agreement been meaningfully binding, it would have required Senate approval as a new treaty. That was not going to happen, but President Obama saw value even in the voluntary framework and its political signals.

To President Trump, withdrawing from the Paris Agreement <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-president-trump-paris-climate-accord/">advanced several political goals</a> that run counter to President Obama’s. President Trump has framed the relationship with China in <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/us-china-clash-on-trade-as-trump-threatens-more-tariffs-2019-11-1028690892">different terms</a>. By rejecting the Paris Agreement and through import tariffs, as just two examples, President Trump signals that America’s success is China’s loss, and vice versa. Paris was a gesture toward cooperation, which does not fit within the zero-sum framing with respect to China or international relations more broadly. Likewise, President Trump <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/12/trump-climate-timeline/">has rejected the basic existence of climate change</a>. Though the Paris Agreement does not force the United States to reduce emissions, remaining engaged in an agreement premised on the threat of climate change makes little sense when President Trump has repeatedly asserted that climate change is no threat, no cause for action, even tepid action. Perhaps, then, the withdrawal is also a symbolic promise to other actors within the U.S. that climate action need not be a priority. Indeed, in announcing the withdrawal, Secretary of State Pompeo pointed to “<a href="https://twitter.com/SecPompeo/status/1191455541052289024">growing our economy</a>” as one of the Administration’s goals. The Paris Agreement alone would have no economic impact, but the rhetoric of growth signals political priorities. Priorities that different actors within the U.S. might then choose to take up for themselves.

Other actors have indeed taken up priorities based on President Trump’s efforts to move away from protective climate policy. This happened perhaps not exactly as the President had expected, however. Sub-national actors such as states and cities, as well as non-national actors, such as corporate leaders, have noticed President Trump’s climate actions and have responded with equal and opposite reactions. The <a href="https://www.wearestillin.com/">We Are Still In</a> coalition is the perfect example. This group of “mayors, county executives, governors, tribal leaders, college and university leaders, businesses, faith groups, cultural institutions, healthcare organizations, and investors” has united to continue pushing for climate action under the Paris framework even as the U.S. is officially headed in the other direction. We Are Still In <a href="https://www.wearestillin.com/signatories">includes big names</a> like Apple, McDonald’s, Microsoft, and Starbucks. Why are they still in? Politics.  Perhaps they want to see federal and global action and this coalition will push leaders in that direction. Perhaps they want to promote their reputation as good corporate citizens. Perhaps, like President Trump, they want to avoid national and global action and they hope by spreading sub-national and non-state leadership they are taking control of the conversation, steering it in a more libertarian direction.

The Paris Agreement isn’t a great meal. It doesn’t move far enough or fast enough on an existential global problem, but it's better to have a lousy meal than to go hungry. With Paris, we may have some climate sustenance. Without Paris, the question becomes whether the politics of withdrawal will leave us to starve, will leave us fed but malnourished, or will force us to find food elsewhere, perhaps shaping an new era of climate politics.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For those inclined to question whether Donald Trump would actually be so brazen as to straight up take over the apparatus of U.S. foreign policy purely to boost his own reelection prospects, bear this in mind. We already know that Donald Trump is willing to hijack an entity organized to serve the public interest and use it to gain election to the Presidency of the United States of America. This is what he did with the Donald J. Trump Foundation in 2016. Trump’s wrongdoing related to this charitable foundation models the wrongdoing evidenced by much of the testimony in the House impeachment inquiry. In fact, the two have an eerie similarity.

In 1988, Donald Trump <a href="https://www.charitiesnys.com/RegistrySearch/show_details.jsp?id=%7bC7B8C63B-12A6-4301-AAEE-C776E9B58A86%7d">organized the Donald J. Trump Foundation</a> under New York state law as a not-for-profit private foundation. From <a href="https://www.charitiesnys.com/RegistrySearch/show_details.jsp?id=%7bC7B8C63B-12A6-4301-AAEE-C776E9B58A86%7d">1988 through 2017</a>, Trump served as a director of the foundation. As a not-for-profit under New York state law, a charity <a href="https://www.dos.ny.gov/corps/nfpfaq.asp#special">may not</a> engage in activity for the personal benefit of a particular individual.  More especially, the corporation’s assets, income or profit <a href="https://codes.findlaw.com/ny/notforprofit-corporation-law/npc-sect-102.html">may not</a> be distributed to or otherwise used to benefit the corporation’s members, directors or officers. These restrictions reflect a basic tenet of corporate charities: in exchange for the freedom to solicit donations and distribute funds, the corporate entity must not profit specific private individuals, especially those charged with making sure the charity carries out its public-regarding mission. <a href="https://www.charitiesnys.com/faqs_reg_new.html">Charities are for the public good</a>.

In a <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=JLJih9v_PLUS_EKSuJs36THzexg==&amp;system=prod">stipulated settlement</a> with the New York State Attorney General, Donald Trump agreed that he <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=JLJih9v_PLUS_EKSuJs36THzexg==&amp;system=prod">repeatedly used the foundation</a> to make payments to serve his private purposes. One instance stands out because it demonstrates Trump’s willingness to misuse an entity organized exclusively for public service to gain his private ambition of election to the U.S. presidency.

In January of 2016, Donald Trump announced he <a href="//www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election/trump-pulls-out-of-republican-debate-in-iowa-idUSKCN0V502J">would not participate</a> in a televised debate with other candidates seeking the Republican nomination for president. The debate was the last such event before the Iowa caucuses. Trump withdrew in part because of his <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2016/01/26/trump-probably-wont-bother-thursdays-gop-debate/79374962/">hostility toward</a> moderator Megyn Kelly. Instead, he decided to <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/2016/01/27/donald-trump-to-skip-gop-debate-hold-fundraiser-for-wounded-troops-instead/">hold his own event</a>, a fundraiser in Iowa, billed as the “Donald J. Trump Special Event for Veterans.” Trump’s presidential <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=JLJih9v_PLUS_EKSuJs36THzexg==&amp;system=prod">campaign developed a website</a> for the event which featured the name of the foundation and informed visitors that the foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. The campaign <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=JLJih9v_PLUS_EKSuJs36THzexg==&amp;system=prod">planned, organized, and paid for the fundraiser</a>, and <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2018/06/14/donald-trump-foundation-iowa-caucus-illegal-conduct-lawsuit/701564002/">the campaign directed the timing, sums, and recipients</a> of the foundation’s eventual grants made from donations received via the fundraiser. In January and February, Trump held campaign events where he displayed copies of checks from the foundation payable to veterans’ groups in Iowa. In May, during a campaign press conference, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/05/30/tomorrow-trump-will-give-more-details-about-his-donations-to-vets-heres-what-we-still-dont-know/">Trump announced</a> grants the foundation made to veterans’ groups from the proceeds of the January fundraiser. At the same time, the campaign <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/05/31/480163943/questions-over-trumps-donations-to-veterans-boil-over">posted these grant recipients</a> on its website.

This series of events demonstrates how Trump co-opted an entity legally required to serve the public good to advance his personal presidential election campaign. New York state judge Saliann Scarpula singled out this misconduct when, on November 7, 2019, she <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6542055/Trump-Foundation-Restitution-Decision-Nov-7-2019.pdf">ordered</a> Trump personally to pay $2 million in restitution for abusing his position as a director of the Donald J. Trump Foundation.

Note the parallels to Trump’s conduct under investigation by the <a href="https://intelligence.house.gov/documents/whistleblower-complaint-documents.htm">U.S. House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence</a>.

The U.S. government has well established political and legal channels for conducting foreign policy and allocating aid to foreign countries; such aid is delivered for the sake of public objectives, such as advancing U.S. interests in world politics or for humanitarian reasons. In the case of Ukraine, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/us/politics/william-taylor-opening-statement-impeachment.html">U.S. aid supports a country</a> whose developing democracy is menaced by Russia, a country hostile to the U.S. and its allies. Rather than allowing U.S. aid to flow to Ukraine within usual channels, Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/top-state-department-official-expected-to-face-questions-about-ukraine-and-giuliani/2019/10/14/8ba23d18-eeca-11e9-b2da-606ba1ef30e3_story.html">apparently directed</a> U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, then Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, and U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry to take over. Their <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/gordon-sondland-testimony-in-opening-statement-ambassador-implicates-officials-quid-pro-quo/">mission</a> was to get Ukraine to announce an investigation into former Vice-President Joe Biden, a strong contender for the Democratic nomination for President in the 2020 elections. Such an announcement <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/gordon-sondland-testimony-in-opening-statement-ambassador-implicates-officials-quid-pro-quo/">was a precondition</a> for the newly elected Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to have a White House meeting with Trump and for Trump to <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/sondland-says-ukraine-aid-was-tied-to-quid-pro-quo-in-impeachment-testimony-2019-11-20">greenlight the transfer</a> of Congressionally appropriated funds to Ukraine.

By creating a back-channel to orchestrate whether Ukraine received already Congressionally appropriated funds and conditioning receipt of those funds on Ukraine’s announcing a prosecutorial investigation into Joe Biden, Trump <a href="//www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/hill-dismisses-sondlands-ukraine-work-as-domestic-political-errand-not-foreign-policy">co-opted a process</a> dedicated to public objectives to serve his personal interests in getting reelected. The back-channel is to U.S. foreign policy what the 2016 Trump campaign was to the Donald J. Trump Foundation: an apparatus for taking over an officially public-serving enterprise and convert it to serve the personal ambitions of Donald Trump. Sondland, Volker, and Perry are to career diplomats what Corey Lewandowski, <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Donald_Trump_presidential_campaign_key_staff_and_advisors,_2016">the 2016 Trump Campaign manager</a> selected by Roger Stone, was to anybody with professional charitable organization experience at the Trump Foundation. In both situations, the personnel running the show were totally inappropriate for the job, not only because their loyalties were to Trump’s personal interests rather than any public-serving mission. In both settings, the people Trump assigned to do the work lack even the veneer of expertise necessary to do the official job – responsible U.S.-Ukrainian relations for Sondland and Perry and charitable fundraising and grant-making for Lewandowski.

Moreover, just as the Ukrainian government was apparently pressured to serve Trump’s interests, so too were third parties touched by the Trump campaign fundraiser. At least <a href="https://nonprofitquarterly.org/trump-donation-to-vets-charity-one-grantees-experience/">one grantee</a> was given the impression that the grant was conditioned on appearing at Trump campaign political event. While that grantee accepted the money and refused the appearance, other veterans’ organizations <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/29/trump-skips-debate-raises-6m-for-vets.html">were loath</a> to get <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/veterans-groups-to-donald-trump-dont-hide-behind-us/">caught up</a> in Trump’s political efforts at all and refused money from the Iowa fundraiser altogether.

The pivotal difference between Trump’s misuse of his position as director of the Donald J. Trump Foundation and his misuse of the office of the Presidency lies in whether and how he will be held accountable for the latter. Prompted by tenacious and creative <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-ordered-to-pay-2-million-to-charities-over-misuse-of-foundation-court-documents-say/2019/11/07/b8f804e2-018e-11ea-9518-1e76abc088b6_story.html">reporting</a>, especially by the Washington Post’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/david-a-fahrenthold/">David A. Fahrenthold</a>, the New York State Attorney General was able to make such a strong case under New York state laws pertaining to <a href="https://codes.findlaw.com/ny/notforprofit-corporation-law/">not-for-profits</a> and <a href="https://codes.findlaw.com/ny/estates-powers-and-trusts-law/">charities</a> that Trump settled rather than fight. The settlement required the dissolution of the Trump Foundation, an agreement from Trump to submit to close supervision by the State Attorney General should he ever form another not-for-profit in New York, and the $2 million restitution payment. The misconduct to which Trump stipulated <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-his-foundation-were-just-forced-admit-their-fraud-now-ncna1081906">may eventually</a> give rise to federal tax penalties and even an Internal Revenue Service audit.

When it comes to Trump’s efforts to commandeer U.S. foreign policy to serve his personal interests, the mechanisms of accountability are not as clear cut and the potential consequences of conceding the facts are greater. Despite the information provided by witness testimony to the House Select Committee, Trump is unlikely to do the equivalent of settling the current dispute, which would be to resign the office of the Presidency in light of strong evidence that he sought to convert American foreign policy into a tool for his reelection. As of this writing, the Republican-dominated Senate continues to seem unlikely to play the role of the New York Attorney General and the New York court, which would be to convict Trump of treason, bribery, high crimes and misdemeanors or some combination of these.

What remains to be seen is whether Trump makes it to the 2020 Presidential Election ballot and if the electorate denies him a second term. Of course, that mechanism of accountability is precisely the one Trump is now allegedly attempting to wrongfully influence, this time by usurping U.S. foreign policy and foreign aid in the service of his own ambitions to remain in office.

		<title>The PACT Act:  A Step in the Right Direction on the Path to Animal Welfare</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Nine years ago, President Obama signed into law a bill proscribing the distribution of so-called “<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-111shrg64411/html/CHRG-111shrg64411.htm">animal crush</a>” videos, which are depictions of a practice that is as disturbing as it sounds: the killing of animals (puppies, kittens, mice, bunnies, goats, and others) slowly and excruciatingly, often by provocatively-dressed women who stand on the animals while wearing high heels that they use, along with other objects, as instruments of torture. The video creators would then sell the recordings, typically to people who derive sexual gratification from watching them.  “Animal crushing” is behavior that Supreme Court Justice Alito aptly <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/559/460/">described</a> as “horrific,” “depraved,” and having “no social value.”

But that law only banned the distribution of animal crush videos, not the actual cruelty itself. Those who wanted to abuse animals in that way could continue to do so without express penalty under federal law; they just could not film it and sell the videos in interstate commerce.

Animal crushing falls within the purview of state anticruelty laws, which typically ban purposefully and unjustifiably torturing, maiming, or causing serious physical injury to animals. State laws are notoriously <a href="https://aldf.org/article/charging-considerations-in-criminal-animal-abuse-cases/">inconsistent</a> in how they define and how severely they punish animal cruelty, however, with some states classifying even acts as appalling as animal crushing as misdemeanor offenses. And even in a state with stronger anticruelty provisions, limited resources may force a prosecutor to relegate animal cases to the bottom of the list of priorities.

No federal law focuses directly on general acts of cruelty. The federal <a href="https://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/animal-welfare-act">Animal Welfare Act</a> (AWA) contains provisions addressing animal fighting and puppy mills and sets minimum standards for the treatment of animals used in entertainment and scientific research, but the AWA does not prohibit intentional cruelty outside of those contexts. Without a federal anticruelty law, people who commit deliberate acts of animal abuse can be <a href="https://blog.humanesociety.org/2019/11/breaking-news-pact-act-passes-u-s-senate-two-weeks-after-clearing-house-bill-now-awaits-trumps-signature.html">extremely difficult to prosecute</a> if they do so on federal land, when transporting animals across state lines, or when posting on the internet.

Congress finally took action this fall to help remedy these problems when it passed the Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture (PACT) Act, which the President <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/26/politics/donald-trump-animal-cruelty-act-signed-trnd/index.html">signed into law</a> this week. The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/724/text">PACT Act</a> amplifies the limited power of the 2010 law and criminalizes the underlying cruelty itself, providing an avenue for federal prosecutors to reach animal abuse beyond the particularized practices outlawed by the AWA. The PACT Act received overwhelming bipartisan <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2019/11/senate-unanimously-passes-pact-act-against-extreme-animal-cruelty/">support</a>, reflecting recognition of increasing <a href="https://blog.marketresearch.com/animal-welfare-an-increasing-concern-for-consumers">public concern</a> for animal welfare and established <a href="https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/animal-cruelty-and-human-violence-faq">studies</a> proving that those who commit acts of animal cruelty are likely to segue to acts of violence against humans.  Co-sponsor Senator Pat Toomey <a href="https://www.toomey.senate.gov/?p=op_ed&amp;id=2520">termed</a> the Act “a major victory in the effort to stop animal cruelty and make our communities safer.”

Importantly, while the PACT Act forbids conduct like that depicted in crush videos, the abuser’s motivation is irrelevant as long as the abuse is intentional and unjustified. (An example of justified intentional harm to an animal is customary veterinary practice.) The Act defines “animal crushing” broadly, encompassing any conduct that causes serious bodily injury to an animal, regardless of whether the abuser meant to engage in “crushing” specifically. Further, applicability is not reserved for those who torture animals for sexual gratification, which usually is the purpose of crush videos. Thus, the PACT Act enables federal prosecutors to press charges against more animal abusers than only those who crush animals, or who participate in animal fighting, operate puppy mills, etc. And those federal charges may lead to penalties considerably steeper than those permitted by state laws, including federal imprisonment of up to seven years.

The PACT Act also defines “animal” more expansively than <a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=112001112005004073030121005122020071053009053038065056030072018066021090100007091094098007039126015013042084121031026076114115027039038017006094064004065007125007093039032030001089104124027010106028026117005120098087090103106066078091002005114099125071&amp;EXT=pdf">the AWA</a>, which excludes mice, rats, birds, and other species from many of its protections. The PACT Act bans crushing, burning, drowning, suffocating, impaling, or otherwise subjecting serious bodily injury upon “one or more living non-human mammals, birds, reptiles, or amphibians.” It also references other federal laws that define “<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title18/pdf/USCODE-2011-title18-partI-chap65-sec1365.pdf">serious bodily injury</a>” as it relates to humans, and that prohibit <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title18/part1/chapter109A&amp;edition=prelim">sexual abuse</a> against humans. Those fighting for laws to protect animal welfare may find this heartening, at least analogically, as it suggests that the federal government may be willing to expressly accept that human and nonhuman animal suffering is not dissimilar.

While the Act will not interfere with state anticruelty measures, it may nonetheless provide a useful model. Some degree of ambiguity in statutory language can be beneficial, such as referring generally to causing “serious bodily injury” instead of listing only specific acts, but the “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/07/777280602/trump-is-expected-to-sign-bill-making-animal-cruelty-a-federal-crime">patchwork</a>” of anticruelty laws at the state level can lead to one defendant receiving considerably different punishment in one state than a defendant in a neighboring state who committed the same crime. Though not required to do so, states may look to the PACT Act as a guide and update their laws to bring greater uniformity to their provisions concerning intentional cruelty; and because the Act imposes more severe punishments than do many states, any potential changes likely would prove advantageous to animal welfare. Additionally, the United States now joins a growing number of countries willing to ban intentional, unjustified cruelty at a national level. This may help influence the governments of <a href="https://www.globalanimallaw.org/database/national/index.html">foreign countries</a> with less strict animal cruelty laws—or no animal cruelty laws at all—to draft similar provisions.

Legislators, law enforcement, and animal welfare organizations all justifiably <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2019/11/senate-unanimously-passes-pact-act-against-extreme-animal-cruelty/">laud</a> the PACT Act as a major milestone in the fight against animal cruelty.  There is more distance still to cover on the road to animal welfare, however. For instance, the Act does not mention neglect, even though neglect may cause even worse, more drawn-out <a href="https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/animal-cruelty-and-neglect-faq#criminal">pain and anguish</a> for the animal victims. In fact, neglect cases like <a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=967113064118004117126100009109021122030015030047000031018016078096021070028002012106026119119003010032035025084026023107010076121007043047074118000125005097027065087003020075086085023014085012004073006007122081116025124087101001025113072020118088112000&amp;EXT=pdf">hoarding</a> harm more animals each year than all acts of intentional cruelty combined. While addressing intentional abuse certainly is a start, incorporating neglect would make the PACT Act more complete and effective in protecting animal welfare at the federal level.

Consistent with most state anticruelty laws, the PACT Act also explicitly exempts several practices from liability: veterinary procedures, hunting and other legal sporting activities, actions to protect a person or property, scientific research, and animal husbandry and slaughter. Creating exceptions is logical and necessary, but the language in the Act may excuse a considerable amount of arguably unnecessary suffering. For example, certain scientific animal experimentation methods are both antiquated and ineffective, as reflected by regulations in <a href="https://www.navs.org/what-we-do/keep-you-informed/legal-arena/product-testing/worldwide-progress/#.XdmEIy2ZM4o">other countries</a> and even the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s own <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/administrator-wheeler-signs-memo-reduce-animal-testing-awards-425-million-advance">memo</a> directing a reduction in animal testing in favor of alternative methods. And while some of the horrific acts of cruelty against livestock highlighted in <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/1/11/18176551/ag-gag-laws-factory-farms-explained">undercover videos</a> of slaughterhouses and factory farms may fall under the purview of the Act, customary <a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=787119070001117026000122030088065068125005068013093026075075125088100086100100115085029055063104039010060025127009007093006102019036075005000008109023028123070102005018033044104064113023025105009126099113076067099003100098026084064088019093022090102093&amp;EXT=pdf">procedures</a> such as non-sedated amputation and intensive overcrowding most likely would not. Moreover, while Act supporters correctly note that animal abusers are more likely to progress to harming humans, studies also show that factory farm workers—whose jobs subject them to daily repeated violence against animals and the suppression of natural empathy—also are more likely to engage in <a href="http://www.animalstudies.msu.edu/Slaughterhouses_and_Increased_Crime_Rates.pdf">violent crimes against humans</a>.

According to co-sponsor Ted <a href="https://teddeutch.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=402687">Deutch</a>, the PACT Act “sends a clear message that our society does not accept cruelty to animals.” To truly live up to this standard, the Act ideally would expand its protections beyond only intentional acts of abuse and tighten its exemptions.  That is a tall order for any law, however, especially the first of its kind on the federal stage. For now, proponents of animal welfare can rest assured that the federal government is taking steps in the right direction.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[What does it mean to discriminate because of sex? The answer to that question has become increasingly important to gay and lesbian employees challenging employment discrimination under federal and state laws. Take the case of Keith Wildhaber, a St. Louis County, Missouri police officer, who, in October 2019, <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2019/10/st-louis-police-officer-awarded-nearly-20-million-after-being-told-to-tone-down-his-gayness/">won a lawsuit</a> he filed against his employer for sex discrimination and retaliation under Missouri law. Wildhaber, who was referred to as "fruity" and told "to tone down [his] gayness," did not claim his employer harbored ill will towards him because he was a man. Rather, he argued that because of his status as a gay man, in the eyes of his employer, he failed to act like a man should act.

Neither federal law nor the laws in most states, including Missouri, provide explicit <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/08/lgbt-employment-discrimination-half-of-states-offer-no-protections/3837244002/">protection</a> against sexual orientation discrimination. These same laws, however, typically bar sex discrimination. The U.S. Supreme Court will soon decide whether facts like those raised in Wildhaber's case, which pertain to sexual orientation discrimination, amount to sex discrimination under federal law, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

Some courts now proclaim that discrimination based on sexual orientation is beyond the scope of Title VII. However, the path-breaking thirty-year-old Supreme Court case, <em>Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</em>, suggests otherwise.

<strong>Price Waterhouse—Protecting Against Sex Stereotypes</strong>
In <a href="https://www.kcur.org/post/major-ruling-missouri-supreme-court-expands-definition-sex-discrimination#stream/0">Price Waterhouse</a>, the Supreme Court held that employees can satisfy Title VII's because-of-sex requirement by producing evidence that an employer’s adverse treatment stemmed from their failure to conform to sex stereotypes. Despite stellar qualifications, Hopkins's application for partnership at Price Waterhouse was denied. Her gender clearly played a role. Decision-makers, for instance, suggested that her chances might improve on the next go-round if she was less “macho.” She was also advised to attend charm school, to walk, talk and dress more femininely, to wear make-up and jewelry and to get her hair styled.

Ruling in her favor, the Supreme Court held that Title VII’s reference to “sex” encompasses both biological differences between men and women, as well as gender discrimination, that is, discrimination based on a failure to conform to stereotypical gender norms. Gender has been <a href="http://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/transgender.aspx">described</a> as "socially constructed roles, behaviors, activities, and attributes that . . . society considers appropriate" for one sex or the other. In Hopkins’s case, when her employer punished her for being too macho or insisting that she wear makeup and an updo, it acted on the basis of her gender.

Relying on Price Waterhouse, numerous courts interpreting federal and state statutes have concluded that employees may rely on evidence of sex stereotyping to show discrimination occurred because of sex. Indeed, earlier this year, the Missouri Supreme Court reached that conclusion with regard to the state's anti-discrimination statute, under which Wildhaber pursued his sex-based claim based on his being gay. Yet, courts have split on whether the sex stereotyping principle announced in Price Waterhouse extends as far as Wildhaber was allowed to take it.

<strong>The Conduct-Status Split—A Standard Difficult to Justify</strong>
Some courts have created in effect a conduct-status divide, protecting individuals because of how they behave or look (conduct) but not because of who they are (status). A man, for instance, might be shielded from discrimination because of his observable feminine conduct or behavior, say, for instance, painting his fingernails red or wearing tight pants and fitted tops, but not merely because he is gay.

To that end, it is not clear that Wildhaber's claim would have survived in a jurisdiction drawing a conduct-status distinction because the only gender nonconforming behavior he raised was that he was gay. In cases like his, regardless of how one looks or behaves, the stereotype at issue is that men should be sexually attracted to women, not to other men. These distinctions matter. The sex stereotyping <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/the-most-important-gay-rights-case-since-marriage-equality-was-won-3038c633d1ba/">principle</a> as employed by some courts bars discrimination against the flamboyant gay man and butch lesbian but not the employee who satisfies gender norms in all but their sexual attractions.

Limiting the application of sex stereotyping in this manner is problematic for several reasons. First, it is difficult if not impossible to unpack beliefs about sexual orientation from beliefs about gender norms. This is because ideas about how men and women ought to behave blur into ideas about heterosexuality and homosexuality. Being a homosexual in the minds of many necessarily means one is violating gender norms with regard to one's sexual attractions.

The conduct-status divide also undermines a principal rationale for prohibiting employer reliance on sex stereotypes in making employment decisions. They unnecessarily limit employment opportunities because they have no bearing on the ability to do the job. Wildhaber, for instance, presented overwhelming evidence that he was considered highly qualified for the promotions he sought but was rejected because he was gay.

If reliance on sex stereotypes hampers employment opportunities, and it surely does, there is no justification for shielding employees from discrimination because of sex stereotypes related to observable behavior or conduct while allowing it if related to sexual orientation. The line drawing is particularly problematic because sexual orientation is a fundamental aspect of a person. While notions about homosexuality have evolved over time, leading mental health and medical <a href="https://www.apa.org/about/offices/ogc/amicus/obergefell-supreme-court">organizations now regard</a> sexual orientation as “a normal expression of human sexuality and immutable.” No one should have to suppress or attempt to change one's sexual orientation. Such efforts are unlikely to succeed anyway and may cause <a href="https://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/sexual-orientation">harm</a>. Permitting employers to discriminate freely on that basis, therefore, places significant burdens on opportunities to work.

To be sure, extending existing protections against sex discrimination to sexual orientation claims has its critics, who <a href="https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2019/10/11/supreme-court-decision-lgbt-discrimination-sets-religious-liberty-clash">argue</a> for various reasons that the matter is best left to legislatures, not courts. Still, if the Supreme Court is faithful to <em>Price Waterhouse</em>, then across the country employees like Wildhaber will never feel pressured to "tone down the gay" to get a job.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As we await the Supreme Court’s decision on whether under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act “because of . . . sex” encompasses discrimination based on an individual’s sexual orientation, I suggest that the Justices listen to both the Missouri Supreme Court and the jury in the “heartland” state of Missouri. The jury recently awarded a St. Louis County gay male police officer nearly $20 million in a sexual orientation discrimination case.

The Missouri Supreme Court in 2019 extended legal protections to LGBTQIA+ people in a case that dealt with employment rights under the state’s human rights law prohibiting discrimination because of sex. The jury heard police officer Wildhaber tell them that he was turned down for 23 promotions in about six years. With over 15 years of experience, a clean record, and strong performance reviews, he placed in the top tier of candidates. Further, Wildhaber asserted a member of the Board of Police Commissioners told him he would have to “tone down [his] gayness” if he wanted to receive a promotion to lieutenant. After the judgment, the jury foreperson stated the jury wanted the verdict to “send a message” that “[i]f you discriminate you are going to pay a big price.” Will the Supreme Court hear this message?

On October 8, 2019, the Supreme Court heard oral argument on whether Title VII protects gay, lesbian and transgender employees. Because fewer than half of the 50 states specifically bar discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity (the Missouri law did not explicitly make unlawful sexual orientation discrimination), the Court’s ruling could be significant. The outcome of the two cases could hinge on Justice Neil Gorsuch, who at times appeared sympathetic to the plaintiffs’ argument but also expressed concern about the “massive social upheaval” that he believed would follow from a ruling for them.

Justice Gorsuch, former Justice Kennedy’s law clerk and mentor who led the Supreme Court in important social change recognizing the humanity of LGBTQIA+ people, knows well that although Bostock and Zarda (two plaintiffs before the court) were fired for being gay – that is, for being men who were attracted to other men – they would not have been fired if they were women who were attracted to men. Gorsuch pushed back against efforts to distinguish between sex and sexual orientation, pointing to the fact that Title VII only requires sex to be a cause. If Bostock and Zarda were men who liked other men, Gorsuch asked, why wouldn’t that be enough to bring Title VII into play?

Asserting and defending the employment rights of lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, and transgender, queer, intersex, and asexual people (LGBTQIA+) remains a civil rights struggle. The Supreme Court’s recognition that the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Constitution must protect the right of same-sex couples to marry in <em>Obergefell v. Hodges</em> reflected the continuing prejudices in “law and social convention” that prevent equality and dignity from including everyone. Justice Kennedy writing for the Court aspired to look beyond prejudice in its opening line: “The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach, a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity.”

Despite a dramatic increase in public acceptance of LGBTQIA+ individuals post the Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Obergefell</em>, during the administration of President Trump, public tolerance for accepting LGBTQIA+ individuals declined. The policy positions taken by the President and his administration concerning LGBTQIA+ people increased the hateful rhetoric. The Supreme Court embracing this group of individuals by finding protection in Title VII can send a message that hate and legal pushback by this President are not the direction the people of the “heartland” and throughout the country will travel.

Not only does discrimination in the workplace injure, embarrass, and block individual LGBTQ workers, it stigmatizes LGBTQ people as a group. LGBTQ people's exclusion from society is compounded by employment discrimination's brand of second-class status, and the pressure to remain closeted or be denied a visible place in the range of jobs our society offers. Lawyers litigating for equal treatment for their LGBTQIA+ clients must innovate and educate as well as advocate. As more and more people become aware of their LGBTQ coworkers, neighbors, family members, friends, and professionals, withholding basic civil rights protections in employment becomes increasingly untenable. Employers, as well as employees, benefit accordingly.

The Supreme Court should continue to build on Justice Kennedy’s leadership and recognize that Title VII extends full federal protections against employment discrimination because of a person’s sex. Ruling to exclude LGBTQIA+ people from federal civil rights protections would give greater berth to the stereotyping and ignorance that are the wellsprings of prejudice.

		<title>About Extensions for Pakistan&#039;s Chief of Army Staff</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The last few days have been very tense. Everyone had the same question on their mind: will the<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/"> Supreme Court of Pakistan</a> allow <a href="https://www.ispr.gov.pk/chief-of-army-staff.php">General Qamar Javed Bajwa</a> to remain as the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) as the expiry of his term and his retirement loomed ever closer on 28<sup>th</sup> November 2019 and the notification for his extension remained suspended?

A minister resigned and notification after notification was published as all the King’s men and all the King’s horses worked hard to put the Chief’s extension back together again. All the while, Chief Justice of Pakistan, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/judges/honble-chief-justice-of-pakistan/">Asif Saeed Khosa</a> and the rest of his merry band of Hon’ble judges sat in judgment, amused at the clerical errors, legal lacunas and ignorance of law being portrayed by the Federal Government through its Law Ministry.

In the end, the Federal Government finally got the formula right (or it seems the Hon’ble Court grew bored) and the COAS was provided a six month conditional extension, subject to the Federal Government legislating for the lacunas which had oozed out in dramatic fashion as the Supreme Court surgically probed deeper and deeper into the issue.

Criticisms of the final order of the Supreme Court aside, which should be withheld till the full order is made available to the public, the short order announced by the Apex Court has, along with postponing COAS Qamar Javed Bajwa’s retirement plans, implicitly raised and answered many important jurisprudential questions.

Firstly, the power of the Hon’ble Court to judicially review the extension in term granted to the COAS by the Federal Government is now precedent law and it is a very welcome decision. We are, after all, a government of laws and not of men and all public power is accountable and limited. Therefore, in a country where the appointment of the head of any public sector organization is justiciable, why shouldn’t the head of one of the strongest, most capable and powerful institutions entrusted with our security and protection be as well? No one wishes for an overreaching judiciary, least of all the judiciary itself: where the constitution places discretion and subjective satisfaction in the executive or any member of the executive branch, that power is wholly theirs to keep and employ. But the exercise of that discretion must still be subject to law, proportionate and reasonable. Thus the exercise of any executive discretion, especially one - the justiciability of which is not expressly barred by the <a href="http://www.cpdi-pakistan.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/CONSTITUTION-OF-PAKISTAN.doc.pdf">Constitution</a> – should always remain open for the Hon’ble Courts to inquire into on an objective basis.

Secondly, it is now clear as day that the extensions in tenures of Chiefs of Army Staff have never had any basis in law whatsoever. One must not forget that in the end, the Constitution is a restraint on the state. Public power is limited by the very Constitution which grants the functionary the right to employ power. Thus the Federal Government cannot do that which it is not authorized to do as per law. As per Article 243, the Constitution provides the power to the President, under the advice of the Prime Minister, to appoint the Chief of Army Staff but the Constitution remains silent on the matter of extension in tenure and so does the <a href="http://pja.gov.pk/system/files/Army%20Act%201952.pdf">Army Act</a>, which is the sole piece of legislation passed by the Parliament of Pakistan on the subject of the Armed Forces. Thus it is clear: The power to appoint does not mean the power to also extend and when the law does not provide for such power to be exercised, its exercise by the Federal Government is without jurisdiction and therefore liable to be struck down. Thus the 6 months that have been given to COAS Bajwa, are a grace period, in which the Federal Government must legalize that which is and always has been illegal and arguably unconstitutional.

Lastly, the Army Act in Section 8(2) defines the COAS as the officer commanding the Pakistan Army. The term ‘officer’ is defined as per Section 8(12) as a serving officer of the armed forces of Pakistan. Now, while the Federal Government can make rules and regulations on the when, where and how (and if ever) a member of the armed forces retires, from the bare act it is clear that a non-serving officer of the armed forces, who is not gazetted, commissioned or ‘in pay’, cannot be appointed as the COAS. Where does this leave the extension in tenure of an army chief who stands at the cusp of retirement? Any amendment in the regulations which allows an otherwise retired General to remain as COAS, is arguably a frustration of the law maker’s intent. So till the Army Act is amended by suitable legislation, no retiring army chief’s tenure can be extended.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Impeachment has always been a combustible mix of constitutional law and constitutional politics, but the way in which impeachment integrates law and politics has evolved from the framing of the Constitution to the mid-nineteenth century to the late twentieth century and may be further evolving at present. The framers designed an impeachment system that would enable a non-partisan Congress to remove a renegade president. The nineteenth-century debates over whether Andrew Jackson, John Tyler and Andrew Johnson should be impeached concerned partisan struggles over policy and the scope of presidential power under Article II of the Constitution.  The late twentieth and early twenty-first-century debates over whether to impeach Richard Nixon, Bill Clinton and Donald Trump concerned partisan disputes over whether these presidents had committed crimes and whether those crimes were impeachable. The debate over the Trump impeachment is rapidly turning into a dispute as to whether an admittedly renegade president should and can be impeached when his partisans are indifferent to his political crimes.

The impeachment process the framers designed was long on constitutional politics and short on constitutional law. The House was given the power to impeach. The Senate was given the power to convict. Nowhere in Article I or anywhere else did the Constitution spell out the procedures necessary to impeach or convict, other than to note the Chief Justice would preside over the impeachment of the president and that conviction required a two-thirds vote. The substance of impeachment was only a little more definite. <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii">Article II</a> declared that a president “shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” History clearly demonstrates that “other high Crimes and Misdemeanors” encompasses both ordinary crimes and abuses of office and fails to clearly demonstrate the precise ordinary crimes and abuses of office that are impeachable. For the most part, the framers assumed that presidents who obtained executive office under the constitutional rules would be virtuous state-persons who would not commit acts that might plausibly be impeachable and that, on the rare occasion such acts allegedly occurred, the representatives who obtained legislative office would have the virtues necessary to determine whether the sitting president was unfit to remain as chief executive of the United States.

So understood impeachment fit with a constitutional order that was long on constitutional politics and short on constitutional law. Rather than spell out the legal rules for impeachment, the framers on this matter and others, assumed institutional design provided better protection for improvident political behavior than parchment rules. As Hamilton declared in <a href="https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed31.asp">Federalist 31</a>, “all observations founded upon the danger of usurpation ought to be referred to the composition and structure of the government, not to the nature or extent of its powers.” Impeachment was no exception.

The three significant impeachment debates during the nineteenth century featured disputes over presidential power. Andrew Jackson was censured by the Senate for removing federal deposits from the Bank of the United States. John Tyler was condemned by the House of Representatives for using the presidential veto as a policy instrument. Andrew Johnson was impeached by the House for cashiering cabinet officials without Senate approval in violation of the <a href="https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/Johnson_TenureofOfficeAct.pdf">Tenure of Office Act</a> (and making improvident statements on the campaign trail in 1866). The subject matter of these disputes were constitutional rules, not criminal law. Jackson, Tyler and Johnson would not have been subject to criminal trial and punishment had they been impeached because their allegedly impeachable offenses were not ordinary crimes.

Partisan disputes fueled impeachments during the nineteenth century. Each impeachment was initiated in a branch of the national government controlled by the opposition party. Senate Whigs censured Jackson because they knew the Jacksonian controlled House would never impeach. House Whigs condemned Tyler (who acted like a Democrat after taking office) because they knew the Jacksonian controlled Senate would never convict. House Republicans impeached Johnson, who was acquitted only when enough conservative Senate Republicans joined with Senate Democrats to reject the charges. These partisan disputes were over policy and constitutional powers. Whigs censured and condemned Jackson and Tyler because their controversial exercises of presidential power were directed at the national bank and other American system measures that Whigs favored and Jacksonians opposed. Johnson was impeached because his controversial exercises of presidential power were aimed at limiting Republican efforts at Reconstruction and preserving Democratic commitments to white supremacy.

The three significant impeachment debates during the last fifty years featured disputes over presidential lawbreaking. Richard Nixon was accused of obstructing justice. Bill Clinton was accused of perjury. Donald Trump is being accused of bribery. Presidents impeached for these actions are subject to subsequent criminal trial and punishment. Nixon had to be pardoned by President Gerald Ford. Clinton was disbarred. Even if an impeached Donald Trump is not tried for bribery on the ground that his actions in Ukraine are better described as an abuse of office rather than as a criminal offense, a fair case can be made that given various investigations already underfoot in New York and perhaps elsewhere, upon removal from offense Trump might be charged with the number of criminal offenses sufficient to have him sentenced as an habitual offender.

Partisanship continues to fuel impeachments, even when the allegedly impeachable conduct is presidential lawbreaking rather than the scope of presidential power. As was the case in the nineteenth century, every effort to impeach a president has begun in the branch of government controlled by members of the rival party. House Democrats impeached Richard Nixon. House Republicans impeached Bill Clinton. House Democrats are impeaching Donald Trump. With the important exception of the last days of Richard Nixon, when several prominent Republicans announced a willingness to impeach, partisanship determines beliefs about whether the president has committed a crime or whether the crime the president has committed is an impeachable offense. Democrats in the Senate who prevented Clinton from being convicted maintained that lying about a private sexual matter under oath was not a “high crime or misdemeanor.” Republicans insist that Donald Trump has committed no crimes or that his misdeeds with respect to Ukraine and elsewhere are not impeachable offenses. Both policy and polarization help explain these partisan cleavages. Bitterly divided along an extended range of issues, from the cultural wars to the role of the government in the economy, neither Republicans nor Democrats are willing to hand the other party a victory, even if that defeat does not affect partisan control over the White House.

The Clinton impeachment also heralded a new trend in the partisan constitutional politics of impeachment. During the 1992 and 1996 presidential campaigns, clear evidence emerged that Clinton at the very least was a philanderer who was not above using his office to create opportunities for extramarital affairs. Whatever most Democrats may have said in public, one suspects few thought Clinton remotely the model of a faithful spouse. While evidence in the 1860 campaign that Abraham Lincoln owned slaves (or in 1796 that George Washington had actually told a lie) might have caused a substantial electoral shift, when the evidence clearly indicated that Clinton had lied about sex under oath, few Clinton voters had reasons to remove Clinton from office. They had voted for him knowing that he was the kind of person likely to lie under oath about sex. Kenneth Starr neither told Republicans (who already believed Clinton was a criminal) or Democrats (who already believed Clinton was a cad) something they did not already know.

The Clinton phenomenon helps explain why increased evidence of Trump’s criminality has little or no impact on Republican opposition to impeachment. During the 2016 presidential campaign, clear evidence emerged that Donald Trump was a lifelong white-collar criminal. Whatever most Republicans may say in public, one suspects that few doubt that Trump has cheated on his income taxes, regularly engages in fraudulent business activities, uses public office for private gain and, for that matter, is at least as great a philanderer as Clinton. Evidence that Trump may have attempted to bribe or otherwise influence Ukraine to investigate a political rival, therefore, is exactly what Trump supporters expect Trump to do. For these reasons, the impeachment hearings neither tell Democrats (who already think Trump is a criminal, unfit for office) or Republicans (who already think Trump is a criminal, fit for office) something they did not already know. Surveys consistently show that a majority of Trump supporters are sufficiently partisan that no evidence of criminality will affect their political choices. Trump supporters differ only in whether they fully support presidential policy in Ukraine or, like Representative Charles Hurd, they wish a president they will not impeach had nevertheless acted otherwise.

The constitutional politics of the Trump impeachment highlight how far constitutional politics in the United States has drifted from the framing vision, even as prominent conservatives insist Americans should acknowledge original constitutional law in the absence of original constitutional politics. The framers assumed a constitutional politics in which non-partisan elites determined whether a president had abused the office or engaged in sufficient criminal conduct to justify removal from office. Jacksonian debates over impeachment demonstrated that what constituted an abuse of office, in the absence of allegations of criminal conduct, was a partisan matter. American debates over impeachment during the last fifty years have demonstrated that it is a partisan matter to determine whether the president is a criminal who warrants impeachment. The Trump impeachment has taken these partisan transformations one step further. The present partisan debate is over whether, in a polarized political regime, any form of political behavior is impeachable, whether a renegade president by framing standards, who satisfies the base by contemporary standards, is allowed to remain in office.

The persons responsible for the Constitution of the United States believed that republican government, in the long run, depended in part on the quality of the governors. The Constitution of the United States was designed to ensure to the extent humanly possible that Americans would be governed by persons who did not abuse office or convert public trust into private gain. They feared the excessive partisanship that would forgive all political sins in the interest of maintaining office. The Trump impeachment is testing this framing vision. The first test will be whether partisanship merely colors how persons look at evidence of impeachable offenses or whether Americans have become so partisan that evidence no longer matters. The second and more important test will be whether a regime in which evidence of abuse of office or criminal conduct no longer matters can remain a republican regime.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Suppose someone <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/us/gun-seizures.html">posts</a> a message on social media suggesting he might shoot up a movie theatre, and punctuates the point with a photo in which he is holding an AK-47-style rifle. Can the government temporarily confiscate the person’s firearms, in order to ensure that he does not pose a threat to himself or members of the community?

<a href="https://lawcenter.giffords.org/gun-laws/policy-areas/who-can-have-a-gun/extreme-risk-protection-orders/">Seventeen states and the District of Columbia</a> have enacted so-called “red flag” or “risk-based gun removal” laws. The terms of the laws vary, but they generally allow law enforcement officers, family members, and others to petition courts to remove weapons from people who may be dangerous and prevent them from buying other weapons. Red flag laws allow a court to issue a temporary emergency removal order to seize guns, typically for between 14 to 45 days, in order to determine whether the owner poses a serious threat to himself or others. A subsequent order can result in the removal of guns for a longer period, in some states up to a year, upon a showing that the person continues to pose a threat to himself or others.

Red flag laws have proliferated in the wake of mass shootings at schools, churches, and other places. They currently enjoy widespread – including rare bipartisan – support. According to a poll by American Public Media Research Lab, Americans support such laws by as much as 77%. Not everyone is a fan. Gun rights proponents have warned that the laws presume guilt without a criminal trial, deprive owners of <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment">Second Amendment</a> rights, violate freedom of speech, and are a means of <a href="https://spectator.org/red-flag-laws-are-lethal-leftist-weapons/">confiscating</a> firearms. An increasing number of localities have declared themselves “<a href="https://reason.com/2019/11/21/americas-second-amendment-sanctuary-movement-is-alive-and-well/">Second Amendment sanctuaries</a>,” partly in response to the enactment of red flag laws. In some of these locales, law enforcement has vowed not to enforce the laws.

While red flag laws raise important constitutional issues, some opponents have overstated these concerns. The central constitutional question raised by red flag laws relates to process – the nature and timing of the hearing required before a court temporarily removes guns.

Even temporary deprivations of property or liberty raise serious constitutional concerns. Thus, President Trump’s suggestion in March 2018, “Take the guns first, go through due process second,” is wholly inconsistent with basic notions of procedural fairness. Contrary to <a href="https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2019/oct/28/robin-vos/do-red-flag-laws-allow-gun-seizure-without-judges-/">some claims</a>, however, red flag laws do not follow the President’s suggested approach. To the contrary, they expressly require a judicial order before removal of firearms. According to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/judge-andrew-napolitano-the-dangerous-urge-to-do-something">some gun rights proponents</a>, only a criminal trial can support temporary removal of guns. However, red flag laws authorize a civil proceeding; they do not involve any criminal charges or punishments.

More generally, opponents characterize red flag laws as constitutional outliers, since they do not require a trial in advance of temporary removal. In fact, temporary deprivations are not foreign to law. Indeed, states have modeled red flag removals on domestic violence restraining orders, which temporarily deprive alleged abusers of significant liberty interests, including in some cases access to the residence and custodial rights, without a trial. Civil commitment proceedings, which can result in involuntary confinement in a mental institution for extended periods, also do not require full-blown trials. The process required varies with the nature of the deprivation and the risks involved. Thus, a higher standard of proof and greater process may be required for involuntary commitment on grounds of mental illness than for other temporary restrictions on a person’s liberty.

Typically, laws provide an opportunity to be heard prior to the deprivation of liberty or property. Another argument opponents of red flag laws have made is that initial <em>ex parte</em> removals – those ordered without providing the owner the opportunity to appear – are unconstitutional. However, the Supreme Court has held that where a state must act quickly, or where it would be impracticable to provide pre-deprivation process, post-deprivation process is adequate. For example, courts can issue <em>ex parte</em> civil protective orders in the domestic abuse context and civil commitment orders. Where the gun removal is for a very short duration and based on a finding that the owner poses a danger to self or others, <em>ex parte</em> proceedings satisfy due process.

Given that property and liberty interests are at stake, the standard for longer-term removals should be relatively high, and indeed higher than the standard for briefer<em> ex parte </em>removals. Several state laws require "clear and convincing" evidence that the person poses a safety risk to himself or others. Under that standard, petitioners have to present specific information indicating such a risk. Consistent with due process, red flag laws also require a prompt judicial decision. Additionally, the laws provide safeguards that allow courts to correct unfavorable rulings, such as suspension of a confiscation and hard time limits on removal. Finally, to curtail abuse, some state laws impose penalties for false removal petitions.

Thus far, lower courts have <a href="https://www.law.com/dailybusinessreview/2019/09/26/florida-appeals-court-upholds-constitutionality-of-red-flag-law/?slreturn=20191104180921">upheld</a> laws that have some or many of these process features. State red flag laws vary, and insofar as the laws do not include these or similar kinds of protections they may still be subject to challenge on due process grounds. Although no procedure can guarantee a court will not wrongly deprive an owner of firearms, state red flag laws are generally consistent with procedural fairness. Although many of the laws are new, some <a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/judges-not-rubber-stamping-maryland-gun-seizures-under-red-flag-law/65-6660e508-0c4f-411e-8ef1-72a852d45d9e">early evidence</a> indicates that courts are not rubber-stamping removal petitions. Courts must faithfully apply the standards in red flag laws, and legislatures should ensure their laws are serving the purpose of reducing suicide and gun violence.

Although possession of arms is at issue, the Second Amendment poses no serious barrier to enforcement of red flag laws. In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6484080926445491577&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr">District of Columbia v. Heller</a>, the Supreme Court limited the individual right to keep and bear arms to “law-abiding and responsible citizens.” The petition itself does not render the subject an outlaw, or prove he is an irresponsible citizen. Rather, if the petitioner demonstrates that the stated risk is present, the law authorizes temporary removal. On this reasoning, courts have <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/inctco20160209082">held</a> that red flag laws do not violate the Second Amendment.

Finally, some have raised <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> concerns relating to removal petitions. Suppose, for example, that the basis for a removal petition consists solely of statements like the one at the beginning of this post. Gun owners do not have a First Amendment right to communicate threats or incite unlawful conduct. Even assuming the speech is fully protected courts may still consider it when performing the risk assessment, just as they do in domestic violence and civil commitment cases. That does not mean free speech concerns are wholly absent in some cases. Petitions based solely on communication of offensive or derogatory messages, judicial consideration of political or other associational affiliation in determining dangerousness, or evidence of official retaliation for speech raise such concerns. In most cases, however, the standards of proof for gun removal, post-deprivation hearings, and punishment for false petitions alleviate these concerns.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Americans love to pretend that the Constitution is a legal document. Of course, it’s nothing of the sort. At best, it’s a restatement of an imaginary common ideology, a Rorschach card onto which we project our vision of the ideal legal order. The Constitution enables us to resolve political problems by magically transforming them into legal ones. While it always requires a certain suspension of disbelief, nowhere is constitutional magic stretched more thinly than impeachment.

The Constitution <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii">provides</a>, “The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” But what does that mean? The Constitution provides a process for impeachment and trial, but doesn’t explain when impeachment is proper and when it isn’t.

On December 4, 2019, the House Judiciary Committee <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2019/12/house-judiciary-committee-holds-first-impeachment-hearing/">launched</a> a hearing on the impeachment of President Donald Trump by hearing testimony from four law professors on what constitutes an impeachable offense. Noah Feldman of Harvard Law School argued that “President Trump’s conduct described in the testimony and evidence clearly constitutes an impeachable high crime and misdemeanor under the Constitution” because he “abused his office by soliciting the president of Ukraine to investigate his political rivals in order to gain personal political advantage,” among other things. Pamela Karlan of Stanford Law School argued that Trump “used the powers of his office to demand that a foreign government participate in undermining a competing candidate for the presidency.” And Michael Gerhardt of the University of North Carolina School of Law observed, "If what we're talking about isn't impeachable, then nothing is impeachable.” By contrast, Jonathan Turley of the George Washington University Law School urged caution, and advised against “lowering impeachment standards to fit a paucity of evidence and an abundance of anger.”

But all of the law professor testimony was simply beside the point. When the Republicans unsuccessfully tried to impeach Justice William O. Douglas in 1970, Representative Gerald Ford memorably observed, “An impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history.”

Ford was right. The House of Representatives can impeach the President for any reason, or no reason at all, and the Senate has absolute discretion whether to convict and remove the President. Impeachment is not a legal process, but a political one.

Perhaps an illustration would be helpful. On August 28, 2014, President Barack Obama committed an impeachable offense. Scandalized news and political figures watched with horror as the leader of the free world addressed the nation on developments in the fight against the Islamic State and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in a tan suit. For his fashion faux-pas-- some might allege that it clearly met the definition of “high crimes” against good style-- the rebukes were swift and biting.

“There’s no way, I don’t think, any of us can excuse what the President did yesterday,” claimed Long Island Republican Representative Peter King on NewsMaxTV, “I mean, you have the world watching.” Lou Dobbs of Fox News tweeted: “#Obama in a #TanSuit? What message is the President trying to send?” Others opted for a lighter scolding, roughly the equivalent of censure in the halls of public opinion. GQ’s Jake Woolf offered “a few simple tweaks that could make this look, I don’t know, Presidential.”

It was arguably the dumbest controversy of Obama’s presidency, although it had plenty of competition. But Obama’s tan suit, and every other action or inaction of a President past or present, is an impeachable offense. If the House had decided to impeach Obama on the basis of his tan suit, it would have been a valid impeachment. Presumably, many people would have questioned the wisdom and legitimacy of the impeachment, but no one could have prevented it. And if the House had impeached Obama, the Senate could have convicted him and removed him from office. Surely, many people would have objected and complained that sartorial choices are not a proper subject of impeachment. But their complaints would have been irrelevant, so long as there were enough votes to convict.

Obviously, the law professors testified for a reason. Democrats want to make a political case for impeachment, and Republicans want to make a case against. But at the end of the day, the law that matters can’t be found in constitutional theories advanced by legal scholars. According to Noah Feldman, “If we cannot impeach a president who abuses his office for personal advantage, we no longer live in a democracy -- we live in a monarchy, or we live in a dictatorship.” That’s simply untrue.

We can impeach or not impeach a President for anything, without harming any democratic values. All we need are votes. The only relevant “law” is the process provided by the Constitution: how many votes the President has in the Senate. For better or worse, it looks like the answer is “plenty.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Myths, often ancient traditional stories that are designed to prescribe moral or traditional values, are fantastical but also highly rational. That is because myths describe a commonly manifested belief on the way we view the world.

In 1992, Professor <a href="https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/bulr72&amp;i=11">Jane Rutherford</a> utilised the myth of Robin Hood in order to make a point about the myth of due process. Robin Hood is a myth and, leaving the Sherwood Forest scenery aside, it is a myth about an individual standing up to injustice and tyranny. Robin Hood aided the down trodden by taking from the rich and therefore, his legally dubious actions were seen to be for greater good.

Robin Hood confronted government and demanded equal treatment of rich and poor. Robin Hood’s actions support theories on utilitarianism, and many consider him to be a hero. Robin Hood is a set of narratives outlining the inherent morality of equal treatment and governmental fairness. But at all times, Robin Hood is a myth.

Rutherford argues that, like Robin Hood, due process is a myth. Due process is a set of texts and moral values handed down over centuries that prescribes a fair relationship between an individual and the government, safeguarded by the judiciary. Now, roughly 25 years after Rutherford drew this eerily close comparison, due process continues to be a myth, an empty shell that is only enforceable if it suits a political agenda.

Roughly 700 years after the Robin Hood myth became a symbol for equal treatment and justice for the public, a man whom some have <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/robin-hood-of-hacking-1.683707">likened</a> to a digital Robin Hood’ is suffering an unprecedented departure from due process.

Due process, a bulwark of the criminal justice system, is enshrined in the US Constitution in the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment">5th</a> and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">14th</a> Amendments. Whereas due process in the 5th Amendment affords a constitutional guarantee to procedural fairness, the 14th is of a substantive character. The US constitutional guarantee to both procedural and substantive due process is closely aligned with the original <a href="https://www.crf-usa.org/foundations-of-our-constitution/magna-carta-text.html">Magna Carta</a> text, with the 14th Amendment prescribing:
<blockquote>"…No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."</blockquote>
Theories of justice focus on the substantive and procedural guarantees of due process: fair outcomes are a result of fair procedures that are conform to due process guarantees. In both the 5th and 14th amendment of the US Constitution, fundamental fairness is ‘the touchstone of due process’.

To return to Rutherford, the myth of due process acknowledges that there can be no justice without due process and no due process without an impartial judiciary safeguarding its guarantees.

In the case of the digital Robin Hood, Assange informed voices such as the United Nations special rapporteur on torture <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=24665">Nils Melzer</a> and Bloomberg columnist <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-04-05/wikileaks-s-assange-should-not-be-extradited-to-the-u-s">Leonid Bershidsky</a> argue that the likelihood that his case is considered by an impartial and unbiased judiciary and jury, is minimal or nil.

More specifically a premise of due process <em>Audi Alteram Partem</em>, is not guaranteed in the case of Assange. <em>Audi Alteram Partem</em> is a universally accepted due process guarantee that protects an individual against unfair governmental practices in the sense that it provides equal arms during criminal proceedings. In <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/373/83/">Brady v. Maryland</a>, this right was emphasised to be about fundamentally protecting individuals from prosecutorial misconduct in withholding evidence. Equality of arms is an elemental safeguard against arbitrary treatment and an integral part of the scheme in it that it prescribes a range of minimum standards protecting parties’ equality.

But in Assange’s case earlier this year, US prosecutors <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/may/19/us-prosecutors-julian-assange-wikileaks-ecuadorian-embassy">obtained</a> Assange’s legal defence strategy, medical records and other personal belongings from the Ecuadorian Embassy. This was an unlawful confiscation, a clear case of prosecutorial misconduct, that has been left unscrutinised by the UK judiciary through its allowing for the extradition proceedings to commence without further delay.

In the same vein, equality of arms also underpins the right to engage counsel and prepare a defence. The right to effective legal representation is undeniably a constituent of fundamental fairness. This right necessitates effective access to counsel and documents needed to prepare a defence effectively. Restriction of these rights enhance a disturbing departure from due process in it that it creates inequality of parties in proceedings.

The Government’s restriction of access to material reasonably needed to prepare an effective legal defence has also been addressed in Strasbourg, where in <a href="https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#%7B%22itemid%22:[%22001-57422%22]%7D">Albert and Le Compte v. Belgium</a> the Court firmly protected the principle of equality of arms as an effectively enforceable element of the right to a fair trial. Parties further "must be given the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed and the evidence adduced by the other party" the Court held in <a href="https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/app/conversion/pdf/?library=ECHR&amp;id=002-5775&amp;filename=002-5775.pdf">Garcia Alva v. Germany</a>.

Once again, in the case of Assange this right, emphasized and protected by the ECtHR, has been selectively ignored by one of its Member States. The UK, as member of the Council of Europe subscribes to the European Court’s jurisdiction and therefore purportedly honours its decisions. The UK judiciary so far, in dealing with Assange’s extradition proceedings, appears to have disregarded any due process violations by executive government. This disregard has resulted in Assange being restricted in liaising with counsel or getting access to the voluminous material underpinning the charges against him.

It hardly needs to be said that the right to counsel is fundamental protection for individuals who are being prosecuted by a well-resourced arm of government. In conforming with international and common law human rights standards, the UK needs to respect the due process guarantees which demand that Assange should have adequate time and facilities to prepare his defence. Otherwise the picture emerging is that procedural due process guarantees are reliant upon the discretion of the judiciary. This of course, disregards ECtHR precedent.

Competence to stand trial and to undergo legal proceedings is a due process guarantee deriving from a range of Supreme Court decisions stressing the importance of rational decision making. It is inextricably linked to the right of an effective legal defence. These due process guarantees derive from the seminal cases <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/362/402/">Dusky v. United States</a> and <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/420/162/">Drope v. Missouri</a>, where the Supreme Court has firmly safeguarded the rights of incapable defendants to effectively instruct counsel. Aside from Assange’s inability to access counsel, over sixty medical experts have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/25/julian-assanges-health-is-so-bad-he-could-die-in-prison-say-60-doctors">recently urged</a> his release due to his deteriorating mental and physical health. His prolonged exposure to psychological torture affects his ability to make sound decisions, potentially demonstrating a clear case of incompetence to undergo extradition proceedings, let alone to stand trial in the eastern Virginia ‘Espionage Court’. By allowing for pre-trial detention and rejecting a stay of proceedings, the UK judiciary is disregarding Assange’s fundamental right to effectively defend himself.

Due process of law has been a concept developed over centuries. The international agreed meaning of it is that it provides fundamental protections to individuals accused of a crime. The concept has received jurisprudential skepticism of the enforceability of its fundamental protections. Due process is a concept known by many but is only respected by governments when politically convenient. The legal proceedings against Assange have demonstrated unprecedented departures from due process. This commentary did not aim to alleviate deficiencies of the concept itself, it highlights the unenforceability of its guarantees in the proceedings against Julian Assange. Due process is of fundamental importance but also an empty vessel. Due process is a set of texts and common law but remains to be moral values driven by idealistic ideas of law rather than enforceable procedural and fundamental rights. Recent developments in the extradition proceedings against Assange have demonstrated the unenforceability of these moral guidelines. Due process is portrayed as an ideal element of law but is a toothless tiger if not respected by governments or the judiciary.

For the ‘Digital Robin Hood’ being prosecuted for standing up to injustice and the exposure of war crimes; due process is a myth.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The coming invigoration of the non-delegation doctrine, <a href="http://digitalcommons.law.villanova.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3032&amp;context=vlr">long-declared dead</a>, is now nearly certain. In a recent statement, Justice Kavanaugh signaled his interest in revisiting the long-dormant doctrine in a future case. But, while Justice Kavanaugh’s statement all but confirms that the Court will breathe life into the non-delegation doctrine sometime soon, questions still remain about its ultimate scope and whether it can be applied in a predictable and coherent way.

<strong>The <em>Gundy</em> Opinions</strong>

The federal non-delegation doctrine has been less of a doctrine than a ghost story told to law students since it was <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8998960440123298467&amp;q=schechter+poultry&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,36">last used</a> to strike down a federal statute in 1935. In theory, if not, in fact, the non-delegation doctrine places limits on Congress’s power to vest decision-making authority in other branches of government, most notably, administrative agencies. But, despite <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=968580795714943926&amp;q=industrial+union&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,36">renewed interest</a> among some members of the Supreme Court in the years since the New Deal, there had been no great likelihood that the Court would animate the doctrine until the 2019 <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-6086_2b8e.pdf"><em>Gundy v. United States</em></a> opinion. The statutory provision at issue in <em>Gundy</em> grants the attorney general (AG) the authority to apply provisions of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) retrospectively, that is, to conduct that took place before the statute was enacted. Although there were five votes to uphold the statute’s delegation of authority to the AG, no opinion commanded a majority of the Court. In her opinion for a plurality of four, Justice Kagan narrowed SORNA by reading into it a requirement for the AG to implement SORNA “as soon as feasible.” In light of this limitation on the AG’s discretion, she concluded, the provision “easily passes constitutional muster” because it gives the AG an “intelligible principle” to follow, which is all that the non-delegation doctrine requires.

Justice Alito provided the fifth vote to uphold the statute but made clear that he favored a more robust vision of non-delegation. He noted that, in another case, he would support an effort to “reconsider the approach we have taken for the past 84 years” if a majority of the Court was willing to take that step.

In a dissent joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Thomas, Justice Gorsuch opined that, unlike Justice Alito, he “would not wait” for the next case to set out his vision for a robust non-delegation doctrine. Leaning heavily on a formalist conception of separation of powers, Justice Gorsuch opined that the structure of the Constitution demands the separation of legislative authority from the executive branch. Notably, he ventured that the “intelligible principle” test that has been the touchstone of the non-delegation doctrine for generations has “mutated” and has “no basis in the original meaning of the Constitution [or] in history.” Reaching back to pre-New Deal precedent, Justice Gorsuch drew a distinction between Congress’s responsibility to make policy decisions and its power to authorize agencies to “fill up the details.” While Congress is ultimately responsible for setting policy, Justice Gorsuch suggested that it would be constitutional for Congress to authorize the executive branch to “fill in even a large number of details. . . or to exercise non-legislative powers.”

Justice Gorsuch concluded with what can only be described as request to Justice Kavanaugh, who took no part in the <em>Gundy</em> opinion, to help make a majority to invigorate the non-delegation doctrine: “I remain hopeful,” wrote Justice Gorsuch in closing, that the Court will return to the issue of delegation “in a future case with a full panel.”

<strong>And Justice Kavanaugh Makes Five</strong>

After <em>Gundy</em>, a number of commentators noted that Justice Kavanaugh was likely to provide a fifth vote to invigorate the non-delegation doctrine at some future time. After all, the <em>Gundy</em> opinions split along conventionally partisan lines with the conservative justices’ opinions seeking a stronger non-delegation doctrine and the liberal justices seeking to maintain the status quo. But, if any doubt lingered, Justice Kavanaugh eliminated it in his recent Statement Respecting the Denial of Certiorari in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/112519zor_8mj9.pdf"><em>Paul v. United States</em></a>. Because the issues presented in <em>Paul</em> were the same as those raised in <em>Gundy</em>, Justice Kavanaugh agreed with the denial of cert. But, he wrote separately to comment that Justice Gorsuch’s <em>Gundy</em> dissent “may warrant further consideration in future cases.”

Although some commentators read this statement as an endorsement of Justice Gorsuch’s approach, Justice Kavanaugh carefully avoided adopting Justice Gorsuch’s distinction between policy and details and his distinction between legislative and non-legislative powers. Instead, Justice Kavanaugh connected Justice Gorsuch’s opinion to the so-called “major questions” doctrine of statutory interpretation. As described by Justice Kavanaugh, the major questions doctrine is a clear statement rule that suggests that courts should not defer to an agency’s interpretation of a statute that is “<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-114_qol1.pdf">economically and politically significant</a>” unless Congress clearly granted the agency this authority. Justice Kavanaugh read Justice Gorsuch’s dissent as an amended and constitutionalized version of major questions doctrine, prohibiting “dele­gations to agencies of authority to decide major policy ques­tions—even if Congress expressly and specifically delegates that authority.”

<strong>The Future of Nondelegation</strong>

The future of nondelegation is not yet written, but the opinions of Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh suggest two possible visions of its future scope. Justice Gorsuch’s vision is starkly formalist, relying on a distinction between “policy” and “details” and between legislative and non-legislative powers. His opinion, however, left unanswered the all-important questions of how to distinguish policy from detail and legislative from non-legislative powers. Each of these categories covers some distinct ground, but at the margins, in cases that are likely to be litigated, these categories surely blur, vesting significant discretion in the judge attempting to apply them.

By contrast, Justice Kavanaugh’s vision of non-delegation avoids the thorny categories of policy vs. details and legislative vs. non-legislative power. Instead, Justice Kavanaugh recognizes what could be considered a continuum—ranging from minor to major—within the realm of policy. In this view, only major questions of economic and political importance would be off-limits for delegation. But, here too, Justice Kavanaugh’s vision of non-delegation relies on impossibly fine judgments. What makes a policy question “major” rather than minor? How “important” must a statute’s economic and political importance be before it is considered a major question? Indeed, the Court’s major questions cases, including <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/98-1152P.ZO">Brown &amp; Williamson</a> and <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-114_qol1.pdf">King v. Burwell</a>, do little to suggest that these questions can be answered in a predictable, coherent, and objective way.

These two visions of non-delegation are certainly <a href="https://www.acslaw.org/analysis/acs-supreme-court-review/toward-a-non-delegation-doctrine-that-even-progressives-could-like/">not the only possible ways</a> that the new doctrine may be invigorated. The final shape of the doctrine might depend on the case that the justices use as the vehicle to announce a new standard. And much will depend on the opinion’s author and whether the opinion is written in order to attract more than a bare majority. Because of these uncertainties, the Court’s next non-delegation case will be one to watch closely.

		<title>A Perfect Impeachment of Presidential Crime: Emmitt Till Justice or Nuremberg Justice?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span>Between elections, the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2989221" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fallacy</a> that one can not criminally prosecute a sitting President leads us to a situation where the only recognized path to address alleged Presidential criminality during their term is impeachment.</span>

<span>The <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/12/13/trump-impeachment-whats-next-full-house-vote-senate-trial/4407540002/">prognosticators now tell us</a> that the House will vote to <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/Articles%20of%20Impeachment.pdf">impeach President Trump</a> for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress along party lines and the Senate will vote to acquit him in the Senate trial also along party lines.</span>

<span>If those forecasts are accurate and our politics so predictable, something is terribly broken in us.</span>

<span>Is it possible for us as ordinary Americans to see this as a welcome moment where we can insist that those who seek every few years our vote to lead us to be less predictable and more deliberative?</span>

<span>In 1945 Justice Robert Jackson - just before he was appointed Chief Prosecutor at Nuremberg - <a href="https://www.roberthjackson.org/nuremberg-event/justice-robert-h-jacksons-opening-statement/">reminded us</a> that when we use judicial forms we must make sure we respect judicial norms.  And two key aspects of those norms for him were first that the defendant could be represented by whomever they wanted and second that if they could bring forward the evidence for their acquittal they should be able to be acquitted.</span>

<span>And now it seems that the party positions are so hardened that we might need to update Justice Robert Jackson’s comment with a third postulate: that if the evidence brought forward by the prosecutor is there to convict, then it should be possible to convict. </span>

<span>If no matter how convincing the evidence, it is only possible to have articles of impeachment voted or impossible to get a conviction voted because of party lines, then what do we have left to protect the rights of the people?</span>

<span>It reminds me of those cases during segregation like <a href="https://fsu.digital.flvc.org/islandora/object/fsu%253A390158/datastream/OBJ/view/J_W__Milam_and_Roy_Bryant_Trial_Transcript.pdf">Emmett Till with the acquittal by all-white juries</a>.  Those <a href="https://www.apmreports.org/story/2018/06/05/all-white-jury-acquitting-emmett-till-killers">kinds of cases</a> are not history but form part of memory and remind us of the perversion of justice.</span>

<span>Of course, some would say that impeachment is not a judicial process but is a political process and subject to different norms.</span>

<span>I have lived through the <a href="https://watergate.info/impeachment/articles-of-impeachment">Nixon impeachment</a> where the process was not so clearly along party lines. And then the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/105th-congress/house-report/830/">Clinton impeachment</a> which was clearly along party lines.  The Nixon process impressed me, the Clinton process did not. </span>

<span>What will the Trump process be and how will our leaders be viewed by posterity?</span>

One key point is that all of the judicial processes (state courts, courts-martial, military commissions, federal courts) foresee the ability to raise a question as to the independence and impartiality of a juror or a judge.

And the issue of pre-judgment by Senators who will be sworn in as jurors has already arisen before they have been sworn in.

I have seen cases in international arbitration where a party proposed an arbitrator who was required to sign a declaration of independence by which the proposed arbitrator was to state whether they were and would remain independent and impartial during the arbitration. The proposed arbitrator could, in doing that, disclose any points about themselves they wished to be drawn to the parties’ attention, the parties could decide whether to object and if a party so objected the arbitral institution would decide whether or not to confirm the proposed arbitrator as an arbitrator to hear the case looking forward to the enforceability of the arbitral award. And of course, there are the rules on voir dire for ordinary citizens being considered to sit on juries and rules for recusal for judges in state courts, courts-martial, military commissions, and federal courts at all levels. At the Supreme Court, the rule is that the Justice decides on his/her own recusal motion, but that implies that such a motion can be made (and has been made in the past).

Under the <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/SMAN-113/pdf/SMAN-113-pg223.pdf">Senate Impeachment Rules</a> - VII. "The Presiding Officer of the Senate shall direct all necessary preparations in the Senate Chamber, and the <strong>Presiding Officer</strong> (Chief Justice) on the trial shall direct all the forms of proceedings while the Senate is sitting for the purpose of trying an impeachment, and all forms during the trial <strong>not otherwise specially provided for</strong>" (emphasis added).

So, at least in theory, it is possible for an objection to a Senator sitting as a juror in the trial to be raised by another Senator, or the representatives from the House of Representatives and the Presiding Officer (the Chief Justice in this case), in the absence of Senate rules, would have to decide how to address such a motion for recusal.

It is not clear that the Senate can override such a decision by the Presiding Officer. Interestingly, the rules prescribe <strong>only with respect to evidence</strong>, that the Presiding Officer’s ruling shall stand as the judgment of the Senate, unless some Member of the Senate shall ask that a formal vote be taken thereon, in which case it shall be submitted to the Senate for decision without debate; or he may at his option, in the first instance, submit any such question to a vote of the Members of the Senate. Upon all such questions, the vote shall be taken in accordance with the Standing Rules of the Senate.

So we will see if such a step is taken with respect to Senate Majority Leader McConnell and Senator Lindsay Graham who have been reported to have made public comments that could be construed as pre-judgment. Again, is this going to be Emmitt Till Justice or Nuremberg Justice? Inquiring minds wish to know and will be watching.
