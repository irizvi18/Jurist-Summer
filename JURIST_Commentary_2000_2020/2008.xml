		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.lawcouncil.asn.au/RayBio.pdf"><strong>Ross Ray QC</strong></a> [President, <a href="http://www.lawcouncil.asn.au/">Law Council of Australia</a>]: &quot;David Hicks may have been <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/ex-guantanamo-bay-detainee-hicks.php">released from prison on 29 December</a>, but he is not a free man. <br /><br />Although it has not been alleged, let alone proven, that Hicks has committed any offence under Australian law, he is now subject to an interim control order issued under the Commonwealth Criminal Code. Amongst other things the control order requires him to report to police 3 times a week, comply with a midnight to 6am curfew, live at premises approved by police, only use a police issued mobile phone and SIM card and police approved email account and internet provider.<br /><br />The order was issued on the basis that David Hicks, having allegedly trained with a terrorist organization and once expressed support for a violent ideology, represents an unacceptable risk to the community. <br /><br />If the interim control order is confirmed in February, it will likely remain in force for 12 months. David Hicks can have little confidence that once it expires, a new order won&#39;t simply be sought. <br /><br />Once more the Hicks case has drawn attention to the need to be vigilant in ensuring that measures introduced to respond to the threat of terrorism strike an appropriate balance between the legitimate sacrifice of some of our precious rights and freedoms and the introduction of excessive regimes which do not allow the appropriate testing of Executive action.<br /><br />Restrictions on our activities, movements and associations may now be justified, not on the basis of charge or conviction, but on the basis of fear, assertion and supposition. Once branded a risk, a person remains forever vulnerable to Executive intrusion, since there is no obvious expiration date on a person&#39;s &#39;potential terrorist&#39; status. <br /><br />The Law Council will continue to monitor the effects of the control order requirements on the Hicks case, particularly from the point of view of their fairness and impact on the re-engagement of Hicks into the community.&quot;<br />

		<title>Ruling in No Child Left Behind Act case major victory for students, parents</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Michael Simpson [Assistant General Counsel, <a href="http://www.nea.org/index.html">National Education Association</a>]: &quot;In a major victory for students, parents, and public education, <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/federal-appeals-court-rules-no-child.php">the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held on January 7th</a> that the Bush Administration&#39;s interpretation of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) violates the federal Constitution. The court&#39;s ruling came in an NEA-sponsored lawsuit filed in 2005 on behalf of school districts from Michigan, Texas, and Vermont, NEA, and several NEA affiliates challenging the U.S. Department of Education&#39;s (ED) demand that states and school districts expend their own funds in order to comply with mandates of NCLB when there is a shortfall in federal funding. <br /><br />The lawsuit is based on the &quot;unfunded mandates&quot; provision of NCLB (&Acirc;&sect; 9527(a)), which provides, in relevant part, that &quot;[n]othing in this Act shall be construed to &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; mandate a State or any subdivision thereof to spend any funds or incur any costs not paid for under this Act.&quot; The plaintiffs argue that this provision means that ED cannot require states and local school districts to comply with NCLB requirements that are not funded by federal money. The Sixth Circuit agreed, holding that ED&#39;s contrary reading of NCLB &quot;violate[s] the Spending Clause&quot; of the Constitution. NEA estimates that the law has been underfunded by at least $70 billion since its enactment in 2001. <br /><br />This is a major victory because the Court of Appeal reached the merits of the case and ruled in our favor. The Court said that the unfunded mandates provision means exactly what it says: that the federal government cannot require states and school districts to expend their own funds to comply with the NCLB mandates. <br /><br />The case was remanded to the district court &quot;for further proceedings consistent with this opinion,&quot; which could include further litigation on the question whether the federal government actually provides sufficient funds for the plaintiff school districts to comply fully with NCLB. There is also the possibility that this lawsuit may produce a political solution: Congress and the President could provide the federal funds needed to attain NCLB&#39;s goals.<br /><br />ED has 45 days from the date of the decision (i.e., January 7) to file with the Sixth Circuit a petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc, and 90 days from January 7 (or from the disposition of a motion for rehearing) to file a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court. In a statement issued on January 8, ED Secretary Spellings announced that the &quot;federal government is exploring all legal options available.&quot;<br />

		<title>More Guantanamo transfers: a step towards closing the prison?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chip Pitts [President, <a href="http://www.bordc.org/">Bill of Rights Defense Committee</a>; Lecturer, Stanford Law School]: &quot;The recent <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/dod-transfers-10-saudi-detainees-from.php">transfer home from Guantanamo of ten more Saudi prisoners</a> (and reports from Qatar News Agency that more of the final 13 Saudis may soon follow) suggests that the prison is one step closer to being closed &#8212; as demanded by even our closest allies and as acknowledged as a desirable goal since last year even by President Bush (subject to countries taking citizens back and there being trials where appropriate). The timing on the eve of the president&#39;s visit to Saudi Arabia may seem political, recalling how Chinese political prisoners are often released in advance of official U.S. visits. And the Pentagon&#39;s press release claimed, absurdly, that the decision highlights &quot;the processes put in place to assess each individual and make a determination about their detention while hostilities are ongoing &#8212; an unprecedented step in the history of warfare.&quot; Although sending prisoners back is far preferable to attrition (and greater Muslim outrage) from more Saudi suicides at the facility, perhaps the administration&#39;s Guantanamo strategy has failed to an extent that even President Bush can finally grasp.<br /><br />After all, the Supreme Court has repeatedly questioned the effort to set up Guantanamo as a realm beyond the law, and last month&#39;s arguments in the pending <u>Boumediene</u> and <u>Al Odah</u> cases gave no good reasons for a rosier view of Guantanamo (despite the addition of new justices Roberts and Alito). In 2004, the Court found in <u>Rasul v. Bush</u> that the detainees had a right to challenge their detention via habeas corpus, and in the 2006 <u>Hamdan</u> case, the Court found that the administration&#39;s military commissions plan violated the Geneva Conventions and that the court-stripping measures of the 2005 Detainee Treatment Act did not preclude pending habeas claims. Given those precedents, the Court certainly should not find now, after six years of Guantanamo detentions:<ul><li>that the supposedly speedy rights to habeas review have been legally removed (in the absence of the &quot;invasion or rebellion&quot; constitutionally required) or<br /><br /><li>that the flawed &quot;Combatant Status Review Tribunal&quot; substitute offered (allowing secret evidence and evidence obtained by coercion, a military advisor in lieu of independent counsel, etc) -- meets the demands of habeas, due process, international human rights and humanitarian law, or fundamental fairness.</ul>As a practical matter, moreover, the release of hundreds of detainees without incident &#8212; more than two-thirds of the over 900 prisoners who have been held at Guantanamo at one time or another &#8212; confirms the military&#39;s own analysis (buttressed by the 2005 Seton Hall and other academic studies) that few Guantanamo detainees had any connection to al Qaeda or Taliban fighters. Vague allegations that a few have &quot;resumed hostilities&quot; have been found to be grossly exaggerated and misleading by another Seton Hall study. Even if true to a limited extent, however, this could be the predictable reaction that some might have to being held incommunicado without counsel, due process, access to family or friends and subject to abuse and torture for years. It hardly proves evidence of an original al Qaeda connection.<br /><br />If evidence of terrorism or war crimes exists against any of the 275 remaining prisoners they should be tried by fair legal processes. If not, they too should be released to their home countries or to locations where they can be reliably confident they won&#39;t be tortured or abused (a test that can&#39;t be met by mere diplomatic assurances by nations like Libya that still resort to torture according to our own State Department). Although those most susceptible to release have been released, and numbers are dwindling down to the 80 detainees (including the 15 &quot;high value&quot; detainees) of greatest genuine concern, it&#39;s past time to end the overbroad, illegal, and counterproductive measures that have characterized the so-called &#39;war on terror&#39;. Finally focusing instead on tailored, intelligent, lawful means to counter the growing number of actual terrorists would be much more moral, legal, and effective.&quot;<br />

		<title>Lifting Turkey&#039;s headscarf ban: freedom of choice, or Islamist Trojan horse?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Farzana Hassan [President, <a href="http://www.muslimcanadiancongress.org/index.html">Muslim Canadian Congress</a>] and Zeynep Baysal [Director, <a href="http://www.muslimcanadiancongress.org/index.html">Muslim Canadian Congress</a>]: &quot;The recent victory of the newly elected Islamic party in secular Turkey has spawned a reversal to traditional Islamic precept and practice in the country. This contention is confirmed by the newly elected Turkish Prime Minister&#39;s move to <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/turkish-pm-calls-for-end-to-headscarf.php">lift the ban on headscarves in public places</a> nearly a century after their prohibition by secular reformist Kamal Ataturk. The move is intended to allow Muslim women the right to express their religiosity in a more conservative manner if they so desire.<br /><br />Most would agree that such a move is desirable in the interest of freedom of choice. However, ideally, in a climate of resurgent religious fundamentalism, the lifting of the ban must also be accompanied by appropriate safeguards for the rights of those who choose not to wear the headscarf.<br /><br />There is no guarantee for example, that women who refuse the hijab will not be forced into adopting the practice simply because it is deemed a religious requirement by the orthodoxy. The danger in lifting the ban lies in the empowerment of a fundamentalist strain within Islam that marginalizes and oppresses women, isolating them in social enclaves and reducing their role in society to one of subservience and subjugation. An allowance for women to don the hijab in public will regrettably also provide leverage to the religious right to enforce compliance for the practice where it is not voluntary. Will the current Islamic government of Turkey also legislate to ensure that women are not coerced into wearing the headscarf? Interestingly, Merve Kavakci, a Turkish American barred from entering the Turkish parliament in a hijab, blatantly rejected the right of Iranian female legislators to appear in parliament without the headgear. Choices must work both ways.<br /><br />Traditional Muslims often respond to such criticism by downplaying the social pressures faced by women who reject the hijab. This, however, is a misrepresentation of reality. Even women who supposedly opt for it, do so because they are rarely if ever exposed to an alternative exegesis on the issue, which does not regard the hijab as a requirement. Women&#39;s &quot;choice&quot; in the matter can be considered genuine only if they are exposed to other narratives on modesty which do not entail the covering of the hair. <br /><br />Turkey as a modern state and last refuge for secular Islam must continue to uphold its tradition of the separation of religion and state. The current government hopes to use the hijab as an Islamist Trojan horse to eliminate secularism. Here, it is useful to remember that Turkey is a predominantly Muslim country. People pray, fast, give alms and some of them choose to cover their hair, which thus far never presented a problem in the country. Islamists have now introduced the headgear as a social weapon to fight secularism, turning it into a political weapon. The headgear or hijab is a political tool and a threat to Turkey&#39;s secular tradition. Currently, there is pressure for secular women to cover themselves even in large cities. The present government is also trying to eliminate the secular dress code in government offices. It has taken a slower, steadier path, careful not to rock the establishment too quickly while at the same time floating an occasional trial balloon for social reforms to advance the Islamist agenda. <br /><br />Turkey must continue repel the Islamist onslaught in such matters. It must continue to serve as an example to other Muslim nations who are lagging far behind in terms of instituting democratic values, pluralism, egalitarianism, as well as freedom of conscience and religion.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Max Croes [Advocacy Associate, <a href="http://www.sudandivestment.org">Sudan Divestment Task Force</a>]: &quot;On December 31, 2007, President Bush, with unanimous support from Congress, signed the <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/bush-signs-sudan-divestment-bill.php). "><strong>Sudan Accountability and Divestment Act </strong></a> into law. The law is a landmark establishment of standards for policies of targeted divestment from Sudan. The operative provisions are fourfold.<br /><br />First, the law authorizes states and local governments to adopt policies of targeted Sudan divestment absolving contentions of constitutionality pertaining to Article 6 Clause 2 of the US Constitution. These actions are authorized only if states limit the scope of divestiture to companies involved in Sudan&#39;s oil, mineral extraction, power production and military sectors, and provide targeted companies the opportunity to address their Sudan operations prior to divestment. Secondly, the law effectively prohibits corporations operating in these targeted sectors from receiving US government contracts. It also authorizes states and local governments to pursue their own policies of contract prohibition. Third, the legislation provides legal protection for asset managers that pursue policies of Sudan divestment within the specified sectors. Lastly, the law establishes a sense of Congress that private pension funds may implement targeted divestment from Sudan without violating the Employee Retirement Income Securities Act (ERISA).<br /><br />Since 2005, 22 states have adopted divestment policies from Sudan. Fifteen of these states have adopted the Sudan Divestment Task Force model of targeted Sudan divestment which, like the Sudan Accountability and Divestment Act only targets companies involved in Sudan&#39;s oil, mineral extraction, power production and military sectors and provides targeted companies the opportunity to address their Sudan operations prior to divestment.<br /><br />In February 2006, U.S. District Judge Matthew F. Kennelly ruled a broad Sudan divestment statute in Illinois to be unconstitutional. The Sudan Accountability and Divestment Act provides clarity and constitutional protection from similar challenges for the 15 states that have already adopted the Sudan Divestment Task Force&#39;s divestment model and the 14 states that will be considering the model in 2008.<br /><br />The Sudan Accountability and Divestment Act has already affected corporate operations in Sudan. Sudan&#39;s government is overwhelmingly reliant on foreign direct investment, specifically in the country&#39;s oil sector, and has shown an historic responsiveness to economic pressure. Since the introduction of the legislation, nine companies have either withdrawn from Sudan or substantially altered their business operations and corporate governance policies in the country. Pressure placed on these corporations and the Sudanese government is expected to increase significantly with the impending federal contract prohibition and threat of potential state contract prohibition.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://anlus.wordpress.com/"><strong>Santosh Giri</strong></a> [advocate/human rights lawyer, Supreme Court of Nepal]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/nepal-parliament-votes-to-abolish.php">abolition of Nepal&#39;s nearly 240-year-old monarchy</a> and declaration of Nepal as a &quot;federal, democratic, republican state&quot; was made by an overwhelming majority in the interim parliament late last month. 270 members in the 329-member House of Representatives voted on December 27, 2007 in favor of ending the monarchy (3 pro-monarchists cast against the motion while the rest abstained). However, Nepal will become a republic only after the first meeting of the Constituent Assembly, which is due to be elected by mid-April next year. The decision also serves to put the peace process back on track and paves the way for elections notwithstanding the fact that elections have been postponed three times since June 2006. Constituent Assembly seats has been increased from 497 to 601, of which 335 (58%) will be elected on the basis of proportional representation, with 240 to be directly elected and 26 to be nominated by the country&#39;s cabinet.<br /><br /><strong>Background</strong><br /><br />Since 1990 restoration of democracy, there were 3 elections in 1991, 1996 and 1999. Numerous governments were formed and numerous failed. The parliament was dissolved in 2002 which paved way for an absolute monarchy again. In 2005, the king staged a coup d&#39;&eacute;tat. Seven major political parties united and formed an alliance with the Maoists to overthrow the king in April 2006 after dozens of innocent killings. In April 2006, the king restored the parliament which eventually led to abolishment of the monarchy. The November 2006 agreement between the political parties and the Maoists came as a peace pact which enabled a cease-fire and temporarily ending the conflict in which more than 13,000 people died since 1996. In January 2007 the Maoists entered the parliament and the cabinet in April 2007.  In September 2007, the Maoists walked out of the government citing differences and demanding fulfillment of their demands of abolishment of monarchy and restructuring of the electoral system. They also threatened to quit the parliament in December 2007 if their demands were not met. Meanwhile the Constituent Assembly elections were postponed thrice, firstly citing lack of preparedness, secondly unfavorable security situation and thirdly the Maoists opposition. In December 2007, a new accord was signed which agreed on both demands and the Maoists reentered the cabinet. In December 2007, the parliament with a majority decision abolished the monarchy (subjected to ratification by the Constituent Assembly Parliament) and restructured the electoral system. <br /><br />Nonetheless, the Maoists continuously lost support because of continued terrorism through splinter groups such as Madheshi Janadhikar Forum (MJF), Janatantrik Terai Mukti Morcha (JTMM) etc and its sister organizations such as Young Communist league, All Nepal Free Student Union (Revolutionary), All Nepal Free Trade Union (Revolutionary) and others. Extortion, protection, murder, kidnapping, disappearance, property seizure, forced displacement, forced recruitment and censorship against newspapers are rampant. Moreover, in the southern Terai plains region they have been involved in inter-ethnic rivalry, resulting in several deaths. The seven-party alliance, on the other hand is widely criticized for its lack of control over the heightened insecurity, increase in crime and impunity. <br /><br /><strong>Nepal&#39;s transition from a monarchy to a republic</strong> <br /><br />Nepal&#39;s monarchy has drastically changed from being traditional, titular, democratic, absolute and stripped-off-powers until recently. The recent abolishment of monarchy has shelved the 240 year old rule in the history forever. A challenging transition phase is yet to be completed for a complete transformation to a republic. Since April 2006 parliament has made strong decisions on monarchy such as stripping off its powers, titles, rights and privileges of the king and finally the abolishment of the institution. <br /><br />Criticisms are widely being drawn regarding the abolishment of the monarchy based on the following:<br /><br /><u>(a) Uncertain Elections</u>: Uncertainty of elections still persists amidst ongoing Terai (Southern Plains) Crisis, where several violent and non-violent groups have put forth demands to ensure the rights of the Madheshis (people from the Southern Plains) who have been discriminated historically in all walks of life. Many doubt if an election will ever occur for some time! If there is no election, there is no endorsement! In an event the election go through, it will be obliged to endorse the motion of abolishment of the monarchy and will not have the power to amend or reject it. <br /><br /><u>(b) Just a Fuel</u>: The recent decision is also understood as a last resort to elongate the November 2006 agreement between the Seven Party Alliance and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) which seemed to be breaking away until December 2007. There were vows from the Maoists to quit parliament after they walked out of the government and to take up arms again to wage a &#39;decisive war&#39;. That agreement came three months after Maoist rebels had walked out of the government in September 2007, demanding immediate abolition of the centuries old institution. The abolition of the monarchy and change in electoral laws has been two key campaigning issues for the CPN-M. <br /><br /><u>(c) The South Block</u>: India has been against the idea of abolishing the monarchy as much as Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which insists that the monarchy in Nepal is essential for the sake of Hinduism. <br /><br /><u>(d) A Ploy of the SPA-M Alliance</u>: There have been accusations from the Terai based parties and groups that the agreement and the recent decision is nothing but a mere ploy to give continuance to the ruling government which comprises of seven major parties and the Maoists. Accusations also raise serious concern over the lack of proper action by the government on the nations increasing insurgency and displacement of the citizens. <br /><br /><u>(e) Pro-monarchs</u>: Recent demonstrations by the pro-royalist parties including RPP and RJP (led by ex-prime ministers Surya Bahadur Thapa and Lokendra Bahadur Chand suggest integration of their like-mindedness and protesting the parliaments recent decision. Hindu extremists and traditional royalists have already started raising their voices against the abolishment. A recent interview of Bharat Keshar Singh, ADC to the King, shows the Royalists perception towards the recent developments. The royalists still claim the parliament and the results derived thereof as unconstitutional and ad-hoc in nature. Although such issues are not primarily significant at this point, it may still suggest a plot to be staged in future. <br /><br /><u>(f) Nepal Army</u>: Previously known as the backbone of the Monarch, Nepal Army boasts itself as a People&#39;s institution now. It has openly abstained from being associated with any &#39;ism&#39; and has clearly denounced integration of the Maoist soldiers with the Nepal army. Maoists have already raised serious concerns about this. Though Nepal Army has made its stance clear that it shall not be involved in a coup, a possibility cannot be ruled out in a South Asian Political perspective. <br /><br /><u>(g) Intra-Party and Inter-Party Factions</u>: Be it Nepali Congress, Communist Party of Nepal or RPP, all of these have factions. There have been several breakaways and integration among each of them, which raises serious concerns over a sustainable peace, peace-pact and the results we have generated. <br /><br />Strong provisions have also been made for removing the monarchy before the perspective polls in an event the king is found to &quot;be creating serious hurdles to the Constituent Assembly Elections&quot;. A two-thirds majority decision of the interim parliament will be required in such situation. <br /><br /><em>The perspective on the abolishment of monarchy and the politics of Nepal does not necessarily represent the perspective of Association of Nepalese Lawyers in the US [ANLUS] as a whole or in part.

		<title>US pandemic flu plans should not curtail civil liberties</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.slaw.neu.edu/"><strong>Wendy E. Parmet</strong></a> [Professor of Law, <a href="http://www.slaw.neu.edu/">Northeastern University School of Law</a>]: &quot;The spread of H5N1, a new, deadly strain of avian influenza, has raised fears of a potential human pandemic. While the virus is not now easily transmissible to humans, scientists fear it may mutate to become more highly contagious, thereby triggering a pandemic. <br /><br />In the last several years, the <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/aclu-says-us-pandemic-flu-plans-may.php">federal government has begun planning</a> for such a possibility. In so doing, officials have rightly recognized the important role that law can play in protecting the public&#39;s health. Unfortunately, as a recent <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/privacy/pemic_report.pdf">report</a> by the ACLU shows, federal pandemic planning efforts, particularly with respect to what the government calls &quot;legal preparedness,&quot; have unduly focused on the use of law to impose restraint on Americans and immunize officials in the event of an emergency. Reflecting a perspective more appropriate for the law enforcement and national security contexts than for public health, federal plans mistakenly assume an inevitable trade-off between health and liberty, and between health and accountability. <br /><br />History shows that such trade-offs are both unnecessary and counterproductive. Americans overwhelmingly do not want to spread disease to others and are generally more than willing to follow public health advice -- if they can trust public health officials and if official advice can be plausibly followed. Effective public health policies nurture trust and help communities develop the capacity to reduce the spread of disease and care for the ill. Rather than forcing individuals into quarantines, effective pandemic planning would provide individuals with the financial and practical means to comply with requests by health officials to stay at home &#8212; for example, by providing income replacement and ensuring that medications will be delivered.<br /><br />Of course, there will always be a few people who deliberately engage in behaviors that expose others to infection. Sufficient laws already exist to deal with such cases. But focusing on such individuals distracts attention from the critical and expensive steps&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;including support for a crumbling public health infrastructure and development of an ample surge capacity within the health care system&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;that are necessary to prevent or mitigate a pandemic. Moreover, the adoption of a law enforcement/national security approach to public health poses a grave and interminable threat to civil liberties. The war against disease, after all, will never end. If health requires the suspension of civil liberties, they will be forever lost.<br /><br />To encourage the development of an effective pandemic policy, the ACLU has proposed an alternative approach built on four fundamental principles:<ul><li><strong>Health</strong> -- The goal of preparing for a pandemic is to protect the lives and health of all people in America, not law enforcement or national security. <br /><br /><li><strong>Justice</strong> -- Preparation for a potential pandemic (or any disaster) should ensure a fair distribution of the benefits and burdens of precautions and responses and equal respect for the dignity and autonomy of each individual.<br /><br /><li><strong>Transparency</strong> -- Pandemic preparedness requires transparent communication of accurate information among all levels of government and the public in order to warrant public trust.<br /><br /><li><strong>Accountability</strong> -- Everyone, including private individuals and organizations and government agencies and officials, should be accountable for their actions before, during and after an emergency.</ul>A pandemic policy based on these principles would emphasize community engagement and accountability. It would protect minorities and disadvantaged individuals from discriminatory measures. And it would rely to the greatest degree possible on voluntary actions, ensuring that coercive measures are applied only when they are necessary as a last resort, and only with full constitutional protections. By working with rather than against the American public, and maintaining rather than suspending the role of law, Americans can have both their health and their liberty.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Basil Fernando [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.alrc.net/">Asian Legal Resource Centre</a>]: &quot;This note confines itself to the legal implications of the <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/pakistan-ex-pm-bhutto-assassinated-at.php">assassination of Benazir Bhutto</a>, though in fact it will also be felt enormously politically and socially. It is important to note that the assassination has taken place shortly after the country&#39;s higher judiciary was virtually wiped out by the dismissal of forty of the country&#39;s respected judges. With that act whatever the limited credibility Pakistan&#39;s judiciary might have had was lost. In the eyes of the people of the country their judiciary no longer enjoys their confidence. Whatever semblance of confidence that could have been built through an election, perceived to be relatively fair under the circumstances, is now also lost with the assassination of one of the two best known political leaders of the country. Added to this is the fact that President Musharraf himself no longer enjoys any legitimacy. Initially his legitimacy lied in the fact that he was the leader of the military and that, for better or for worse, he was holding power as a leader of the military. However, he is now no longer the leader of Pakistan&#39;s military. He can root his legitimacy only within the political framework of the country and yet now there is no political framework to speak of.<br /><br />At the moment the greatest victims of the chaos within Pakistan are the middle class and the educated elite, including the professional classes. Over six thousand lawyers were arrested and very senior lawyers like Munir Malik, the former president of the Supreme Court Bar Association, who was tortured so severely that he suffered renal failure, is symbolic of this problem. At the time of writing this note news has also been received that the two daughters of Asma Jahangir, a well known lawyer and a United Nations Rapporteur were assaulted and threatened. One of the daughters narrowly escaped sexual abuse due to the timely intervention of her mother, who was also threatened by gunmen who belonged to the ruling party. Benazir Bhutto would have represented the country&#39;s elite, the middle class and the secular forces. Now, as there will be severe polarization within the country, there will be very little room left for this class. It is on this class of people that the running of the institutions of rule of law and democracy in terms of acceptable standards rests. The loss of the position of this class will severely imbalance the very foundations of legality in the country.<br /><br />This will further help the polarization of the extremist elements, the army on the one hand and on the other, various sectarian forces which have been staging their revolts in this dangerous region of the world. Between them they will threaten all aspects of the legal system of the country. The gun and not the rule of law will conduct the social discourse. There are several countries in South Asia now which have fallen to this situation. One lesson that can be learned from them is that once this situation comes about, the plunge into the greater abyss of lawlessness is rapid. The very fact of the state losing its legitimacy will help other extreme forces because they no longer have to compete to demonstrate their positions as being more legitimate than the state. As the state is unable to conduct its affairs on the basis of legality it will also rely more on brute military force. When the legitimacy of the state is undermined this itself becomes the argument that justifies the actions of the extremists. <br /><br />The loss of the significance of legality not only threatens individual freedoms but also the very property system itself. There are many examples in the Asian region that demonstrates how large scale assaults on property by way of land grabbing and enormous cheating in business activities can take place when law enforcement and the adjudicating power of the courts falter. Often various groups enjoying the patronage of the military become the most active elements in such situations. Under those circumstances a professional military is replaced with a military that has strong claims on property issues. <br /><br />Under the present circumstances it is very doubtful as to whether any election will be perceived by the people as credible. It will take extraordinary attempts in order to convince the public of the legality of any election in the future. President Musharraf is very unlikely to take any such extraordinary steps to conduct an election that will be perceived as legitimate. Instead the public perception at the moment is that every possible attempt will be made to subvert a free and fair election. In all likelihood the ghost of Benazir Bhutto will haunt the people of the country, reminding them that there is something foul in the state of Pakistan.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cristi&aacute;n Correa [Senior Associate, <a href="http://www.ictj.org/en/index.html">International Center for Transitional Justice</a>]: &quot;The whole debate about <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/us-intelligence-chief-says.php">if waterboarding is torture</a> or not seems artificial to me, because it is very clear that drowning detainees during interrogation is a way of intentionally inflicting severe physical suffering for the purpose of obtaining information or a confession. [US Director of National Intelligence] McConnell&#39;s comments are just what should be expected from any civil servant. They are positive in the way that they contradict Mr. Mukasey&#39;s reluctance to acknowledge that such practice is torture during his confirmation hearings as Attorney General. However, it will be difficult to challenge the strong message that the Administration, through the Vice President&#39;s statements to the press and through the former Attorney General&#39;s secret memos, has sent to the public and to those agents in charge of questioning detainees.<br /><br />The United Nations Convention Against Torture contains a definition of torture that reflects the international consensus about it, a consensus that includes the United States. The efforts of the U.S. current Administration to narrow the definition of torture and to exempt some &quot;harsh interrogations techniques&quot; from it resemble the attitudes and arguments employed by dictatorships and other regimes that systematically violate human rights. They also induce confusion among U.S. military and intelligence agents about which are the borders between lawful techniques and criminal conduct. <br /><br />The U.N. Committee Against Torture has been very clear in demanding that the U.S. &quot;should rescind any interrogation technique, including methods involving sexual humiliation, &quot;waterboarding&quot;, &quot;short shackling&quot; and using dogs to induce fear, that constitute torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, in all places of detention under its de facto effective control, in order to comply with its obligations under the Convention.&quot; (Conclusion and recommendations of the Committee to the U.S., July 25, 2006, paragraph 24). In its comments to those conclusions, presented in November 6, 2007, the Administration affirmed that the Department of Defense Directive 2310.01E and the Army Field Manual 2-22.3, both passed in September 2006, &quot;provide guidance to military personnel to ensure compliance with the law, and require that all personnel subject to the directive treat all detainees, regardless of their legal status, consistently with the minimum standards of Common Article 3 [of the Geneva Conventions]&quot;. Both documents establish the general principle of the obligation for all personnel to treat detainees humanely, and that all intelligence interrogations, debriefings, or tactical questioning to gain intelligence from captured or detained personnel shall also be conducted humanely, in accordance with applicable law and policy. If the Administration&#39;s answer to the Committee intended to preclude the use of waterboarding, as it seems to, in response to such a direct request, there is no explanation for the reluctance of the Attorney General to avoid a clear answer condemning its use. On the contrary, given that the Army Field Manual is a long text that doesn&#39;t receive the same degree of publicity as the confirmation hearing, the lack of a clear answer from Mr. Mukasey helps to maintain the uncertainty of whether waterboarding prisoners is permitted or is a crime.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.comisiontortura.cl">Chilean Commission on Political Imprisonment and Torture</a>, which received more than 35,000 testimonies of victims of torture during the Pinochet regime, considered that to provoke a near to death experience, by waterboarding, is torture. The Commission was able to listen to several persons that were tortured by waterboarding, appreciating the consequences of physically experiencing being intentionally drowned by captors until almost dying, in the context of detention. The Commission rejected this practice and denounced how torture was massively and institutionally used during the 1973-1990 dictatorship. Such an official acknowledgment of a criminal policy is helping Chile to come to terms with its past, as well as serving as a foundation of its restored democracy. As it is the experience of Chile and many other countries throughout the world, acknowledging wrong doings bring legitimacy to governments. It also helps countries to reinforce their commitments to the protection and promotion of the rights of their citizens and of the rights of every person.&quot;<br />

		<title>Canada and torture: politics trumps human rights again</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alex Neve [Secretary General, <a href="http://www.amnesty.ca">Amnesty International Canada</a>]: &quot;Over the past week there has been reason to both <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/canada-document-includes-us-on-list-of.php">commend</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/canada-to-remove-us-from-list-of-states.php">chastise</a> Canada for the approach it takes to assessing where torture is likely to occur. <br /><br />In the midst of court action launched by Amnesty International Canada and the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, challenging Canada&#39;s practice of transferring battlefield detainees in Afghanistan into the custody Afghan officials, a manual has come to light, used to train Canadian diplomats who are likely to interview Canadians imprisoned abroad. There has been considerable criticism of Canada&#39;s approach in the past, as consular officers sent in to foreign jail cells have often lacked the expertise and information needed to detect whether prisoners may have been subjected to torture or mistreatment. This was certainly underscored in the course of the public inquiry into the case of Maher Arar, the Canadian citizen who was detained and tortured in Syria for one year. Among the many revelations of wrongdoing and mistakes by Canadian officials, the public inquiry made it clear that the efforts of Canadian diplomats in Syria to determine whether Mr. Arar was being tortured were inadequate. The new training program was meant to remedy those distressing shortcomings.<br /><br />The manual included a page listing a number of countries or locations where torture or abuse in prison may possibly occur. Those listed are Afghanistan, China, Egypt, Guantanamo Bay, Iran, Israel, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Syria and the United States. Not an exhaustive list by any means but certainly a sampling of countries where there have been notorious and often tragic examples of detained Canadians being badly tortured, sometimes leading to death. It was remarkable and refreshing to see a list based objectively on a country&#39;s human rights record, not politics. As such, Guantanamo Bay, Israel, Mexico and the United States were all included, despite being close allies of Canada. This did, however, starkly highlight contradictions in Canadian foreign policy. For example Canadian consular staff were being trained to be cognizant of the fact that torture is a real likelihood in Guantanamo Bay while, at the same time, the Canadian government maintains virtual silence and refuses to intervene in the case of Canadian citizen Omar Khadr, sent to Guantanamo at the age of fifteen and now held there for over five years.<br /><br />But all of this changed quickly once the information came to public attention. There was swift reaction from both the US and Israeli Ambassadors to Canada, both objecting strenuously to having been listed in this way. That was followed soon after by a statement from Canadian Foreign Minister Maxime Bernier, expressing his regret for having embarrassed close allies who were &quot;wrongly&quot; included on the list. He indicated that the list was to be reviewed and rewritten. So once again, human rights considerations take a back seat to politics. The message of course is that Canada is more concerned about protecting allies from embarrassment than delivering comprehensive and objective training that will help protect Canadians from torture. <br /><br />Lists such as these should most certainly be regularly reviewed. The purpose of the review should be to ensure the accuracy of the information. If there have been substantial reforms in a country then yes, of course, it should be removed from the list. If it is apparent that a country where torture is a real concern and where there is a likelihood of Canadians being imprisoned is missing from the list, it should be added. Sadly, though, that does not seem to be the spirit of this review. Rather, it appears that the motivation is quite simply to compile a list of countries not friendly to Canada. <br /><br />The struggle against torture deserves and requires a more principled approach.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Malcolm Nance [Director, <a href="http://www.specialreadiness.com"><strong>SRSI - Special Readiness Services International</strong></a>]: &quot;That the National Director of Intelligence, <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/us-intelligence-chief-says.php">Mike McConnell would recently come out and opine</a> that waterboarding &quot;[W]hether it&#39;s torture by anybody else&#39;s definition &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; for me it would be torture&quot; tells me that the heretofore positive view of torture may be ready to dramatically reverse itself. <br /><br />First, an aside. Admiral McConnell is a person who falls under the highest risk of capture as the highest level official of the US intelligence community. It would seem to me that as the NDI he should have already been a recipient of some form of Level &quot;C&quot; code of conduct training for intelligence personnel who could become potential peacetime detainees, terrorist hostages or prisoners of war. The reason I mention this is that Mr. McConnell, as executive program manager for all US intelligence should already have seen the waterboarding process in training at one of the agent survivability courses. I am surprised that he chose to offer speculation in a variety magazine about how it could or could not feel. His words betray him. He has seen it, even in a training environment and he doesn&#39;t like what he&#39;s seen. <br /><br />I suspect that Mr. McConnell, like Judge Mukasey, is waiting for a clear legal standard for torture (backed up by centuries of precedence) before he will cross the line to condemn the administration&#39;s use of it on captured prisoners. In Mr. McConnell&#39;s words, he is not sure if it is &quot;legally&quot; torture &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; but torture is any technique that deliberately inflicts pain, anguish and mental suffering to induce responses by threatening more pain - and it should shock the conscience. <br /><br />Clearly Mr. McConnell has already been shocked. He states in his New Yorker interview waterboarding already meets his personal definition of &quot;&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; excruciatingly painful to the point of forcing someone to say something because of the pain&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;&quot; <br /><br />Mr. McConnell conjectures quite accurately when he says &quot;If I had water draining into my nose, oh God, I just can&#39;t imagine how painful! Whether it&#39;s torture by anybody else&#39;s definition, for me it would be torture.&quot; That is exactly what happens when the water fills the nose, throat and pushes into the lungs. The entire process is designed to make the subject say something to make the pain stop&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; it&#39;s the pain and fear of more pain that makes the victim talk&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; about anything; truth, lie or all of the above. <br /><br />As a former intelligence professional, its clear to me that Director McConnell is not just letting his personal opinion roll off his tongue, but he is sending a message across the community that this practice is about to be outlawed in US intelligence. Perhaps he is also trying to assist Judge Mukasey to give him a legal opinion to back him up? Anything is possible. Still he threateningly adds &quot;If it ever is determined to be torture, there will be a huge penalty to be paid for anyone engaging in it.&quot; To his credit one can surmise that when the hammer drops he wants to be on the right side of the issue. And woe betides those who chose to be on the wrong side and participated willingly on the President&#39;s say so.<br /><br />Refreshing as it may seem, we will have to wait to see if his presupposition that waterboarding is, as it has always been, illegal or merely turned into a stressful and unpleasant way to talk to terrorists, precedence and rule of law be damned. As JURIST commentators and many other legal scholars have discussed, there is no such finding or discussion necessary &#8212; torture is illegal under many US and international statutes today. <br /><br />Hopefully the Justice Department&#39;s criminal investigation of the destruction of videotapes, which it is alleged shows the direct torture of Al Qaeda suspects, will pry open the sense of moral courage among the more righteous members of the CIA and Justice Department. We need to bring to account the people who decided torture is criminal when the enemy does it but acceptable, debatable and legal when we do it.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>John Kamm [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.duihua.org/index.htm">The Dui Hua Foundation</a>] &quot;<a href="/paperchase/2007/12/china-arrests-rights-activist-for.php">The detention of Hu Jia</a> on December 27, 2007 for &quot;incitement to subversion&quot; is the most important move against the small but increasingly defiant community of human rights defenders and dissidents in China in recent months. We do not know the specifics of what he is suspected of, and are unlikely to know the basics of the charges until, at the earliest, a prosecutor formally approves an arrest order, an event likely to happen in late January, roughly two weeks before the onset of Spring Festival. That will set in motion a period of police investigation (commencing in earnest after the long holiday) that will almost certainly conclude with Hu&#39;s trial and conviction later in 2008. All this will be going on in Beijing as the city readies itself to host the Olympics in August. With a reckless disdain for world opinion, Beijing has just taken a big step that will help insure that human rights are a principal focus of the games. <br /><br />Hu has been a force of nature, an outspoken activist in a high profile area (HIV/AIDS) with excellent contacts both among China&#39;s fledgling human rights community and foreign journalists. Because he was involved in so many confrontations with the authorities &#8212; and because of his daring video protest at his own (and his wife&#39;s) treatment at the hands of the political police &#8212; it is not possible to guess what the tipping point was that led to his detention.<br /><br />One possibility is Hu&#39;s participation in a European Parliament meeting on China&#39;s human rights situation held in Brussels in late November. The EU Parliament invited 11 Chinese representatives to attend, but the Chinese government refused to give them visas. Hu went ahead and attended by means of video phone linkup to his apartment in Beijing, where he and his wife have been under house arrest. His remarks, as reported by the Interpress Service, were highly critical of China&#39;s human rights record as well as aspects of its preparation for the Olympics. There have been several other recent detentions and arrests of individuals who have voiced opposition to the Olympics including that of the petitioner Yang Chunlin (&quot;We want human rights, not the Olympics.&quot;)<br /><br />Dui Hua recently published national statistics that showed that arrests for endangering state security doubled in 2006 over 2005. Hu Jia&#39;s detention, happening at the end of 2007, will not show up as an arrest statistic until the numbers for 2008 are released in late 2009. It nevertheless illustrates in the starkest of terms the determination of China&#39;s leaders to suppress all forms of protest and non-violent dissent. It remains to be seen whether the international community will do anything other than issuing strong statements of disapproval.&quot;<br />

		<title>Norway extraditing Vukovar war crimes suspect Sireta to the wrong country</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ranko Helebrant [Deputy Executive Director, Croation Helsinki Committee for Human Rights]: &quot;Damir Sireta (43), a citizen of Croatia, is waiting to be transferred to Serbia in the near future, according to the <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/norway-to-extradite-vukovar-war-crimes.php"><strong>decision of extradition</strong></a> made by the Kingdom of Norway. Although both Croatia and Serbia asked for extradition, the final decision was made in favor of Serbia. The official explanation was that Serbia accused Damir Sireta of the killing of 200 people in Vukovar in November 1991, while in the Croatian request he was accused just for killing one person. Sireta was accused and sentenced to 12 years in an earlier judgment of a court in Vukovar. <br /><br />The opinion of the CHC is that the decision of Norway is questionable because the war crimes that Damir Sireta is accused for were committed in Vukovar, Croatia. Having in mind that both countries requested his extradition, we feel that the territorial principle should be stronger than the level of accusation. The fact that so far Croatia accused Damir Sireta only for one murder doesn&#39;t mean that the prosecutor&#39;s office in Vukovar couldn&#39;t broaden their indictment. In that respect we also point out the responsibility of Croatian institutions which haven&#39;t done that before submitting the request to Norway.<br /><br />In the present situation we hope that court proceedings in Belgrade will be fair and impartial, giving compensation to the victims of that horrible crime. It would be very important that some of the representatives of the Croatian state and civil society organizations monitor the whole proceedings, and report about it to the Croatian public.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Faisal Naseem Chaudhry [advocate, Lahore High Court, Lahore, Pakistan]: &quot;All was not well on the morning of December 27, yet it was not so unwell either. Elections were to take place on 8th of January. Benazir Bhutto, Nawaz Sharif and other politicians were on a move round-the-clock as part of their election campaign. The lawyers&#39; boycott of judges who had taken oath&#39;s under General Musharraf&#39;s declaration of emergency rule was a working reality, with the exception of Lahore. The issue of restoration of the ousted superior court judges was sizzling and Bhutto was condemned for her fluctuating stance on the subject.<br /><br />Everything changed at 6 PM that evening when one or more bullets killed her. Three days of official mourning witnessed excessive damage to public and private property resulting in huge losses to the national exchequer; just the other day Pakistan Railways demanded 6 billion rupees for a revamp. The Election Commission of Pakistan set February 18 as the new date for General Elections, and the deposed judges appeared to be part of history.<br /><br />Only in the last couple of weeks has the lawyers&#39; movement witnessed some progress. The Lahore District Bar Elections took place on 12 January. Hamid Khan&#39;s all-powerful &quot;Professional Group&quot; made a clean sweep. After a couple of days, the new Chief of Army Staff issued a strict official directive that he would not tolerate military&#39;s indulgence into politics and any officer inviting a politician to his office shall have to face serious consequences. News items also appeared that the Army Chief also decided to summon back officers working as deputies in in civilian organizations. <br /><br />In the wake of all this, a strange decision of Pakistan Bar Council struck everyone. Through a resolution, it decided that the lawyers&#39; fraternity would observe a complete strike of Superior and Subordinate Judiciary on every Thursday while on other working days only a token strike shall be observed from 10:30 am to 11:30 am. This is interesting because in the Superior Judiciary, the tea break for judges commences at 10:30 and ends at 11. The decision jolted not the community, but rather its discipline. In its wake, provincial and local lawyers bodies agitated and simply flouted the decision of the Pakistan Bar Council, asking it to go back to its former rule.<br /><br />February 2008 is going to be a very important month. National Elections are to take place, but for me, the Lahore High Court Bar Association Elections (23 Feb) are of more importance. It was a shame when the Office Bearers of the Lahore District Bar Association came out against rallies amidst police baton charges and our leadership preferred to take shelter in the form of &#39;house arrest&#39;. It was a shame when we were advised to &#39;protest&#39; within the boundary of the High Court: &quot;Do not go out; police will beat you. Let the thrashing of Civil Court Lawyers take place, you are superior. They appear before the subordinate judiciary, you appear before the Lordships.&quot; It was a shame in toto. If the District Bar Association was not there, the leadership of the Lahore High Court Bar Association in connivance and collaboration with the recently retired Chief Justice of the Lahore High Court would have almost destroyed the lawyers&#39; movement in Lahore. <br /><br />This is why I consider the forthcoming LHCBA elections of supreme importance. If the &quot;Professional Group&quot; does not succeed this time having Mr. Anwar Kamal as candidate for the position of President, we shall again be constrained to merely read in the newspapers as to what is going on at Peshawar High Court or Sindh High Court at Karachi. The office bearers of Lahore High Court Bar Association caused great damage to the lawyers&#39; movement in fear of the former Chief Justice of Lahore High Court. Kudos go to the individual lawyers who were arrested, beaten, and later jailed under Anti-Terrorism charges. It was these individual members of the High Court Bar who said &#39;no&#39; to the office bearers, refused to listen to their deodorized speeches, and decided to join their Civil Court colleagues in the streets. What a day it was when the former President of the Lahore District Bar (as the new President has been elected on Jan 12) virtually bullied the District Police Officer in the last week of December, &quot;On November 5, we were not prepared. If you have guts, try to baton charge us today and then see how we are going to hammer you and your foot-constables&quot;. Police Officers did not baton charge afterwards since the then Chief Justice had not issued any clandestine orders in this regard. I am not aware of other provinces and Bar Associations other than the two based in Lahore, but so far as Lahore is concerned, the lawyers were beaten on March 13 and November 5 under the specific orders of the then Chief Justice of the Lahore High Court, intimidated by the President of the Lahore High Court Bar Association. I do not have a video to support my arguments but these arguments are the talk of the town. Take a poll; you will get the same opinion.<br /><br />Since November 3, 2007, the Chief Justice of Pakistan, the President of the Supreme Court Bar Association (Mr. Aitzaz Ahsan), Mr. Ali Ahmad Kurd, and many others have been detained in their houses. They have not been allowed to come out of their houses lest &#39;public order&#39; deteriorate. Where is the democratic United States in all this? Its leaders would prefer to have debates over the fate of Guantanamo detainees while one of ours - imprisoned by a government they support - is the Chief Justice of this country. The EU meanwhile is sending a Mission to &#39;observe&#39; the upcoming National Elections, yet the EU does not seem to care about the fate of those who sacrificed their high offices for the security of our constitutional rights.<br /><br />On top of all this, we also do not allow them to start their Chambers either. The deposed judges have been asked by the lawyers not to commence legal practice, as it would be taken as consent to the unlawful removal from office. Almost three months have passed with no other source of income and they are sitting home while restrained by us not to work as legal counsels.<br /><br />I am apprehensive of the days after the National Elections. The infamous &#39;horse-trading&#39; will begin in the newly elected Constituent Assemblies; the newspapers will have other spicy stories to publish; the new Prime Minister of Pakistan will address his &#39;brethren&#39; promising the alleviation of their sufferings; I shall have new clients and new litigation in my pocket, and amidst the mesmerizing lights of Lahore we shall forget how a deposed Judge will pay the electricity bills to have lights in his house.&quot;<br />

		<title>Breaking the Code: A Call for Candor at the CIA</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.wmitchell.edu/academics/faculty/radsan.html">A. John Radsan</a>, former CIA assistant general counsel now at William Mitchell College of Law, reminds us of other recent investigations into CIA activities apart from the destruction of interrogation tapes and explains why we should pay as much attention to the former General Counsel, Scott Muller, as to the Acting General Counsel, John Rizzo...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/johnradsan.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font> month before the news broke about the destruction of CIA tapes, I was back in Washington to speak on a panel.  After the event, one of my former colleagues came over to discuss something in hushed tones.  ("Jay", let's call him, used to be the top lawyer at the CIA's Counterterrorist Center.)  He made it clear to me that he disapproved of those who broke the Company's code of silence.  "Be careful," was his message.<br /><br />As justification, I told Jay that former officials should enlighten the public about intelligence issues.  Then, as a jibe, I said that current officials should do more than say "no comment" about every story.  Jay nodded in a way I wishfully interpreted as an acknowledgement.  But since then, perhaps because he was involved in the tapes, Jay keeps the code.  Undeterred, I offer some tidbits &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; "unclassified"&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;that Jay doesn't want you to know.<br /><br /><li>The CIA was already under investigation.<br /><br />Attorney General Michael Mukasey, on January 2, announced a full criminal investigation into the tapes.  Before his announcement, the Justice Department (DOJ) and the CIA's Inspector General (IG) had reviewed the matter for close to a month in a "preliminary inquiry."  But that was not the first time DOJ and the IG had joined forces.  According to the press, DOJ/IG have been investigating many other CIA programs.<br /><br />An investigation that spanned the 9/11 divide was "Peru shootdown."  In April 2001, missionaries traveling in a float plane in Peru were mistaken for drug traffickers and shot from the sky.  Two people died.  Although Peruvian officers operated the plane that fired the shots, they acted on information from another plane, staffed by CIA contractors.<br /><br />The joint DOJ/IG investigation into the Peru incident took several years while they determined whether the drug interdiction program had deviated from President Clinton's original plan.  Plus, DOJ/IG investigated whether American officials had made any false statements about the April 2001 shootdown.  One irony from Peru is that the investigation was most intense at the same time the White House was assuring the CIA it had nothing to fear from being aggressive after 9/11.<br /><br />Two years ago, DOJ announced that it had closed the criminal case into Peru.  But the IG investigation probably continues.  Although our government paid millions to settle with the Peru survivors, many CIA officers still worry about the IG's final report.  They hope this report, due out soon, will not be as tough as the IG's findings about 9/11, released a few months ago.<br /><br />In any event, the CIA's Inspector General, John Helgerson, perhaps learning from the complications on Peru, will not assist DOJ on the criminal investigation of the tapes.  This time DOJ will try to do things without him.  And time will tell whether a career prosecutor from Connecticut completes the investigation or whether Mukasey succumbs to those who want a special prosecutor.<br /><br /><li>There once was a lawyer named Muller.<br /><br />DOJ, of course, is interested in John Rizzo, the CIA's top lawyer.  Rizzo is set to testify before the House Intelligence Committee on January 16.  A major question is whether he participated in, or was aware of, the tapes' destruction in 2005.  So far, however, less attention has been paid to Scott Muller, the CIA's General Counsel from 2002-2004.<br /><br />Muller, having litigated at Davis Polk before he joined the Agency, viewed his job through the lens of a criminal defense lawyer.  Rather than always serve the Agency's best interests, Muller incorporated the personal agendas of senior officers.  For instance, some complained at DOJ &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; and within the IG &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; that Muller improperly applied pressure to shut down the Peru investigation.  Thus, Muller's aggressiveness on Peru parallels reports of his aggressiveness, far earlier than 2005, in seeking to destroy the tapes.  In all, DOJ should not forget what Muller has done.  <br /><br /><li>Rizzo adds so much irony.<br /><br />Even though Rizzo was not central in approving the CIA's interrogation program, he paid the political price.  During his confirmation hearing in the summer of 2007, the Senate intelligence committee was dissatisfied that he did not disavow the Justice Department's 2002 "torture memorandum."  Rizzo, realizing the votes were not there for him, withdrew his nomination.<br /><br />Now, less than a year after the confirmation debacle, Rizzo is trusted as "Acting" General Counsel to clean up the mess concerning the tapes with DOJ, the IG &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; and with the oversight committees.  For all, Rizzo is both intermediary and a subject of investigation.<br /><br />At the CIA, so much depends on the nuances.  One person's hypocrisy is another person's irony.  And Jay's code has become this man's call for a bit of candor.<br /><br /><br /><em>John Radsan, associate professor at William Mitchell College of Law, is a former federal prosecutor and a former assistant general counsel at the CIA from 2002-2004</em><br /><br /><iframe src="/related/radsan.php" frameborder='0' width='100%' height='140' scrolling='no' valign='top' marginheight='3'></iframe><br />

		<title>Burma: The Guillotine is No Solution for Despair</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.alrc.net/">Basil Fernando</a> of the Asian Legal Resource Centre says that repression of the Burmese people by the military government of the country now officially known as Myanmar is a device used against a despairing people that cannot be legitimated by anti-terrorism rhetoric ...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/basilfernando.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>D</strong></font>espite the assurances given by the Burmese military regime at the UN Human Rights Council session last month (December 2007) that an investigating body into alleged killings, abductions and disappearances in the Southeast Asian nation had been set up, no such investigations are taking place into the killings and other abuses of rights that occurred during the protests of monks and others in September 2007. Such deception is part of a pattern of total denial of state responsibility to protect human rights that the Burmese military regime is quite used to. It believes that the solution to protest is the guillotine. <br /><br />Over forty years of militarism has destroyed the livelihoods of the majority of people in Burma. Only a handful that are close to the military regime and others who participate in keeping the machinery of repression alive obtain some benefit from the situation. Together with destitution, destruction of livelihoods, and widespread poverty there has also been the destruction of the entire political system and the administration of justice. There are no credible means of public representation through political leaders or parties. There is no free media of any sort and the system of the administration of justice after years of suppression has disappeared. The policing system is basically a surveillance system on the people and independent investigation into crime does not exist. Naturally there are no independent investigations for the abuse of human rights by the military regime itself. Even under these circumstances the people have tried to organise and express themselves. The last such intervention was in September 2007. The response was a brutal crackdown including murder, forced disappearances, secret imprisonment, torture and displacement of dissidents, including Buddhist monks. <br /><br />The only outlet that the people could have relied on was an investigation by the United Nations but this move was defeated by strong players in the international community, including the Indian government. The Indian government argued that since the military regime promised to conduct inquiries no external inquiries were necessary. If a murderer promised to conduct an inquiry into the alleged murder, or for that matter any alleged criminal gave an undertaking to conduct the inquiry into the criminal act, anyone would see the ridiculousness of such a situation. The Indian government, which calls itself the largest democracy in the world and which also got the largest number of votes to sit in the UN Human Rights Council, does not see this as ludicrous. In fact, this is deliberate hypocrisy which some attribute to the possibly little advantages that India may have in the exploitation of some of the natural resources of this desperately poor country. The rest of the international community was not able to do anything in the face of such a ludicrous situation. <br /><br />The result is that the people of Burma are continuously subjected to the draconian military rule of the regime that can do whatever it likes with the lives of the people. This includes keeping about 40 percent of the children in the country in a state of malnutrition. <br /><br />With the spread of the ideologies of anti-terrorism any legitimate protest can be made to appear as a crime. When people in despair, facing nothing but repression, try to get themselves out of this situation the state offers them only the guillotine. The people are trapped and often ask, how are we to fight against the conditions of poverty and repression? There is no answer to this under present circumstances. <br /><br />Those who wield the guillotine not only crack down on all acts of protest but also triumphantly claim that they are doing this in order to save humanity from terrorism. Within this context, mass murderers appear as heroes. There is hardly any sense to be found in the discussions on this issue. <br /><br />People who out of sheer despair attempt to take any action to demonstrate their plight are treated today in the same way mental patients were treated in many countries in previous centuries. Bedlam in England was notoriously famous for such treatment. Patients were often put in jail-like conditions, physically abused and discarded by society. It is this same mentality with which the wretched of the present day world are being treated. They are considered a threat and therefore using the guillotine against them is considered morally and ethically acceptable. <br /><br />I am reminded of the book <em>Lord of the Flies</em> by William Golding. The book demonstrates what happens to society when it abandons its basic rules of law and decency. As the author points out "rules are all we have." When those are abandoned we descend to the habits of cruelty and inhumanity. But in some periods, like now, such acts of cruelty and inhumanity can be justified and even glorified in the name of the fight against terrorism. <br /><br /><br /><em>Basil Fernando is Executive Director of the Asian Legal Resource Centre, based in Hong Kong.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Abigail Salisbury of the Mekelle University Law Faculty in Mek&#39;ele, Ethiopia, says that although the vast majority of Ethiopians publicly denounce H.R. 2003, the so-called Ethiopia Democracy and Accountability Act now going through Congress that links nonessential US assistance to fulfillment of various human rights obligations, the spirit of the bill is correct...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/abigailsalisbury.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>O</strong></font>ne of my law school casebooks included a 1960 photo of Bernardus Fourie, former South African Representative to the UN, taken when he was speaking before the Security Council. Here was a man sent to represent his country at a time when it was subject to near-universal criticism for its policy of apartheid. When I looked at the photograph I inspected the individuals on either side of him, trying to gauge their reactions to his remarks. I studied his facial expression and posture, trying to imagine myself in his place. I could not stop asking myself how he must have felt at that very moment captured in the picture, when he was placed in the exceedingly awkward position of publicly representing a country which was under such heavy attack from nearly all sides. Since then, I have had that same question tucked into the back of my mind, and just when I ran across the photo again I was forced to represent America as it was being denounced, causing me to reexamine my beliefs about my own country. <br /><br />Last month I was invited by my Ethiopian host institution, the Mekelle University Law Faculty, to participate in a panel discussion on H.R. 2003, also known as the Ethiopia Democracy and Accountability Act of 2007. This American bill, passed in October by the US House of Representatives and now before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, would withdraw nonessential assistance from Ethiopia until its government fulfills various human rights obligations as set forth by Congress. <br /><br />As the only American on the Law Faculty&#39;s staff, I found myself the <em>de facto</em> representative of the United States, held responsible for explaining and justifying the legislation and its policy objectives. The hall was packed, standing room only at the back, but of all the Ethiopian professors and law students in attendance, not one person believed that it might somehow improve their nation's situation. Instead, it was unanimously interpreted as an illegal violation of Ethiopian sovereignty. As I listened to the comments of others, I got the impression that there was a perceived air of imperialism in the document. In other words, although all states are equal, depending on their level of development some are more equal than others. <br /><br />As an American, I often feel that when it comes to public opinion, we can never win. When we involve ourselves in the affairs of other nations, we are denounced for apparently believing that we have the right to run the whole world, regardless of law or outside approval. If, on the other hand, we elect to stay out of a conflict, then we are portrayed as cold and unfeeling, only caring about the suffering of others when there is money at stake. When abroad I am often told that Americans are dilettantes in the field of humanitarian intervention, only pushing for change when there is something to gain. This perceived hypocrisy has been worsened by some past administrations, who have been accused of complying with and aiding various regimes in order to achieve their own objectives, almost viewing dictators as the expediters permitted under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. However, some of these short-sighted decisions have come back to haunt us in recent years, indicating a practical &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; if not entirely altruistic &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; need for a change. Probably the most frequently-cited example of these policies' shortcomings is Osama bin Laden, one product of the Cold War-era strategy that the enemy of our enemy was our friend.<br /><br />Accordingly, H.R. 2003 on its face seems to assert Congress's intent to start fresh. It could potentially be viewed as the legislature's use of its power of the purse to set foreign policy so that America will no longer support tyrannical governments out of expediency. The problem, however, is that Congress is in some ways commandeering the President's post. In the past, some of the legislative powers set forth in the Constitution have been widely interpreted in U.S. domestic courts, perhaps most notably its authority over interstate commerce, which has over the years been stretched to permit regulation of myriad seemingly-unrelated areas. Indeed, from that vantage point H.R. 2003 seems to be yet another attempt to retrofit the Constitution in a manner which appears to offend the principle of the separation of powers. <br /><br />Even if the domestic court system holds this exercise of authority to be proper, much of the international legal community will remain unsatisfied, believing that the legislation requests Ethiopian subordination in contravention of the so-called "Friendly Charter" of 1970 which mandates:<blockquote>No State or group of States has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State. Consequently armed intervention and all other forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements, are in violation of international law.</blockquote>Such language, however, pulls the legal ground out from under any and every type of humanitarian intervention. The document, which has been called the "tyrant's charter" by Geoffrey Robertson, QC, is so open to abuse on its face that one can not reconcile it even with entering a country to provide aid and stop genocide. Clearly, since 1970 there have been many such violations of international law without strict enforcement, indicating a lack of desire to apply its literal language to such foreign interference. Thus, this argument for applying the Friendly Charter in order to invalidate H.R. 2003 internationally is weak. <br /><br />Some Ethiopians go farther, though, stating that the bill amounts to coercion or intimidation, reaching the level of interference and threats against Ethiopia. While I do not believe that the bill was meant to intimidate, it was clearly intended to persuade the Ethiopian government to change its ways, using economic restrictions as a tool. In American law, such an intent is not automatically invalid, because federal aid often comes with strings attached for the states which accept them, and we have a body of case law as a reference point for determining the acceptability of those strings. In international policy, as well, embargoes and economic sanctions are commonplace, and Congress took care in H.R. 2003 to specify that America would only be withdrawing "nonessential United States assistance" separate from funds used for hunger programs, health care, etc. There is no universal travel or import/export restriction such as the decades-long embargo we have imposed on Cuba, for instance. <br /><br />Ethiopians bristle at such a comparison because it tends to imply that since the international community tolerates our stance on Cuba, then it should similarly permit the mandates of H.R. 2003. The analogy is false, many Ethiopians feel, because they have neither threatened nor used force against the U.S. In effect, they see America as taking retaliatory measures which would be appropriate in wartime, but without having been attacked. They find similarly unimpressive any comparisons to other instances when America tried its hand at foreign state-building, because although Congress is trying to encourage the institution of democracy in the post-conflict environment of Ethiopia, it is do
ing so at a distance and with no right. The U.S. is involved in negotiations for the future of Kosovo and is trying to set benchmarks for Iraq, but it has a physical presence and interest in those places because of its prior military efforts, whereas it has no such relationship with Ethiopia. <br /><br />After listening to the Ethiopians' opinions and putting them into legal terms, I began to wonder whether Congress is attempting to bootstrap the concept of universal jurisdiction in the courts and turn it into a drafting doctrine, permitting it to legislate at a distance should conditions sufficiently shock the conscience. Some Ethiopians do suspect that America is using H.R. 2003 to disguise some other activity or motive, with Mekelle law professors wondering if this is the beginning of the development of another concept of sovereignty altogether. It is true that Congress is really only dictating how American aid money should be spent and thus is not creating binding laws for Ethiopia in the strictest sense, but dangling conditional aid in front of a country this poor does not allow for real domestic decision-making in Addis Ababa. Instead, Ethiopia starts to be governed from Washington, which would be just fine with some people. Several members of the audience at the law faculty's discussion forum made vehement statements to the effect that developing nations do not have the luxury of debating the legality of such legislation, and Ethiopia must just accept America's terms for the good of the nation. <br /><br />Let us say, however, that Ethiopia or any other country in a similar position refuses to comply with the terms of such legislation. Research suggests that economic sanctions or their functional equivalents imposed in response to human rights violations actually exacerbate existing problems. Robert Pape from the University of Chicago has demonstrated that the true results of such measures include losses for foreign investors and subsequent worsening of the local situation. One can easily envision that when people lose their jobs due to withdrawal of foreign investment, they will have nowhere to turn but to the government, which therefore ends up getting more powerful. The strengthened administration will be able to rally additional support by setting up those who imposed the sanctions as the immoral enemy.<br /><br />I can certainly understand the view held by some that America has needy groups at home and has no obligation to send money abroad. Thus, it would follow, if America in its benevolence decides to confer aid to foreign governments, then at least we should have the right to make sure the money is not funding cruel regimes. In short, this is the philosophy, "Play by my rules or I'll take my football and go home." In the midst of exasperated attempts to discuss H.R. 2003, I have sometimes wanted to say something to that effect. There is a sense amongst many of the foreign aid workers whom I have met here that Ethiopians have developed a sense of entitlement. It is true that this could just be stressed people complaining about the locals to let off steam. However, during the H.R. 2003 discussion forum there seemed to be a general assumption that Ethiopia is entitled to American aid. Throughout all the exploration of the various legal issues involved, no one ever doubted that the money belongs to the Ethiopian people. When I worked up the courage to mention the issue, I was rather strongly told that America has a moral obligation to provide assistance to Ethiopia.<br /><br />One very practical and compelling reason for criticizing Congress is that many do not agree with the factual findings used as justification for the actions to be taken. There is more than a little hypocrisy in US legislators putting heavy emphasis on alleged election irregularities in Ethiopia while the last two American presidential elections have raised more than a few eyebrows. Congress also relied heavily on the reports and testimony of just a small group of people in preparing its findings, and in Ethiopia there is some doubt as to the interests of the parties involved in the investigations. The opinion of many of the professors in Mekelle is that the bill is now moot because the human rights issues enumerated have already been successfully resolved. Annoyed, and feeling that Ethiopians are already doing all they can, some ask what more America wants from them and why it hasn't recognized any of the advances made so far. <br /><br />I was beginning to be won over by this particular argument until I sat down to read and grade the mid-term essays of the students in my International Human Rights Law classes. Because all of the instructors at Ethiopian universities are made to sign a contract that we will never say anything against the government or ruling party, I had been very careful in wording my assignment. I asked the students to select a human rights issue in Ethiopia (making sure not to imply that there are any actual problems, just issues) and find another country dealing with that same situation. They were required to then compare the actions of the two nations, discussing them in light of various international human rights instruments which have been covered in class. Then, they were to propose some potential methods they might use to deal with this "issue" they selected. Thinking that this was a sufficiently non-inflammatory prompt, I assumed I would get some rather dry responses, especially given the comments from the H.R. 2003 discussion forum, which all seemed to assert that Ethiopia is doing just fine on the human rights front. <br /><br />I was absolutely shocked, then, when I started reading my students' work. Out of the hundred third-year students I teach, probably forty of them had inserted a special section, right after the cover page, warning me of what might happen to them were their paper to leave my hands. A number of students wrote that they would never give their real opinions to an Ethiopian professor because they fear being turned in to the government and punished. Others begged me to take their work back to America with me so that people would know what was going on. Of those who wrote such notes, almost all said that I would probably be surprised to find that many of the students had been afraid to express their true feelings at the H.R. 2003 discussion forum because you never know who is listening.<br /><br />After my initial shock, I began to wonder if the students weren't just making exaggerated claims in hopes of getting better grades. I kept trying to figure out whether they were writing these warnings because they were genuine or because they wanted to make me think that they were really putting themselves on the line for this assignment. As I read the papers which had been submitted without the notes about fears, however, I got the sense that the students were just writing in as safe a fashion as possible. They put in long recitations of facts and laws and strove to make the "issue" seem as insignificant as possible within the larger context of Ethiopian government. They were holding back. Their work lacked the color, honesty, and intensity of the writing of the students who had asked me not to show their papers to anyone. <br /><br />To be fair, I can understand how the students might be afraid to speak their minds, because there have been a number of student protests which have been put down with violence recently, some journalists have been imprisoned, and much of the media is censored. At dinner, some university graduates from Addis Ababa mentioned that they had been without food for weeks at a time on campus but were forbidden by the administrators to ever voice a complaint. My friend tried to learn more about the conditions, but the Ethiopians had quickly changed the subject, telling her that they should not be overheard discussing such things. I even know some expatriate workers here who are hesitant to say anything negative about the country in their e-mails to friends and family at home, because they know that everything goes through a central server and could be read, with possible negative repercussion
s.<br /><br />I should mention that teaching this human rights class can be a very touchy thing, even though the subject appears to be strongly supported by the university, which is of course overseen by the Ministry of Education in Addis Ababa. While such a subject would be almost a luxury elective or niche seminar in America, it is a part of the Ethiopian core curriculum and the administrators consider it one of the most important topics today, even having established a Human Rights Centre for community advocacy and informative purposes. However, I have heard very little public criticism of the actions taken by the government, even though most people would like the human rights situation to improve. <br /><br />It turns out that ethnic loyalties &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; not the alleged satisfaction with the progress being made &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; have a great deal to do with the reluctance to agree with the policies behind H.R. 2003. The political boundaries of Ethiopia are drawn based on ethnic groupings, with each region having its own unique language and culture. I live in the northern region of Tigrai, which is well-known as the homeland of almost all of today's Ethiopian leaders, including Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, who is portrayed in H.R. 2003 as a human rights abuser. After the Derg military regime was defeated, the new government was formed largely by the political party which grew out of the Tigraian People's Liberation Front, whose enormous office is about three-hundred yards away from the campus of the law faculty. Other groups do not get anything close to the level of governmental representation enjoyed by the citizens of Tigrai, even though it is one of the smallest regions.<br /><br />People from other regions are much more free with their criticism of the government. I have seen several couples get into screaming fights because the spouse from Tigrai refuses to criticize the government while the spouse from elsewhere rants about corruption, censorship, the military, Eritrean secession, and so on. On a recent trip to the Amhara region, some young men asked me and my friends about our travels in Ethiopia. They were extremely friendly to us until we said that we were not really backpackers, but that we live in Mekelle, at which point one of the men spat on our vehicle and all but one walked off in disgust, yelling that they hate people from Tigrai. Our group was made up entirely of white people and this conversation was being held in English. It goes without saying that we could not possibly be from Tigrai, but so great was their hatred of the Tigraian politicians that the mere fact that we live in Mekelle was enough to taint us. One calmer man stayed to speak to us and told us that in order to be safe and have a better time when we travel, we should tell people, "The Ethiopian government made me work in Mekelle. Of course I never wanted to live in Tigrai." <br /><br />When discussing foreign travel, I often hear Americans advising each other to say they are Canadian in order to avoid politically-motivated troubles. In the minds of a good portion of the world's people, the U.S. plays the role of the cruel, wasteful and capricious overlord. At the same time, many people look to America when they want things to change. This lose-lose scenario perfectly sums up the problem of H.R. 2003, and a prime illustration occurred at the discussion forum. An irate audience member told me that America has no right to change everything unilaterally and it should have worked for a General Assembly Resolution on Ethiopia instead of making a domestic law. I responded that there is often the perception that the international system provides a high level of legitimacy but a low level of action, such as that taken towards Burma, whose human rights abuses resulted in a toothless Resolution and no real change for its people. The individual then rebutted by recommending &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; in all seriousness &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; that the U.S. has the responsibility to revolutionize the UN and install a new system. You just can not have it both ways, wanting America to stay out of the affairs of other nations but still expecting it to come riding in on a white horse to save the day. <br /><br />Listening to the Ethiopians talk about the bill's various points during the discussion forum, I felt as if I were under attack, but did begin to wonder if America hadn't done something foolish and egotistical by asserting its right to determine the domestic affairs of a foreign nation. After reading my students' work and speaking with people from outside Tigrai, however, I have to think that the spirit of H.R. 2003 is correct. I can admire the desire to help the people in another country and break with our tradition of cooperating with governments which harm their people when it suits American needs. I do see, however, that the factual findings section should have been redrafted because it is out-of-date, and if it is used as the justification for the actions taken in the rest of the bill, then the actions are without sufficient foundation and seem pointless. In recent years, foreign policy decisions have made America less and less popular around the world, but I think Americans are frustrated because we want to be recognized for our good works and intentions. I used to get angry and wonder why our leaders do not seem to understand that what they are doing with foreign affairs is not only hurting our reputation, but is putting the U.S. in danger by providing more already-furious people with ever-better reasons to attack us. It is quite sad when someone cannot leave the U.S. and express pride at being American for fear of retaliation by those who can not separate the national policies from the individual citizens. <br /><br />From this experience, however, I can better understand why sometimes actions must be taken which will earn us even more hatred. If those who craft our laws and policies ran international affairs like a popularity contest, then America might be more beloved by foreign nations, but it might also be committing terrible injustices against millions of people whose own leaders care little for their safety or happiness. Thus, although at the discussion forum I felt like Bernardus Fourie in that old photograph, a lone representative forced into the position of defending a nation whose actions are indefensible, I now have a different outlook. Instead of being ashamed that our country is disliked for taking unpopular measures, perhaps as Americans we can find pride in that self-same fact, exactly because we do that which we feel must be done to improve lives, despite what others may think of us.<br /><br /><br /><em>Abigail Salisbury currently teaches at the the Mekelle University Law Faculty in Mek&#39;ele, Ethiopia.

There is some truth to Senator Clinton's comment. Dr. King would not have succeeded without help from powerful politicians like President Johnson.<br /><br />But the problem with her statement is the paradigm that it presents &#8212; one of top-down change, discounting the efforts of the thousands of political activists (the majority of whom were African Americans) who fought and even risked their lives to achieve political successes like the 1964 Civil Rights Act. <br /><br />Dr. King was not just a dreamer, but also a shrewd political activist who, with other leaders, mobilized an effective and successful movement for change. More to the point, Senator Clinton's remark mistakenly implies a disconnect between Dr. King's dream and the actions of President Johnson and the members of Congress who enacted the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The central purpose of Dr. King's activism was to encourage legislative change: the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act, were essential goals for Dr. King and his allies. Moreover, these statutes would not have been enacted but for their activism.<br /><br />The 1964 Civil Rights Act was a landmark piece of legislation that outlawed segregation in places of public accommodation, employment, and education, and provided effective measures for enforcing those mandates. Anti-segregationist members of Congress had been proposing civil rights legislation since the mid 1930s, but their attempts were stifled by segregationist members of Congress who held important leadership positions. After World War II, African American labor leaders and returning GIs who had fought racism and ethnic hatred abroad joined together with other African Americans who were tired of being treated like second class citizens to form a civil rights movement. One of the goals of the civil rights movement was ending race based segregation. <br /><br />The civil rights movement gained momentum with the 1955-1956 Montgomery bus boycott and the emergence of Dr. King as a charismatic and politically canny leader. Subsequent campaigns, including the boycotts of segregated lunch counters, the Freedom Riders, and the civil disobedience in Georgia and Alabama, heightened national awareness of segregation and garnered public support for federal civil rights legislation.<br /><br />When Dr. King gave his memorable "I Have A Dream" speech at a rally in Washington in the summer of 1963, attended by over 100,000 people, he demanded federal legislation to end segregation. <br /><br />Dr. King and other civil rights activists created a climate of change in which their call for legislative reform could not be ignored. Leaders of the civil rights movement and the labor movement also actively lobbied for the legislation and were involved in weekly strategy meetings with Senate leaders during the filibuster of that Act. Make no mistake: that Act was one of King's finest achievements. King stood proudly by as Johnson signed the Act. Senator Clinton's remark undervalues both the power of the dream and the concrete deeds of the dreamer.<br /><br /><br /><br /><em>Rebecca Zietlow is the Charles W.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.syr.edu/faculty/facultymember.asp?fac=152">David Crane</a> of Syracuse University College of Law, former Chief Prosecutor for the UN Special Court for Sierra Leone, says that amidst the recent feting of Libyan leader Muamar Ghadaffi in European capitals, part and parcel of his larger political rehabilitation in the West, his regime&#39;s role in atrocities in Liberia and Sierra Leone in the 1990s must not be forgotten....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/davidcranenew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>W</strong></font>hile President Muamar Ghadaffi waltzed around the capitals of Europe last month with cynical leaders eager to do business with this political oddity from Libya, it must not be forgotten that he laid waste two countries in West Africa in the 1990s. His direct participation in the conflicts within Liberia and Sierra Leone caused the murder, rape, maiming, and mutilation of over a million human beings and the internal displacement of several million more. His surrogates - in the guise of former President Charles Taylor of Liberia, President Blas&Atilde;&copy; Compare of Burkina Faso, the late Foday Sankoh of Sierra Leone along with a covey of gun runners diamond dealers, and financiers from all over the world - joined in a decades long joint criminal enterprise that remains a threat to peace in that back-water part of the world.<br /><br />During the late 1980s, Ghadaffi trained hundreds of potential terrorist in various camps strewn about the Saharan sands of Libya. A virtual rogues gallery of those who bore the responsibility for the conflicts in West Africa are all alumni of those camps. During my initial investigations into the war crimes and crimes against humanity perpetrated that stemmed from the ten-year civil war in Sierra Leone, we began to uncover direct evidence from independent witnesses that the true source of the suffering came from Ghadaffi. Using link analysis from these sources, all of whom did not know the other, the dots that we connected went through President Charles Taylor, somewhat President Blas&Atilde;&copy; Compare and his henchman Ibrahim Bah, directly to President Ghadaffi. All three of these individuals were graduates of those terror camps.<br /><br />President Ghadaffi's plan was to place as many surrogates into West Africa so he could influence West Africa and use it for his own political purposes. He managed to do this in Burkina Faso, Liberia, tried to in Sierra Leone, and the Ivory Coast. The next country would have been Guinea. He was stopped when the international community created an international tribunal in Sierra Leone which not only investigated, indicted, and prosecuted those who bore the greatest responsibility for the tragedy of Sierra Leone, but exposed the joint criminal enterprise that was backed by Ghadaffi's oil dollars.<br /><br />As we reviewed the evidence it became clear that President Charles Taylor was the most directly responsible for the horror of the Sierra Leone conflict, with both Presidents Compare and Ghadaffi a culpable secondary. For his direct involvement, I signed the indictment against President Charles Taylor for numerous counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity in March 2003. He now sits on trial for those misdeeds before Trial Chamber Two of the Special Court for Sierra Leone. Compare and Ghadaffi are both un-indicted co-conspirators so to speak. Their specific involvement in this sad history will most undoubtedly come out at Taylor's trial.<br /><br />It is amazing how the smooth salve of oil and the bandage of petrol-dollars helps the West look the other way regarding what took place in West Africa in the 1990's with Ghadaffi's specific backing. The subtle support and buying off of many African leaders continues today by President Ghaddafi. The West, particularly Europe knows this. Ghadaffi's visit to France in December 2007, feted as a legitimate leader by the French, is just such an example. The bitter pill of human rights violations by this pariah goes down much easier with the promise of new commercial contracts.<br /><br />Dialog and engagement with the world's tyrants, dictators, and warlords smacks of appeasement and is a source of continued of unrest, atrocity, and conflict. The beast of impunity must be faced down wherever it rears its ugly head. What took place in Europe last month augers poorly for the future.<br /><br /><br /><em>David M.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/main.asp?PID=34">Jordan Paust</a> of the University of Houston Law Center says despite a recent conclusion of the US DC Circuit Court of Appeals that former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and other top US officials are immune from torture-related litigation launched by former US detainees because they were performing acts &quot;within the scope of their employment,&quot; it is legally and morally impossible for any member of the executive branch to be sheltered by such authority while engaging in war crimes...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/paustbig.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>n <em>Rasul v. Myers</em>, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia upheld dismissal of suits brought by four former detainees against Donald Rumsfeld, General Richard Myers, and others for (among other claims) alleged "torture" and, alternatively, alleged "cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment" in violation of international law. Dismissal was based on a sweeping anticontextual conclusion that each individual defendant was a federal official or employee "acting within the scope of his office or employment" within the meaning of the 1988 Westfall Act, 28 U.S.C. &Acirc;&#167; 2679 (b)(1) and (d)(1). The three-judge panel noted that the district court below had "agreed with the defendants that their alleged authorization, implementation and supervision of torture was 'incidental to the conduct authorized'" by the Executive and that their actions were "'within the scope of their employment.'" <br /><br />Plaintiffs had stressed that the conduct was "seriously criminal," "never authorized," and had long been condemned by the United States. Plaintiffs had agreed that the "torture, threats, physical and psychological abuse inflicted upon them" were "intended as interrogation techniques to be used on detainees." The three-judge panel noted that the district court found that the alleged "'torture and abuse [were] tied exclusively to the plaintiffs' detention in a military prison and to the interrogations conducted therein.'" These points were enough for the three-judge panel to conclude, "then, [that] the <em>underlying conduct</em> &#8212; here, the detention and interrogation of suspected enemy combatants &#8212; is the type of conduct defendants were employed to engage in...." (emphasis added). With respect to the fact that the alleged conduct is seriously criminal, the panel stated that "criminal conduct is not per se outside the scope of employment."<br /><br />What must necessarily be shocking to those familiar with international law is that alleged conduct that is "seriously criminal" and creates war crime responsibility (e.g., torture, cruel treatment, inhumane treatment, and degrading treatment in violation of the laws of war) could ever be considered to have been engaged in by any member of the executive branch while acting "within the scope of his office or employment" or that if defendants had authorized, were engaged in, or had facilitated interrogation as such, they could ever be said to have been acting "within the scope" of their office or employment with respect to interrogation tactics that they had authorized, facilitated, or used that were violations of the laws of war, which are war crimes. As documented in my recent book, <em>Beyond the Law: The Bush Administration's Unlawful Responses in the "War" on Terror</em> 21-22, 169-72 (Cambridge Univ. Press 2007), every relevant federal and state judicial opinion since the dawn of the United States, including several U.S. Supreme Court opinions, has affirmed that all persons within the executive branch are bound by the laws of war and that the laws of war place limitations on the authority of any member of the executive branch. As a matter of common sense, it is legally and morally impossible for any member of the executive branch to be acting within the scope of his authority while engaging in war crimes. As the Supreme Court recognized more generally with respect to conduct during the Civil War in <em>United States v. Lee</em>, 106 U.S. 196, 220 (1882):<blockquote>No man in this country is so high that he is above the law. No officer of the law may set that law at defiance with impunity. All the officers of the government, from the highest to the lowest, are creatures of the law, and are bound to obey it. It is the only supreme power in our system of government, and every man who by accepting office participates in its functions is only the more strongly bound to submit to that supremacy, and to observe the limitations which it imposes upon the exercise of the authority which it gives.</blockquote>During the Civil War, the Supreme Court also affirmed that the President has no powers ex necessitate, "is controlled by law, and has his appropriate sphere of duty, which is to execute [and not violate] the laws," and "[b]y the protection of the law human rights are secured; withdraw that protection, and they are at the mercy of wicked rulers." <em>Ex parte Milligan</em>, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 2, 119-21 (1866). In <em>Dooley v. United States</em>, 182 U.S. 222, 231 (1901), the Court recognized that military powers are "regulated and limited ... directly by the laws of war." As noted, throughout our history judicial opinions addressing the laws of war demonstrate that members of the executive branch are controlled by the law of war and are not employed to violate the law of war. Clearly, crimes under the laws of war are not within the scope of the "office or employment" of any federal official or employee and relevant criminal conduct is beyond the scope of lawful authority or ultra vires whether or not "underlying conduct" is within the scope of their authority. Indeed, as Founders and Framers recognized, the people of the United States were bound by the customary law of nations and had no authority to violate such law that they could delegate to the executive. Instead, they created an express mandate in the Constitution that the Executive must faithfully execute the laws.<br /><br />The International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg rightly applied an ultra vires rationale in the face of German national claims that they were acting within the scope of official authority and were entitled to immunity: "He who violates the laws of war cannot obtain immunity while acting in pursuance of the authority of the State if the State in authorising action moves outside its competence under international law." During Alien Tort Claims Act (ATCA or ATS) and Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA) litigation over the last many years, several federal cases have also applied the ultra vires rationale in connection with civil suits against foreign heads of state, other officials, generals, and others to recognize that conduct in violation of international law cannot be considered to be an "official," "public," or authoritative act and, instead, is outside the lawful authority of any government or office. Since international law has often been used by the Supreme Court and other federal courts as a necessary background for interpretation of federal statutes, it is surprising that the three-judge panel did not use international law for purposes of interpreting the phrase "within the scope" and that there was no reference to the IMT at Nuremberg's recognition or to the many ATCA and TVPA cases noted above that had used international law in connection with an ultra vires rationale. <br /><br />It is also surprising that the panel did not use <em>The Charming Betsy</em> rule that federal statutes must be interpreted in a manner to comply with international law and that, in any event, federal statutes "<em>can never</em> be construed to <em>violate ... rights</em> ... further than is warranted by the law of nations." 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 64, 117-18 (1804) (emphasis a
dded). Additionally, it must be shocking to those abroad to learn that a U.S. court has concluded that torture, cruel treatment, inhumane treatment, and degrading treatment are "within the scope of" the office or employment of persons within the U.S. executive branch; that such persons are not bound by the rule of law; and that they are employed to engage in such international crimes. When interpreting the phrase "within the scope," it would have been better to affirm that no officer of the law is beyond the law, that no officer of the law can be employed to violate the law, that no officer of the law can be acting within the scope of his office or employment if he is committing war crimes.<br /><br />Also of interest is the fact that torture, and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment are proscribed in all circumstances under human rights law, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and under the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment and Punishment. Moreover, each treaty requires that civil remedies for violations be made available. For example, the ICCPR expressly mandates that victims "shall have an effective remedy, notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity." As documented in <em>Beyond the Law</em> (at 166-67), both treaties were ratified after the 1988 legislation and the Federal Tort Claims Act and are, therefore, last in time. As such and under the last in time rule, they must prevail against any prior federal legislation that might otherwise deny an effective remedy. Even if the treaties had not been last in time, rights to effective remedies under the treaties would prevail under the "rights under" treaties exception to the last in time rule that has been recognized in Supreme Court and other federal cases. As explained also in the book, this point can be important with respect to proper interpretation and application of the subsequent Military Commissions Act (MCA), although one should not apply the last in time rule with respect to such legislation because, in accordance with a long line of Supreme Court cases, a treaty will prevail unless there is a clear and unequivocal intent of Congress to override a particular treaty expressed within the legislation and no such intent appears in the MCA.<br /><br />The message that <em>Rasul v. Myers</em> sends within the United States and abroad is a message that terrorists generally prefer in order to demonstrate that the government that they oppose is acting outside and beyond the law, that the rule of law is inoperative and unrestraining. It is also a message that we clearly should not tolerate in the face of ahistorical and autocratic Bush Administration claims, otherwise denied by the Supreme Court in <em>Hamdi</em>, <em>Rasul</em>, and <em>Hamdan</em>, that the President can violate any inhibiting international law and congressional legislation during his so-called "war" on terror &#8212; that he and his entourage are beyond the law.<br /><br /><br /><em>Jordan J.

		<title>Balancing rights behind the Netherland&#039;s burqa ban</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Angela C. Wu</strong> [Acting Executive Director;<br />International Law Director, <a href="http://www.becketfund.org/">The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty</a>]: &quot;The Netherlands, seeking to address concerns about security and cultural integration, is in the final stages of <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/netherlands-to-ban-burqas-in-schools.php">banning the burqa in schools and government offices</a>, with a fine of up to 3,350 euros or 12 days in jail. The parliament has passed the ban, which will be discussed at next Friday&#39;s cabinet meeting. <br /><br />What are the implications for religious freedom and the Netherland&#39;s human rights obligations, and how do those concerns line up against other public interests?<br /><br />The Dutch cabinet has already rejected a proposal by former Immigration Minister Rita Verdonk and decided that a general public ban on burqas would violate freedom of religion. The Netherlands is bound under international law as a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) by Article 18&#39;s protection of the freedom of thought, conscience, and religion. General Comment No. 22 explicating the meaning of Article 18 explicitly states that the &quot;freedom to manifest religion or belief&quot; encompasses the &quot;wearing of distinctive clothing or headcoverings.&quot; It is silent on the question of full face-coverings such as the burqa. A limited ban in schools and government offices would also, of course, impede the ability of the approximately 50 women who currently wear burqas in the Netherlands to express their religious faith. <br /><br />In principle, a government has no business telling religious believers what they can and cannot wear solely on the basis of the religious nature of their dress. Telling Muslims, Jews, Sikhs, or anybody else who wears a religious head covering that they cannot do so in public spaces is often to dictate their conscience and the acceptability of who they are in the public square. A reasonable accommodation by government of religious exercise is good for everyone in a free society, and protects religious expression just like other forms of expression. At the same time, just because dress or an action is religious in nature does not offer it complete protection under the law.<br /><br />Fundamental freedoms and public interests are not absolute, and need to be balanced against one another. General Comment No. 22 recognises that Article 18.3 &quot;permits restrictions on the freedom to manifest religion or belief only if limitations are ... necessary to protect public safety, order, health or morals, or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others.&quot; How that balancing act is accomplished will mean the difference between the ban being seen as addressing legitimate public interests or as mere pretext for discrimination against Muslims. <br /><br />The banning of religious wear in several states has become a lightning rod issue for the growing Muslim minority in Europe, and the Netherlands need only look at bans in neighboring countries to see how effective legislating this issue will be. The BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4616664.stm">reported</a> that the police in Belgium &quot;are not too happy with the [burqa] ban,&quot; which carries penalties of 150 euro, or eventually, jail. &quot;They say it has made relations with the Moroccan community worse and gives young people a reason to resent society.&quot; This sort of resentment &#8212; a dissimilation from the larger culture &#8212; is exactly what the bans are meant to avoid. <br /><br />In passing any law that would limit a fundamental freedom, states should take a two-pronged approach. States should ask whether a compelling public interest has been affected, and whether the compelling public interest is really in fact threatened. A second question would be whether there are other ways to accomplish the same compelling public interests that would be less burdensome to the fundamental freedoms. <br /><br />Consistency in enforcement will be key. In 2004, subsequent to a ban on religious symbols in public schools in France, a Strasbourg high school refused to allow Muslim student Cennet Doganay, who traditionally wore a Muslim headscarf, to wear even a baseball cap or bandanna allowed to other students because her use of the cap or bandanna would be for a religious purpose. Doganay eventually shaved her head rather than expose her hair, and was then made to sit alone without instruction in a classroom for six months before finally transferring to a school in London. The school expressed that shaving her head for a medical reason would have been acceptable, but not for the purpose of religious expression. If the ban is selectively enforced only upon people with religious intent, it is not surprising that religious believers would feel marginalised. The school&#39;s enforcement of its rules went beyond forms of public expression and forbade not only the behaviour it deemed disruptive, but the very conscience behind her actions.<br /><br />The burqa or niqab is distinguishable from the Muslim headscarf, which only covers a woman&#39;s hair, and does not present the same security issue as the covering of the face. However, the same analysis in both situations can apply. In schools and government offices, will the Netherlands also ban the wearing of hats and winter scarves covering the nose and mouth? <br /><br />The Netherlands stands at an important crossroads as it wrestles with its own identity crisis &#8212; a country known for its liberalism and tolerance now faced with how to balance delicate rights in a society increasingly divided. The process of how it does so will matter as much as the resulting legislation.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Amrit Singh</strong> [Attorney, <a href="http://www.aclu.org/index.html">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU)]: &quot;&quot;Ours is a government of laws.&quot; &quot;No one is above the law: not the executive, not the Congress, and not the judiciary.&quot; With these words, on September 15, 2004, a federal judge in New York ordered the CIA to produce or identify all records responsive to the ACLU&#39;s Freedom of Information Act (&quot;FOIA&quot;) requests for records related to the treatment of detainees apprehended after September 11, 2001 and held in U.S. custody abroad. <br /><br />The CIA&#39;s destruction in 2005 of hundreds of hours of videotapes of harsh interrogations--records clearly responsive to the ACLU&#39;s FOIA request--was a flagrant violation of the Court&#39;s September 15, 2004 order, and a clear indication that the CIA considers itself &quot;above the law,&quot; accountable to none. The ACLU moved last month to hold the CIA in contempt of court for its destruction of these records. In response, the CIA argued that the videotapes were not &quot;responsive documents&quot; within the meaning of the September 2004 order because they were &quot;operational files&quot; and therefore exempt from CIA search, review and retention under the CIA Information Act, 50 U.S.C. &Acirc;&sect; 431(c). <br /><br />But in December 2007, CIA Director Mike Hayden himself admitted in a public <a href="https://www.cia.gov/news-information/press-releases-statements/press-release-archive-2007/taping-of-early-detainee-interrogations.html">statement</a> that the CIA&#39;s Office of Inspector General (OIG) had viewed the tapes in 2003 as part of its look at interrogation and detention operations. That admission, along with other statements contained in the CIA&#39;s court papers, makes it amply clear that the tapes were subject to FOIA search and review under the &quot;investigations&quot; exception of the CIA Information Act, which requires the agency to search for information concerning CIA OIG investigations into impropriety and illegality. <br /><br />The CIA nonetheless argued before the Court that the tapes were not subject to FOIA search and review under the &quot;investigations&quot; exception because they were not viewed not as part of an OIG &quot;investigation&quot; but as part of a so-called &quot;special review.&quot; The CIA can call the OIG&#39;s viewing of the tapes in 2003 what it wants, but the CIA&#39;s own description in its court papers of the so-called &quot;special review&quot; shows that the &quot;review&quot; walks and talks like an &quot;investigation.&quot; <br /><br />Semantics will be of little avail to the CIA for evading accountability for thumbing its nose at the law. It is time for the agency to be brought to task not just for the <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/cia-chief-never-objected-to-destruction.php">destruction of the tapes</a> but also for its use of the illegal interrogation methods depicted on those tapes.&quot;<br /><br /><em>Amrit Singh is one of the lead lawyers in the ACLU&#39;s Freedom of Information Act litigation concerning the torture of prisoners held in U.S. custody abroad. She is also co-author (with Jameel Jaffer) of <a href="http://www.aclu.org/about/staff/administrationoftorture.html">Administration of Torture</a> (Columbia Univ. Press 2007), a book about the abuse of prisoners in U.S. facilities overseas.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Miri Weingarten</strong> [Coordinator oPt Department,<br /><a href="http://www.phr.org.il/phr/">Physicians for Human Rights-Israel</a>]: &quot;PHR-Israel has been immersed in the <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/un-rights-chief-slams-israeli-blockade.php">crisis that has engulfed Gaza</a> since the takeover by Hamas in June 2007, and the resultant closing by Israel of all crossing points to goods and persons. Patients who prior to June had the possibility of accessing Egypt for medical care found this way barred from the 9th of June, leaving the Erez Crossing the only point of exit for patients. <br /><br />In order to enter Israeli hospitals or to cross Israel into medical centers in the West Bank, East Jerusalem or Jordan, patients are required to undergo elaborate, opaque and ever-multiplying bureaucratic procedures in order to procure an exit permit. Patients whose requests are rejected due to a &quot;security prohibition&quot; or whose requests are so delayed as to cause repeated re-scheduling of appointments apply to PHR-Israel for redress. <br /><br />Since June, the number of patients&#39; applications from Gaza to PHR-Israel has increased dramatically. Whereas from January to May 2007 PHR-Israel fielded 20-40 applications each month, in June this figure increased to 60 per month, and in October a peak number of 160 applications was recorded. <br /><br />Increases in negative or delayed responses correspond closely to Israeli policy decisions: The first increase corresponds to the closing of the Erez and Rafah Crossings while the second corresponds to the Israeli declaration of Gaza as a hostile entity and its declared decision to impose collective measures against the civilian population. <br /><br />On the ground, PHR-Israel has met increasing difficulties in ensuring access to healthcare of Gaza patients who need care in external medical centers. Since September 2007, even life-threatening conditions have been refused exit repeatedly. Nine of the patients who applied to PHR-Israel have died while waiting for a permit.<br /><br />In its work, PHR-Israel applies to the High Court of Justice (HCJ) as a last instance to ensure access of patients to medical care that is unavailable within Gaza. When analysed, the Court rulings are shown, overall, to echo deteriorating State policy. High Court judges voice attitudes ranging from total identification with State policies to confusion rather than courage:<ul><li>In June, after PHR-Israel together with partner organization &quot;<a href="http://www.gisha.org/">Gisha</a>&quot; submitted an urgent petition to the HCJ demanding that the Erez Crossing be opened to patients in need of care unavailable in Gaza, the State responded that it no longer bore any legal responsibility toward the civilians of Gaza, that patients would be permitted entry as a &quot;humanitarian gesture&quot; only, and that only life-threatening conditions would merit permission. Danger of amputation or of the loss of an eye, for example, would be defined as endangering &quot;quality of life&quot; and not life itself, and therefore would not justify entry. In its ruling the Court questioned this distinction between life and limb, but did not intervene on behalf of the 26 patients in the petition, and refused to rule either on the policy of access to health care of patients from Gaza, or on the legal status of Gaza itself.<br /><br /><li>In November, the cases of 11 patients in life-threatening condition were heard. Two separate hearings were held, delaying the court decision. While waiting for a ruling, 21-year-old cancer patient Nael El Kurdi died at home in Gaza. This did not persuade the Court to oblige the State to formulate a policy ensuring access of patients to medical centers outside Gaza.<br /><br /><li>In December, Justice Elyakim Rubinstein ruled that &quot;even a total criminal&quot; had a right to access to care, if in urgent and life-threatening condition, and asked that the State examine the possibility of ensuring access to Egypt or to Jordan of several specific patients in life-threatening condition. He too refrained from addressing policy.<br /><br /><li>In January 2008, the previous ruling was overturned by three judges, who reviewed the cases of 8 patients, all in urgent life-threatening condition, and &quot;were persuaded that there are no grounds for our intervention in the decision of the Respondents to prevent the entry of these appellants into the territory of Israel.&quot; (HCJ ruling 11105/07, 8.1.08). <br /><br /><li>Less than a fortnight later, leukemia patient Amin Fayyad was also refused redress by the Court. Justices Prokatcha, Alon and Naor saw no grounds for intervention and suggested that his case be reviewed &quot;by the end of February&quot; (HCJ ruling 559/08, 22.1.08) &#8212; thus justifying a delay that could cost the patient his life.</ul>The possibility of legal redress for Palestinians has been seriously eroded by this process, raising grave questions regarding the independence of the judiciary system in Israel. PHR-Israel reiterates its demand that the State of Israel ensure the access of Gaza patients to medical care unavailable in Gaza in external medical centers, as a matter of policy.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.heritage.org/about/staff/charlesstimson.cfm">Charles Stimson</a> [Senior Legal Fellow, Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, <a href="http://www.heritage.org/">The Heritage Foundation</a>]: &quot;The Congress should provide appropriate <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/cheney-presss-congress-for-fisa.php">retroactive liability protection for telecommunication companies</a> alleged to have assisted the government since September 11th. Such protection or &quot;immunity&quot; is necessary for several reasons: it is fair to those companies who responded to the governments&#39; request for lawful assistance; it encourages the private sector to assist the United States in the war on terror, and; it puts the terrorists on notice that we will utilize all national assets, governmental or otherwise, in a lawful manner to defeat them. <br /><br />The government asked telecommunications companies to assist them in obtaining intelligence information after September 11th. The companies relied on written legal assurances that the President authorized the activities, and that those activities had been determined to be lawful by the Department of Justice. Not only that, it is clear that the assistance was perfectly legal, and that was surely the sound legal advice of the telecom general counsels. To date, there are over 40 lawsuits against the telecoms asking for billions of dollars in damages. It is simply unfair to allow those suits to go forward against companies that were acting not only in good faith, but no doubt out of a sense of patriotism.<br /><br />Denial of immunity in these cases will discourage other companies from assisting the government in the future. The Senate Intelligence Committee held hearings and studied whether granting retroactive liability protection to telecommunications providers was the right thing to do. After studying the issue closely, they issued a report, that said in part, &quot;without retroactive immunity, the private sector might be unwilling to cooperate with lawful Government requests in the future [resulting in a] possible reduction in intelligence.&quot; The Committee concluded that that outcome was &quot;simply unacceptable for the safety of our Nation.&quot; I agree.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Elizabeth Jordan</strong> [Program Assistant, Human Rights Defenders Program of <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/defenders/hr_defenders.asp">Human Rights First</a>]: &quot;Human Rights First does not consider the <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/cuba-held-fewer-political-prisoners-in.php">decrease in the number of political prisoners</a> held in Cuba a reflection of a more favorable human rights environment on the island. In the spring of 2003, 75 men and women <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/defenders/hrd_cuba/hrd_cuba.asp">human rights defenders</a> were imprisoned as part of a <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/defenders/hrd_cuba/hrd_cuba_crackdown.htm">major crackdown</a> on civil society. Today, 59 of these peaceful activists remain in prison; many of them are <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/defenders/hrd_cuba/alert_011608_paneque3.htm">gravely ill</a>. Repressive governments often use political prisoners as bargaining chips in diplomatic negotiations, and Cuba is no exception. Until Cuba releases all peaceful human rights defenders &#8212; and respects the basic human rights they defend, such as freedom of expression and association &#8212; the situation remains essentially unchanged. <br /><br />That being said, Human Rights First <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.info/pdf/071214-hrd-ltr-un-signing.pdf">welcomed</a> the December announcement by Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque that Cuba would become party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and would submit to review by the UN Human Rights Council as part of the Universal Periodic Review mechanism. Cuba would be bound to uphold the rights enshrined in these treaties, opening potential new avenues to redress for human rights activists. While this announcement is a first step in the right direction for human rights in Cuba, it remains to be seen if Cuba is serious about adhering to the treaties.&quot;<br />

Last September the French authorities recognized the death of my husband&#39;s service in the context of an attack, and no longer want to hand over a copy of this file. <br /> <br />I am personally absolutely opposed to giving a copy of the file to the Djiboutian authorities because they were personally involved:<ul><Li>the Djiboutian President is suspected of having been the possible ring leader and commander of my husband&#39;s murder.<br /><li>the Djiboutian Public Prosecutor is suspected of having put pressure even in Belgium, on one of the most important witnesses, and this pressure is still continuing.</ul>State pressure was evident on the twelfth anniversary of my husband&#39;s murder in October 2007: a part of the witness&#39;s family, although they have Djiboutian nationality, has been expelled from Djibouti to Yemen while the other part - the children and the other parent - has been kept in Djibouti.  <br /> <br />This is a perverse trial because the Djiboutian Public Prosecutor who himself wrote the request asking the International Court to intervene, is a member of the Djiboutian delegation to the International Court. It is the subject of an arrest warrant issued by international french justice and broacast by Interpol. He seeks in this way to get international diplomatic immunity before his trial by the Court of Versailles on next 13 March, in order to avoid the possibility of being declared guilty of suborning a witness. My husband was responsible for judicial cooperation with Djibouti at the time of his death, yet the Djiboutian authorities have waited 12 years before opening criminal proceedings; they have done this only because they were personally involved, and wish to lead the investigation in the wrong direction, far away from the Truth.&quot;<br />

		<title>New legislation could protect against abuse of state secrets privilege</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Sharon Bradford Franklin</strong> [Senior Counsel, the <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/">Constitution Project</a>]: &quot;The State Secrets Protection Act (S. 2533), <a href="http://kennedy.senate.gov/newsroom/press_release.cfm?id=c56bd1d0-7ad3-46ea-9d30-a77317f28b70">introduced</a> this week by Senators Kennedy and Specter, would bring much needed reform to the state secrets privilege. The doctrine has been problematic since it was first recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1953 in <u>United States v. Reynolds</u>. In that case, the widows of three civilian contractors who were killed in the crash of a military plane sought production of the Air Force accident report. The Supreme Court refused to require the executive branch to turn over the accident report to the district court judge for an independent assessment of whether the report did indeed contain <a href="/currentawareness/secrecy.php">state secrets</a>, concluding that forcing the government to disclose information it claimed was sensitive created an unacceptable risk to national security. However, more than four decades later, the Air Force declassified the accident report, revealing that it did not in fact contain sensitive security information, but only evidence of the government&#39;s negligence. <br /><br />Moreover, since its inauspicious beginnings in the <u>Reynolds</u> case, this privilege has been expanded almost beyond recognition. Rather than simply applying the doctrine to prevent the disclosure of particular pieces of evidence, more recent court decisions have foreclosed any litigation of cases in which the state secrets privilege is asserted. For example, in the <u>El-Masri</u> case decided last year by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, the court dismissed the case at the pleadings stage, before any discovery had occurred. Mr. El-Masri, an innocent victim of the United States&#39; extraordinary rendition policy, had filed his lawsuit to challenge his imprisonment and abuse by the CIA. <br /><br />The Senate bill would provide three critical and much-needed reforms to the state secrets privilege. First, the bill would prohibit reliance on a state secrets claim to dismiss a case at the pleadings stage &#8212; as has happened in cases like <u>El-Masri</u>. Rather, whenever the executive branch asserts the state secrets privilege, courts would be required to first conduct a closed hearing to examine the allegedly secret evidence, and determine whether the privilege should apply. <br /><br />Second, the bill would require that when the executive branch asserts the privilege, it must provide all allegedly secret evidence to the judge for <em>in camera</em> review. The judge is then required to make an independent assessment of each &quot;specific item of evidence&quot; to determine whether the state secrets privilege applies. This requirement for independent court review of the actual evidence is crucial &#8212; had such review been mandated in <u>United States v. Reynolds</u>, the judge would have discovered that there were no national security secrets contained in the disputed accident report.<br /><br />The third significant reform in the bill is a requirement that if the judge concludes that an item of evidence legitimately contains state secrets, the judge must assess whether &quot;it is possible to craft a non-privileged substitute&quot; for the evidence &quot;that provides a substantially equivalent opportunity to litigate the claim or defense.&quot; Such non-privileged substitutes could include a version of a document with privileged material redacted, or a summary of the privileged information. If the court finds it is possible to create such a substitute, the bill requires that the court &quot;shall order&quot; the executive branch to provide such a substitute to the opposing party. If the government refuses to comply with this order, the court would be required to decide the disputed issue in favor of the non-government party. This provision balances the need to preserve national security information with the rights of litigants challenging government policies, and would enable some litigation to proceed even where state secrets may be involved.<br /><br />Beyond these three fundamental reforms, the bill also includes provisions to facilitate an in-depth review of executive branch state secrets claims by an independent judge. These include provisions authorizing the use of protective orders to secure sensitive information; the appointment of special masters who may have an expertise in national security matters to assist judges where appropriate; and the appointment of guardians <em>ad litem</em> with security clearances to represent the interests of non-government parties.<br /><br />The Senate bill does, however, raise some concerns regarding its treatment of the toughest cases: those in which the judge concludes that state secrets are at issue, and it is not possible to create a non-privileged substitute for the evidence. The bill&#39;s procedures would decide such cases in favor of the government, by permitting their dismissal if litigating the case without the privileged evidence &quot;would substantially impair the ability of a party to pursue a valid defense to the claim or counterclaim.&quot; Such cases raise important questions about how to balance national security concerns with the interests of justice and the need to provide an independent check to ensure that executive branch policies do not violate the constitution. Congress should carefully evaluate how best to craft this balance.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.militaryjudges.com/"><strong>Neal A. Puckett</strong></a> [attorney for <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/haditha-marine-squad-leader-court.php">Sgt. Frank D. Wuterich</a>; Lieutenant Colonel, USMC (Ret)]: &quot;The criminal justice system in America has certain checks and balances against overreaching by prosecutors when they bring felony charges. Some must simply file charges by information, which is then subject to a preliminary hearing before judge or magistrate who determines whether there is sufficient evidence to bind the defendant over for trial. Others must seek a grand jury indictment, before moving ahead with the trial of a defendant. This involves taking the evidence before a group of citizens who then vote on whether to return a true bill, or indictment.<br /><br />The military justice system has a similar pretrial gateway, called an Article 32 investigation, named for Art 32 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). That process involves a hearing before an impartial military officer (often a lawyer or &quot;JAG&quot;) who issues a report answering two questions: 1) is there sufficient credible evidence to believe the accused committed any of the offenses charged; and 2) if so, how should those charges be adjudicated? The standard of proof is low (reasonable cause to believe) and the recommendation as to whether to prosecute as a felony, misdemeanor or dismiss is advisory only. That means that the commander who appointed the investigator is free to disregard those recommendations. <br /><br />Often the Art 32 process is viewed by defense counsel as a rubber stamp for the commander who wishes to push the case to a felony trial (general court-martial), because over 90% of cases result in that recommendation. In other words it is easy manipulate and abuse. In rare cases, a recommendation to dismiss charges provides the commander justification to do away with specious allegations brought by disgruntled service members. More often, a recommendation to dismiss is ignored, as when the commander really wants protection against allegations of failing to punish misconduct or when he or she simply wants to appear &quot;tough.&quot; Homicide and sexual assault offenses are almost never dismissed short of a full general court-martial even when dismissal is strongly recommended. Commanders do not want to be seen as insensitive to the needs of accusers, (read: politically incorrect), even when they fully believe in the innocence of the accused. <br /><br />The Art 32 investigation protection against proceeding to trial on baseless charges could be improved by a change to the Manual for Court-Martial (a Presidential Executive Order). The change should require that investigating officer be JAGs except where impracticable and by making the investigating officer&#39;s recommendations binding on the commander in cases where that officer recommends dismissing charges.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Bernard Nicholas</strong> [journaliste, auteur de deux documentaires d&#39;enqu&ecirc;te sur l&#39;affaire Borrel]: &quot;Cette <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/djibouti-pressing-icj-for-control-over.php">audience [la semaine derriere] devant la C.I.J de La Haye</a> est en effet un &eacute;pisode important de cette affaire.<br /><br />La R&eacute;publique de Djibouti appuie sa demande sur un accord de coop&eacute;ration judiciaire pass&eacute; avec la France, d&egrave;s 1977 ann&eacute;e de l&#39;ind&eacute;pendance de Djibouti(ancienne colonie fran&ccedil;aise).<br /><br />Selon Djibouti, la France doit transmettre le dossier judiciaire concernant l&#39;assassinat du juge Borrel &agrave; la justice djiboutienne dans le cadre de cette coop&eacute;ration.<br /> <br />Or plusieurs probl&egrave;mes se posent.<ul><li>Cette demande du dossier  a &eacute;t&eacute; formul&eacute;e par le Procureur G&eacute;n&eacute;ral de Djibouti, M.Djama Souleiman Ali. Ce magistrat est impliqu&eacute; dans une affaire de subornation de t&eacute;moin dans la cadre de l&#39;affaire Borrel. Vis&eacute; par un mandat d&#39;arr&ecirc;t international, il est renvoy&eacute; devant le Tribunal correctionnel de Versailles le 13 Mars prochain &agrave; l&#39;issue d&#39;une instruction qui a d&eacute;montr&eacute; que ce magistrat ainsi que le chef des services secrets de Djibouti, Hassan Sa&iuml;d, ont exerc&eacute; des pressions sur des t&eacute;moins djiboutiens du dossier criminel, r&eacute;fugi&eacute;s en Belgique. Ce proc&egrave;s du 13 Mars fait peur au plus haut niveau de l&#39;Etat djiboutien, car les deux personnes vis&eacute;es sont des proches du Pr&eacute;sident djiboutien. Et les pressions continuent sur ces t&eacute;moins: une partie de la famille de Mohamed Saleh Aloumekhani a &eacute;t&eacute; expuls&eacute;e de Djibouti vers le Y&eacute;men(8 personnes, sans leur passeport)voici 3 mois d&eacute;j&agrave;, afin que M.Aloumekhani, t&eacute;moin essentiel dans le dossier criminel, revienne sur son t&eacute;moignage. Ce qu&#39;il refuse de faire depuis 2000.<br /> <br /><li>Il appara&icirc;t en outre dans des documents &eacute;manant des Minist&egrave;res fran&ccedil;ais des Affaires &eacute;trang&egrave;res et de la Justice, que c&#39;est la France, par l&#39;interm&eacute;diaire de Jacques Chirac lui-m&ecirc;me qui en 2004, qui a sugg&eacute;r&eacute; &agrave; Djibouti d&#39;attaquer la France devant la Cour Internationale de Justice de la Haye. Or cette cour ne r&egrave;gle que des litiges entre &eacute;tats. <br /><br />Y-a-t il litige quand les deux &eacute;tats s&#39;entendent au pr&eacute;alable?<br /> <br /><li>L&#39;instruction judiciaire de l&#39;affaire Borrel se poursuit en France, par Mme Sophie Cl&eacute;ment. Il est inconcevable pour cette magistrate qui travaille sur ce dossier depuis 2002 de transmettre une copie de ce dossier &agrave; Djibouti. Ce dossier comporte un certain nombre de documents provenant des services secrets fran&ccedil;ais et des noms d&#39;agents fran&ccedil;ais apparaissent, ce qui pourrait les mettre en danger. Ensuite, les noms des personnes vis&eacute;es par l&#39;enqu&ecirc;te fran&ccedil;aise apparaissent aussi dans ce dossier; et ce sont le plus souvent des djiboutiens, proches d&#39;Isma&iuml;l Omar Guelleh, le Pr&eacute;sident de la R&eacute;publique de Djibouti.<br /><br />Si le dossier est transmis &agrave; Djibouti, ces personnes pourraient &ecirc;tre jug&eacute;es tr&egrave;s vite, et il serait impossible pour la justice fran&ccedil;aise de poursuivre son travail, selon la r&egrave;gle du &quot;Non bis in idem&quot; qui interdit de juger deux fois la m&ecirc;me personne sur des faits identiques dans une m&ecirc;me affaire.<br /> <br /><li>Aujourd&#39;hui, les repr&eacute;sentants de la France devant la C.I.J de la Haye ont plaid&eacute; contre la transmission du dossier &agrave; Djibouti. Nicolas Sarkozy soutient Mme Borrel dans son combat pour la v&eacute;rit&eacute;, ce que n&#39;avait jamais fait (c&#39;&eacute;tait le contraire) Jacques Chirac durant ses mandats.&quot;</ul><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Cara Horowitz</strong> [Staff Attorney,<br /><a href="http://www.nrdc.org/">Natural Resources Defense Council</a> (NRDC)]: &quot;Care about the National Environmental Policy Act? Then read on. Early in January, in a case challenging naval mid-frequency sonar training exercises off the coast of southern California, environmentalists (including my organization, NRDC) won a major victory when a federal court issued an injunction requiring the most comprehensive suite yet of measures to protect whales and other marine mammals from the harmful effects of high-intensity Navy sonar. But now <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/bush-grants-exemption-from.php">the Bush Administration is attempting to block the injunction</a> through Executive fiat. Last week, the administration issued two &quot;waivers&quot; to undercut the legal foundation of NRDC&#39;s case: a presidential waiver (signed by Bush himself) exempting the Navy from compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act (16 USC 1456(c)(1)(A)) in these exercises, and a CEQ decision excusing the Navy from NEPA compliance (42 USC 4321 et seq). <br /><br />Both waivers constitute executive overreaching, but the NEPA waiver is particularly dangerous, as it rests on a regulation aimed at streamlining NEPA compliance in response to true emergencies&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;-a regulation that has, in the past, been used only to deal with unexpected emergency events like dams breaching, outbreaks of deadly diseases, and Hurricane Katrina. Never has it been used to excuse NEPA non-compliance in routine federal actions (like the regularly-scheduled training exercises at issue here, which have been planned for more than a year). Nor has it ever been used to attempt an override of a federal court decision and injunction. If approved, the waiver would open a gaping hole in NEPA, which by clear statutory language requires compliance by all federal agencies (including the military) &quot;to the fullest extent possible.&quot; (42 USC 4332). One can easily imagine, for example, the Executive declaring &quot;emergencies&quot; to expedite oil and gas leasing on environmentally sensitive lands, on the theory that additional energy production is a national security priority.<br /><br />We are now briefing the legality and effect of the waivers in district court, arguing (among other things) that an administrative regulation can&#39;t override clear statutory language to the contrary or a federal court injunction. We expect the issue to make its way quickly up the appellate chain. In the words of the Chair of the House Oversight Committee in a letter today deriding the CEQ waiver in this case, the regulation at issue was &quot;not designed to undermine environmental protections or reverse court decisions the Administration disagrees with.&quot; Here&#39;s hoping the district court sets the Administration straight.&quot;<br />

		<title>Padilla trial highlights Bush Administration&#039;s manipulation of justice</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Paul Craig Roberts</strong> [former US Assistant Secretary of the Treasury; co-author (with Lawrence Stratton) of <a href="http://www.truthinjustice.org/tyranny.htm"><strong><em>The Tyranny of Good Intentions</em></strong></a>]: &quot;The George W. Bush administration responded to the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center and Pentagon with an assault on US civil liberty that Bush and the DOJ justified in the name of &quot;the war on terror.&quot; The government gave assurances that the draconian measures only apply to &quot;terrorists.&quot; &quot;Terrorist,&quot; however, was not defined. The government claimed the discretionary power to decide who is a &quot;terrorist&quot; without having to present evidence or charges in a court of law. <br /><br />The Bush administration&#39;s policy comprises an end-run around any notion of procedural due process of law. Administration assurances that harsh treatment is reserved only for &quot;terrorists&quot; is meaningless when the threshold process for determining who is and who is not a &quot;terrorist&quot; depends on executive discretion that is not subject to review. Substantive rights are useless without the procedural rights to enforce them.<br /><br />Jose Padilla, a US citizen, was accused of intending to set off a radioactive &quot;dirty bomb&quot; in an American city. He was denied due process and the protection of habeas corpus. He was held for years under harsh conditions that brought about &quot;essentially the destruction of a human being&#39;s mind,&quot; according to Dr. Angela Hegarty, a psychiatrist who spent 22 hours examining Padilla.<br /><br />Eventually, the courts intervened. In December 2003 an appellate court ruled that Padilla could not be denied habeas corpus protection. To forestall another Supreme Court ruling against the Bush administration, the administration withdrew Padilla&#39;s status as &quot;enemy combatant&quot; and filed criminal charges that bore no relationship to the administration&#39;s original allegations that Padilla intended to explode a &quot;dirty bomb.&quot; <br /><br />The only case the DOJ was able to manufacture against Padilla was that he was a &quot;terrorist-wannabe.&quot; Padilla was thus indicted on the Benthamite grounds that he might commit a terrorist act in the future. <br /><br />By the time Padilla went to trial, he had been demonized for years in the media as the &quot;dirty bomb&quot; terrorist. In the Washington Post, August 17, 2007, Peter Whoriskey described the Padilla jury as a patriotic jury that appeared in court with one row of jurors dressed in red, one in white, and one in blue. As Lawrence Stratton and I write in the new edition of <em>The Tyranny of Good Intentions</em>: &quot;It was a jury primed to be psychologically and emotionally manipulated by federal prosecutors. No member of this jury was going to return home to accusations of letting off the &quot;dirty bomber.&quot;<br /><br />The main &quot;evidence&quot; introduced against Padilla was an unrelated 10-year old video of Osama bin Laden, which served to arouse in jurors fear, anger, and disturbing memories of September 11. <br /><br />The prosecutors also claimed to have a form that Padilla is alleged to have completed in 2000, prior to September 11, 2001, to attend an al Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan. At that time Al Qaeda and the Taliban were fighting against a remnant of the Northern Alliance containing elements of the old Soviet regime to unify Afghanistan as an Islamic state. Although it is far fetched that al Qaeda sent out applications to attend its training camps, any such application by Padilla predated the 9/11 attack and was related only to domestic affairs in Afghanistan. Any such application has no relevance to any act of terrorism.<br /><br />Padilla was convicted on all counts. In handing down a <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/padilla-gets-17-year-prison-sentence-on.php ">17-year sentence</a>, US District Judge Marcia Cooke denied the prosecutors&#39; request for a life sentence and observed: &quot;There is no evidence that these defendants personally maimed, kidnapped or killed anyone in the United States or elsewhere.&quot;<br /><br />Under Blackstonian law, the basis of the US Constitution, the Padilla case has no crime and no intent to commit a crime. Judge Cooke vaguely recognized this, but US law has been pushed off its Blackstonian basis and is being reconstructed on a Benthamite basis.<br /><br />Benthamite law is the great ally of tyranny. It permits people to be arrested on the suspicion that they might commit a crime in the future, to be tortured, and to be held indefinitely. In other words, suspicion leads to imprisonment without the check of warrant, judge, trial or jury.<br /><br />This is the law that the Padilla case has given us. Padilla, an American citizen, was denied habeas corpus, tortured, and convicted of the Benthamite crime of being suspected of possibly committing a real crime in the future. The fact that judge and jury went along with the Benthamite proceeding shows that Benthamite justice can operate within the old Blackstonian process.<br /><br />The Justice Department that manufactured the case against Padilla is the same DOJ that wrote memos justifying torture and findings that the President of the US need not obey federal statutes such as FISA or abide by the Geneva Conventions and the US Constitution. It is the same DOJ whose attorney general told Congress that the Constitution does not provide habeas corpus protection to every US citizen. <br /><br />This same DOJ is the product of an administration the highest officers of which have been documented to have <a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/WarCard/">lied about Iraq</a> 935 times in the two years following 9/11. <br /><br />If the Bush administration will lie about matters of war and death and fabricate evidence to justify war, why won&#39;t the administration lie and fabricate evidence in order to convict accused &quot;terrorists&quot; like Padilla and whomever else they please?<br /><br />Harvey Silverglate has noted that the legal changes we have experienced since 9/11/2001 have destroyed the common law basis of US law. In terrorist cases, prosecutors do not need to fabricate evidence, because they can make crimes out of innocuous and even constitutionally protected activity. A case in point is the federal indictment of a Saudi graduate student at the University of Idaho who operated some Websites, a constitutionally-protected activity, where some participants in discussion groups advocated jihad. Applying a provision of the US PATRIOT Act, federal prosecutors indicted Omar Al-Hussayen for providing &quot;expert advice or assistance&quot; to terrorist organizations (see <a href="http://harveysilverglate.com/articles/freespeechinanage.html">Silverglate</a>, The Boston Globe, June 28, 2004). What prosecutors are doing goes beyond fabricating evidence. They are using amorphous terrorism statutes to criminalize ordinary aspects of everyday life. Another way of putting it is that prosecutors take ordinary events and stretch them to fit an expansive interpretation of a terrorism statute. A large amount of effort is committed to prosecuting activities that do not fit any common sense meaning of crime.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Tom Burke</strong> [spokesperson, <a href="http://www.freericardopalmera.org/">National Committee to Free Ricardo Palmera</a>]: &quot;The main legal issue is: the imprisonment, trials, and sentencing of Colombian revolutionaries in U.S. courts is a violation of the Colombian people&#39;s sovereignty.  Ricardo Palmera is a political prisoner of the U.S. government.  The U.S. has no right <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/us-judge-sentences-colombian-rebel-to.php">to put Ricardo Palmera on trial or to imprison him</a>.  <br /><br />The Bush administration is using the U.S. judicial system as a tool in the U.S. counter-insurgency war in Colombia.  The U.S. Military directs the war and commands the Colombian Military from the U.S. Southern Command.  The U.S. is attempting to criminalize Ricardo Palmera, his comrade Sonia, and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).  To the great disappointment of the Bush administration, the State Department, and the Department of Justice, the effort has largely failed.  Ricardo Palmera&#39;s testimony in the three trials has convinced U.S. jurors that the Colombian people&#39;s struggle is political.  Ricardo Palmera is a freedom fighter rebelling against the tyranny of an oligarcy and their corrupt, narco-trafficking government that is supported by the wealthy ruling class of the U.S.&quot;<br />

		<title>Duplicative investigation of US Attorney firings wastes tax dollars</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.american-partisan.com/bios/alexander.htm"><strong>Rachel Alexander</strong></a> [editor, <a href="http://www.intellectualconservative.com/">Intellectual Conservativism</a>]: &quot;As Scott J. Bloch, head of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, continues to <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/doj-accused-of-impeding-us-attorney.php">complain</a> that the Department of Justice&#39;s investigation is delaying his investigation of the nine U.S. attorney firings, the question arises, why are two investigations needed? Although there is concern that the Department of Justice is technically investigating itself, don&#39;t forget that there have already been consequences - Alberto Gonzales has resigned. The validity of an investigation is in dispute, since those on the right think Gonzales did nothing wrong and had a right to fire the attorneys for almost any reason. Those on the left are the ones who called for an investigation, evidence this could be nothing more than a political witch hunt. There is no consensus that an investigation is necessary.<br /><br />Bloch&#39;s credibility as a prosecutor is questionable. His administration of the Office of Special Counsel reveals a temperamental style of going after perceived improper behavior by government employees, quick to make scathing accusations. Ironically, Bloch has been accused himself of stonewalling investigations into his own office by refusing to turn over or deleting computer files on his computer, retaliating against whistleblowers with investigations, and improperly dismissing other requests for whistleblower investigations. Congress just added $1.1 million more in funding for Bloch to investigate alleged illegal political activity by the Bush administration. It seems a bit wasteful to have two investigations going on the taxpayer dole. Bloch&#39;s blustering presents a good opportunity to revisit the decision to have his office double up on this investigation.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Max Jeganathan</strong> [spokesperson, <a href="http://www.cla.asn.au/index.php">Civil Liberties Australia</a>]: &quot;Civil Liberties Australia unequivocally and unconditionally rejects Mr Keelty&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/australia-police-chief-suggests.php">call for media restrictions</a> on coverage relating to all and any operations by the Australian Federal Police Force. Clearly, the arms of law enforcement and the judicial process need to operate freely and impartially without incumberance. However, the cruciality of a free press can not be undermined for a false purpose. There is absolutely no reason why law enforcement agencies and the judiciary can not operate responsibly and effectively while the media reports on their operations responsibly and effectively.  <br /> <br />At a time when procedural fairness, natural justice and due process are been stretched in the name of national security, it is incumbent upon a free media to hold law enforcement and the judiciary accountable. The false case brought by the Federal Police and the Director of Public Prosecutions against <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/australia-federal-court-upholds-haneef.php">Dr Mohammad Haneef</a> would have gone unscrutinised and unreported if Mr Keelty&#39;s wishes were granted. This is just one example of why media restrictions are, in a philosophical, theoretical and practical sense, unpalatable in any pluralist society. <br /> <br />It is not too much to ask for an unencumbered media to operate along side a competant law enforcement agency. In fact, anything less should be considered unacceptable.&quot;<br />

		<title>Khmer Rouge leader Nuon Chea not likely to be released on bail</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Anne Heindel</strong> [legal advisor, <a href="http://www.dccam.org/">Documentation Center of Cambodia</a>]: &quot;The provisional release hearing of &quot;Brother Number Two,&quot; Khmer Rouge leader Nuon Chea, was cut short on Monday in response to a request by his Cambodian attorney. Son Arun argued that the <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/eccc-hearing-for-khmer-rouge-second-in.php">proceedings must be adjourned</a> due to the unavailability of his foreign co-counsel. Nuon&#39;s Dutch attorney Victor Koppe was unable to appear at the proceedings after the Cambodian Bar Association refused to admit him on Friday, arguing that he had violated the Bar&#39;s rules by signing a motion requesting the disqualification of one of the Pre-Trial Chamber (PTC)  judges before being admitted to practice. The defense strategy appears to have worked. On Tuesday the Bar swore in Koppe, and Nuon&#39;s hearing will resume on Thursday morning. <br /><br />This is the second time that Nuon, charged by the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia with crimes against humanity and war crimes, has requested the Court to address the scope of the right to counsel. In September, the Co-Investigating Judges (CIJs) held Nuon&#39;s initial appearance without any counsel present. Nuon&#39;s counsel later requested that the written records of those proceeding be annulled to remedy violations of his right to counsel and other fair trial rights. Last month the CIJs ruled that Nuon had clearly and deliberately waived his right to counsel, and refused to seize the PTC on this matter.<br /><br />With these trial rights questions decided for the moment, Thursday&#39;s hearing is likely to be short. Nuon&#39;s attorneys are arguing that the conditions for his provisional detention have not been met. However, this argument is not likely to persuade the PTC. In November, the PTC reviewed the CIJs thinly reasoned decision in the case of Tuol Sleng prison chief Kang Guek Eak (alias Duch) and found that the legal requirements had been met for his continued detention. The prosecution&#39;s arguments for detention were similar, and indeed stronger, in Duch&#39;s case. Duch&#39;s pretrial rights were likely violated by the almost nine years he was detained by a Cambodian military court, he has previously confessed his responsibility for torture and murder of detainees, and he is likely cooperating with Court. Nuon was second only to Pol Pot and has never accepted responsibility for the crimes of the Democratic Kampuchea regime. Despite Nuon&#39;s 81 years, the PTC will undoubtedly agree with the CIJs that he is a flight risk and might interfere with victims and witnesses, and that his release could imperil public order as well as Nuon&#39;s personal safety.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Michele Granda</strong> [staff attorney, <a href="http://www.glad.org/30years/">Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders</a> (GLAD)]:&quot;The New York State appeals court decision to <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/new-york-court-rules-that-state-must.php">recognize the valid legal marriage</a> of Patricia Martinez and Lisa Ann Golden contrasts starkly with a recent decision of Rhode Island&#39;s Supreme Court on the same issue.  <br /> <br />Our Nation has faced marriage across state borders for over 200 years, and state-to-state marriage recognition questions are generally handled under traditional family law conflict of law principles.  That body of law has handled vexing public policy issues of similar magnitude in the past (e.g., inter-racial marriage, polygamy, divorce), and the New York appeals court quite correctly ruled that we are not on a blank slate when it comes to the marriages of same-sex couples.  Gay couples should be protected by the same legal rules that have always governed the recognition of out-of-state marriages. <br /> <br />Yet, the Rhode Island Court, when asked to rule on the validity of the marriage of two women who sought to divorce in Rhode Island, refused to apply the longstanding legal principles that have been guiding us for hundreds of years.   Rhode Island&#39;s highest court went out of its way to make an apparent gay exception to the rule and tradition of comity - respect for marriages validly made in the jurisdictions where they took place.  The Rhode Island court&#39;s ruling was nonsensical and cruel, and as the dissenters noted, it &quot;places the parties, and all those similarly situated, in an untenable position.  They are denied access to the Family Court and thus are left in a virtual legal limbo&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;&quot;<br /> <br />As the New York Times noted, the New York appeals court&#39;s decision, by contrast, was both &quot;common-sensical and profound.&quot;  It is also good law.&quot;<br />

But rarely is the crime of genocide invoked when Western militaries murder Muslim groups. This essay argues that the internationally recognized crime of genocide applies to the intentional killings that NATO troops commit on a weekly basis in the poor villages and mute mountains of Afghanistan to destroy the Taliban, a puritanical Islamic group. NATO combat troops bombard and kill people in Taliban enclaves and meeting places. They also murder defenseless Afghan civilians. The dehumanized label of &quot;Taliban&quot; is used to cloak the nameless victims of NATO operations. Some political opposition to this practice is building in NATO countries, such as Canada, where calls are heard to withdraw troops from Afghanistan or divert them to non-combat tasks. <br /><br /><strong>Dehumanization</strong><br /><br />In almost all NATO nations, the Taliban have been completely dehumanized &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; a historically-tested signal that perpetrators of the crime of genocide carry unmitigated intentions to eradicate the dehumanized group. Politicians, the armed forces, the media, and even the general public associate in the West the Taliban with irrational fanatics, intolerant fundamentalists, brutal assassins, beheaders of women, bearded extremists, and terrorists. This luminescent negativity paves the way for aggression, military operations, and genocide. Promoting the predatory doctrine of collective self-defense, killing the Taliban is celebrated as a legal virtue. To leave the Taliban in control of Afghanistan, says NATO, is to leave a haven for terrorism.<br /><br />A similar dehumanization took place in the 16th and 17th centuries when NATO precursors occupied the Americas to purloin land and resources. The killings of native inhabitants were extensive and heartless. Thomas Jefferson, the noble author of the Declaration of Independence, labeled Indians as &quot;merciless savages.&quot; President Andrew Jackson pontificated: &quot;What good man would prefer a country covered with forests and ranged by a few thousand savages to our extensive Republic, studded with cities, towns, and prosperous farms.&quot; Promoting the predatory doctrine of discovery, the United States Supreme Court later ratified the pilgrims&#39; crimes, holding that &quot;discovery gave an exclusive right to extinguish the Indian title (to land). ([T]he Indians were fierce savages...To leave them in possession of their country was to leave the country a wilderness.&quot; <br /><br />The predators have not changed their stripes a bit. They come, they demonize, they obliterate. They do all this in the name of superior civilization. <br /><br /><strong>The Facts</strong><br /><br />The NATO website lists its killings in Afghanistan. These killings are also reported in the world media, often with a shameless tone of gratitude as if NATO forces are engaged in wiping out cannibals. In 2007 alone, NATO helicopters and precision guided munitions bombed and killed over six thousand &quot;Taliban.&quot; Read the following recent attacks, which the NATO itself reports, and smell the scent of genocide:<ul><li>On January 19, 2008, NATO launched a preemptive strike relying on &quot;credible intelligence&quot; that the Taliban were planning to mass on a NATO base. The attack killed two dozen &quot;insurgents&quot; in the Watapoor District of Kunar Province, though the exact number of casualties could not be confirmed because of the rough mountainous region. The world media reported that numerous civilians were killed and 25 bodies were buried in just one mass grave. <br /><br /><li>On January 12, 2008, NATO forces conducted what it calls a &quot;precise strike&quot; on a compound in Kapsia Province targeting Taliban leaders. NATO claimed that the civilians were cleared from the compound before the attack. The claim is absurd because any removal of civilians from the compound would have alerted the battle-hardened Taliban that an enemy attack was imminent.<br /><br /><li>On September 20, 2007, NATO forces launched &quot;Operation Palk Wahel&quot; to kill and remove the Taliban from an area in the Upper Gereshk Valley. Numerous civilians were killed. The evidence of the genocide was so obvious that NATO admitted that it &quot;was unaware of civilians in the vicinity of the target and unfortunately it appears that a number of non-combatants were caught in the attack and killed.&quot;</ul><strong>The Law</strong><br /><br />The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (entered into force, 1951) is binding on all states including the 26 member states of NATO. The Genocide Convention is jus cogens, the law from which no derogation is allowed. It provides no exceptions for any nation or any organization of nations, such as the United Nations or NATO, to commit genocide. Nor does the Convention allow any exceptions to genocide &quot;whether committed in time of peace or in time of war.&quot; Even traditional self-defense - let alone preemptive self-defense, a deceptive name for aggression - cannot be invoked to justify or excuse the crime of genocide. <br /><br />In murdering the Taliban, NATO armed forces systematically practice on a continual basis the crime of genocide that consists of three constituent elements - act, intent to destroy, and religious group. The crime, as defined in the Convention, is analyzed below:<ol><li>Act. The Convention lists five acts, each of which qualifies as genocide. NATO forces in Afghanistan are committing three of the five acts. They are killing members of the Taliban. They are causing serious bodily harm to members of the Taliban. They are deliberately inflicting on the Taliban conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction in whole or in part. Any of these three acts committed one time constitutes the crime of genocide. NATO combat troops have been committing, and continue to commit, these acts through multiple means and weapons. <br /><br /><li>Intent to Destroy. The crime of genocide is a crime of intent. It must be shown that NATO combat troops and the high command ordering these troops carry the requisite intent to destroy the Taliban. Mere negligent killings do not qualify as genocide. The statements of NATO&#39;s Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer and those of NATO spokesmen leave no doubt that the NATO conducts military operations to &quot;hunt and destroy&quot; the Taliban. Preemptive strikes to kill the Taliban are sufficient proof that NATO troops and commanding generals have specific intent to destroy as many Taliban members as they can find. The weekly murderous planning and intelligence gathering to locate and eliminate the Taliban leaders and members further demonstrate that the killings in Afghanistan are not negligent, accidental, or by mistake. For all legal purposes, NATO&#39;s incessant and deliberate killings of the Taliban are powered with the specific intent to destroy a religious group. <br /><br /><li>Religious Group. The Genocide Convention is far from universal in that it does not protect all groups from genocide. Its protection covers only four groups: national, ethnic, racial and religious. (Political groups are not protected). The Convention does not require the complete eradication of
 a protected group as a necessary condition for the crime of genocide. Even part destruction of a protected group constitutes the crime. It is no secret that the Taliban are a religious group. (They may also qualify as a national (Afghan) or ethnic (Pushtun) group). The Taliban advocate and practice a puritanical version of Islam. The Convention does not demand that the protected group advocate and practice a form of religion acceptable to the West or the world. The questionable beliefs and practices of a religious group are no reasons to destroy the group. That the Taliban are armed or support terrorism or oppress women are unlawful excuses to commit genocide. (All reasons that Hitler had to murder Jews would be simply irrelevant under the Convention).</ol><strong>The Holding</strong><br /><br />It may, therefore, be safely concluded that NATO combat troops and NATO commanders are engaged in murdering the Taliban, a protected group under the Genocide Convention, with the specific intent to physically and mentally destroy the group in whole or in part. This is the crime of genocide. <br /><br /><br /><br /><em>Ali Khan is a professor at Washburn University School of Law in Kansas.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.mbktrial.com/about/amsterdam_bio.cfm">Robert Amsterdam</a>, international defense counsel for Russian billionaire and former Yukos CEO Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Siberia for tax fraud after a controversial trial and now facing money laundering charges, says it is increasingly clear that the case against his client is political in nature...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/robertamsterdamforum.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>n the Kremlin&#39;s zeal to keep Mikhail Khodorkovsky in prison and frustrate his expected release on parole this past October, prosecutors brought ludicrous new charges against him in February of last year. A sloppily-drafted indictment, replete with factual errors and clear impossibilities, seems set to be the basis for a new trial and longer prison sentence.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the estimated $200 billion worth of assets expropriated and redistributed to state-owned firms during the Yukos affair are believed to be at the heart of the Kremlin clan wars that have erupted at the end of President Vladimir Putin&#39;s second term. These clan wars suggest that the much-touted stability of the Putin era may well rapidly collapse, with wholly unpredictable results.<br /><br />Coupled with the incomprehensible indictment, a series of foreign legal developments in Khodorkovsky&#39;s and Yukos&#39;s favor appear to have been at least partially responsible for the delay in the launch of the new Khodorkovsky trial. With the indictment process in procedural shambles, responsibility for the case has been transferred to a newly-created investigative agency under even closer control of the Kremlin. However, the new trial is now unlikely to start until March 2008 at the earliest - even though Khodorkovsky has been in pre-trial detention since December 2006 (in a violation of Russian law, I might add).<br /><br />The most important legal development of 2007 came in the form of a set of six decisions issued in August by the Swiss Federal Tribunal. This court ruled that Swiss authorities are no longer to comply with Russian prosecutors&#39; requests for assistance concerning the Yukos affair. The Tribunal validated a series of appeals from Khodorkovsky and several of his former partners, who had asserted that helping the Russian authorities would bring about grave moral and legal injustices. The judgment cited several legal violations in the criminal proceedings against Khodorkovsky and his associates, and deemed those proceedings to be politically motivated. <br /><br />According to the judges, &quot;Switzerland would be in breach of its international obligations if it cooperated with a foreign criminal proceeding presenting a risk of treatment of an accused, particularly discriminatory treatment, which is inconsistent with minimal guarantees recognized under international law.&quot; <br /><br />The Tribunal also revealed details of Russia&#39;s inability or refusal to satisfy Switzerland&#39;s requests for routine justifications regarding the Yukos-related demands of the Russian prosecutor: Russia&#39;s responses to legitimate Swiss questions were deemed by the court to be &quot;scattered and evasive&quot; and without credibility. This was the first time in history, outside of extradition cases, that Switzerland rejected a request to provide assistance to prosecutors from another country.<br /><br />Russia&#39;s response to this series of judgments was to turn around and characterize them as &quot;politically motivated&quot; - a charge that no one who knows anything about Switzerland can take plausibly. More telling, shortly after the Swiss decision, the prosecutor overseeing the Khodorkovsky case was dismissed and the new investigative agency was created.<br /><br />The Swiss judgment closely followed upon a judgment in a Czech court, which in July 2007 refused to allow the extradition to Russia of Elena Vybornova, who was wanted for testimony related to new charges brought against Khodorkovsky this year.<br /><br />Despite an international warrant issued by Russian procuracy, the Czech court decided to protect Vybornova from the certainty of unfair treatment in the hands of Russian justice. The Czech judge presented a broad collection of evidence showing in what ways the Russian justice system has serious flaws: persons viewed as inconvenient or troublesome are jailed regardless of guilt or innocence, they are denied access to legal counsel, they are tortured or abused to extract testimonies, they are bullied into perjury, and judges are subjected to political pressure to decide cases regardless of facts or proof. Vybornova clearly had no hope for any guarantee of a fair trial, and so the court refused to allow her extradition to Russia.<br /><br />In September 2007, the Lithuanian Prosecutor General&#39;s Office also decided against cooperating with Russia on a Yukos extradition case, concerning Mikhail Brudno. Laima Cekeliene, Chief Prosecutor of the Division of Judicial Cooperation and Mutual Assistance of the Lithuanian Prosecutor General&#39;s Office, stated: &quot;Upon analyzing the materials on the Yukos case, we have concluded that this case is politicized and Mikhail Brudno has been persecuted, maybe because of other people involved in the Yukos affair, and we have decided that the charges against him are politically motivated.&quot;<br /><br />Then in December 2007 a Dutch court ruled that Russia had illegally forced the bankruptcy sale of certain Yukos assets in the Netherlands. The court cancelled the validity of that sale and ordered a new auction.<br /><br />Meanwhile, in a series of procedures undertaken in the United States in the latter half of 2007, courts in California and Texas have granted applications by Khodorkovsky for discovery pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &Acirc;&#167; 1782. This has helped Khodorkovsky to prepare his defense in response to the new charges in light of what has now become obvious - namely, that when prosecutors were raiding Yukos in Moscow in connection with the first trial, they were not only seizing evidence, but also destroying evidence, especially any exculpatory evidence.<br /><br />After nearly five years of arguing that the case against Khodorkovsky is political in nature, the truth of his defense counsels&#39; position has been validated time and time again. Last week the respected Russian business paper <em>Vedomosti</em> reported that the complete political steering of the affair meant that there were essentially three most likely scenarios that could be played out. In any case, the judges will have little or no role determining the precise outcome. Rather, the precise outcome will depend upon the political options facing the Kremlin. By the time of trial, prosecutors will no doubt show up to court wearing jerseys from either &quot;Team Rosneft&quot; or &quot;Team Gazprom&quot;. So transparent are the vested interests of the state-controlled companies in legitimizing their theft of Yukos assets that the prosecutors will themselves be little more than puppets acting out the Kremlin&#39;s orders.<br /><br />The competing clans may not have agreed whether Khodorkovsky should be locked away for another five, ten or twenty years. In the meantime, the defense team, in the words of Yuri Schmidt, is left attempting to puzzle out the winds of change in the Kremlin to determine whether or not the phony trial against Khodorkovsky will be closed or open, in Siberia or in Moscow, short or long.<br /><br />This sad farce has left not only Khodorkovsky as victim. Others, from his closest business partner to a junior member of his in-house legal department, have paid a terrible price for their proximity to Khodorkovsky. One Yukos prisoner, as reported in <em>The Financial Times</em> on January 15, 2008, is near death as his jailers deny him urgently needed life-saving
medications. This is the cruelty of those in the Kremlin who have illegally expropriated a company that today would be worth nearly $100 billion - and who need to assert the legitimacy of their acts through incredible abuses of state authority.<br /><br />The Kremlin is reeling from the loss of legitimization that comes from the generally-shared understanding worldwide that in cases that relate to national resources or political diversity, the rule of law in Russia is honored only in its breach. The fight over assets going on in the Kremlin highlights the unfortunate probability that the May 2008 inauguration will herald a new President dangerously low in legitimacy.<br /><br />With the Kremlin firmly in control of the national energy sector and fuelled by its revenues, the world has been confronted with the repercussions of the Yukos affair. A hubristic Kremlin does as it wishes, with impunity, whether domestically or internationally. For the Kremlin, law is either a pretext for the exercise of brute power, or an inconvenience to be brushed aside. What matters is power, not law.<br /><br /><br /><em>Robert R.

		<title>The Pakistan Lawyers&#039; Movement: A Lost Cause?</title>

After nearly ten months of unfailing persistence, lawyers in Pakistan are finally beginning to wonder: Should they go on?<br /><br />On 13 January, the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) voted to end the continuous boycott of judges who swore oath&#39;s under the country&#39;s Provisional Constitution Order and to instead substitute "a complete boycott of the superior judiciary every Thursday and a one-hour token strike on a daily basis." Predictably, the decision created a furor: for many, it was a sell-out. <br /><br />Both the Lawyers National Action Committee (LNAC) and the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) quickly denounced the decision as "contradictory" and "against the spirit of the lawyers' sacrifices." The provincial bar councils, the high court bar associations and the district bar associations echoed similar sentiments: they insisted on pursuing the strategy of continuous boycott. <br /><br />The PBC, some argued, did not have authority to amend the methods of the movement. The LNAC was responsible for all decisions post-March 9 and the same, they said, should decide on the issue of amending the scope of the boycott. Secondly, appearing before these courts, some of the high court bar associations argued, would amount to giving legality to the unconstitutional acts of the regime. <br /><br />And finally, many lawyers reiterated their resolve to continue a complete boycott notwithstanding the financial hardships. A majority of the mostly young lawyers of the Islamabad District Bar Association, for example, rejected the PBC decision insisting on their willingness to "face financial constraints" and "sacrifice everything for the rule of law." <br /><br />The PCB, on its part, argued that the decision was motivated by the hardships of the litigants: : it was "a concession in public interest in view of the misery of persons falsely accused of criminal cases and hardship of litigants seeking determination of their genuine claims." The concession, however, wasn't "a recognition of the validity and constitutionality of the PCO judges," the PBC said.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, the PCB found few takers for its explanation. And with mounting pressure to revert to its original plan of complete boycott, the PCB met on February 2 to decide the future course of action. But it chose not to revoke its earlier decision.<br /><br />With the PBC now openly in disagreement with the LNAC and the SCBA about the future course of action, it may be worthwhile to pause for a moment and ask: what, after all, are the objectives of the lawyers' movement? What are they seeking to achieve? What purpose does a complete (or token) boycott serve? More importantly, is there a disconnect between their purported goals and the strategies they have employed thus far?<br /><br />In the last three months, some or all of these have been articulated as the objectives of the current agitation: (a) restoration of the pre-PCO judiciary (b) removal of (retd.) General Musharraf from the office of the President (c) and the release of lawyers and judges who have been kept under "detention" including Aitzaz Ahsan, Munir Malik , Shakeel Ahmad, Ali Ahmad Kurd and Justice (retd.) Tariq Mahmood. Additionally, they have also called upon the political parties to boycott the impending general elections. <br /><br />Beyond these specific claims, lawyers have often demanded the following: establishment of an "independent judiciary" and respect for rule of law, the restoration of the 1973 constitution in its "real form" and the cessation of all forms of coercion against lawyers and members of the civil society.  <br /><br />In the light of these narrow and broad objectives, consider the effectiveness of a boycott strategy. Consider, for example, objectives (b) and (c) mentioned above. What reason does one have to believe that General Musharraf can be removed from office by boycotting the superior judiciary? Or what reason does one have to believe that a boycott of the superior judiciary will lead to the release of detained lawyers and judges?<br /><br />Or consider the effectiveness of the boycott strategy with reference to the broader objectives. Can the boycott of the superior judiciary, by itself, lead to the establishment of an "independent judiciary"? Or can it lead to the establishment of a "rule of law" society? Or can it, by itself, lead to the restoration of the 1973 Constitution in its "real form"? <br /><br />The agitation may be effective in making a moral statement against the illegalities of the Musharraf administration. But the effectiveness of the boycott strategy in producing tangible changes must be seriously questioned. <br /><br />Lawyers in Pakistan are trying to effect significant political and legal changes both by their presence in and absence from the courts. Their endeavors are strikingly reminiscent of what came to be known in the US as "cause lawyering" in the early 1950s. "Cause lawyering" typically involves a strategic use of the litigation process to pursue specific goals.<br /><br />For example, throughout the 1950s, black organizations used the litigation process to challenge specific laws (and policies) that were unfairly discriminatory. Organizations "shopped around" for appropriate persons to act as petitioners while lawyers located judges likely to be sympathetic to anti-discrimination arguments.<br /><br />And bit by bit, a body of equality jurisprudence began to develop, culminating in the historic <em>Brown v Board of Education</em> in which the US Supreme Court declared the policy of racially segregated schools unconstitutional. "Cause lawyering" became a phenomenal success and since then has been a pervasive feature of the US legal system. <br /><br />There is, however, a basic difference between the practice in the US and what is now being attempted in Pakistan. In the US "cause lawyering" was employed to bring about changes in specific areas of law: equality jurisprudence, abortion rights, gay rights and so on. In contrast, most of the objectives of the current agitation relate to fundamental legal and political changes in Pakistan. <br /><br />A strategy closely tied to the litigation process can rarely deliver fundamental changes. "Independence of the judiciary" or the restoration of the 1973 Constitution in its "real form" cannot be brought about by a dialogic process merely involving lawyers and judges. These are objectives that can be achieved only through broader political power. <br /><br />This may explain why Justice Khalilur Rehman Khan, the former SC judge who did not succumb to the 2000 Provisional Constitution Order, recently "asked lawyers not to press for the boycott of the elections." "Lawyers must beat General Musharraf at his own game," he said "by persuading the masses to vote only for those candidates who had pledged restoration of the pre-PCO judiciary."<br /><br />Justice Khan encouraged lawyers to persuade the masses to vote for specific candidates. Maybe lawyers need to present themselves as candidates. Boycott, it would then appear, is a misguided strategy: they need to participate actively, whether in the courts or in the elections.  <br /><br />In their 1995 "Plan for the Historic Initiation of the People's War," the Maoists in Nepal declared: "everything is an illusion except state powe
r." As Pakistan&#39;s lawyers work towards their February 9 convention, they would be well-advised to consider the validity of the "Maoist truth."<br /><br /><br /><em>Shubhankar Dam is a law professor at the Singapore Management University School of Law working mainly in the area of South Asian law and politics.</em><br />

US Army (Ret.) and former Special Assistant to the Judge Advocate General for Law of War Matters, now a professor at South Texas College of Law, says that the pattern of executive branch decision making in the aftermath of the terror attacks of September 11th suggests that US national security policy will succeed only if policy is driven by law, and not vice versa...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/geoffreycornnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he ongoing debates between the remaining candidates vying to become the next President of the United States have once again highlighted the challenges associated with developing sound national security policies.  One of these challenges, particularly for candidates, is the obvious need to define which national security issues are most important to this nation.  How this question is answered will in many ways define the national security strategy of whichever candidate prevails in November.<br /><br />It is obviously tempting to focus on substance in deciding which national security issue is most important to our nation today.  However, I would like to suggest a different focus: the relationship between law and policy.  This suggestion is in large measure a product of my time as a government legal advisor, and my reactions in that capacity to the many national security law related decisions that flowed from our government in the aftermath of the terror attacks of September 11th.   This experience produced a frequent sense of discouragement as I became increasingly aware of what I and many others perceived to be deliberate manipulations of law to satisfy the demands of policy objectives.  <br /><br />This has led me to conclude that, at least in my opinion, the most important issue in national security law today is the relationship between national security law and national security policy.  U.S. national security policy will succeed only if policy is driven by law, and not vice versa.  To paraphrase Justice Frankfurter from the <em>Steel Seizure Case</em>, the existence of emergency does not <em>ipso facto</em> produce power in government; and power in the federal government to respond to emergency does not <em>ipso facto</em> produce power in the executive branch.  However, most observers would now agree that this was exactly the philosophy that dominated executive branch decision making in the aftermath of the terror attacks of September 11th.<br /><br />This distorted view of the role of law in the development and execution of national security policy has been pervasive at the highest levels of the executive branch.  With issues ranging from the legal basis for Operation Iraqi Freedom, to the status and treatment of individuals captured by the armed forces during the military component of the self-proclaimed Global War on Terror, to the development of a process for the use of military commissions, to the use of national intelligence assets to conduct domestic surveillance, law had become a slave to policy.  This not only undermined the legitimacy of these critical national security policy decisions &#8212; a number of which were subsequently invalidated because of defective legal foundations &#8212; but it damaged morale of the thousands of legal advisors serving throughout the executive branch.  These lawyers - some relatively inexperienced, others with long and distinguished careers in government service &#8212; had always understood their ultimate role to be that of ensuring the policy makers they advised adjusted their decisions to the dictates of law.  However, the message sent through the dubious legal opinions emanating from the senior levels of the executive branch undermined this fundamental tenet of ethical responsibility and suggested that the "new" role of legal advisors was to interpret law in a way that accommodated policy objectives.<br /><br />This is not to suggest that legal advisors should pride themselves on being "naysayers".  Indeed, the tradition of the government legal advisor is quite the opposite.  These lawyers have traditionally taken great pride in their ability to assist policy makers in identifying legally sound courses of action to achieve established policy objectives.  But good faith application of controlling legal authority has always been the "first principle" of such an approach to advising policy makers, and such alternate courses of action have ultimately been responsive to the unyielding commitment to ensure policy is adjusted to comply with law, not that law is adjusted to facilitate policy.  Nor is this a suggestion that all existing legal constraints on policy are always logically and pragmatically sound.  But the response to such impediments must always be to seek modifications in the law, not manipulation, marginalization, or circumvention.   <br /><br />The fallout from this distortion of the relationship between law and policy has been profound.  Key legal opinions have been withdrawn; key legal advisors have been discredited; senior career legal advisors &#8212; such as the Judge Advocates General of the military services &#8212; have stood in unison against their politically appointed counterparts to challenge and undo prior legal decisions.  But perhaps most pernicious has been the uncertainty this approach has injected into the operational decision-making realm. Policy decision calling into question the application of tried and true legal paradigms undermined the effectiveness of subordinate legal advice and the clarity with which operational decision-makers understood the parameters of acceptable conduct.<br /><br />Another significant, although more subtle negative consequence of this distortion was how the dubious legal analysis flowing from the executive branch produced a loss of congressional confidence and a resulting backlash in the form of legislating operational standards.  This was most apparent with regard to the treatment of detainees, leading to the passage of the Detainee Treatment Act.  Setting aside the question of whether the Act actually achieved the asserted objectives of Congress, the mere fact that Congress felt compelled to legislate in an area historically entrusted to executive discretion reveals the extent of the loss of confidence resulting from executive overreaching.  These legislative rebukes have not been limited to detainee treatment, but have extended to several other key areas of the Bush national security policy.  All of this reveals a truly unfortunate executive branch deviation from the tradition of interpreting and applying law in a manner consistent with its underlying purpose, and not in a manner designed to "get to yes."<br /><br />As the Supreme Court observed in <em>United States v. Robel</em> in 1968, "[I]t would indeed be ironic if, in the name of national defense, we would sanction the subversion of ... those liberties which make the defense of the nation worthwhile."  The first bulwark against such subversion is preserving the traditional understanding of the relationship between law and policy.  Fidelity to this "first principle" of the role of a government legal advisor must begin at the highest levels of government.  Without such an understanding, legitimacy in the realm of national security will invariably be the first casualty.<br /><br /><br /><br /><em>Geoffrey S.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.danskfolkeparti.dk/Morten_Messerschmidt.asp"><strong>Morten Messerschmidt</strong></a> [MP, <a href="http://www.danskfolkeparti.dk/Forside.asp">Danish People&#39;s Party</a>]: &quot;Since the terrorist attack against the United States in 2001 all Western countries have reinforced their legal armoury in the fight against Islamic terror. In Denmark this amongst other measures led to a strengthening of our immigration laws in 2002, especially regarding the administrative possibilities of expulsion. In accordance with international law each country has the right to determine who can or cannot stay in the country. Accordingly, the former article 25 in the Danish immigration law, which originated in 1983, was strengthened so that refugees or immigrants -regardless of type - who are judged to represent a threat to the stability and democracy of the state of Denmark are to be expelled. If the information leading to this expulsion, executed by The Danish Security and Intelligence Service (PET) and approved by The Minister of Justice is considered confidential, it can be kept from public scrutiny. If, for instance, publication of these pieces of information could warn terrorists who are close to exposure, it makes perfectly good sense that such information must be kept secret - at least until the time where publication no longer poses a threat to the investigation of terrorist attacks or attempts of such.<br /><br />During the so-called Muhammad crisis in 2005, related to the publication of 12 cartoons of the prophet Muhammad in a Danish daily, Jyllands-Posten, it was unveiled that around 60% of the Moslems in Denmark demanded for a change in the laws ensuring freedom of speech, rooted in the Danish Constitution of 1849. This high percentage clearly indicates that many Moslems in Denmark experience a strong resistance towards the free and open society of Denmark. This is a pattern known from many other European countries, where a similar percentage of Moslems indicate that they would rather be living in a religious dictatorship than in a free democracy. Under such appalling circumstances proportional means are necessary: a residence permit, given administratively, can obviously on the very same grounds be cancelled administratively. In view of this, I and my party, The Danish Peoples&#39;s Party, strongly support the current expulsion of two non-Danish citizens who intended to <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/denmark-police-arrest-suspects-in.php">assassinate</a> one of the above mentioned Mohammad cartoonists.&quot;<br />

		<title>New treaty prohibiting cluster munitions needs clear standards to protect civilians</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Thomas Nash</strong> [coordinator, <a href="http://www.stopclustermunitions.org/">Cluster Munition Coalition</a>]: &quot;By the end of 2008 a new rule will be enshrined in an international legally binding treaty <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/icrc-urges-adoption-of-cluster-bomb-ban.php">prohibiting the use of cluster munitions</a>. This prohibition is the only way to prevent further humanitarian and developmental harm from cluster munitions and more and more international legal experts are coming around to this view, including the ICRC.<br /><br />The rationale for such a new rule is quite simple: current IHL is not adequate on this issue because it is too difficult to apply and it is too open to interpretation. Just as importantly, only a precise and clear rule prohibiting the weapon will be able to send the message to both eventual states parties as well as non states parties that the use of such weapons is not morally acceptable.<br /><br />There are some important points to consider in support of this rationale. First let us take the evolution of the UK&#39;s position on cluster munitions. For many years the UK maintained that no new rules were required on cluster munitions. Today the UK is working with other countries towards a specific treaty on cluster munitions. This recognition shows that the basis for new rules depends on the political will, not simply on legal arguments. Now that the political will is there, a new treaty is on the way.<br /><br />Second let&#39;s consider the recent finding by the Israeli Defence Forces that its use of cluster munitions was in accordance with existing IHL. Whether or not one accepts this claim &#8212; and of course it could be debated &#8212; the very fact that it can even be claimed that such use was lawful shows the potential for existing IHL to be interpreted in ways that fundamentally undermine its potential for protecting civilians. Only a crystal clear rule can really protect civilians from cluster munitions.<br /><br />So the rationale makes sense and the new rule is under rapid development. But what will the new rule mean? Of course it will prohibit the use of cluster munitions, as they end up being defined, thus stemming the flow of new victims and new unexploded cluster bomblets. Equally importantly though it will reinforce two broader norms of international humanitarian law. First the idea that it is simply unacceptable to use large amounts of explosive force in areas of civilian concentration and second that an obligation exists for countries which use explosive ordnance to clear it up afterwards. Aside from the immediate prohibition of an unacceptable class of weapons, the new cluster munition treaty will thus reinforce the type of clear and unambiguous standards that are needed if we are to move beyond current IHL and ensure real protection for civilians in armed conflict.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="URL of your webpage"><strong>Ali Khan</strong></a> [Washburn University School of Law]: &quot;Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf deserves credit for holding fair elections for the national and provincial parliaments. The opposition parties have won and the President&#39;s Party has lost in a big way. It is now time for the President to leave office with honor and dignity. <br /><br />To put Pakistan back on the democratic path, the following items need immediate attention. First, the judges deposed after the November proclamation of emergency must be restored so that the judicial system is rehabilitated and the striking lawyers go back to work. The winning parties must honor the lawyers who have sacrificed a lot for the restoration of the rule of law. Second, the unlawful and unilateral constitutional amendments made during the emergency should be annulled. Third, once the Supreme Court is restored, the case involving the legitimacy of the October Presidential election must be brought to conclusion. If the Supreme Court holds that the Presidential election is constitutional, the opposition parties must allow President Musharraf to finish his five year term. All these items, however, will more easily resolve if President Musharraf leaves office without further distorting political and constitutional dynamics. As it is said about democracy: The people have spoken!&quot;<br />

Hurley</u> misstated the holding of the case, but perhaps we shouldn&#39;t be surprised as those of us from Massachusetts are used to being misunderstood and denigrated for our progressive ways. Consider the criticism heaped on Horace Mann, a lawyer, the &quot;father of public education&quot; and former Secretary of the Board of Education of Massachusetts. He had the radical idea that everyone should be entitled to an education, even those who were not wealthy! <br /><br />The Parker children (and the co-plaintiff&#39;s children) were read books in grade school that included same sex couples with children and a fairytale with two princes who fall in love with each other, marry and live happily ever after. The complaint alleged that such exposure was &quot;indoctrination&quot; and violated the parents&#39; right to religious freedom as well as the state&#39;s statute allowing parents to exempt their children from any curriculum that primarily involves sexuality issues. Not so, said the lower court, in a memo heralding diversity in public schools. Notification wasn&#39;t necessary as this wasn&#39;t about sex.<br /><br />&quot;In essence, under the Constitution public schools are entitled to teach anything that is reasonably related to the goals of preparing students to become engaged and productive citizens in our democracy. Diversity is a hallmark of our nation. It is increasingly evident that our diversity includes differences in sexual orientation. Our nation&#39;s history includes a fundamental commitment to promoting mutual respect among citizens in our diverse nation&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;It is reasonable for public educators to teach elementary school students about individuals with different sexual orientations and about various forms of families, including those with same-sex parents, in an effort to eradicate the effects of past discrimination, to reduce the risk of future discrimination and, in the process, to reaffirm our nation&#39;s constitutional commitment to promoting mutual respect among members of our diverse society.&quot;<br /><br />Moreover, the rationale for the lower court holding was not just that Massachusetts law recognizes equal marriage, but that we have in Massachusetts (and have had since the early 90&#39;s) a panoply of state laws that protect lesbians and gay men from discrimination including one that prohibits public schools from discrimination based on sexual orientation (M.G.L. c. 76 &Acirc;&sect;5) and one that requires the Board of Education and the Commission of Education to develop curricula standards that &quot;inculcate respect for the &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;diversity (M.G.L. c69, &Acirc;&sect;1D).<br /><br />While not nearly as eloquent as the District Court on the subject of diversity, the Circuit Court affirmed the District Court&#39;s dismissal of the parties&#39; constitutional claims stating that &quot;Public Schools are not obliged to shield individual students from ideas which potentially are religiously offensive, particularly when the school imposes no requirement that the student agree with or affirm those ideas, or even participate in discussion about them.&quot; Furthermore, in a lengthy opinion discussing the standard of review, the Free Exercise Clause, the distinction between parents&#39; and children&#39;s rights under the First Amendment, and the public school&#39;s interest in implementing its curriculum, the court held that the school district struck the right balance between competing &quot;demands on government&quot; therefore not offending the Free Exercise or Due Process Clauses of the Constitution. <br /><br />Headlining the case as one focused on &quot;same sex marriage teaching,&quot; certainly is eye-catching but woefully simplistic.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.armscontrol.org/about/kimball.asp"><strong>Daryl Kimball</strong></a> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.armscontrol.org/">Arms Control Association</a>]: &quot;<a href="/paperchase/2008/02/russia-ex-defense-minister-calls-for.php">Defense Minister Ivanov&#39;s address</a> at the Berlin security conference reflects Russia&#39;s frustration with the current US-Russian impasse on key strategic weapons issues and the Bush administration&#39;s resistance to certain bilateral strategic arms agreements. Ivanov&#39;s comments do not really break any new ground. Rather, he simply appears to be reiterating Russia&#39;s current positions on key strategic weapons issues in a way that might appeal to European leaders who do not wish to see renewed weapons-related tensions between Russia and the West and who fundamentally believe that legally binding, verifiable agreements are important to maintaining consistent norms and legal standards.<br /><br />His comments relate to two key sets of developments in US and Russian relations and the treaties that have regulated them. In early 2002, the Bush administration abandoned the bilateral US-Russian Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) of 1972 and pursued the testing and construction of a rudimentary strategic missile interceptor system. Now, the US plans to install missile interceptors in Poland, which has added to Russian concerns that the United States might redeploy its reserve nuclear forces and utilize leftover nuclear delivery systems for conventional strike missions. In response, President Vladimir Putin has authorized new strategic missile systems and plans to increase the number of warheads carried by certain missile systems. Putin has also proposed that the US and Russia work together on a cooperative strategy to missile defense that ensures that US interceptors and radars do not pose a threat to Russia&#39;s shrinking nuclear and missile stockpile. While US officials have in the past few months been receptive to talks on Russia&#39;s ideas, no agreement has emerged or is likely.<br /><br />Also in 2002, President George W. Bush also insisted on a less formal approach to regulating U.S. and Russian deployed nuclear weapons. The Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty (SORT) calls for deeper reductions in deployed strategic nuclear warheads, to 1,700-2,200 each by 2012, but unlike the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) approach, SORT does not require the destruction of strategic delivery systems. SORT also allows each side to store nondeployed warheads. The treaty fails to establish new verification mechanisms, relying instead on those contained in START. The treaty&#39;s emphasis on flexibility detracts from its predictability, lessening its value in building a more stable and secure US-Russian relationship.<br /><br />Now, news reports indicate that neither government wants to extend START past its scheduled expiration on Dec. 5, 2009. US and Russian experts began discussions in March on follow-on measures to START, but the two sides are at odds over several core issues. Russia favors negotiating a new treaty that would reduce strategic nuclear warheads to less than 1,500 each, with additional limits on delivery systems. The Bush administration rejects further weapons limits and prefers new, informal transparency and confidence-building measures. <br /><br />In response to Russia&#39;s concerns about possible strategic vulnerabilities, last year, Putin proposed that Washington and Moscow seek to multilateralize the 1987 US-Russian treaty banning intermediate-range nuclear forces. So far, the states that possess such missiles have not greeted the proposal with enthusiasm.<br /><br />What should be done? Rather than allow the START to expire or mask long-simmering differences with halfway measures, Bush&#39;s and Putin&#39;s successors should agree to continue to observe START until they can enter into a new agreement that achieves what SORT did not: permanent and verifiable reductions of excess US and Russian Cold War nuclear forces. A new treaty with streamlined START-style verification protocols is necessary to restore confidence that each country will actually dismantle, not simply warehouse, warheads and missiles originally deployed to destroy the other. <br /><br />Many nuclear analysts believe that such an agreement could map out permanent, phased reductions of all strategic nuclear warheads, deployed and reserve, to a level of 1,000 or less and establish ceilings on the number of non-nuclear strategic missiles, and open the way for negotiations with the world&#39;s other nuclear weapons possessors.<br /><br />The two sides also need to avoid further tension over missile interceptors in Europe. Unfortunately, Bush and Putin will not likely resolve their differences and avert a collision on missile defense any time soon. Putin&#39;s offer to discuss alternative basing plans that would not interfere with Russian missiles is worth exploring. Nevertheless, the White House seems determined to begin construction of the European system before Bush leaves office. <br /><br />Such an approach is mistaken. The United States and its NATO partners should defer work on the European strategic missile defense project until Bush&#39;s and Putin&#39;s successors arrive. In the meantime, they should engage Russia in a meaningful dialogue to address its missile defense concerns, explore technical alternatives, and advance new proposals for deeper warhead and missile force cuts that would reduce tensions and erase Russian fears of US nuclear supremacy.&quot;<br />

As you know, the Parliament of the Serbian Province of Kosovo run by UN Mission has illegally and unilaterally <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/kosovo-parliament-adopts-declaration-of.php">proclaimed independence</a>. This decision was made against the international law and the endorsed UN Security Council Resolution 1244, which calls for a negotiated settlement on future Kosovo status and substantial autonomy of the Province of Kosovo within the Republic of Serbia. If the international community gives its consent for this unlawful act, the internationally recognized borders of Serbia will be redrawn, the sovereignty of Serbia abolished and 15 percent of its territory amputated. After a decade of ethnic Albanian repression against non-Albanian minorities, Kosovo politicians prove that Kosovo is being established as an ethnic Albanian state, which will not serve all its citizens but only one ethnic group.<br /><br />We are calling for the international rule of law by not recognizing the phony state of Kosovo as independent, because it is the only way to retain peace and stability in the region as well as in other disputed territories of the world.&quot;<br />

		<title>New French detention law incompatible with European rights treaty</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Judith Sutherland</strong> [researcher, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> Europe and Central Asia Division]: &quot;On February 7, 2008, the French parliament <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/france-anti-recidivism-bill-violates.php">enacted a law</a> allowing for the continued detention of offenders who have already completed their prison sentences, purportedly to prevent them re-offending.  The law empowers a commission of three judges to impose an additional one-year term in special detention centers if an offender is found to be dangerous and likely to reoffend by a multidisciplinary panel of experts.  The one-year detention period can be renewed indefinitely, and the measure may be applied to individuals convicted before the law entered into effect but who have not completed their sentences as of September 1, 2008.<br /><br />The measure is incompatible with France&#39;s obligations under the European Convention for Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  While the government argued that detention to prevent recidivism is an administrative security measure, deprivation of liberty of this type constitutes a criminal sanction.  The sanction is not being imposed as a result of a criminal conviction but purportedly to prevent some potential, unknown, unspecified, unforeseeable crime. The European Court of Human Rights has already held that detention powers cannot be used as &quot;a justification for the re-detention or continued detention of a person who has served a sentence after conviction of a specific criminal offence where there is a suspicion that he might commit a further similar offence.&quot;<br /><br />As Human Rights Watch has <a href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2008/01/28/france17895.htm">argued</a>, the preventive detention scheme under the new law violates the prohibition on arbitrary detention and fair trial standards at the heart of international human rights law, including the right to presumption of innocence and the right not to be punished twice for the same crime.  It also runs foul of the prohibition on subjecting anyone to a heavier penalty than the one that was applicable at the time the offense was committed (the principle of non-retroactivity of a criminal sanction).<br /><br />A broad spectrum of opinion opposed the law, including leading national human rights organizations such as the Human Rights League (Ligue des Droits de l&#39;Homme), the quasi-governmental National Consultative Commission on Human Rights, the national bar association (Conseil National des Barreaux), and Robert Badinter, a former justice minister.  In addition, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights Thomas Hammarberg has in the past expressed concern about the compatibility of this type of measure with the rule of law.  Opponents in Parliament have already asked the Constitutional Court to evaluate whether the text of the law is compatible with the French Constitution.&quot;<br />

		<title>Burma referendum indicates entrenchment of current regime&#039;s power, not democracy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="URL of your webpage"><strong><a href="http://ratchasima.net">Awzar Thi</a></strong></a> [member, <a href="http://www.ahrchk.net/index.php">Asian Human Rights Commission</a>]: &quot;The news that <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/myanmar-to-hold-constitutional.php">Burma&#39;s government will hold a constitutional plebiscite</a> this May, followed by general elections in 2010, has captured interest and caused some confusion abroad. <br /><br />That the army is intent upon cementing its power in any future government there is beyond question. It has never pretended otherwise. Nor is it necessary to read the long and tiresome accounts of the recently completed national convention to know that the country&#39;s as yet unwritten charter will have this express purpose.  <br /><br />So the argument caused by this latest announcement is not over whether or not the military intends to stay on top. Rather, it is about whether or not the upcoming poll might signify something more. <br /><br />For the regime&#39;s opponents and its many detractors, it does not; the referendum is just another ruse. For its backers and a few apologists, it does, if for no other reason than that any hint of reform should be encouraged. <br /><br />Although this divergence in views is apparently caused by the peculiarities of Burma and its dictators, it is as much a consequence of differences in opinion about the qualities of referenda, as well as about the nature of social and political change anywhere.<br /><br />Those persons who have already described the upcoming vote as a sham rightly point out that Burma remains home to thousands of political prisoners, and that the authorities will certainly stage-manage the electoral process. <br /><br />But the proposed use of a ballot to legitimatize the military leadership&#39;s grip on the country is neither uncommon nor fraudulent. <br /><br />Referendums are called not to reveal public opinion but to endorse official plans. Autocrats from Hitler to Marcos, Pinochet to Ne Win, have used them to good effect. Sometimes they backfire, as almost happened in Thailand recently. But in any event, it is wrong to associate a plebiscite with democracy.<br /><br />As for the persons who prefer to give this latest announcement the benefit of doubt, they stress that for anything to happen in Burma something must move somehow, and like it or not, movement depends upon army acquiescence of one type or another. <br /> <br />This is common sense. But to go from that point to imply that the army is a stimulus for change is nonsense. Twenty-first century dictators routinely entrench their authority while pretending the opposite. This has been one of the constants in Burma over the last decade or so, and elections, conventions, committees, subcommittees, roadmaps and pretended dialogue have all played their part; now a referendum. <br /><br />Change will not come to Burma from its generals, because it is not in their interests. It will not come from the formalities of referenda or constitutions, because these things can at most be the embodiments of change, not its originators. It will not, for that matter, come from the visits of United Nations representatives and self-appointed mediators, because it is neither within their means nor their understanding. <br /><br />Change is extraneous to all these. It will come to Burma in the spilling out of pent up demands for food, rights to speak freely and the basic human need to be treated with simple decency, as it did last September. How and when that happens next remains to be seen, but whatever the case, the vehicle for protest should not be mistaken as the cause of change, and the opponents of change must not be mistaken as its proponents.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Maureen Aung-Thwin</strong> [Director, Burma Project/Southeast Asia Initiative of the <a href="http://www.soros.org/">Open Society Institute</a>]: &quot;The sudden announcement by the Burmese military regime that it would soon hold a <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/myanmar-to-hold-constitutional.php">national referendum</a>, to be followed by elections in two years, is not a total surprise. The referendum scheduled for May is on a yet-to-be-written new constitution that has been drafted in secrecy since 1993, in a process controlled by the military.  Parliamentary elections would take place in 2010, twenty years after the last time the Burmese people went to the polls and voted out the military government.  <br /> <br />The Burmese military junta is a master at buying time. After fifteen years of choreographing a National Convention, attended by mostly non-elected, hand-picked participants who were confined to the premises and prohibited from open discussion of the issues, why did the regime suddenly set dates to wrap it all up? A likely reason is damage control after the universal condemnation of the regime&#39;s crackdown on peaceful monks and civilian demonstrators last September. Perhaps more important, by appearing to embrace political reform, the regime helps its major supporter, China, deflect potential negative attention before the beginning of the Beijing Olympics. <br /> <br />The current junta headed by Senior General Than Shwe has manipulated a constitutional process the regime hopes will eventually legitimize military rule in perpetuity.  Reportedly trained in psychological warfare, General Than Shwe is betting that the international community, in particular the United Nations Security Council, the European Union and particularly the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;who are all suffering from various degrees of &quot;Burma fatigue&quot;--  might, however reluctantly, grasp at any fa&ccedil;ade of change. <br /> <br />Genuine and lasting change, however, will come to Burma not because of outside pressure, although that is important, but when the wishes of its own citizens are freely acknowledged. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the detained leader of the main opposition party the National League for Democracy, once told the Burmese public that: &quot;A State Constitution is a contract between the people and the government of a nation. Only a constitution that is willingly accepted by the people will endure the test of time.&quot; [NLD press statement, Rangoon, November 22, 1995] <br /> <br />One hopes that the people of Burma can also endure the test of time to finally approve a document that genuinely reflects their wishes.&quot;<br />

That Act forbids the admission of evidence extracted by torture, although it permits evidence obtained by cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment if it was secured before December 30, 2005.  Thus, the administration would be forbidden from relying on evidence obtained by waterboarding, if waterboarding constitutes torture.  <br /><br />That&#39;s one reason Attorney General Michael Mukasey refuses to admit waterboarding is torture.  The other is that torture is considered a war crime under the U.S. War Crimes Act.  Mukasey would be calling Dick Cheney a war criminal if the former admitted waterboarding is torture.  Lawrence Wilkerson, Colin Powell&#39;s former chief of staff, has said on National Public Radio that the policies that led to the torture and abuse of prisoners emanated from the Vice President&#39;s office.<br /><br />The federal government is working overtime to try and clean up the legal mess made by the use of illegal interrogation methods.  In a thinly-veiled attempt to sanitize the Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo trials, the Department of Justice and the Pentagon instituted an extensive program to re-interview the prisoners who have undergone abusive interrogations, this time with &quot;clean teams.&quot;  For example, if a prisoner implicated one of the defendants during an interrogation using waterboarding, the government will now re-interrogate that prisoner without waterboarding and get the same information.  Then they will say the information was secured humanely.  This attempt to wipe the slate clean is a farce and a sham.<br /><br />In <em>Brady v. Maryland</em>, the US Supreme Court held that a prosecutor has a duty to give criminal defendants all evidence that might tend to exonerate them.  Yet the CIA admitted destroying several hundred hours of videotapes depicting interrogations of Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Ramin al-Nashiri, which likely included waterboarding.  The administration claims Abu Zubaydah led them to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, one of the defendants facing trial in the military commissions.  So the government has destroyed potentially exonerating evidence.  Moreover, the CIA&#39;s &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques&quot; are classified so they can be kept secret from the defendants, and CIA agents cannot be compelled to testify or produce evidence of torture.<br /><br />A report just released by Seton Hall Law Center for Policy and Research reveals more than 24,000 interrogations have been conducted at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo since 2002 and every interrogation was videotaped.  Many of these interrogations were abusive.  &quot;One Government document, for instance, reports detainee treatment so violent as to &#39;shake the camera in the interrogation room&#39; and &#39;cause severe internal injury,&#39;&quot; the report says.<br /><br />The Military Commissions Act contains other provisions that deny the defendants basic due process.  It allows a trial to continue in the absence of the accused, places the power to appoint judges in the hands of the Secretary of Defense, permits the introduction of hearsay and evidence obtained without a warrant, and denies the accused the right to see all of the evidence against him.  Defense attorneys are not allowed to meet their clients without governmental monitoring, and all of their notes and mail must be handed over to the military.<br /><br />Will the U.S. Supreme Court be able to rectify the situation of abusive interrogations if and when a case comes before it?  Not if Justice Antonin  Scalia has his way.  Once again, Scalia is acting as a loyal foot soldier in the President&#39;s &quot;war on terror.&quot;  In a BBC interview that aired this week, Scalia defended the use of torture to extract information from prisoners in some cases.  <br /><br />Scalia&#39;s remarks mean he has prejudged the issues in future cases in which the Constitution might dictate the suppression of evidence because of illegal police interrogation techniques, or the right to compensation of a person whose civil rights have been violated.  Justice Scalia should recuse himself from any case that presents these issues.  <br /><br />Bush is meanwhile threatening to veto a bill Congress passed that would forbid the CIA from subjecting prisoners to interrogation techniques banned by the U.S. Army Field Manual.  John McCain, the tortured POW who led the charge in 2005 against cruel treatment, has now hitched his wagon to Bush&#39;s star.  Presidential candidate McCain voted to allow the CIA to continue to ply its cruelty.<br /><br />When Bush vetoes the bill, Congress should stand firm for the rule of law and basic standards of human decency and override his veto.  Dick Cheney and other officials who participated in formulating the abusive interrogation policies should be investigated under the U.S. War Crimes Act.  And the Democratic-controlled Congress should repeal the Military Commissions Act that Bush rammed through the Republican-controlled Congress.<br /><br /><br /><em>Marjorie Cohn is a professor at Thomas Jefferson School of Law and president of the National Lawyers Guild.

		<title>Resist Torture or Acquiesce? A Question for Americans</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/students/faculty/BDavis/BDavis.htm">Benjamin Davis</a> of the University of Toledo College of Law says that CIA chief Michael Hayden&#39;s recent admission to Congress that three &quot;high value&quot; terror detainees were waterboarded by US interrogators begs the question of whether American citizens will acquiesce in this state lawlessness because the torture was done by our government to foreigners considered to be leaders of our enemy, or will resist torture by pressing for the prosecution of high-level American civilians for authorizing war crimes commited against the laws of the United States...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/benjamindavisnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>G</strong></font>eneral Michael Hayden publicly acknowledged this week that the United States waterboarded three Al-Qaeda persons in the 2002-3 period.  According to White House spokesman Tony Fratto, the then-US Attorney General and the President are presumed to have been the officials approving the use of such interrogation methods.  <br /><br />Notwithstanding the disappointing parsing previously engaged in by Attorney General Mukasey and others with regard to the point, let us be clear &#8212; waterboarding is torture in U.S. domestic law and as a matter of international law. There is no need for new law on this point as the current law is sufficient to prosecute waterboarding. There is no room for doubt except if one is trying to protect someone who did this torture.  Read Evan Wallach&#39;s <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/jtl/vol_45_2_files/45_2_wallach.html ">Drop by Drop: Forgetting the History of Water Torture in United States Courts</a>, 45:2 <em>Columbia Journal of Transnational Law</em> (2005).  Also, read Jordan Paust's <em>Beyond the Law</em> (Cambridge 2007) for legal analysis of the question of torture.<br /><br />At least three domestic and international war crimes were therefore committed in 2002-2003 under authorizations that went at least to the then Attorney General John Ashcroft and most likely to President of the United States George Bush.  These persons are therefore &quot;persons of interest&quot; in helping us determine whether they are in fact principals (including accessories before the fact) and accessories in federal crimes including conspiracy that I detail in some length in my forthcoming article &quot;Refluat Stercus&quot;.  In addition, all those who knew of these crimes and kept them from prosecution are similarly persons of interest with regard to being accessories after the fact with regard to the cover-up of these crimes.<br /><br />We thus have a group of potential defendants and we have an admission that acts that are torture were authorized and did occur.  The question for American citizens is therefore whether we will acquiesce in this state lawlessness because the torture was done by our government to some foreigners who are considered to be leaders of our enemy.  If we do that, then we are acquiescing in U.S. government torture.  On the other hand, if we seek that the perpetrators of government lawlessness be criminally prosecuted for what they did or authorized then we are resisting U.S. government torture.<br /><br />The defense that they will attempt to raise is something like the reasoning described by General Hayden that "&quot;We used it against these three high-value detainees because of the circumstances of the time. Very critical to those circumstances was the belief that additional catastrophic attacks against the homeland were imminent."  No ticking time-bombs (as if that was an excuse).  Just good old torture out of ignorance and fear.  Panic and improvisation in derogation from U.S. law and international law.<br /><br />I hold no brief for the persons tortured. If they are as bad as they are said to be, they can go to hell.  I do hold a brief for the United States.  And I would submit that the damage done by this government lawlessness to the American cause is devastating.  I believe this because we are considered torturers wherever we go.  We might as well wear "scarlet Ts" on our heads as we go through the world.  Nothing we say about what we are doing to protect ourselves has meaning because it is so tainted by the torture that we have had done in our names.<br /><br />I do not for a minute believe that waterboarding is the only form of torture that has been done by the United States government.  I do not for one minute believe that  torture was done to only a small group of people.  The information we hear from the different fronts in the War on Terrorism tells us the opposite.  We can just look at the experience at Abu Ghraib to know that torture has been done in many places as authorized by this government with bipartisan acquiescence of Congress.<br /><br />As you know, persons who have alleged being tortured by the United States have sought redress in many civil cases that have been dismissed for state secret grounds over the past seven years.  That effort to get dismissals continues.<br /><br />I would like Americans to now INSIST that this Attorney-General lead on this issue or get out of the way.  Attorney General Mukasey should criminally prosecute former and present Administration figures who are or were principals and accessories in this torture.  He should also look to members of Congress to determine whether some of those who were briefed on this can be charged notwithstanding Speech and Debate Clause concerns.<br /><br />In short, to reestablish American standing with Americans and with the rest of the world, the high-level civilians (including the lawyers) and military generals who put in place this monstrous policy need to be criminally prosecuted for what they put in place and condoned.  If American civil society sincerely believes that torture is un-American, then I ask my fellow citizens to do what is necessary to have these persons stand in a court of law and have their fate determined in fair criminal trials.  If we are not willing to prosecute our high-level civilians for what they had low-level persons do, then we are saying there are two laws at work &#8212; one for the powerful and one for the minions.  The minions do not deserve to be treated that way.  The powerful need to understand that the United States considers what they did was a crime against the United States that has caused us extreme prejudice.  Criminal prosecution is the means to extremely repudiate those high-level civilians and generals.  <em>Refluat Stercus</em>.<br /><br /> <br /><em>Benjamin Davis is a professor at the University of Toledo College of Law</em><br />

		<title>Pulling Rank: Reinforcing an Independent JAG Corps</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.nesl.edu/faculty/hansen.cfm">Victor Hansen</a> of New England School of Law says that new legislation increasing the required rank of Judge Advocates General in the US military to three-star general or admiral will help assure the independence of the legal advice provided by uniformed JAG lawyers and put a more effective check on the executive&#39;s assertion of power...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/hansennew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>L</strong></font>ast month Congress passed and the President signed the Fiscal Year 2008 Defense Authorization Act. The Act includes a significant provision which is an important step in assuring the independence of the legal advice provided by the uniformed lawyers in the Judge Advocate Generals Corps. The legislation requires that all future heads of the Army, Navy, and Air Force JAG Corps will hold the grade of Lieutenant General or Vice Admiral while serving in that position. This grade is commonly referred to as three-star general or admiral. <br /><br />While there have been legislative efforts in the past to increase the grade of the Judge Advocates General, this most recent change is significant for two reasons. First, three-star general or admiral is now the statutorily required grade that the Judge Advocates General must hold. Second, the 2008 Defense Authorization Act also increases the number of officers in each service who can serve in grades above a two-star general. Without this second change it was highly unlikely that the services would have been willing to allot one of the limited number of three-star positions to the Judge Advocate General, particularly in a time of war. These changes ensure that all future Judge Advocates General will serve at this higher rank.<br /><br />The need to increase the grade of the general officer serving in the position of the Judge Advocate General has been demonstrated time and again over the past seven years of the Bush Administration. In numerous instances since the administration announced its war on terror, the legal advice of the Judge Advocates General has stood in sharp contrast to the legal advice provided by Bush political appointees in the Department of Defense and the Office of Legal Counsel in the Department of Justice. On issues ranging from detainee interrogations, to the structure of military commissions, respect for the provisions of the Geneva Conventions, and the use of secret evidence, the Judge Advocates General have provided opinions that have proven both prescient and well reasoned and free of the political expediency seen in the advice by the Office of Legal Counsel and the Department of Defense General Counsel. <br /><br />Unfortunately, the advice of the Judge Advocates General was all too often and all too easily sidelined by the Bush Administration. The administration's disregard for the legal advice of the Judge Advocates General has been well documented. While there are numerous reasons why this administration has been able to ignore the advice of the uniformed lawyers in an area of the law where the JAGs enjoy a special competence, one of the primary reasons was that the Judge Advocates General held the rank of two-star general. A simple reality of life in the Pentagon is that the higher the rank of the officer, the more difficult it is to ignore him or her. By increasing the grade of the Judge Advocates General to the three-star level, Congress has made it more difficult for the advice of these uniformed officers to be sidelined and ignored by political appointees of any administration. This change also helps ensure that the Judge Advocates General are on a more equal footing with the military and civilian officials with whom they work and advise. <br /><br />This legislation serves as a significant check on the executive's assertion of power, and is precisely the type of counterweight envisioned under our constitutional structure. The Constitution expressly permits Congress to "provide for the common defense," U.S. Const., Art. I, &Acirc;&#167; 8, cl. 1; to raise and support armies, see id. &Acirc;&#167; 8, cl. 12; and to "make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces," see id. &Acirc;&#167; 8, cl. 14. Particularly in respect to the composition of the armed forces &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; which necessarily includes the JAG Corps &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; Congressional authority is clear. See, e.g., <em>Loving v. United States</em>, 517 U.S. 748 (1996) (Congress has primary authority to regulate military conduct).<br /><br />This action also stands in sharp contrast to repeated efforts by this administration to politicize the JAG Corps over the past several years. These efforts have included attempts to subordinate the Air Force Judge Advocate General to the Air Force General Counsel, attempts to virtually disband the Air Force JAG Corps, and the most recent efforts by the Department of Defense General Counsel to have a say in the officer promotions of all Judge Advocates. These attempts by the administration to politicize the JAG Corps, stem from an erroneous view of a unitary executive and an incorrect belief that the military is just another executive department. Such a view runs counter to both our history and our constitutional structure. Recent events have clearly demonstrated the genius of this constitutional structure as well as the vital necessity of a JAG Corps that remains fiercely independent and able to provide its best legal advice regardless of the personality or party in power. <br /><br /><br /><em>Victor Hansen was a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army JAG Corps and currently teaches at New England School of Law</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.nesl.edu/faculty/facProfile.cfm?facID=4">John Cerone</a> of New England School of Law, formerly a Human Rights Legal Advisor with the UN Mission in Kosovo, says that given the legal and moral complexity of the Kosovo situation, recent suggestions that Kosovo&#39;s unilateral declaration of independence from Serbia is unlawful but may nonetheless be &quot;justified&quot; are problematic...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/johncerone.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>F</strong></font>rom the moment the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia began in 1999, the independence of Kosovo seemed a highly likely eventuality. Since that time, developments on the ground have effectively precluded virtually any other possibility. As such, an independent Kosovo does seem inevitable. However, a number of commentators have recently opined that although the purported secession of Kosovo may well be unlawful, it is nonetheless just. Both of these propositions &#8212; that it was not in conformity with international law and that it was &quot;justified&quot; &#8212; are open to question. <br /><br />International law has very little to say about the legality of secession. Traditionally, the international community simply sits back and waits to see if the secession is effective. This neutrality derives largely from the principle of non-intervention &#8212; that states must generally refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of other states. To posit that Kosovo's secession is not in conformity with international law implies that there is some international legal procedure for secession that was not observed. No such procedure exists. While it may be argued that the Security Council's pronouncements have anticipated a "political settlement" on the future status of Kosovo, there is no indication as to what this settlement should entail or whose consent would be required. <br /><br />While it would be difficult to characterize the declaration of independence as unlawful, recognition of Kosovo's independence by other states is a separate legal question. Here the question of conformity with international law is a bit murkier. As with secession, international law has little to say about the legality of other states' recognition of newly independent states. Recognition of newly independent states is generally lawful, so long as that new state has effectively established its independence in fact. The only exception to this rule would be in specific cases where the Security Council has created an obligation not to recognize a particular state (e.g., as happened in the case of Southern Rhodesia). Whether Kosovan authorities have in fact established effective control over the territory is a matter of some debate, but it is not clear either way.<br /><br />Even less clear is the question of whether Kosovo's independence is justified. Those claiming that it is justified typically ground their position in a black-and-white view of the Kosovo conflict that tends to obscure a much more complex reality.<br /><br />I have to admit that, upon my arrival in Kosovo in the summer of 1999, I had very much shared this simplistic view of the situation. Indeed, my work there on war crimes documentation was largely driven by a desire to secure accountability for the seemingly steady stream of international crimes being broadcast by the international media. <br /><br />I was initially stationed in western Kosovo, where I, along with throngs of other international aid workers, was welcomed as a benefactor and friend of the Albanians; that is, until I questioned the acceptability of blowing up the town's Serbian Orthodox Church. Any suggestion that Kosovo Serbs should benefit from the protection of human rights law was met with open hostility.<br /><br />I later moved north to Mitrovica, the ethnically divided city bisected by the River Ibar, with Kosovo Serbs living to the north and Kosovo Albanians living to the south. Working regularly with individuals from all ethnic groups, I was one of very few people who crossed the Ibar on a daily basis. The few Kosovo Albanians who remained in the north lived in a state of continuous insecurity. Kosovo Serbs fared less well in the south. Shortly before I arrived in Mitrovica, a Kosovo Serb was discovered south of the Ibar, and was consequently beaten to death by an angry mob. <br /><br />The work of documenting past abuses was quickly supplemented by the need to respond to the spike in crimes against ethnic minorities, including Kosovo Serbs. Over the course of the following 18 months, the killing and displacement of Kosovo Serbs, and other ethnic minorities, continued unabated, notwithstanding the presence of tens of thousands of NATO soldiers. <br /><br />Further reflection was prompted once the percentage of the Kosovo Serb population that had been murdered or displaced surpassed the percentage of the Kosovo Albanian population that had been killed or displaced in the years leading up to the NATO intervention. While only a tiny percentage of Kosovo Albanians were directly responsible for the killings, the perpetrators were protected by the majority of the population who saw these crimes as unfortunate, but understandable. Even when these perpetrators killed an elderly Serb woman in Pristina &#8212; a woman who could have played no role in the conflict, and who had never left her apartment for fear of attack -- her murder was portrayed as forgivable in light of what 'her people' had done.<br /><br />To the extent that prior abuses could serve as a "justification" for Kosovo to secede from Serbia, it could equally serve as a justification for the northern part of Kosovo, populated mainly by Kosovo Serbs, to secede from the rest of Kosovo.<br /><br />Of greater concern, however, is that the portrayal of Kosovo's secession as justified typically rests on a conception of independence as a much deserved reward for the Albanians and fitting punishment for the Serbs. This view of the situation makes it far too easy to disregard the plight of minority groups in Kosovo and feeds into the destructive mentality of collective responsibility. <br /><br />If we as outsiders cannot distinguish between individual and collective responsibility, how can we expect otherwise from those directly involved?<br /><br /><br /><em>John Cerone is Associate Professor of Law &amp; Director of the Center for International Law &amp; Policy at the New England School of Law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.wmitchell.edu/academics/faculty/erlinder.asp">Peter Erlinder</a> of William Mitchell College of Law, lead defense counsel for former Major Aloys Ntabakuze in the Military 1 Trial at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and president of the UN-ICTR Defense Lawyers Association, says that recently issued French and Spanish international war crimes warrants and new evidence at the UN Rwanda Tribunal have exposed current Rwandan President Paul Kagame as the man primarily responsible for the 1994 "Rwanda Genocide" and the beneficiary of a decades-long US-sponsored "cover-up" of Pentagon complicity in the massacres committed by his regime...<br /><br /><em>Editor&#39;s Note: a <a href="#8151153342898279352">response</a> by Brian Atwood, a former USAID Administrator during the Clinton Administration, follows this piece.</em><br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/petererlinder.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>s George Bush continues his much ballyhooed African safari, he has heaped praise on Rwandan President Kagame as a "model for Africa," and mourned with Kagame the victims of the "Rwanda Genocide".  But recently issued French and Spanish international "war-crimes" warrants, and new evidence at the UN Rwanda Tribunal, have exposed Kagame as the war criminal who actually touched off the 1994 "Rwanda Genocide" by assassinating the previous President and who is benefiting from a decades-long U.S.-sponsored "cover-up" of Pentagon complicity in massacres committed by Kagame's regime, which even Britain's <em>Economist</em> has called "the most repressive in Africa." [1]<br /><br /><strong>Multiple "War Crimes" Warrants Issued for Rwanda's Leaders</strong><br /><br />            Just last week, a Spanish judge issued 40 international warrants for current and former members of Kagame's government, including senior staff at Rwanda's Washington Embassy. Judge Abreau's warrants charge Kagame's clique with war crimes and crimes against humanity that may even fit the definition of "genocide."  But these are not the only international arrest warrants issued for Rwanda's current leaders.  <br /><br />French Judge Bruguiere (famous for indicting "The Jackal") has also issued international warrants against nearly a dozen members of Kagame's inner circle.  Bruguiere also met with Kofi Annan in late 2006 to personally urge the U.N. Rwanda Tribunal to prosecute Kagame for the assassination of Juvenal Habyarimana, the war crime that re-ignited the four-year Rwanda War and the massive civilian killings in the war's final 90-days. <br /><br />            Could it be that no-one in the Bush Administration was aware of these pending charges against their Rwandan hosts - or is it that they just don't care? <br /><br />             In either case, the French and Spanish international arrest warrants have pierced the wall of U.S./UK/Rwandan propaganda about who bears primary responsibility for the massive tragedy that unfolded in Rwanda - but  the "official story" has  actually been unraveling for some time.<br /><br /><strong>Chief UN Prosecutor Del Ponte in 2003: "Rwanda's Leaders Guilty of War Crimes"</strong> <br /><br />            In the summer of 2003, Swiss Judge Carla Del Ponte, then Chief Prosecutor for both the Yugoslavia and Rwanda tribunals, publicly announced that she would soon begin the prosecution of members of Kagame's government for the same kinds of crimes now charged in the French and Spanish warrants.  But nearly five years later, not one case has been filed against one member of Kagame's government, nor against Kagame himself, despite the direct request of Judge Bruguiere.  <br /><br />            The Del Ponte-announced prosecutions did not go forward because she was replaced at the ICTR within 90 days of her announcement by Abubacar Jallow, a US/UK-approved Prosecutor who pledged not to prosecute any on Kagame's side, no matter what the Del Ponte and the European judges' findings!  Prosecutor Del Ponte's long-time press-aide, Florence Hartmann, published a book in Paris in September 2007 that explains exactly how and why Del Ponte was replaced. <br /><br />            According to the Hartmann book, that Del Ponte has not repudicated, Del Ponte was called to Washington just after her 2003 announcement and threatened with removal from office by Bush "war crimes ambassador" Pierre Prosper because of a long-standing political <em>quid pro quo</em> between Washington and the Kagame regime that is spelled out in detail in the book. (Ironically, Prosper was a former ICTR prosecutor under Del Ponte, and must have had access to the same information motivated her decision to prosecute the U.S. ally).  When she refused to ignore her UN-mandate, to prosecute all crimes committed during the 1994 Rwanda War, she was sacked by the U.S. and U.K.[2] <br /><br /><strong>ICTR Chief Investigator in 1997: "Rwanda's Kagame Assassinated Previous President"</strong><br /><br />But this is not the first time that crimes of Kagame have been "covered-up" at the ICTR.  According to sworn affidavits, placed in the ICTR record in early 2006, well respected ICTR Lead Investigative Prosecutor Michael Hourigan, an Australian QC,  recommended that Kagame himself, be prosecuted for the assassination of Habyarimana in 1997!  But then-Chief UN Prosecutor, Louise Arbour of Canada, ordered him to drop the Kagame investigation; to forget it ever happened; and, to burn his notes!  Hourigan resigned rather than comply and copies of his original notes are now part of the ICTR public record for all to see. [3] <br /><br /><strong>The "Rwanda Genocide" Cover-up on Clinton's Watch</strong><br /><br />The Hourigan affidavit makes clear that the "Rwanda Genocide&quot; cover-up has been going on for at least a decade, but the reasons for the cover-up did not become clear until late 2007, when a senior Clinton administration diplomat, Brian Atwood, was confronted with UN documents describing a 1994 "cover-up" meeting with the Rwandan Foreign Minister in Kigali and the UN's Kofi Annan. According to the UN documents, U.S.-sponsored human rights reports by investigator Robert Gersony had documented massive military-style executions of civilians by Kagame's troops, during and after the final 90 days of the four-year Rwanda War.[4]<br /><br />            The former Rwandan Foreign Minister at the meeting, Jean Marie Ndagiyimana, testified at the ICTR that, rather than participate in the proposed "cover-up," he resigned and went into exile, where he remains today. His ICTR testimony confirmed that Clinton's USAID Chief for Africa, Brian Atwood, and the chief of the UN Department of Peace Keeping Operations Kofi Annan, were both in his office in late October 1994 urging him to assist in the "cover-up" the war crimes committed by Kagame's forces. [5]<br /><br /><strong>The "Inconvenient Truth" Behind  the Cover-up:  Pentagon Complicity in the 1994 Rwanda War</strong> <br /><br />            The damning "Gersony Report" included first-hand evidence of tens of thousands of civilians being massacred by Kagame's troops in eastern Rwanda, later confirmed by similar reports by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International.  The U.N. document (also in the ICTR record) says that Annan told the Foreign Minister that public knowledge of the Report would be "embarrassing to the UN" and the former U.S. Clinton administration diplomat, Brian Atwood, not only confirmed he was at the meeting, but explained that he had engaged Gersony, and that Gersony's findings of war-crimes being committed by Kagame were "&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;an inconvenient truth"  for both the United States and the UN.<br /><br />According to Atwood, unknown to the State Department, "the Pentagon had been supporting Kagame since before the 1990 invasion, when he was the head of Military Intelligence for the Museveni gov
ernment of Uganda." The "Gersony Report" tied the Pentagon to the crimes of Kagame's invading, Pentagon-trained and funded forces.  More UN documents in the ICTR record reveal that the State Department was negotiating for a peaceful settlement of the war at the same time the Pentagon was supporting Kagame's invasion.  The Clinton Administration sought to enlist Atwood and Kofi Annan in keeping evidence of Kagame's crimes from ever seeing the light of day, to prevent Pentagon involvement in the "Rwandan Genocide" from ever coming to light.[6] <br /><br />The existence of a separate Pentagon foreign policy on Rwanda also tallies with the ICTR testimony of former Ambassador Robert Flaten, who testified that he seriously doubted that Habyarimana's supporters planned to kill civilians on a massive scale because the CIA and other intelligence agencies would have reported it when he was in Rwanda from 1990 to late 93.[7]  He said that his requests for Pentagon-DIA spy satellite photographs showing the status of the war in the countryside were turned down because of "clouds over Rwanda," during his entire 3-plus years in Rwanda. [8]   <br /><br /> Former Amb. Flaten also noted the obvious: Uganda's military assistance for the 1990 Kagame invasion coincided with increased Ugandan military funding by the U.S./U.K.  Most importantly, Flaten also testified that he personally warned Kagame that "he (Kagame) would be responsible for massacres like just happened in Burundi, if Kagame broke the cease-fire and re-started that war&quot;. Now the evidence in the ICTR record, shows Kagame did exactly that!   <br /><br />In short, the evidence that is now in the public record shows that during the 1994 Rwanda Genocide, the Pentagon could have stopped the carnage with a phone call, and the State Department apparently did not know enough about the Pentagon's close ties to Kagame to ask them to do so, at least until USAID's Atwood was informed of Pentagon panicked reaction to the "Gersony Report," in the summer of 1994.<br /><br />Other de-classified State Department documents show that it was the invading Kagame forces that were the aggressors, and were blocking the State Departments efforts to implement the Arusha Accords, peace agreement.[9]  The UN's General Dallaire has testified that Kagame would not agree to a ceasefire to use troops to stop the massacres because "he was winning the war."[10]  And, now we know what Dallaire may not have known, until later&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;Kagame was winning with the Pentagon's help.<br /><br /><strong>The Great "Rwanda Genocide" Cover-up  Continues under Bush</strong><br /><br />The "Rwanda Genocide" cover-up of Pentagon complicity in Kagame's crimes is almost complete, with the U.S. cutting ICTR funding to shut it down by the end of 2008.  Carla Del Ponte's replacement, Abubacar Jallow, will be conveniently unable to carry out the prosecutions that Del Ponte urged in 2003, or those initiated by Judge Bruguiere in 2006, or Judge Abreau, just last week. <br /><br />           However, the international warrants are still in effect, and the Del Ponte book and Hourigan's affidavit have begun to unravel the whole sordid manipulation, but unless the "Rwanda Genocide" cover-up makes it onto &quot;page one&quot; in Europe and North America, it may be too late for the ICTR detainees who are being held responsible for the crimes of the Kagame regime - a bit like the UN holding the Japanese responsible for Hiroshima and the Germans for the fire-bombing of Dresden.<br /><br />            With U.S. and U.K. support, Kagame's government is actively campaigning to have all ICTR matters transferred to Rwanda and has issued 40,000 warrants for Kagame's  Hutu and Tutsi opponents in the worldwide Rwandan diaspora (a movement that includes such as figures Paul Rusesabagina, the real hero of <em>Hotel Rwanda</em>).   <br /><br /><strong>Correcting the Historical Record and Ending the Cover-up</strong><br /><br />            But I have to disclose my own bias. Under the laws of Rwanda, I too am a criminal "negationist" for writing this essay, and President Kagame has personally denounced me as a "genocidaire" for my work as an ICTR defense lawyer.  My former investigator is seeking asylum in Europe and the ICTR Prosecutor who replaced Carla Del Ponte is now prosecuting another defense investigator for asking too many questions in Rwanda while denouncing Judge Bruguiere's request for the UN to prosecute Kagame and Spanish Judge Abreau as well. <br /><br />            An ICTR defense lawyer like me has to hope that despite all that is now known about the manipulations of the ICTR by the U.S. and U.K. for their own political purposes, the ICTR judges will not be influenced by the sacking of Del Ponte and that they will carefully evaluate the evidence in my client's case. But it it is hard to be too optimistic. <br /><br />            At least my conscience is clear, now that the great "Rwanda Genocide" cover-up has been exposed.  But I wonder if the judges, prosecutors, other UN-ICTR officials (who now know about the manipulation of their best efforts) will be able to say the same, if they allow the cover-up to continue?  <br /><br />During the week's festivities in Rwanda, Presidents Bush and Kagame are sure to find much in common, as would Tony Blair, who has recently signed-on as an "unpaid" advisor to Kagame.  All three stand accused of war crimes, and are mutually benefiting from the US/UK/Rwandan "cover-up" of their own complicity in the "Rwandan Genocide" tragedy that should put all three in the dock at the ICTR.<br /><br /><font SIZE=2 style='font-size: 8pt'>(c) 2008 Peter Erlinder.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php">Ali Khan</a> of Washburn University School of Law says that Pakistan&#39;s newly-elected Parliament is authorized to pass an Emergency Bill to arrest Pervez Musharraf, charge him with treason, and prosecute him under Article 6(1) of the Constitution in his capacity as a usurper, not a lawful president subject to potential impeachment...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/alikhan.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>P</strong></font>ervez Musharraf, who usurped power in Pakistan on November 3, 2007 by virtue of his Proclamation of Emergency, refuses to relinquish the office of the President, an office he unlawfully occupies against the will of the people and contrary to the Constitution of Pakistan. This essay argues that if Musharraf does not voluntarily vacate the Presidency, Pakistan&#39;s newly-elected Parliament is authorized to pass an Emergency Bill to capture him, charge him with treason, and prosecute him under Article 6(1) of the Constitution, under which: &quot;Any person who abrogates or attempts or conspires to abrogate, subverts or attempts or conspires to subvert the Constitution by use of force or show of force or by other unconstitutional means shall be guilty of high treason.&quot; <br /><br />Arresting Pervez Musharraf will establish the sovereignty of the Parliament, fulfill the demands of justice, and restore the rule of law for which the judiciary and lawyers of Pakistan have paid a heavy price. Any compromise with Musharraf that keeps him in office might please foreign constituencies. But it will be lethal for democracy and constitutionality in Pakistan. Any such compromise will encourage future military coups. The time has come for Pakistan to show to the world that a fearless democracy can remove usurpers in a strong but lawful manner. <br /> <br /><strong>Incarceration, not Impeachment</strong><br /><br />Article 47 of the Constitution of Pakistan furnishes a procedure to impeach the President. The President is impeached if he violates the Constitution or engages in gross misconduct. The National Parliament comprised of the Senate and the Assembly investigates the charges. During the investigation, the President has the right to appear before the joint sitting of the two Houses. If, after investigation of the charges, a two-thirds majority of the Parliament passes an impeachment resolution, &quot;the President shall cease to hold office immediately on the passing of the resolution.&quot;<br /><br />This impeachment procedure, however, presumes that the President has been duly elected according to the constitutional framework. Article 47 cannot be invoked to impeach any person who claims to be the President. Any such broad reading of Article 47 collapses the distinction between lawfully elected President and usurper who occupies Presidency through constitutional subversion. Accordingly, any impeachment proceedings against Musharraf will unwittingly concede that he lawfully holds the Presidency. Even if the impeachment proceedings succeed and Musharraf leaves office, the Article 47 procedure will have been misapplied. <br /><br />Usurpers are arrested and removed. They are not investigated and impeached. Pakistan&#39;s newly elected Parliament must not ignore this important constitutional distinction. <br /> <br /><strong>Usurper, not President</strong><br /><br />It might be argued that Musharraf is indeed the President of Pakistan since the outgoing electoral college of National and Provincial Parliaments elected him to the office of the President on October 6, 2007. This argument is without merit.<br /><br />Recall that in October, 2007 the Pakistan Supreme Court had allowed the holding of the Presidential election. The Court ordered, however, that results of the election must not be released until the Court has first considered on merit the challenges to Musharraf&#39;s candidacy for the office of the President. At the time, Musharraf was simultaneously holding two offices, one that of the President and the other that of the Army Chief. A panel of the Supreme Court heard the case for several weeks. Musharraf&#39;s lawyers submitted to the Court&#39;s jurisdiction and forcefully argued that Musharraf was qualified to contest the Presidential election.<br /><br />On November 3, a day or two before the Court was to render its verdict, Musharraf engaged in preemptive self-defense and proclaimed emergency.  Under the Proclamation of Emergency, thirteen judges of the Supreme Court were unlawfully fired and arrested. Unconstitutionally, a brand new Supreme Court packed with pro-Musharraf judges, was reconstituted. Musharraf took all these extra-constitutional measures to avert a possible negative Court verdict that would have disqualified him and nullified the October 6 election. <br /><br />On November 3, Musharraf himself relinquished the office of the President and became the Army Chief.  Recall that Musharraf suspended the Constitution in his capacity as the Army Chief, not President. Furthermore, by subverting the Constitution and unlawfully preempting the Supreme Court verdict, Musharraf ceased to be the lawful President.  Even after the restoration of the Constitution and despite a favorable decision from a rubber stamp Supreme Court, Musharraf's occupancy of the office of the President continues to be unlawful and illegitimate.  By turning the Constitution off and on at will, Musharraf cannot profit from his wrongs.  From November 3 onwards, Musharraf is no longer the President but an unlawful usurper and trespasser of the office of the President. <br /><br />Removal by incarceration and not impeachment is the proper constitutional treatment for usurpers.<br /> <br /><br /><em>Ali Khan grew up in Pakistan and is a law graduate of Punjab University, Lahore.

The U.S. and most European states will recognize Kosovo within days, but Russia and Serbia are firmly opposed; the Security Council is meeting in emergency session. Both sides are marshaling arguments about Kosovo&#39;s status and the implications of independence in the Balkans and beyond. How much do these arguments matter? International law's contribution to the Kosovo crisis has been ambiguous at best; Kosovo's legacy for international law may prove more explosive. Here are some of the most unsettled, and unsettling, issues: <br /><br /><strong>Russia's Right...?</strong><br /><br /><u>Should Kosovo be recognized as an independent state</u>? There are compelling arguments on both sides. The commitments the U.S., European States and Russia made in the Helsinki Final Act, for example, suggest that Serbia&#39;s territorial integrity must be respected, as does Security Council Resolution 1244, which created the international protectorate over Kosovo and laid the legal groundwork for the final status process. Russia further claims that 1244 only authorized a UN administration &#8212; and therefore the planned handover to an EU supervisory mission is illegal &#8212; and that the since the resolution is still in force and has not been superseded by any other Security Council action, the Kosovo Assembly's action is in violation of 1244. <br /><br />But, counter Western governments, the campaign of ethnic cleansing that Serbia conducted against Kosovo&#39;s Albanians in 1999, and the UN protectorate established under 1244, confirm that Serbia has lost any legitimate right to retain sovereignty. Anyway, 1244 doesn't say anything about the outcome of the final status process, so independence is not precluded. The Security Council is supposed to decide the province&#39;s status, but it is clearly deadlocked &#8212; and that provides a further argument for Western recognition: UN paralysis compels outside action. Finally, the Declaration expressly invites the EU mission &#8212; though that hardly persuades unless the Declaration is valid.<br /><br />Who's right? Security Council resolution 1244 doesn't actually say anything about creating a new state, and prudential interpretative principles as well as the general purposes of the UN Charter would probably counsel against reading in an extraordinary right to alter the borders of another state. Western diplomats rather lamely note that 1244 only mentions territorial integrity in the non-operative preamble &#8212; but the preamble's reference is to the Helsinki Final Charter, whose strong protections for territorial integrity apply whether they are mentioned or not. And the first article of the operative text "[d]ecides that a political solution to the Kosovo crisis shall be based on the general principles in annex 1 and. . .annex 2" &#8212; and in those annexes, Yugoslavia's (read Serbia's) territorial integrity is mentioned.<br /><br />Besides, so what if 1244 doesn't textually exclude the possibility of independence? If partition prohibited by the Charter and contrary to its purposes, it's ultra vires for the Security Council in any event. You can't bootstrap in an unavailable power to partition just by failing to mention the legal and legitimate outcomes with sufficient specificity. Still Western powers have to bootstrap onto 1244 for a simple reason &#8212; they know they can't get another, clearer resolution through the Security Council.<br /><br />Of course, who really cares about such lawyering? Russia may be right, but it's wrong. The argument that really drives Western support for the Kosovars' cause &#8212; that independence is a necessary response to the ethnic cleansing suffered by Albanians, who cannot trust Belgrade ever again &#8212; is empirically persuasive and morally powerful. Curiously, though, it finds little traction in international law. <br /><br />There is language &#8212; in the General Assembly's Declaration on Friendly Relations, Resolution 2625(XXV), for example &#8212; suggesting that territorial integrity only protects states "possessed of a government representing the whole people belonging to the territory without distinction as to race, creed or colour" &#8212; something Serbia patently was not throughout the 1990s. More recently, the 'responsibility to protect' has gained considerable traction. But a right to intervene and a right to partition are not identical. These claims are highly general, and have never been applied to forcibly partition a country against its will. No one has established a clear threshold test for such an action. (The Secretary General convened a working group in 2007 to take the "inevitable next step" and give the responsibility to protect "practical meaning," which rather suggests it doesn't have it yet.)<br /><br />The US and majority European view (not, pointedly, the EU's, since several EU states won't be recognizing Kosovo) is a replay, in a sense, of the justifications surrounding NATO's original intervention in Kosovo: that did not have the Security Council's sanction either, and NATO leaders at the time were mostly silently about the legal basis. Their strategy was to declare the moral necessity of what they were doing, and let it blow over. A prominent commission of scholars termed the Kosovo war 'illegal but legitimate,' and that same sensibility informs Western approaches to Kosovo's independence now: The case is so compelling, why worry about the technicalities, especially when Russia is playing the spoiler? Look for arguments, once again, about how Russia's exercise of its veto proves the need for reform at the UN. (Meanwhile, look for the US to exercise its veto when Russia demands UN action to quash Kosovo's declaration.) And of course, the legal niceties notwithstanding, if Western recognition sticks and Kosovo maintains its independence, then, over time, that fact alone will constitute an important data point proving that the right to secede following ethnic cleansing &#8212; and the responsibility to protect &#8212; will have become established. <br /><br /><strong>...Russia Might</strong><br /><br /><u>Of course, formal legal arguments won't decide Kosovo&#39;s future</u> &#8212; they are, at most, tools in the hands of the contending parties &#8212; but the underlying ideas about state sovereignty, territorial integrity, fear of fragmentation, commitment to supranational norms do play an important role in the debate. So, what kind of legal precedent does independence for Kosovo create in international law &#8212; or at least what predictable effect is it likely to have?<br /><br />Russia has played a skillful hand in deflecting momentum toward independence. A little more than a year ago, when the UN&#39;s envoy, Martti Ahtisaari, announced his plan for the province, most Western experts assumed Kosovo would be independent by the middle of 2007. But Russia insisted on a negotiated solution and its consistent and effective reminders about the threat to the norm of territorial integrity that independence would pose implicitly linked Kosovo&#39;s independence to the outcome of other conflicts in which it has an interest. The states within Europe that are opposed to Kosovo&#39;s independence, like Cyprus and Spain, have legitimate c
oncerns about their own territorial integrity. <br /><br />Citing the province&#39;s unique history of suffering and its recent UN-sanctioned international supervision, the United States insists that Kosovo isn&#39;t a precedent. But what does that mean? It&#39;s not as if there is a clear answer in international law about this that everyone agrees upon; the answer is going to come out of an ugly and protracted political contest, and will be read backwards from subsequent events.<br /><br />Independence for Kosovo means the partition of Serbia, and it&#39;s not possible to simply declare that it doesn&#39;t have any effect on other situations. It&#39;s a precedent if people think it is, and Vladimir Putin, for one, is determined to exploit Kosovo for other conflicts in the former Soviet sphere &#8212; there is a real chance Russia will move to bolster its support for breakaway regions in Georgia, for example. Certainly, the Serbs of Bosnia have suggested that if Kosovo can separate from Serbia, they can separate too. Are these cases connected? Legally no, but politically, of course they are. <br /><br />Possibly the best proof that Kosovo is a precedent is that its Declaration of Independence insists it's not. Kosovo's Assembly actually "Observ[es] that Kosovo is a special case arising from Yugoslavia&#39;s non-consensual breakup and is not a precedent for any other situation." That's a far cry from the self-evident universalism of the American Declaration of Independence or the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen &#8212; though one senses the hand of diplomats from these very countries vetting drafts of Kosovo's declaration to ensure this level of humility.<br /><br />But inserting a clumsily obvious phrase in someone else's founding document isn't going to determine this event's meaning. The U.S. wants independence for Kosovo but it doesn&#39;t want to pay the price in precedent and politics which independence implies. The U.S. can unilaterally recognize Kosovo, but it can&#39;t control those other effects, and Russia&#39;s actions. These concerns are a large part of the reason that Europe and the U.S. &#8212; despite favoring Kosovo&#39;s independence &#8212; were for so long unwilling to press ahead in the face of Russian opposition, hoping instead that the problem could be put off.<br /><br /><strong>Because the Serbs Can...</strong><br /><br />The problems are still there. Whatever its legal or moral justifications, independence will not actually change much in the short term, and it will likely make one thing worse: <u>Kosovo's Serb minority is deeply alienated</u> from the Albanian majority, and in the north, where Serbs predominate, they are unwilling to accept the new state's authority. The Ahtisaari Plan contains generous proposals to protect Serbs cultural and political rights, and Kosovo's Assembly has pledged to implement the Plan in full. But there's no indication that northern Serbs &#8212; who maintain close ties to Belgrade, which subsidizes the Serb presence in Kosovo &#8212; will agree to integrate. From their point of view, they have no reason.<br /><br />One way to solve the problem of the north would be to not try to solve it &#8212; instead, simply let that area remain part of Serbia, and limit the territory of the new state to those areas populated by Albanians who have a legitimate claim to international intervention to protect them from a regime that has proven unacceptably dangerous to them. Indeed, if we accept that the responsibility to protect justifies intervening, we still have to ask, 'to protect whom?' Our responsibility isn't to a territory, but to the people Belgrade put at risk. That responsibility may justify recognizing an independent state for Albanians, but does it justify removing parts of Serbia whose population neither wants nor needs our protection?<br /><br />The potential benefits of a flexible territory approach &#8212; grounded in the triple principles of respecting sovereignty where possible, promoting democratic choice, and protecting individuals from repression &#8212; are obvious: greater scope for a negotiated solution, simplification of Kosovo's demography, which in turn makes its governance less fragile; and of course, for the Serbs in the north themselves, the opportunity to remain citizens of their preferred state without moving. Nothing in 1244 would bar such a solution, yet any border adjustment has been categorically excluded by the Contact Group responsible for final status negotiations since the outset. It is no exaggeration to say that the one plausible path to compromise has never been on the table &#8212; which is as good a proof as any that ideas can have tremendous power in politics.<br /><br /><strong>Another, Older Way</strong><br /><br />Admitting a solution for the northern Serbs on the basis of their political desires also suggests that <u>there is another way to justify Albanians' independence</u> &#8212; one not recognized by current law, but with strong historical roots and strong moral intuitions supporting it: a return to self-determination. Kosovo's Albanians ought to have their independence not because they were oppressed or subjected to ethnic cleansing, nor because the great powers allow it, but by virtue of their separate identity and overwhelming majority on the territory &#8212; by virtue of their existence as a people that desires to determine its own destiny. Looking back, surely we could all agree that it would have been better to recognize the independence of Kosovo's Albanians when the first called for it in the early 1990s, <u>before</u> the exterminations and the expulsions; surely no people should have to suffer as they did before claiming what so many have as a right. Now that would be a precedent worth recognizing.<br /><br /><br /><em>Timothy William Waters helped prepare the indictment of Slobodan Milosevic.

Most people in the West noted the event, vaguely recalled the 1998-99 Kosovo War and NATO bombing campaign, and smiled to themselves &quot;good for them&quot; as they went about their business.  European Union member states, especially Britain and Germany, are preparing to recognize Kosovo&#39;s independence, as will the United States shortly thereafter.  Russia and Serbia, however, are preparing a legal argument to the contrary.<br /> <br />Both countries want a hearing before the United Nations Security Council to make their case that Kosovo&#39;s independence move is a breach of international law.  Until February 17, 2008, Kosovo was universally recoginized as an internal province of Serbia.  Even the West reiterated this recognition as it let fly thousands of NATO sorties that eventually drove Serb troops back to their barracks after they had been unleashed by Slobodan Milosevic to carry out a dreadful ethnic cleansing campaign which drove 800,000 non-Serb people from their homes.  Indeed, President Clinton noted that not only was Kosovo part of Serbia, but that he and NATO were acting militarily without approval from the Security Council on the basis of humanitarian intervention.  Russia, of course, was prepared to veto any U.N. action protecting Kosovo from the clutches of their Serb cousins; thus, acting through the Security Council was not an option.<br /> <br />Arguments of illegality were also raised from Moscow at that time.  Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter forbids the use of military force without Security Council authorization if a state is not acting in self-defense.  But after the Cold War, international humanitarian missions had come to be recognized as an acceptable by-pass to Security Council authorization for military intervention.  Indeed, even  then-Secretary General Kofi Annan acknowledged that to be the case.  Technically the Russians were correct; morally, the world saw the situation differently.  Milosevic and his troops were sent packing and the Russians quieted down.  The United Nations blessed the successful operation retroactively, and a mixture of U.N., E.U. and NATO personnel occupied Kosovo as a protectorate for the next decade.<br /> <br />In the meantime, another small state, East Timor, slipped its cruel bonds and broke free of Indonesia.  Protected by Australian troops, the East Timorese quickly set about setting up their government, rebuilding their infrastructure and aligning themselves to compete economically as other successful microstates in Asia and Europe have done.  Kosovo, with a population of two million, certainly fits into the microstate category - but not more so that its newly independent neighbor to the West, Montenegro, which has eked out an economic niche in natural resource extraction and processing, shipping and tourism.<br /> <br />Serbia never agreed to ceding Kosovo, which was not a term of the 1999 cease-fire.  Indeed, Serbs still regard Kosovo as the medieval birthplace of the Serb nation and continue to celebrate their &quot;glorious defeat&quot; by the Turks in the 1389 Battle of Kosovo (a romanticized Serb version of the fateful &quot;Charge of the Light Brigade&quot;).  Yet by the time of Milosevic&#39;s ethnic cleansing campaign, 95% of Kosovo was populated not by Eastern Orthodox Serbs, but by Muslim ethnic Albanians.  The 10,000 Kosovars who were killed during the Kosovo War were victims of Serb megalomania driven by Milosevic himself to recapture a time and place that history had long since passed.<br /> <br />Without such agreement, Russia contends, Kosovo cannot leave.  Vladimir Putin has described Kosovo&#39;s secession as &quot;immoral and illegal.&quot;  It is unlikely that the Security Council will accept the Russian argument, which would be blocked by the U.S., Britain and France.  And although neither the Russians nor Serbs will act militarily to reverse the secession, Russia can effectively block Kosovo&#39;s ascension to the United Nations as an independent state.  Once again, Moscow may find itself technically correct, but on the wrong side of both history and humanity.<br /> <br />Former Russian defense minister Sergei Ivanov has characterized Kosovo&#39;s move as &quot;opening a Pandora&#39;s box&quot; that would encourage secessionist movements to seek their own independence.  Of course, the Russians and Chinese are worried about Chechnya, Tibet and Taiwan, respectively.  But Mr. Ivanov may have been obliquely referring to the ethnically Russian regions of Georgia and Moldova that are under Russian protection but may seek independence from those former Soviet republics.  President Wilson&#39;s Secretary of State, Robert Lansing, would have agreed with Mr. Ivanov&#39;s assessment.  When the president famously formulated his policy of self-determination in 1918 for people emerging from imperial rule in the aftermath of the First World War, Secretary Lansing remarked:<blockquote>The more I think about the President&#39;s declaration as to the right of &#39;self- determination,&#39; the more convinced I am of the danger of . . . such ideas . . . . What effect will it have on the Irish, the Indians, the Egyptians, and the nationalists among the Boers? Will it not breed discontent, disorder, and rebellion? Will not the Mohammedans of Syria and Palestine and possibly Morocco and Tripoli rely on it? How can it be harmonized with Zionism, to which the President is practically committed?  The phrase is simply loaded with dynamite. It will raise hopes which can never be realized. It will, I fear, cost thousands of lives. . . . What a calamity that the phrase was ever uttered! What misery it will cause!</blockquote>Indeed.  But doesn&#39;t freedom fundamentally include the freedom to govern yourselves?  Good for them.<br /><br /><br /><em>Michael J.

It seems as if the same players, the Islamist Shi&#39;i Alliance, and the Kurdish Coalition, have been successful at making a deal and forcing all others to play along.  This hardly bodes well for the creation of a broader national consensus on so many of the issues that continue to divide the country.<br /><br />By the way of background, at the time of the drafting of Iraq&#39;s Constitution, the centers of power in the new Iraq established themselves and have yet to be seriously shaken.  The Americans had hoped that some sort of nationalist secular alliance, composed of Shi&#39;is such as Ayad Allawi, Sunnis such as Adnan Pachachi and the Kurdish parties, would be able to act as a useful counterbalance to the Islamist Shi&#39;a.  It was hoped that they would ensure that the secularism largely reflected in the interim constitution drafted under American occupation, the so-called Transitional Administrative Law (&quot;TAL&quot;), would be maintained in the permanent Constitution.  <br /><br />This failed, partly because the Allawi-Pachachi alliance, currently at less than 10% of Parliament, does not have the broad support necessary to make it a significant player, but more importantly, because the Kurds were less interested in the fate of Iraq than the fate of their own autonomy within it.   The Islamist Shi&#39;a, aware of this, offered the Kurds a deal: leave the Constitution to us, and we will give you the very broad autonomy that you desire, including the ability to exempt yourselves from almost any law that the national Parliament passes.   The Shi&#39;i Islamic party is about 40% of the Parliament, and the Kurds sensibly enough did not see it in their interests to challenge that 40% and ally with the much smaller secular parties when they were offered the autonomy they desired, which ultimately would permit them to be as secular as they wished in their own region.  And thus was the Constitution drafted, with Islam given a much more prominent role than it had been under the TAL.  The Americans still of course exerted and continue to exert influence in Iraq, which probably limits to some extent the role of Islam under the Constitution, but they could not prevent a fundamentally important provision of the new Constitution, which requires that all legislation be in conformity with the universal tenets of the shari&#39;a.<br /><br />From that time, this Kurd-Islamist Shi&#39;i alliance has held strong.  Recently, however, there has been talk of cracks in the coalition, that the Kurds may have overreached in their excessive demands, that the Shi&#39;a Islamists were breaking apart, and that a new nationalist alliance that transcended ethnic and sectarian boundaries might be formed.   But the budget debate shows quite clearly that all of this talk might be premature.  <br /><br />The source of the recent budget impasse had to do with the amounts of money reserved to the Kurdish region by the federal government.  Under law, for some time, that amount has been set at 17%.  Pointing to recent election data, which seemed to show that the voters in the region numbered about 13% of the total voting population, Arab parties of various sorts sought to lower the Kurdish quota to 13%. (The Kurds are closer to 20% of the population by voting records, but many do not live in the Kurdish region, hence the 13% figure.)   The Kurds argue that voter percentage is hardly the appropriate measure of population and that until a census is completed (which given Iraq&#39;s current condition is likely to take some time), their quota should remain 17%.  Their failure to convince anyone else to go along for a few weeks was supposedly evidence of their weakening.<br /><br />Just as positions were beginning to harden, however, the alliance reasserted itself.  The occasion was another law, the provinces law, where at least some significant portion of the Shi&#39;a Islamists (though not all of them) sought to ensure that the province heads would be dismissed not by a majority of the national Parliament, but rather by local provincial councils.  This is of some importance to some Shi&#39;i Islamists, most importantly from the Supreme Islamic Council of Iraq, who want ultimately to see more power devolved to the southern provinces.  They did not want to have province heads with no local support installed by command of Baghdad.  But the change would not affect the Kurdish region, and so one would imagine the Kurds would not really care very much about it.  The Sunnis and the secularists were viscerally opposed, and it was therefore believed that between Sunni and secularist opposition, Kurdish indifference, and a divided Shi&#39;i Islamic alliance that the measure would pass and a nationalist alliance finally prove itself sustainable against divided and confused Shi&#39;i Islamists.<br /><br />Thus, it came as something of a shock when the Kurds joined the Supreme Islamic Council in a walkout of Parliament on Tuesday, thereby denying a quorum to those who might otherwise have been able to pass the provinces law.  The Sunni Speaker of Parliament became quite upset, but there was little he could do.  As he and his party no doubt stewed in anger, the Supreme Islamic Council announced that they had been persuaded by the Kurdish position on the budget allocation, and all became clear.  The same alliance had reasserted itself.  A day later, the Parliament passed both laws, the budget with the 17% allocation and the provincial law with the modification that permitted a province head to be removed either by the Parliament on recommendation by the Prime Minister or by a vote of the provincial council, effectively giving the local councils a veto over any central government selection.  Kurdish autonomy was maintained, and Shi&#39;i autonomy expanded.  To bring the Sunnis on board, an amnesty law was also passed.<br /><br />In some ways, I suppose this is progress, in that the country did come together to reach an agreement on three laws.  But quite clearly, the same alliance that created this legal order enacted these laws in the forms that they appear, and the same factions disputing the same issues found the same route to a solution, one that emphasizes rather than diminishes the regional and sectarian divisions in the country.  At least for now, the nationalist alliance is nowhere to be seen.<br /><br /><br /><em>Haider Ala Hamoudi is a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/main.asp?PID=34">Jordan Paust</a> of the University of Houston Law Center says that opinions of the US Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel that are manifestly inconsistent with or violative of the laws of war provide no legal cover for any member of the executive branch seeking impunity for alleged war crimes and other international crimes committed by civilians during the Administration's unlawful program of secret detention and "coercive interrogation&quot;...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/paustbig.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>E</strong></font>arlier this month, US Attorney General Mukasey publicly formalized what has been the Bush Administration's functional program of impunity for alleged war crimes and other international crimes committed by civilians during the Administration's unlawful program of secret detention and "coercive interrogation."  For the next year, Mukasey assured, there will be no investigations and no prosecutions.  <br /><br />In fact, as explained in my book <em>Beyond the Law</em>, for the last seven years no person of any nationality or status has been prosecuted under the War Crimes Act, alternative legislation for prosecution of all war crimes, the torture statute, the genocide statute, or the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act.  <br /><br />Refusal to faithfully execute the law was previously obvious.  Now it is official.<br /><br />What is Mukasey's putative justification for inaction?  With respect to admitted CIA waterboarding, he told the House Judiciary Committee, "[w]hatever was done as part of a CIA program at the time ... was the subject of a Department of Justice opinion ... and was found to be permissible."  What is Mukasey's malignant misconception?  His error embraces the autocratic notion that all within the executive branch are always bound by opinions of the DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel, even if they facially authorize or abet international crime.  In our democracy, however, even a unitary executive branch is not above the law.  <br /><br /> For example, a self-serving OLC opinion that facilitates the Administration's "common, unifying" plan to abandon the strictures of the Geneva Conventions and to engage in "coercive interrogation" cannot obviate the reach of well-known absolute proscriptions of cruel and inhumane treatment that are part of constitutionally-based customary and treaty-based international law that is supreme law of the United States that all persons within the executive branch are bound under the Constitution to faithfully execute.  OLC opinions simply cannot authorize conduct that, on its face, is criminal under international law.  A consistent prohibition of "all cruelty" against captured persons has been obvious and well-known under the laws of war at least since codification of the 1863 Lieber Code during the U.S. Civil War.<br />   <br /> Attorney General Mukasey's misperceived claim concerning an alleged cover provided by OLC opinions is tantamount to a claim that within the executive branch orders or authorizations are a complete defense &#8212; a claim that is neither correct under international law nor acceptable in a democracy under the rule of law.  For centuries, our courts have recognized that such claims are false.  A few examples are worth highlighting.  In 1804, in <em>Little v. Barreme</em> (The Flying Fish), 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 170, Chief Justice Marshall ruled that "orders given by the executive" and executive "instructions cannot change the nature of the transaction, or legalize an act which, without those instructions, would have been a plain trespass" against the law, the Chief Justice adding: "[i]f his instructions afford him no protection, then the law must take its course."  Two years later, in <em>United States v. Smith</em>, 27 F. Cas. 1192 (C.C.D.N.Y. 1806), Justice Paterson affirmed that the President is bound by the law and "cannot dispense with its execution, and still less can he authorize a person to do what the law forbids."  If the President had approved a violation, Paterson stressed, "it would not justify the defendant in a court of law, nor discharge him from the binding force" of law.<br /><br /> In 1852, <em>Mitchell v. Harmony</em>, 54 U.S. (13 How.) 115, 137, affirmed that superior orders are not a defense: "[an] order to do an illegal act ... can afford no justification."  Later, Justice Miller, in <em>Elger's Adm'r v. Lovell</em>, 8 F. Cas. 449, 454 (C.C.D. Mo. 1865), recognized that "no proclamation of the president can change or modify" the reach of the "law of nations."  Also at that time, Attorney General Speed, in 11 Op. Att'y Gen. 297, 299-300 (1865), recognized that the laws of war and more general laws of nations "are of binding force upon the departments and citizens of the Government" and neither Congress nor the Executive can "abrogate them or authorize their infraction."  Still later, a district court affirmed, in <em>Ex parte Orozco</em>, 201 F. 106, 111-12 (W.D. Tex. 1912), that conduct resting "merely upon an order directed by the President" was illegal and cannot "be sustained in a court of justice."  Certainly a mere OLC opinion can have no more authority than a presidential authorization, directive, or order.<br /><br /> And what have U.S. tribunals ruled concerning the putative reach of foreign official directives?  In <em>United States v. Von Leeb</em>, et al., during the Subsequent Nuremberg Proceedings, the U.S. military commission correctly ruled that international law "must be superior to and where it conflicts with, takes precedence over National Law or directives issued by any national governmental authority.  The directive to violate International Criminal ... Law is therefore void and can afford no protection to one who violates such law in reliance on such a directive."  Indeed, more generally, the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg applied an ultra vires rationale to recognize that "[h]e who violates the laws of war cannot obtain immunity while acting in pursuance of the authority of the State if the State in authorizing action moves outside its competence under international law."<br /><br /> In contrast to Mukasey's misconception concerning the alleged cover provided by OLC opinions, the Supreme Court has also recognized in <em>United States v. Lee</em>, 106 U.S. 196, 220 (1882), that "No man in this country is so high that he is above the law.  No officer of the law may set that law at defiance with impunity.  All the officers of the government, from the highest to the lowest, are creatures of the law, and are bound to obey it.  It is the only supreme power in our system of government, and every man who by accepting office participates in its functions is only the more strongly bound to submit to that supremacy, and to observe the limitations which it imposes upon the exercise of the authority which it gives."<br /><br /> When the courts are involved, it is also important to remember that numerous cases recognize judicial power to second-guess the legal propriety of executive opinions, authorizations, orders, and decisions taken in time of war with respect to the seizure of persons and property and the status and treatment of persons.  See, e.g., Paust, <em>Judicial Power to Determine the Status and Rights of Persons Detained Without Trial</em>, 44 HARV. INT'L L.J. 503, 520-24 (2003).  As documented in <em>Beyond the Law</em> at 21-22, 169-72, every relevant federal and state judicial opinion since the dawn of the United States, including several U.S. Supreme Court opinions, has affirmed that all persons within the executive branch are bound by the laws of war and that the laws of war place limitations on the authority of any member of the executive branch.  <em>Dooley v. United States</em>, 182 U.S. 222, 231 (1901), is illustrative: "[military powers ar
e] regulated and limited ... directly by the laws of war."  <br /><br />As a matter of common sense, it is legally and morally impossible for any member of the executive branch to be acting lawfully or within the scope of his or her authority while following OLC opinions that are manifestly inconsistent with or violative of the law.  General Mukasey, just following orders is no defense!<br /><br /><br /><em>Jordan J. Paust is the Mike &amp; Teresa Baker Law Center Professor at the University of Houston, a former U.S. Army JAG officer, and author of </em>Beyond the Law: The Bush Administration's Unlawful Responses in the "War" on Terror<em> (Cambridge University Press 2007), available thru <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/9780521884266">http://www.cambridge.org/9780521884266</a>.</em><br /><br /><br /><iframe src="/related/paust.php" frameborder='0' width='100%' height='140' scrolling='no' valign='top' marginheight='3'></iframe><br />

		<title>Children as Terrorists: Wrong to Train, Wrong to Charge</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.syr.edu/faculty/facultymember.asp?fac=152">David Crane</a> of Syracuse University College of Law, former Chief Prosecutor for the UN Special Court for Sierra Leone and a signatory of the recent Paris Declaration on child soldiers, says that not only is it morally and legally wrong to train children to become terrorists, but that those who have been trained or otherwise coerced - including Omar Khadr, the Canadian captured in Afghanistan while a juvenile and now facing a US military commission at Guantanamo - lack the moral culpability and deliberative intent to be tried as war criminals....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/davidcranenew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font> recently captured video in Iraq depicts children, mainly boys, being trained in various military and terror techniques.  This is disturbing.  Coupled with the recent use in Iraq of young women apparently suffering from a mental disability as unwitting suicide bombers, these actions auger poorly for the future as to the shape and scope of tactics being used by various Islamic groups fighting their pseudo-jihad against the West.<br /><br />Women and children have always suffered the brunt of war.  Both in international and internal armed conflicts, the fighting factions use and abuse the weakest found on the battlefield. This trend over the past one hundred years has not changed - in fact, to my mind it is getting worse.  From the horrors perpetrated by King Leopold II in Belgium in the Congo at the turn of the last century, through the campaign of the three Pashas in Turkey against the Christian Armenians during World War I, the depopulations by Joseph Stalin between the wars; the Holocaust of World War II, the mass deaths perpetrated by Mao on the Chinese people, the killing fields of Cambodia, to the more recent depredations of Charles Taylor in West Africa, women and children have been particularly singled out by their own governments as targets.  The victims number in the tens of millions.  <br /><br />In the past twenty years, over two million children have died in conflict.  Most, if not all, were forcibly recruited under great duress, causing whole generations of children to be destroyed in various parts of the world.  In the past ten years the world has begun to address this scourge.  Led by the United Nations, various treaties, protocols, resolutions, and declarations have clearly stated that children are not to be used in conflicts.  From the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child (and its Protocol 1), to the recent Paris Declaration (of which I was a signatory), as well as the law found in the Geneva Conventions, children are to be nurtured and "especially protected".  The law is clear, yet the violations and abuse continue.<br /><br />Those who violate these international standards and norms are now being held accountable.  The ground-breaking work of the international war crimes tribunal in West Africa, called the Special Court for Sierra Leone, saw most of the key leaders in that ten-year horror charged and convicted of the unlawful recruitment of children under the age of fifteen into an armed force.  The International Criminal Court is also moving forward on this new international crime as well particularly by the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda.  This is a major step forward in attempts to stop using children in combat or in terrorist operations.<br /><br />No child has the <em>mens rea</em> (the evil-thinking mind) to commit war crimes.  In fact those who use children in combat use coercive techniques that clearly shock the conscience. In Sierra Leone, children were forced to kill their parents and then were led off into the bush to fight for years, doped up, murdering, maiming, mutilating, and raping.  Many forgot their real names and where they came from.  They became true killing machines.  They knew neither right from wrong, nor the concept of mercy.  The lost generation of Sierra Leone now struggles in life, a life of literally no hope whatsoever.<br /><br />In the Middle East, particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan, we are seeing the coercive induction of children into various terrorist groups, many brainwashed by religious fervor, given little to no options but to perpetrate murder against their own kind, as well as against soldiers from the international community, mainly the west.  The setting is different than West Africa, but the results are the same - children killing against their will and with little choice.  This is morally and legally wrong, regardless of the justification and rationale by the groups into which they are inducted.  <br /><br />It is unfortunate that the capture of this Iraqi video is not the only time that the use of children in the Middle East as soldiers has surfaced.  In another circumstance from Afghanistan, a young Canadian is currently being tried in Guantanamo for a war crime.  Omar Khadr is charged, among other crimes, as having allegedly killed a US soldier in Afghanistan on 27 July 2002 as an "unlawful enemy combatant".  He was just fifteen years old as the time of this crime.  Brought to Afghanistan from Canada by his father several years earlier, young Omar had no choice as to the circumstances he found himself working with individuals who were part of the al-Qaeda network.  <br /><br />When war broke out he was forced to fight and to kill.  Gravely wounded, he was shipped to the US detention camp in Cuba where he has been kept for over five years.  Omar Khadr is the poster child of what can happen when children are forced into these situations.  For his crimes he is the first child ever to be charged as a war criminal.  This too is morally and legally wrong.  <br /><br />It remains to be seen how the hearing officer at Guantanamo will rule on a motion before a US military commission to drop the charges due to Khadr's age.  I am not optimistic as to the outcome.  Hence, he will be tried for crimes arguably he did not have the mental state to commit. This remains to be seen.  It should be those who caused Khadr to be in the circumstance of war to be dealt with, rather than Khadr himself.  That was my policy in West Africa: to charge the leadership of the units and factions, not the children they "recruited".  I felt as the Chief Prosecutor at the time that they were legally not culpable.<br /><br />The international standard for children is for protection, nurturing, educating, and giving them the ability to realize their full potential.  Unlawful recruitment into an armed force is not a part of this paradigm.  The training of children as seen in the video is to be condemned and the release of Omar Khadr, a child soldier, from the US detention camp should be clearly mandated by the international community.  France already has called for his release, as should his own country, Canada.<br /><br /><br /><em>David M.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.commoncause.org/site/pp.asp?c=dkLNK1MQIwG&b=2744673"><strong>Bob Edgar</strong></a> [President, <a href="http://www.commoncause.org">Common Cause</a>]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/us-house-passes-resolution-to-create.php">creation of the independent Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE)</a> has sweeping implications for the House of Representatives and its members. Though the process of rooting out corruption among members of the House has changed over the years, this is the first time that private citizens will have the opportunity to investigate and report on possible misconduct by their elected representatives in Congress.<br /><br />From a legal standpoint, a principal argument against an independent ethics body has been that it would violate U.S. Const., Art. I, &Acirc;&sect; 5, cl.2, which confers the power to punish its Members for disorderly behavior upon the House (and Senate). While there is no judicial authority directly deciding this point, we have argued that there is no textual constitutional impediment to delegating certain responsibilities to an independent body outside the House.<br /><br />In interpreting the powers of the House, the Courts are likely to accord substantial deference to its choice of the means to implement its self-disciplinary power, particularly if that legislative judgment is supported by a finding that the self-disciplinary process is not functioning in an orderly and efficient manner. I think it should be clear to anyone that the House Ethics Committee has been moribund since long before the recent series of scandals and that it was time to do something about it.<br /><br />While an independent ethics body could be a huge benefit to Members and the institution, the OCE will be as good or bad as the party leaders make it. Objective, reasonable appointees with respect for the institution can shield members from frivolous, politically motivated ethics complaints. If the parties appoint political hacks with an axe to grind, members will become the victims.&quot;<br />

		<title>Mexico justice reform should yield positive results</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.cejamericas.org/cejacommunity/index.php?id=140&item2=118"><strong>Juan Enrique Vargas</strong></a> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.cejamericas.org/">Justice Studies Center of the Americas</a> (CEJA/JSCA)]: &quot;Everything indicates that Mexico will soon implement a profound criminal <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/mexico-lower-house-approves-judicial.php">justice reform</a> that would share a great deal of the main characteristics of the reforms that have been introduced in almost every country in Latin America since the early 1990s. Once Mexico joins this process, practically every nation in the region, with the very significant exception of Brazil, will have abandoned the old inquisitory criminal trial systems, replacing them with others that are characterized by the use of oral procedures, the central role of prosecutors in criminal investigation, express recognition of the presumption of innocence and the right to a defense, and more rights and benefits for victims. The single identity in the procedures is a positive factor of this process because it facilitates international cooperation in the struggle against increasingly transnational criminal phenomena. <br /><br />But even more important are the positive effects that this new system should generate within Mexico. Over the past few years, crime has become one of the most serious problems being faced by the State. Whether it is a matter of crimes related to drug trafficking, which receive the most attention internationally because of their seriousness, or common crimes that are less serious but more intense and frequent, the country&#39;s major cities have reached critical levels of citizen insecurity. <br /><br />The biggest question that must be answered now is to what degree criminal procedure reform can reverse this phenomenon. Others have pointed out that crime has many causes, and that it is naive to think that judicial reform policy alone will reverse them. However, a good justice system can and should contribute to a global strategy in this area. It is likely that the problem that Mexico&#39;s criminal justice system is facing today is rooted in high levels of impunity that are often associated with high levels of corruption. An open and transparent system composed of agencies with separate functions that oversee each other can provide at least the basic conditions for fair and just trials and endows the system with a level of legitimacy that the current one would seem to lack.<br /><br />This is not, of course, enough to make crime disappear, but there seem to be essential requirements for moving in that direction. The reform will only have the desired impact if it goes beyond mere legislative changes in order to introduce truly different practices. As the experience of countries that have introduced similar reforms has demonstrated, the correct implementation of the changes is even more important than good normative design. The process requires adequate planning, strong leadership and a capacity to make the changes that are required as time goes on. At the same time, it is important to have the resources necessary to implement institutional adjustments and focus on management mechanisms and training for judicial operators, as these are the two instruments that will allow for the changes proposed in the laws to become a reality.&quot;<br />

		<title>Detainees in Burma: in a lawless land, any law will do</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://ratchasima.net/"><strong>Awzar Thi</strong></a> [member, <a href="http://www.ahrchk.net/index.php">Asian Human Rights Commission</a>, Hong Kong]: &quot;Human rights advocates, lawyers and journalists are often concerned with how special laws are used to suppress dissent and deny basic freedoms in countries around the world. Internal security acts and emergency decrees attract widespread interest and strong critiques. How ordinary laws are used to the same ends often obtains less notice. And yet it is in the workings of mundane codes and procedures that the efforts of governments to control the largest numbers of their citizens are brought into sharpest focus. <br /><br />Burma is a case in point. Democracy campaigners have long described it as having some of the most draconian and sweeping security laws in the world. Now a lawyer has said that around 20 detainees are <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/myanmar-charges-rights-activists-under.php">likely to be charged</a> under one of these. The persons, held since last August, are expected to face charges under law 5/96 for &quot;acts such as incitement, delivering speeches, making oral and written statements and disseminating in various ways [sic] to belittle the National Convention&quot; on a new constitution. <br /><br />Like hundreds of other people locked up since the nationwide uprising last year, none of these persons were ever in fact arrested. Unidentified men bundled them into unofficial vehicles and took them to undisclosed places. They were snatched. Even the state media quietly acknowledged this much, describing them as &quot;brought, investigated and questioned&quot;. Those freed have been forced to sign incoherent pledges, admitting that they have committed undefined crimes and have been released because of the state&#39;s goodwill.<br /><br />Among those still inside, including dozens of defrocked monks and nuns, few have been charged under security laws. Most have been accused of ordinary crimes: insulting religion; keeping obscene materials or illegal videos; gambling, carrying weapons. And if one charge doesn&#39;t stick, there&#39;s sure to be another. <br /><br />The imprisonment of Khin Sanda Win, a 23-year-old university student, is indicative. She was stopped by unknown men on September 29 and taken to the town hall in Rangoon where she was photographed standing behind some arms on a table, with a group of other people whom she had never met. Then she was put inside. Law never even entered into it. <br /><br />At the end of October, Khin Sanda Win was let out after signing a pledge, but shortly thereafter police came to her house and said that she would be charged after all, for allegedly having a slingshot in her bag when she was picked up. Apparently the officers had not realised that possessing a slingshot is not prohibited. <br /><br />When Khin Sanda Win came to court she was instead accused of endangering life. The judge granted bail at an amount that exceeded what was legally permissible, and then without reason unilaterally retracted it. She has since been held in solitary confinement at the central prison and attempts to get her released have been singularly unsuccessful. <br /><br />Such cases are nothing new to Burma. Officials large and small routinely lay run-of-the-mill charges against perceived troublemakers or personal enemies. Cases for upsetting the peace, interfering with public servants and lodging false complaints are commonplace. Other targets are accused of apparently unrelated crimes, such as trading in illegal lottery tickets or tutoring without a licence. Judges have been known to advise inept prosecutors on which charges with which to secure a guilty verdict. <br /><br />In this setting talk only about specialised security laws and high-profile dissidents holds little value. When a country&#39;s entire criminal legal system has been reduced to a means to other ends, trying to make sense of one particularly nasty provision or an especially ugly case is pointless. Instead, real effort is needed to understand and describe the whole; to identify those features that a single case has in common with others rather than those that may distinguish it from the rest. <br /><br />Having documents called laws and people called judges does not alter the fact that Burma is fundamentally lawless. The serial abducting, detaining and belated charging of last year&#39;s protesters is a symptom of this condition. Ultimately, those accused of threatening the National Convention are just another 20 defendants denied lawyers or rights, and for this reason alone, rather than the law under which they have been charged or their personal backgrounds, they are worthy of concern and advocacy.&quot; <br /><br /><em>(Awzar Thi is the pen name of a member of the Asian Human Rights Commission with over 15 years of experience as an advocate of human rights and the rule of law in Thailand and Burma.

		<title>Arrest of Muslim Brotherhood members in Egypt violates right to free association</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Joe Stork</strong> [Program Director, Middle East &amp; North Africa, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a>]: &quot;<a href="/paperchase/2008/02/egypt-police-arrest-70-more-muslim.php">New arrests</a> of Muslim Brotherhood members have brought the total number arrested in the first two months of 2008 to more than 600. Egyptian officials say the grounds for arrest consist of membership in an illegal organization. The authorities indeed have banned the Muslim Brotherhood, but this is a decree that violates Egypt&#39;s obligation to protect the right to freedom of association. <br /><br />It is worth noting that officials enforce the ban irregularly, especially when Brotherhood members or sympathizers attempt to register as candidates in local or national elections. Most of those rounded up since the beginning of this year appear to be leaders of the organization and members or sympathizers who planned to run as candidates in municipal elections scheduled for early April. <br /><br />Government officials often claim informally that the Muslim Brotherhood aims to overthrow the existing political order by violent means, but officials have not charged any of those arrested with committing or advocating violence. The organization has long asserted that it is committed to democratic principles. Many Egyptians debate the extent of this commitment, but the government&#39;s on-again off-again campaigns of repression violate the rights of Muslim Brotherhood adherents to freedom of association and expression and the right to take part in the conduct of public affairs.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Ana Aguilar Garc&iacute;a</strong> [resident fellow in Mexico, <a href="http://www.justiceinitiative.org/">Open Society Justice Initiative</a>]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/mexico-lower-house-approves-judicial.php">judicial reform</a> foresees two sets of important provisions. One related with the elimination of the inquisitorial system, setting forth the adversarial system for the criminal proceedings, and the other the one that establishes special rules against organized crime.<br /><br />A new system with the features of an adversarial system is welcomed in order to change the vicious Mexican inquisitorial system where the fair trial guarantees are constantly and systematically curtailed. The former is already in force in two states, Oaxaca and Chihuahua &#8212; and approved in three more, Zacatecas, Morelos and Baja California. The results so far have been very positive, with surprising statistics such as the 10% rate of pretrial detention in Oaxaca, making real the application of the principle of presumption of innocence for the first time in decades. Oaxaca, by the way, does not have the catalogue of grave non-bailable offences that the constitutional reform foresees. <br /><br />However, in contradiction with the array of guarantees brought by the latter, the new reform also constitutionalizes situations previously declared unconstitutional by the Judiciary for violation of fundamental rights, e.g. the &quot;arraigo&quot; during the investigation, similar to house arrest, except that it takes place usually at &quot;security houses&quot; and could last up to 80 days. Moreover, the apparently new constitutional norms on organized crime do nothing more than the legal rules that have been in force for the last ten years. Hence the question of whether the constitutionalization of such rules will make them more effective arises. <br /><br />These changes will require a strong commitment from the authorities for the implementation of the oral trials, and a strict and constant monitoring from the civil society to the implementation of the provisions on organized crime in order to prevent more abuses than the reform itself entails. Overall, the success or failure of these reforms will depend on the coordination between the three branches of power, and the persistent attention from the citizens to their enforcement.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Howard A. Learner</strong> [counsel for the Environmental Amici, <a href="http://www.elpc.org/">Environmental Law &amp; Policy Center</a>]: &quot;Sixteen environmental and Alaskan conservation organizations, represented by public interest attorneys from the Environmental Law &amp; Policy Center, filed an amicus curiae brief before the U.S. Supreme Court in the <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/supreme-court-hears-exxon-valdez.php">Exxon (Valdez) Shipping case</a> focused on the important issue of whether the federal Clean Water Act should be held to preempt maritime law remedies for damages to private property and other economic damages caused by oil spills.<br /><br />Allowing such preemption would create an unwarranted gap in the framework of federal and state statutes and federal and state common law governing clean water protection.  The Clean Water Act is designed to &quot;restore and maintain&quot; the integrity of our nation&#39;s waters. It should not shield a private company from part of its liability for damages arising from an environmental disaster for which it is responsible.  The environmental amici are seeking to protect the public&#39;s interests in the integrity and effectiveness of the nation&#39;s integrated system of environmental statutes and common law remedies to preserve our natural resources and achieve cleaner waters.<br /><br />The Clean Water Act (CWA), state statutes and common law rights and remedies together provide a complementary and robust legal structure for cleaning up our nation&#39;s waters. Exxon&#39;s argument before the Court that the CWA &quot;leaves no room&quot; for maritime law punitive damages remedies would create a gap in this structure even though Congress stated no such intent.<br /><br />The CWA&#39;s text and the legislative history indicate that Congress intended the Act to supplement private remedies by enhancing the federal government&#39;s ability to deter and clean up oil and other water pollution, not to displace shipowners&#39; existing obligations and incentives to keep clean water clean. Moreover, Congress&#39; silence in the statute cannot be deemed to imply preemption, especially when the CWA includes savings clauses that explicitly preserve private remedies for damages to property and allow any person, under common law, &quot;to seek any other relief. . . .&quot; There is a legal presumption favoring the retention of common law remedies where Congress has not directly spoken.<br /><br />Punitive damages awards for economic losses of private parties do not inherently conflict with the administration of the CWA, nor frustrate any purpose of the federal remedial scheme. Exxon has not overcome the presumption that when Congress passes legislation, it intends to retain common law remedies. United States v. Texas, 507 U.S. 529, 534 (1993). This case is much like Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee in which the Court held that state-imposed punitive damages for the release of plutonium from a nuclear power plant were available despite the extensive federal regulatory framework governing nuclear safety. 464 U.S. 238 (1984).<br /><br />Effective environmental protection depends on the interwoven fabric of federal statutory and regulatory standards, state statutory and regulatory standards, and federal and state common law remedies.  Federal environmental laws often work in combination with, and leave room for, pre-existing private remedies, and they should be interpreted to preserve common law remedies unless Congress has directly spoken to displace them. Under Exxon&#39;s theory, Congress would be compelled to write even more detailed and lengthier statutes lest a gap be implied even when a savings clause is specifically enacted.<br /><br />Exxon&#39;s conduct in this case - leaving a relapsed alcoholic in command of a supertanker - resulted in an environmental disaster and widespread property damage. Accepting Exxon&#39;s overreaching preemption argument in this case could lead to the ironic and unfortunate result of the federal Clean Water Act being used as a shield against, rather than a sword to help achieve, cleaner water. Exxon&#39;s expansive preemption theory fails to account for the CWA&#39;s savings clauses, and it is contrary to the presumptions against preemption and in favor of the retention of existing common law remedies.  Exxon&#39;s argument, if accepted, would weaken environmental protections, threaten principles of federalism, and undermine Congress&#39; efforts to protect the nation&#39;s waters.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Moazzam Begg</strong> [former Guantanamo detainee and spokesman for <a href="http://www.cageprisoners.com/">Cageprisoners</a>]: &quot;In January this year, a training document produced by the Canadian foreign ministry, which referred to Guantanamo Bay, listed the United States as a country known to practice torture. Despite this assertion, the only Westerner remaining in the world&#39;s most infamous prison at Guantanamo Bay is the Canadian, <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/us-military-judge-orders-disclosure-of.php">Omar Khadr</a>.<br /><br />Omar is one of the youngest people to have been captured and detained by US authorities since the invasion of Afghanistan. He had only just turned fifteen when he was first brought into the Bagram Airbase detention facility, horribly wounded. That is where I first met him.<br /><br />Chunks of his chest and shoulder had been blown out - or so I&#39;d assumed; he was also unable to see through one of his eyes because of the injuries sustained in an attack by US troops. His chest looked like he&#39;d just had a post mortem operation performed on him - alive. He was emaciated, fragile and silent. But the rumour spread around about him claimed that he&#39;d launched a grenade-attack on unsuspecting soldiers. Consequently, the military police units guarding us all treated Omar with open contempt and hostility. He was sometimes screamed at all night long; made to stack up crates of water bottles which were thrown down again; a hood placed over his head whilst his wrists were shackled to the ceiling. The soldiers used to call him &#39;Buckshot Bob&#39; but I never really understood why as his wounds didn&#39;t seem like those from a shotgun. Only now, three years after my release have I understood the logic behind this name - after having seen newly released photos of Omar when he was captured: the missing chunks of flesh were exit wounds. It is now clear that Omar had been shot in the back.<br /><br />Many weeks passed during which I managed to have some whispered conversations with Omar but, just like me, he knew his ordeal had only begun. (I witnessed two separate killings in Bagram by American soldiers before I too was sent to Guantanamo. These killings are the subject of this year&#39;s Oscar-winning documentary, <em>Taxi to the Dark Side</em>).<br /><br />Omar was later accused of causing the death of a US Special Forces operative with a grenade. Yet a report given by the soldier who shot him says that not only was Mr. Khadr alive there, an adult man was also alive at the time he, the U.S. soldier, rushed in shooting. This contradicts the testimony of another solider who said that only Mr. Khadr was alive at the time.<br /><br />Whatever the case may be, Omar will soon be approaching the seventh year of his detention in Guantanamo. And his government, which accepts that abuses faced by others at such places are very real, will do nothing for its own citizen, who was bought there in chains as a child.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/about_us/staff/muhammedAlly_s.htm"><strong>Sahr MuhammedAlly</strong></a> [Senior Associate, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/">Human Rights First</a>]: &quot;On March 12, 2008, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/detainees/cases/jawad.htm">Mohammed Jawad</a> [Human Rights backgrounder], a twenty-three year old Afghan prisoner, announced to the military commission judge that he has &quot;been brought here illegally.&quot; Jawad is accused of attempted murder for allegedly throwing a grenade at a military vehicle, and injuring two U.S. soldiers and their interpreter in Afghanistan in December 2002. Through a Pushto interpreter, Jawad said yesterday that the prosecution is &quot;an injustice to me.&quot; <br /><br />According to my colleague, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/about_us/staff/lanigan_k.htm">Kevin Lanigan</a>, who is observing the proceedings in Guant&aacute;namo, Jawad was forcibly brought to the court as he refused to come voluntarily. When he arrived, in an orange jumpsuit and shackled feet, he told the court that as a child he read in a newspaper about American criticism of the Taliban&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;that they are cruel, imprison people without trial, and do not respect human rights. But he claimed that the Americans are doing the same&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;he was arrested five years ago, at age 16, with no trial, and he heard that Americans killed Afghans in custody. (In fact, two prisoners, Mullah Habibullah and Dilawar, did die in Bagram after prolonged interrogation during which they were shackled to the ceiling and beaten).<a href="/paperchase/2008/03/guantanamo-detainee-asks-to-boycott.php"> Jawad then rejected the proceedings and refused legal representation</a>.<br /><br />For the 80 out of 275 men that the government says it intends to prosecute, each military commission hearing reminds us of the failure of justice that the commissions represent. This second tier of justice allows the use coerced testimony so long as the military judge finds the evidence &quot;reliable&quot; and &quot;in the interests of justice.&quot; Hearsay testimony is admissible unless the defendant is able to show that it is unreliable and lacks probative value. Interrogation methods and activities are not disclosed, sometimes even to the military commission judge, thereby making it nearly impossible to demonstrate that a particular statement is the product of abuse. <br /><br />Critics of the military commissions are not limited to human rights advocates. Many critics also include those inside the system. Four military commission prosecutors have resigned in protest because of flaws in the proceedings. The government should try suspected terrorists in civilian criminal courts or by courts-martial, using proven rules of the federal criminal justice system or the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which reject the use of coerced evidence, protect national security, and ensure a fundamentally fair trial.&quot;<br /><span style="font-style:italic;"><br />&quot;Report from Guantanamo&quot; features regular contributions to JURIST Hotline from <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/index.asp">Human Rights First</a>. </span><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Khalid Sekander</strong> [former legal advisor to <a href="http://www.usaid.gov/">USAID</a>]: &quot;An Afghan university journalism student was recently convicted of blasphemy and <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/afghan-student-sentenced-to-death-for.php">sentenced to death</a> by an Afghan trial court for expressing the idea that polygamy may be an inappropriate practice under Islam. The sentence is on appeal, and, meanwhile a majority of the members of the upper house of the Afghan parliament (Meshrano Jirgha) passed a resolution condoning the court&#39;s severe sentence - parliament has since retracted its position, but the government&#39;s message to its citizens is loud and clear: do not debate religious issues.<br /><br />The scenario seems a stark contradiction to the post-Taliban government&#39;s seemingly noble intentions to herald-in a democratic era and meaningfully embark on the road to democracy by promising its citizens and the international community a constitution that enumerates and safeguards fundamental human rights.<br /> <br />The source of this contradiction is the primary law of the land, the Afghan Constitution of 2004. After four rushed months and more than $40 million, Afghanistan&#39;s Constitutional Commission proudly unveiled its &#39;democratic&#39; constitution. <br /> <br />A close reading of the constitution reveals the exercise of the supposed enumerated constitutional &#39;rights&#39; are conditioned on the notion that the exercising of those rights should not violate the principles of Islam. This cleverly placed obstruction prevents the full development and realization of democratic values and beliefs in Afghanistan, and provides the courts and government the legal justification to do as it wishes in the name of Islam. <br /> <br />This is a clear case where the constitution threatens democracy.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Sebastian Elgueta</strong> [researcher, Central America Team, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a>]: &quot;Amnesty International was deeply disappointed at the <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/guatemala-legislature-passes-bill-to.php">passage of Decree 06-2008</a> by the Congress of Guatemala which effectively aims to restart executions of those condemned to death. The Decree establishes the procedure by which the President can grant a pardon to a death row inmate. Executions had been stalled since 2000 when the law that allowed pardons was abrogated. This de facto moratorium was further strengthened in 2005 when the Inter-American Court, in the case of Raxcac&oacute; vs Guatemala, held that a pardon law was a prerequisite and that it must include the specific criteria on which a pardon could be granted. Nevertheless the Decree itself not only omits such criteria but, instead, introduces the concept of &quot;negative administrative silence&quot; which establishes that if the President does not provide an answer to the pardon request within 30 days it is assumed that it has been denied. This procedure, of course, would make it impossible to know what criteria the rejection was based on. In sum, this appears to be a non-fulfilment of the Court&#39;s judgement and a breach of the American Convention which establishes that all the Court&#39;s judgements must be adhered to by signatory States. <br /><br />The passing of Decree 06-2008 in Congress came after a particularly violent week in Guatemala. According to press reports, in one day six bus drivers were killed allegedly by gangs, known as maras. Amnesty International , however, has expressed its concern at what it sees as an ineffective and ultimately counterproductive way of tackling the public security crisis that Guatemala is currently experiencing. Aside from the well established fact that the death penalty has no real deterrent effect, Amnesty International has for many years been drawing attention to one of the root causes of violent crime and the dire public security situation: the prevailing culture of impunity. Although there is a very high rate of murders (hovering around 44 per 100,000, some 5780 murders in 2007) the conviction rate is approximately 1%. This in itself may seem shocking (and indeed it is) but it is not surprising in a country which saw genocide, hundreds of massacres and widespread torture committed during the internal armed conflict which ended in 1996 &#8212; and those responsible for these crimes continue unchallenged and occupying powerful positions in society. <br /><br />For these reasons AI is <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/AMR34/004/2008">asking</a> the President of Guatemala to veto the decree.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/about_us/staff/hicks_n.htm">Neil Hicks</a> [International Policy Advisor, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/">Human Rights First</a>]: &quot;Detaining political opponents is a control mechanism long favored by the Egyptian government.  The continuing incarceration of Ayman Nour, apparently for having the temerity to challenge Hosni Mubarak in the 2005 presidential election is a case in point.  <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/egypt-police-arrest-70-more-muslim.php">Rounding up supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood</a>, Egypt&#39;s largest opposition political movement, prior to elections has long been a feature of Egypt&#39;s political landscape.  The current detention of scores of Muslim Brotherhood supporters in the run up to local council elections scheduled for April 8, 2008 fits this pattern.<br /><br />The Muslim Brotherhood, technically banned since 1954, has an idiosyncratic status that reveals much about the political approach of Egypt&#39;s ruling party, the National Democratic Party (NDP), in what is essentially a highly centralized one party state.  As an illegal movement, the Brotherhoods&#39; supporters can be detained and prosecuted as and when the government deems it necessary.<br /><br />The NDP claims to be on the path to political reform in Egypt and to be committed to expanding democracy.  In practice, the NDP seeks to manipulate and control the political process.  It is happy to give the appearance of the existence of a pluralistic, competitive political system &#8212; after all, democracies should have an opposition &#8212; but it can tolerate only opposition that exists within boundaries set by the state.  The same might be said of the state&#39;s attitude to independent non-governmental organizations.  It will tolerate the existence of such organizations, but only if they comply with a law on associations that provides the government with control over their activities.<br /><br />The Muslim Brotherhood&#39;s participation in elections, sometimes permitted and sometimes banned, is carefully controlled so as to produce a certain number of votes and victorious candidates for them, but not so many as to challenge the NDP&#39;s monopoly on power.  The Brotherhood&#39;s strong showing in the limited number of seats it was permitted to contest in the 2005 parliamentary election gave the NDP an indication of the strength of its popular support, hence the need to weaken its preparation for the next electoral contest, coming up in April.<br /><br />In Egypt, political rights and freedoms flow from the state, not from the people.  The state grants and denies such privileges (not rights) in accordance with its interests and calculations.  This approach is fundamentally at variance with conventional ideas of citizens as rights holders placing concomitant obligations on the state, provided for in international human rights law.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist and British human and medical rights activist <a href="http://medweb.bham.ac.uk/http/depts/clin_neuro/djn.html">Dr. David Nicholl</a>, a neurologist at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, UK, says that Amnesty International&#39;s new <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/AMR51/013/2008/en">report</a> into the rendition and torture of one-time &quot;ghost detainee&quot; Khaled al-Maqtari by the CIA highlights yet again the complicity of doctors in the US detention and rendition process....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/davidnicholl.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>H</strong></font>ow does a torturer know a prisoner being 'waterboarded' is not so close to death that they will die before the tap is turned off?<br /><br />One way is to have a medical professional standing by. The same with beatings, sleep deprivation, starving, extremes of heat and cold, and use of deafening sounds or blinding lights. Enlist the services of a doctor or psychologist and not only can you keep a torture victim alive (if that is your intention), but you can also calibrate their suffering in a way that suits you. And, if things 'go wrong', it's handy to have a doctor who might be prepared to list 'natural causes' on a death certificate as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/140006578X/102-3900667-7832950?v=glance&n=283155">documented in Dr Steve Miles&#39; book &quot;Oath Betrayed&quot;</a>.<br /><br />Not exactly ethical behaviour for anyone, never mind someone sworn to tending the sick, but in fact there's a shameful history of medical collaboration with torture. From medieval cruelty towards the mentally ill centuries ago, to Nazi doctors in WWII and the Dirty War against political opponents in 1970s South America &#8212; a good knowledge of pharmacology and physiology helps aid deliberate assaults on the body and mind by torturers interested in administering measured doses of pain and suffering.<br /><br />Recently there was public shock when a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_yorkshire/7267409.stm">British nurse was convicted of multiple murders</a>. But that was a roundly condemned crime, defended by nobody. Instead, in the USA's 'war on terror', the military and CIA have highly-trained doctors and psychologists working side by side with interrogators and torturers. No one has been punished for these crimes. Here are just a few examples.<br /><br />In the <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1071284,00.html">interrogation log of 'Detainee 063'</a>, the alleged 20th 9/11 hijacker Mohammed Al-Qatani, medics were clearly present throughout his prolonged interrogation. The word 'doctor' is mentioned no less than 45 times during November 2002-January 2003 alone. A 'strap was hung from the ceiling in anticipation of the doctor's arrival', states one entry, and 'medical' interventions included assessments of the detainee's level of hydration and pulse rate to ensure that he was 'physically able to continue' with interrogation.<br /><br />Or take the case of Yemeni <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/manacled-starved-beaten-a-rendition-victims-story-795741.html">Khaled al-Maqtari</a>, detained when US army soldiers raided a suspected arms market in Fallujah, Iraq, in January 2004, arresting at least 60 people. In a <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/AMR51/013/2008/en">report</a> issued this week, Amnesty International says al-Maqtari was initially transferred to the infamous Abu Ghraib prison as an unregistered &quot;ghost detainee&quot; before being rendered to Afghanistan. In late April 2004, he and a number of his fellow detainees were transferred to another CIA &quot;black site&quot;, possibly in Eastern Europe. He was held there for a further 28 months, before being sent to Yemen where he was detained until May 2007 when he was released without charge. He has recounted a regime of beatings, sleep deprivation, suspension upside-down in painful positions, intimidation by dogs, induced hypothermia and other forms of torture. At the secret &quot;black site&quot;, he says he saw at least five doctors or medics and a dentist, as well as half a dozen psychologists. Towards the end of his CIA detention, in 2006, he developed stomach pain and bleeding that left him largely unable to eat solid food, and, in early August 2006, he was taken by plane from the secret detention centre to a distant hospital facility, where he had what he was told was an endoscopy. There were few clues as to the location of the medical facility, but it was likely to have been a considerable distance away from the &quot;black site&quot;. Al-Maqtari first flew on one plane for about five or six hours, then transferred to a second plane, which seemed to fly for some eight hours before landing. After the return flight, about three weeks after his hospital visit, he was taken from the secret detention centre and returned to Yemen and subsequently freed.<br /><br />The human rights group <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/">Reprieve</a> has affidavits from a former 'war on terror' detainee <a href="http://www.globalexchange.org/countries/mideast/palestine/4321.html">Marwan Jabur</a> who was held in various secret prisons from May 2004 until July 2006. These describe the involvement of doctors in secret 'rendition' flights and interrogations without lawyers, as in the al-Maqtari case.<br /><br />As long ago as 2005 the <a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/353/24/2529"><em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> confirmed</a> that doctors at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo Bay were screened to ensure that they had no ethical scruples over force-feeding prisoners at the military prison.<br /><br />Dr John Edmondson, the chief medic at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo from July 2003 to January 2006, was a willing practitioner of a regime of force-feeding scores of prisoners with nasal tubes while they were held down in 'restraint chairs'. For his willingness to disregard an international medical ethical prohibition on force-feeding prisoners, Dr Edmondson earnt a medal for <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/10_03_06_letter.pdf">'inspiring leadership and exemplary performance (which) significantly improved the healthcare for residents of Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo'</a> (as the camp newspaper reported it).<br /><br />Two years ago I and over 250 eminent doctors from around the world <a href="/forumy/2006/06/guantanamo-and-medical-ethics.php">denounced the corruption of medical ethics at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo</a> in <em>The Lancet</em>. Yet, little has changed. More medals have been awarded since Dr Edmondson left Cuba in 2006, and force-feeding at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo under the gaze of military doctors continues to this day. <br /><br />Why do some US military doctors dispense with deep-seated medical-ethical principles and practise torture? It is not that they are 'evil' medics or uniformed 'Doctor Deaths'. All doctors recognise that their first duty is to the patients in their care, but doctors obeying orders are sometimes faced with an acute conflict of interest between the medical needs of their detainee-patients and the orders of their superiors up the military food-chain. The Hippocratic Oath versus their military oath. <br /><br />The American Medical Association guidelines are quite specific. <a href="http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2007/10/pfor2-0710.html">Doctors should neither participate in, nor monitor detainee interrogations</a>. Indeed if 'physicians have reason to believe that interrogations are coercive, they must report their observations to the appropriate authorities'. <br /><br />Overall there is mounting evidence that doctors in the US military and intelligence community have breached their own and international ethical guidelines. These are not isolated incidents and they suggest a c
oncerted programme based on specific orders. The Pentagon's 2006 guidance for medics - <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/231008p.pdf">Medical Program Support for Detainee Operations</a> - makes no explicit mention of the Geneva Conventions. Indeed the guidance notes say that informed patient consent can be ignored on grounds of 'national security-related activity'.<br /><br />That the policy guidelines were written by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Winkenwerder,_Jr.">Dr William Winkenwerder</a> who has no military experience and whose career has been largely spent in the healthcare insurance industry rather than in direct patient care, suggests that ethics weren't exactly a top priority at the Department of Defense.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the US medical establishment appears paralysed. The AMA has failed to take any action against renegade doctors, merely <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140673607618522/fulltext">admitting</a> in <em>The Lancet</em> that it has been 'unable to determine with any certainty whether ethics policies prohibiting physicians' involvement in torture are being adhered to' by the Defense Department. <br /><br />It is time for America's professional medical bodies to denounce its members who use their skills to facilitate torture. Physicians who ill-treat the healthy rather than treat the unhealthy should be drummed out of their profession. <br /><br />They're deserving of criminal investigation, not Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo medals.<br /><br /><br /><em>Dr David Nicholl, MBChB FRCP PhD is a consultant neurologist and honorary senior lecturer at City Hospital Hospital &amp; Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham and the University of Birmingham, England.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.wmitchell.edu/academics/faculty/erlinder.asp">Peter Erlinder</a> of William Mitchell College of Law, attorney on appeal for Dr. Sami Al Arian, says that the treatment accorded the acquitted but still detained academic Palestinian activist from Tampa - now on hunger strike and in danger of irreversible renal failure at a federal prison hospital - is abuse of power amounting to torture taking place in the United States itself under the aegis of the Bush Administration and its &quot;war on terror&quot;... <br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/petererlinder.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he storm of criticism that followed George Bush's weekend veto of Congressional limits on the CIA's use of torture might lead to the conclusion that, reprehensible as "torture" might be in remote, secret CIA locations, it could never happen here in the US. But the Bush administration's abuse of power in its treatment of Dr. Sami al Arian and other acquitted Palestinian "terrorism-defendants" has already demonstrated that "torture" for this administration is commonplace - even here.<br /><br />In December 2005, a Tampa jury acquitted Dr. Al Arian of "terrorism" charges. Two years later he is still in prison, and in the 6th day of a hunger-strike because the Bush administration refuses to honor a May 2006 promise to release and deport him. Unless he receives proper medical care within days, he risks irreversible renal failure and death - all under the watchful eyes of the Bush "Justice" Department. <br /><br />Apparently, "legal black holes" like Guantanamo can be created without having to set-up a special overseas prison, if domestic law can be sufficiently manipulated. And the Bush administration is very, very good at manipulation, both legal and otherwise.<br /><br /><strong>A Propagandized Arrest and Pre-Trial Torture</strong><br /><br />In a February 2003 Moscow press conference, then Attorney-General John Ashcroft breathlessly announced the FBI capture of "the major North American financier for terrorism in the middle-east", in Tampa, Florida, of all places. Ashcroft pointed proudly to obviously, pre-arranged media coverage of a shackled Dr. Sami Al Arian being taken from his home by a SWAT team, with his children cowering in the background.<br /><br />The images were a lot like those of US troops and cowering Iraqi women. But this was not Iraq, or Afghanistan. And Dr. Al Arian was never even suspected of any violence. He was a well-known and well-respected academic and Palestinian activist, and that, the jury concluded more that 2 years later, had been his only "crime." <br /><br />For more than a year before trial, Dr. Al Arian was in Super-Max isolation on 24/7 lockdown. He was denied family visits and was chained whenever he was out of his cell, even to talk to his lawyers. Super-Max prisoners are usually only convicts too violent to live in the general prison population, criminals among criminals. But the Bush administration put Dr. Al Arian in the Super-Max, hundreds of miles from his family, even before the final charges against him had been decided, and without even accusing him of being violent. It was...torture. <br /><br />On top of Guantanamo-like conditions, Dr. Al Arian was denied warm clothing, writing materials and was subject to taunting guards, convinced by Bush administration propaganda that he was a second Osama bin Laden. Things got so bad that the Justice Department Inspector General is investigating abuse by guards. A UN body formally objected to his conditions of confinement before trial. <br /><br />By the beginning of trial in July 2005, the original 200 charges against Dr. Al Arian and his 3 co-defendants were reduced to eliminate any mention of the accusations leveled by Ashcroft. But the remaining 94 "terrorism-related" counts could result in the death penalty or life in prison, including the 17 counts facing Dr. Al Arian, if he had been convicted. But he wasn't convicted, and neither were any of his co-defendants.<br /><br /><strong>Trial By Jury: Still a "Bulwark" Against Government Abuse</strong><br /><br />After hearing 6 months of evidence, including 80 witnesses; hundreds of hours of FISA wiretaps culled from 425,000 conversations recorded over 10 years; testimony of Israeli intelligence agents; heart-wrenching testimony of Israeli suicide bombing victims; graphic video of suffering bombing victims; and more than $50 million in taxpayer money being thrown at the case, the jury refused to find any of the defendants guilty of anything! <br /><br />Dr. Al Arian's lawyers, Linda Moreno and Bill Moffett, did not call one witness or put on one piece of evidence. The defense was the First Amendment right to free speech and the lack of any connection between Dr. Al Arian's lawful support for the Palestinian struggle in the U.S. and the tragic violence connected to Israel's illegal occupation of Palestine. <br /><br />On December 2005 TIME Magazine called Dr. Al Arian's acquittal "the biggest defeat for the Bush Administration to date" [1], and so it was. It was also a victory for the United States Constitution. The Tampa jury upheld the best traditions of our Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial, that is supposed to be a "bulwark" against misuse of governmental power. <br /><br />For a while it seemed that the Constitution was actually working the way it was supposed to, but the Bush administration made sure that this illusion did not last for long. Within days, the administration said they were going to re-try Dr. Al Arian on the lesser charges on which the jury "hung" 10-2 for acquittal. Re-trial is not illegal, but highly unusual when the evidence was so clearly rejected by the jury. <br /><br />But at the same time the Bush administration was telling the world they would try Dr. Al Arian again, they secretly approached Al Arian's lawyers with "an offer he couldn't refuse" in early 2006 to avoid government being embarrassed by another acquittal.<br /><br /><strong>Setting the Trap: "An Offer He Couldn't Refuse"</strong><br /><br />The Bush-administration promised to: (a) drop all charges; (b) release Dr. Al Arian in 30 days; and (c) assist in deporting him to country of his choice, immediately upon his release. Compared to the death penalty or life in prison that he had been facing weeks earlier, it was a difficult offer to turn down but he did precisely that, because there were a couple of "catches" he and his lawyers refused to accept.<br /><br />First, he would have to plead guilty to a crime, and he had not committed any crimes. Second, the standard Tampa plea-agreement had a "grand jury co-operation" clause, and Dr. Al Arian would not agree to either. The Bush administration panicked and sweetened their offer. <br /><br />If Dr. Al Arian would only admit having helped his brother-in-law with immigration matters, and not telling a reporter about a colleague's political associations, both of which were true, and neither of which were crimes, the Bush-administration would agree call the legal, non-violent acts evidence of a "conspiracy," and recommend his release by the end of May 2006. <br /><br />But Dr. Al Arian and his lawyers still said "no-deal" because he absolutely refused to "co-operate" with a Bush Justice Department that had set him up and prosecuted him for political reasons. So the Bush-administration "blinked" again, because they needed to avoid another embarrassing defeat.<br /><br />This time, they removed the "grand jury co-operation" requirement because, as they admitted in court, it was only way to get his name on the dotted line. They also admitted, in court on April 14, that the terms of their agreement with Al Arian had been approved in Washington, D.C. and specifically applied to Alexandria, Virginia, the federal district where most of the Pentagon's employees live and a favorite place
 for grand-jury "terrorism" investigations. <br /><br /><strong>The "Trap" Begins to Close</strong><br /><br />But when Dr. Al Arian appeared in court on May 1, 2006, expecting the agreement to become final, and to be released before the month was out, the game changed. Judge James Moody agreed to immediate deportation (which means neither the judge or the Bush-administration considered him dangerous) and all other charges were dropped. Instead of time-served release and deportation, the judge sentenced him to the constitutional maximum sentence, another year in prison, and read a prepared statement publicly declaring him guilty of "killing women and children in Israel." <br /><br />In essence, the judge convicted Dr. Al Arian of the same violent offenses that the jury had rejected. Several of the jurors went public after the sentencing hearing expressing outrage that the judge had ignored their verdict. So much for the Sixth Amendment. <br /><br />Instead of beginning a new life in May 2006, as the Bush Administration led him to believe would happen, Dr. Al Arian would be in prison until April 2007. But there was no reason to think that the Bush administration was actually manipulating the legal system...yet.<br /><br /><strong>The Bush Administration's Post-Acquittal "Torture-Strategy"</strong> <br /><br />On May 10, 2006 the "trap" snapped shut when the Assistant U.S. Attorney in Alexandria sought a secret order calling Dr. Al Arian before the very Alexandria grand jury that the Tampa prosecutor said had been covered by the "no grand jury cooperation" agreement. Neither Dr. Al Arian nor his lawyers knew about the secret order until October 2006, when AUSA Gordon Kromberg informed them Dr. Al Arian would be brought before the grand jury - during Ramadan.<br /><br />When Dr. Al Arian appeared before the grand jury and relied on the "no-grand jury cooperation" promise, Judge Lee held him in contempt of court, and he was in contempt detention until December 2007, when the grand jury expires, which effectively extended original May 2006 release until April 7, 2008, two years after the Bush administration promised he would be released and deported.<br /><br /><strong>Last Week: Another Turn of the Screw</strong><br /><br />On March 3, 2008 AUSA Kromberg turned the torture screw up another notch, when Dr. Al Arian was brought back to court and informed that he would be called before yet another grand jury on March 19, 2008, this time only 3 weeks before his latest release and deportation date. If he insists on the Bush administration respecting its "no-grand jury cooperation" promise again, he is likely to be held in contempt again, which will effectively cancel the April release date and extend his time in prison again&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;indefinitely. And, he has to insist on it because terms of the plea agreement "contract" are still on appeal, a Catch-22, if there ever was one.<br /><br />But, there is a more sinister manipulation in the works. AUSA Kromberg has charged other acquitted Palestinian defendants with perjury, when they did testify before his grand jury. Other acquitted Palestinian defendants have been charged with "obstruction of justice,&quot; when they declined. Dr. Al Arian's lawyer, George Washington Univesity law professor Jon Turley has said that Kromberg is "setting up Al Arian for a perjury/obstruction trap." The other acquitted Palestinian defendants facing the same "Hobson's choice" have been given "terrorism-enhanced" sentences of 5 to 10 years whether they answered grand jury questions or not after American juries already acquitted them of the underlying charges. Imprisoned for a decade after being acquitted certainly could be called "torture", or at least "Kafka-esque."<br /><br />Neither Alberto Gonzalez, nor &quot;General Mukasey&quot; (as he apparently referred to in White House circles) have done anything to rein in this misuse of prosecutorial power, but neither have the Courts nor the Democrat-controlled Senate and House Judiciary Committees even though both Chairmen, Sen. Leahy and Cong. Conyers, were made aware of this blatant manipulation of prosecutorial power, for apparently political purposes, more than a year ago. <br /><br /><strong>Dr. Al Arian's Last Protest Fast</strong><br /><br />But now, the Bush administration, the Courts and Congressional oversight committees have a chance to intervene.  On March 4, 2008, the day after the "perjury/obstruction" trap was sent by Kromberg, Dr. Al Arian began a complete food and water fast to protest, in the only way he can, the perfidy of the Bush administration, and the "torture" caused by its rejection of the constitution and abuse of its power. <br /><br />This is Dr. Al Arian's third hunger-strike during his 5 years of imprisonment.  The first was in 2005 and lasted 140 days on liquids only, before he was permitted the lawyers of his choice.  In early 2006 he drank only water for 60 days, when the court refused to require the Bush-administration to honor their "no grand jury cooperation" promise, the first time.  Now, he is refusing all food and liquids was transferred to the prison hospital on March 5. But he is not getting necessary medical treatment.  <br /><br />As of Monday, March 10, Dr. Al Arian has not received any intravenous liquids, and he is in danger of irreversible renal failure - yet another kind of torture, that could be ended with proper medical care.  If Dr. Al Arian dies, AUSA Kromberg will have accomplished his stated  "mission", so the question is, will anybody else respond, before it is too late?<br /><br /><strong>End the Torture of Dr. Al Arian Now!</strong><br /><br />Between now and his April 7, 2008 release/deportation date, Kromberg will have to bring Dr. Al-Arian before the grand jury on a stretcher, kept alive by IV's, assuming he receives proper treatment in the next day or two. Unless, of course, the Congress, the Courts or Mukasey put an end to the torture he has so far been subjected to.  While Mukasey or Bush could release Al Arian with the stroke of a pen. Bush&#39;s veto of the torture limitation bill is an indication that Dr. Al Arian's own torture will not be ended without the intervention of the Congress, the Courts, or the American people.<br /><br />The torture of Dr. Al Arian is not "water-boarding," nor the "enhanced interrogation techniques" that Bush says is now part of America's regular way of doing business&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;but it is "torture" nonetheless.  The Bush veto on Saturday demonstrates the Bush-Cheney "war on terror" is not really about terrorism at all, but is a politically-motivated assault directed against the constitution and the rule of law.  <br /><br />A government that is unwilling to publicly renounce torture committed in its name, and in the name of the American people, is capable of doing anything, to anybody, at any time, and the Al Arian case is a prime example of a lawless regime displaying itself to the world.[2] The Al Arian case is not law, it is politics...and torture.  It is time for Congress, the Courts and the American people to put an end to the legal torture of Dr. Al Arian, now.<br /><br />Release him!                                      <br /><br /><font SIZE=2 style='font-size: 8pt'>(c) 2008 Peter Erlinder. <br /><br />Notes<br /><br />[1] TIME Magazine, December 19, 2005, &quot;When Terrorism Charges Just Won't Stick&quot;<br /><br />[2] The Al Arian case is the subject of <em>USA v.

		<title>Democracy Day in Pakistan: No Pardon for Musharraf</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php">Ali Khan</a> of Washburn University School of Law says that the new Pakistani parliament should prosecute Pervez Musharraf for crimes committed against the constitution and people of Pakistan, and resist any pressure to pardon him directly or indirectly by law or by promise of safe passage into exile, perhaps in the United States...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/alikhan.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>P</strong></font>akistan&#39;s newly-elected Parliament meets on Monday, March 17, to form a new government. Monday is &quot;democracy day&quot; ending the eight years of military rule. Former Army Chief Pervez Musharraf, however, refuses to step down and claims to be the nation&#39;s lawful President. Close to a two-thirds majority of the Parliament and an overwhelming majority of lawyers of Pakistan see Musharraf as a usurper. Facing a hostile Parliament and an uncompromising Bar, Musharraf would offer to make a deal. He would relinquish power if he could safely leave the country (and perhaps fly away to the United States). <br /><br />This essay argues that Pakistan&#39;s Parliament must not pardon Musharraf, openly or secretly. The people of Pakistan want their day in court. <br /><br /><strong>Musharaff&#39;s Crimes</strong><br /><br />The lawyers of Pakistan see Musharraf as a criminal who unlawfully occupies the nation&#39;s highest office. Musharraf has committed numerous crimes. Two, however, stand out. On November 3, 2007, Musharraf suspended the Constitution exercising the non-existent powers of the Army Chief. Neither the Constitution, national laws, nor the Military Code confers power on the Army Chief to proclaim emergency and suspend the Constitution. Musharraf has presumptively committed the constitutional crime of high treason and his continuing occupation of the office of President is unlawful.<br /><br />The Constitution mandates that the Parliament &quot;by law provide for the punishment of persons found guilty of high treason.&quot; In exercising this power, however, the Parliament must respect international standards and the national criminal justice system that confer numerous rights on criminal defendants. Article 10 of the Constitution, which Musharraf suspended during the November 2007 Proclamation of Emergency, requires that the person in custody be &quot;informed of the grounds for such arrest. . . and not be denied the right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice.&quot;<br /><br />In addition to perpetrating the crime of high treason, Musharraf committed the crime of massacre. In July, 2007, after prolonging a manufactured showdown with seminarians in the Red Mosque located in Islamabad, Musharraf ordered the killings of innocent men, women, and children trapped within the Mosque. In asserting the rule of law, the Supreme Court ordered an investigation of the massacre. Compounding his crime, Musharraf charged the Supreme Court with supporting terrorism. And exercising the non-existent powers of the Army Chief, Musharraf fired and arrested numerous top judges of the high courts, including the Chief Justice who still has not been freed. Musharraf&#39;s lawyers will have to explain to the trial court whether the Army Chief, in committing the crime of massacre, has the authority to openly subvert the integrity and dignity of the judiciary. <br /><br /><strong>Resisting Foreign Pressure</strong><br /><br />In prosecuting Musharraf for high treason and other crimes, the new Pakistani government might come under some foreign pressure to pardon Musharraf. Except for the United States, however, many nations would see Musharraf&#39;s criminal prosecution as Pakistan&#39;s internal matter. European nations will not support a despised dictator. China rarely caters to losers and is unlikely to raise the issue with the new government. Saudi Arabia will not rescue a self-appointed reformer of Islam. India will only harm Musharraf if it supports him. <br /><br />That leaves the United States in the field alone. The Bush administration may pressure Pakistan&#39;s new government to pardon Musharraf. Soon after the February elections, Bush encouraged Musharraf to stay as Pakistan&#39;s Head of the State. That commitment has now dramatically weakened, and rightfully so. The United States cannot risk alienating the people of Pakistan and the new government for the sake of a former dictator who has lost the military uniform, popularity, and constitutional legitimacy. For pragmatic American policymakers, Musharraf has outlived his utility; and the time is ripe to ditch a useless operator. <br /><br />As a possible favor to Musharraf, the Bush administration might ask the new government for his safe exit to the United States. Many in the Bush administration, however, will vote against pressuring the new government to do so because Musharraf has been a duplicitous ally, frequently caught running with the hare and hunting with the hounds. Certainly Musharraf has killed Muslim militants in Pakistan but not in sufficient numbers to have earned a White House medal of gratitude.<br /><br />Suppose the Bush administration coerces the new Pakistani government to furnish a safe passage for Musharraf. In such a case, Pakistan&#39;s democracy must resist pressure, assert its sovereignty, and persuade the Bush administration that Musharraf&#39;s prosecution for high treason will support and not hurt US interests. If Musharraf is prosecuted for constitutional subversion without American interference, the people of Pakistan will appreciate American commitment to democracy in the Muslim world. If persuasion does not work, saying no to Bush is good for America and a matter of self-respect for Pakistan. <br /><br />In sum, strong democracies punish constitutional subversions but week democracies do not. And by punishing constitutional subversions, democracies are further strengthened. Pakistan needs to make a strong decision. Fortunately, the usurper is positioned as a sitting duck. He has lost all covers that shielded his raw powers. He is no longer the Army Chief, and cannot order the armed forces to stand behind him. The &quot;King&#39;s Party&quot; that propped his lawlessness for years cannot help for it has been thoroughly defeated in the general elections. The Constitution cannot guard Musharraf because Musharraf, as the President&#39;s oath requires, did not &quot;preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.&quot; He should be called to account.<br /><br /><br /><em>Ali Khan is professor of law at Washburn University School of Law in Topeka, Kansas, and the author of the book, <em>A Theory of Universal Democracy</em> (2003).

		<title>The GOP Candidates&#039; Judicial Selection Views</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.richmond.edu/faculty/tobias.htm">Carl Tobias</a> of the University of Richmond School of Law says that although all the Republican presidential candidates have recited the GOP litany regarding appointments demanded of every serious contender, John McCain&#39;s judicial selection record warrants more evaluation...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/carltobias.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>O</strong></font>n Tuesday, Republicans in Ohio, Rhode Island, Texas and Vermont will vote in the presidential primary. One essential constitutional responsibility that presidents discharge is to "nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, appoint" federal judges, including most importantly Supreme Court Justices. Judicial selection has taken on peculiar salience for the next chief executive because the 44th president will probably name multiple Justices to the sharply-divided Supreme Court. Therefore, it is crucial that voters understand the positions which Republican candidates have assumed on appointments.<br /><br />Judicial selection has figured prominently in Republican Party strategy for federal elections since 2000, mainly because the GOP leadership thinks that the issue appeals to its base. The four Republican presidential candidates differ minimally in their views on this process. All four have recited the GOP litany regarding appointments demanded of every serious contender.<br /><br />Because Senator John McCain is now the clear frontrunner, his judicial selection record warrants more evaluation. McCain has invoked the right-wing Republican Party mantras about the process. For instance, the candidate has stated that &quot;one of the greatest threats to our liberty [and] our freedoms is willful judges who legislate from the bench&quot; and has praised President George W. Bush for naming justices &quot;who strictly interpret the Constitution.&quot; McCain has concomitantly vowed to select judges who interpret the Constitution and laws and do not "impose their own view as to the best policy choices" or become &quot;liberal judicial activists.&quot;<br /><br />McCain has also taken the mandatory pledge to nominate Supreme Court Justices who closely resemble Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justices Samuel Alito, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. For instance, the candidate observed that he had "strongly supported John Roberts and Samuel Alito for the Supreme Court," who had demonstrated fidelity to the Constitution, and "that is why I would seek men and women like them as judicial appointees." <br /><br />Numerous conservatives attack McCain for helping fashion the "Gang of 14." This collection of senators' 2005 effort stopped the Republican majority from setting off the "nuclear option," that would have prevented filibusters of judicial nominees. McCain opponents fail to remember that this work prevented the Senate from filibustering Justice Alito. Moreover, the endeavor fostered the prompt confirmation of several conservative judges, such as D. C. Circuit Judge Janice Rogers Brown and Fifth Circuit Judge Priscilla Owen.<br /><br />McCain as well has been attacked for working with Democrats. However, reaching across the aisle may benefit conservatives in the near term. If Democrats win the presidency and increase their Senate majority this fall, conservatives will thank McCain and the Gang for the ability to filibuster nominees whom they find overly liberal.<br /><br />Candidate Mike Huckabee has remarked: "The role of a judge is to interpret the law, not to legislate from the bench; and as president, I will only appoint men and women who share this view." He correspondingly pledged to "appoint justices and judges who not only share my judicial philosophy (e.g., Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Antonin Scalia, Justice Clarence Thomas, and Justice Samuel Alito), but who also have established themselves within the conservative legal community as faithful adherents of originalism and textualism."<br /><br />Candidate Ron Paul remarked that he "would only appoint federal judges who hold a strict constructionist view of the Constitution, and respected every provision of the Constitution, including the second, ninth, and 10th amendments." Moreover, the candidate promised to "work with Congress to pass legislation limiting federal jurisdiction over issues that the founders intended to be resolved by the states, local government and the people."<br /><br />When Ohio, Rhode Island, Texas and Vermont Republican residents vote in Tuesday's primary, they must seriously consider the candidates' views on the important responsibility of federal judicial selection. The perspectives which they have articulated are remarkably similar. The appointments record compiled by Senator McCain, the clear favorite, suggests that he nominally departs from the other candidates' views. Indeed, McCain might rectify or temper the accusations and countercharges and divisive partisanship that have attended selection through cooperation with Democrats, who will probably enhance their Senate majority this autumn.<br /><br /><br /><em>Carl Tobias is the Williams Professor of Law at the University of Richmond</em><br />

		<title>Different Justice at the UN Rwanda War Crimes Court</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.wmitchell.edu/academics/faculty/erlinder.asp">Peter Erlinder</a> of William Mitchell College of Law, lead defense counsel in the Military-1 Trial at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and president of the <em>Association des Avocats de la Defence</em> (ADAD), the ICTR defense lawyers association, says that a recent UN-sanctioned agreement to turn prisoners convicted of war crimes at the UN&#39;s International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda over to a Rwandan government led by men who themselves have been indicted for war crimes shows that the standards of justice at the ICTR are very different from what they are at the ICTY in The Hague, or anywhere else...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/petererlinder.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font> major event in United Nations history - and international law - occurred this week at a public ceremony in Rwanda's capital, and the world hardly noticed.<br /><br />For the first time, the United Nations agreed to turn UN prisoners over to indicted war criminals. But the press and defenders of international human rights in North America and Europe appeared not to have taken note of the &quot;historic&quot; moment. Which all goes to show that the concept of &quot;justice&quot; at the UN-ICTR, as compared to the ICTY at The Hague, is...different. <br /><br />Last Tuesday, UN-ICTR representative Roland Amossouga officially designated President Kagame's Rwanda as one of the UN member states to which UN prisoners might be sent, despite the indictment of 40 members of the top Rwandan government leadership for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide during the 1994 Rwanda War by a Spanish high court judge only one month earlier. <br /><br />On February 6, 2008, Judge Fernando Andreu issued a 182-page indictment detailing crimes committed by Rwandan President Kagame and members of his military, including the murder of some 320,000 civilians during the Rwandan Civil War&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;and more than 4 million in the Congo. INTERPOL warrants have been issued for their arrest. Kagame and company had already been indicted in late 2006 by French Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere for the assassination of Rwanda's previous president (who was the leader all the convicted ICTR defendants in the Rwandan Civil War), the act of aggression which touched off what is known as the "Rwandan Genocide."<br /><br />All this would seem to make the UN knowingly complicit in the crimes alleged in the Spanish and French indictments. <br /><br />At best, it is hard to explain - it is unthinkable that the ICTY would have turned Croat, Bosnian or Kosovar prisoners over the Milosevic government when he was under indictment! But "justice" at the ICTR, as compared to the ICTY, is...different. <br /><br />And this was not the only "history-making" part of the UN initiative to ship UN prisoners to Rwanda last week.<br /><br />This was also the first time in history that the United Nations has voluntarily begun the process of transferring vanquished former war-time enemies to the hands of the victors in a civil war, the exact equivalent of the ICTY publicly agreeing to send Serb prisoners to Croatia, Bosnia&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;or Kosovo to do their time, or vice versa! Unthinkable in Europe - but, at the ICTR, "justice" has a meaning that is...different. And no one in the "human rights world" seems to be paying attention, or saying a word.<br /><br />Of course, the UN designation of "acceptability" does not necessarily mean that UN-ICTR prisoners (none of Kagame's supporters have been charged at the ICTR itself, for political reasons explained by former ICTR Prosecutor Del Ponte) actually will be delivered to the care of their former enemies. Other countries who have agreed to accept ICTR include Switzerland, France, Sweden, Italy, Benin and Mali. ICTR President Judge Dennis Byron must designate the eventual site of each defendant's incarceration, so no one has actually been sent to Rwanda - yet.<br /><br />The President of the ICTY has a choice of countries to send convicted defendants too. As a result, Serb, Croat, Bosnian and Kosovar defendants at the ICTY are serving sentences in prisons all over Europe. But, no Serbs have been sent to Croatia, no Croats or Bosnians to Serbia, etc. I guess this is because the civilized human rights world would be shocked at the suggestion that UN prisoners should be delivered into the tender care of their sworn enemies But, at the ICTR, things are...different.<br /><br />The UN-ICTY prisoners know they will not be delivered to the hands of their former enemies, and that long-term incarceration will be in "first world" conditions, somewhere in Europe. To date, not one UN-ICTR prisoner has been sent to a European prison and all have ended ended up in a remote desert prison in Mali for life - or the UN Detention Center connected to the Tribunal for shorter sentences. <br /><br />So, the designation of Rwanda might be seen as an "humanitarian" act. There are no deserts in Rwanda and the Kagame government has made a great show of providing the best detention facilities in Africa, which they have. But the UN sending its prisoners to Kagame's "care" ignored political reality: these are all sworn war-time enemies, and Kagame's government is facing multiple war crimes indictments for how he and his army fought that war by massive killings of opponents and civilians. <br /><br />The nagging problem of what will happen to Kagame's former wartime opponents, once the UN actually turns them over to his "care," is anyone's guess. But the multiple French and Spanish indictments detailing brutal killings by Kagame&#39;s own troops on a massive scale, for which only his former enemies have been blamed at the ICTR so far, provide a pretty good indication what the UN prisoners can expect.<br /><br />When George Bush visited Kagame only 2 weeks after the Spanish indictment issued, he ignored both the Spanish and French indictments, as UN-ICTR officials apparently did this week. Given President Bush's apparent lack of respect for the rule of law and the existence of long-standing US military ties with Kagame, this might be understandable in "political" terms. But, the "history-making" UN-ICTR endorsement of the victors in the Rwanda War, despite the Spanish and French indictments, is a bit harder to understand. Unless, of course, "justice" at the ICTR means something...different. <br /><br />Could this huge disparity between standards at the ICTY and the ICTR be explained because the UN-ICTR is "Africa"? Or, is it because, as former ICTR Prosecutor Carla Del Ponte has explained, the UN-ICTR has created impunity for U.S. allies, while vilifying their opponents? In either case, the result is the same. <br /><br />At the ICTR, "justice" means something&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;different, and no one seems to be paying attention or saying a word. <br /><br />The dark stain of "manufactured impunity" for allies of the Superpower is spreading across the previously "clean" tablet upon which UN tribunals are supposedly writing new standards for international criminal law. "UN-manufactured impunity" at the UN-ICTR is rapidly becoming a public embarrassment, as member states are forced to take up the prosecutorial function that has been blocked by the US and UK at the ICTR, according to Prosecutor Del Ponte. <br /><br />And it will be an embarrassment of historic proportions if the human rights community and UN member states do not begin speaking out to put an end to the UN- ICTR charade that, as Carla Del Ponte has said, &quot;...ridicule(s) the principles of international justice...&quot;. <br /><br /><br /><font SIZE=2 style='font-size: 8pt'>(c) 2008 Peter Erlinder. <br /><br />Notes<br /><br />[1] Hartmann, Florence, <em>Paix et chatiment: les guerres del la politique</em> (Flammarion, Paris, Sept. 2007

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Roland Amoussouga, Spokesperson and Senior Legal Adviser at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), says that the recent United Nations agreement with Rwanda over the detention in Rwanda of convicted ICTR prisoners is simply an agreement with the country&#39;s lawful government on any sentences that may be served in Rwanda, and does not, as contended by ICTR defense counsel Peter Erlinder in a previous JURIST <em>Forum</em> op-ed, constitute an agreement by the United Nations to hand over UN prisoners to indicted war criminals...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/rolandamoussouga.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>s Spokesperson of the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, to whom your guest columnist Peter Erlinder of William Mitchell College of Law, Lead Counsel in the Military 1 Trial at the ICTR, refers to in his recent JURIST op-ed entitled <a href="/forumy/2008/03/different-justice-at-un-rwanda-war.php">Different Justice at the UN Rwanda War Crimes Court</a>, as having officially designated President Kagame's Rwanda as one of the UN member states to which UN prisoners might be sent, I wish to exercise my right to respond to some of the factual inaccuracies contained in Professor Erlinder&#39;s commentary<br /><br />Prof. Erlinder informed your readers that last week the United Nations agreed to hand over UN prisoners to indicted war criminals. The United Nations did no such thing. What the United Nations did is sign an agreement with the lawful government of Rwanda that will govern any sentences that may be served in Rwanda. As a result of his Commentary, your readers may not be so well informed. Furthermore, allowing falsehoods to be propagated about ICTR without immediate vigorous response would certainly harm the historical accuracy of information that ought to be disseminated in academia and throughout the world.<br /><br />As far as the signing of the agreement between the United Nations and the Government of Rwanda for the enforcement of the ICTR sentences is concerned, I would like to state the following:<ul><li>The negotiation process which led to the signing of the said Agreement was initiated more than three years ago;<br /><br /><li>The final text of the Agreement was duly cleared by the UN Secretariat in accordance with the statutory provisions of the ICTR;<br /><br /><li>It may appear paradoxical that finalizing the said Agreement took much longer than for the other six countries (Mali, Benin, Swaziland, France, Sweden and Italy) that have signed similar Agreements with the United Nations. More so when one reads Article 26 of the ICTR Statute, it seems to suggest that Rwanda is the primary destination for the execution of sentences of all persons convicted by ICTR; <br /><br /><li>The signing of the Agreement marks a milestone in the cooperation between the ICTR and Rwanda. Rwanda has made significant progress in terms of standard of prisons to accommodate ICTR's convicts. This Agreement appears as the last brick completing the legal framework which designates Rwanda as one of the countries that may be deemed suitable for the enforcement of sentences handed down by ICTR; <br /><br /><li>Many people including Rwandans have claimed that Rwanda should be the exclusive destination of ICTR's convicts, if one wants to give meaning to the maxim according to which "&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;justice must be seen to be done"; <br /><br /><li>The Security Council decided that in respect of the former Yugoslavia, no convict would serve his/her sentence in his/her country of origin. So was it; <br /><br /><li>As for Rwanda, the United Nations' position was very clear. The Council under Article 26 of the ICTR Statute decided that "Imprisonment shall be served in Rwanda or any of the States on a list of States which have indicated to the Security Council their willingness to accept convicted persons, as designated by the International Tribunal for Rwanda". This of course, does not mean that Rwanda is forbidden to make its case as the priority place of service of sentence for ICTR convicts; <br /><br /><li>In any event, it will be up to the judges of ICTR, and particularly the President, based on the merits of each case, to decide where the sentences will be served; <br /><br /><li>The parameters to be taken into account when deciding the country for the enforcement of sentences are now known. They are set forth in a directive issued since May 2000 by the then President of ICTR. The satisfaction of the victims is important but it is not the only factor determinative of the choice of the place of service of sentence. The whereabouts of the family of the convict are also a factor, as well as many others, designed to protect competing interests;<br /> <br /><li>The bottom line is that imprisonment, as a sanction meted out by criminal justice, is not meant to entail any other punishment than the deprivation of the right to move about freely. All other rights of the convict should be left untouched, insofar as they are compatible with the regime of detention. The United Nations Organization is bound to uphold this understanding.</ul>The Agreement in question is similar to those signed with several other states. Let me tell you what it says. The Agreement governs any request that may be made in the future to the Rwandan government to enforce a sentence. The procedure set out is that the Registrar with the approval of the President [presently Sir Dennis Byron, former Chief Justice of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court] has to first make a request to the Government of Rwanda to enforce a sentence. Then the Government of Rwanda has to agree. <br /><br />If this process occurs &#8212; the Agreement says nothing about whether it will &#8212; then the Agreement binds Rwanda in a number of ways. The Agreement binds the Rwandan government as to the duration of sentence, the exact place where it is served, the conditions of imprisonment &#8212; they must be in accordance with international standards &#8212; regular inspection by the Red Cross. The Red Cross reports its findings to the President of the Tribunal. The Tribunal can decide at any time to terminate the service of the sentence in Rwanda and transfer the prisoner to another state or back to the Tribunal. <br /><br />At the end of the sentence the Agreement provides for the prisoner to be transferred at United Nations expense to a country other than Rwanda where he or she is lawfully resident. Any repudiation of the Agreement by the country is delayed by the Agreement for enough time to allow the prisoner to be transferred to another state or the Tribunal. <br /><br />With respect to the assertion of Professor Erlinder as regards the fact that (and I quote) ''To date, not one UN-ICTR prisoner has been sent to a European prison and all have ended up in a remote desert prison in Mali for life-or the UN Detention Center connected to the Tribunal for shorter sentences", it is my submission that such a statement is grossly inaccurate and misleading. The facts of the matter could be summarized as follows:<ul><li> Out of the six convicted persons who are currently serving their sentences in Mali since 9 December 2001, 4 of them were sentenced to life imprisonment, one to 25 years of imprisonment and one to 15 years of imprisonment. It is worth noting that the Koulikoro and Bamako Central prisons in Mali are not located in desert areas as Prof Erlinder has unfortunately claimed. Prof. Erlinder's assertion that ICTR convicts suffer poor conditions in a desert prison in Mali is unsupported by the reports of neutral international observers. The conditions of imprisonment there are subject to inspections by the Red Cross. The United Nations specifically spent a great deal of money bringing the African facilities up to international standards;<br /><br /><li>Another convicted person
has started since 28 February 2008 serving his sentence in the prison of Voghera (Pavia, Italy), which is by the way in Europe.</ul>Moreover, the "indicted war criminals" referred to by Prof. Erlinder is the lawful Government of Rwanda, fully recognized as such by member States of the United Nations including Prof. Erlinder's own government. <br /><br />Finally, it is worth recalling that the UN Security Council, in setting up the Tribunal, mandated that sentences would be served in Rwanda or in a State that had indicated to the Security Council willingness to accept convicts. Such imprisonment is expressly made subject to supervision by the Tribunal, a subordinate organ of the Security Council. <br /><br /><br /><em>Roland Amoussouga is Spokesperson and Senior Legal Adviser for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha, Tanzania</em><br />

		<title>The California Marriage Case and the Mainstreaming of Gay Rights</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.ucla.edu/home/index.asp?page=2497">Douglas NeJaime</a> of UCLA School of Law says that in the California marriage case the state&#39;s lawyers are attempting a difficult balancing act between an increasingly institutionalized pro-gay perspective held by those at the highest level of state government and the state's own marriage restriction, itself a remnant of ideas that have been displaced by these new pro-gay principles...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/dougnejaime.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>t might be easy to view the marriage equality case heard by the California Supreme Court last week as just another in a long string of similar challenges across the US. After all, we've seen this show many times before, from New England and the Mid-Atlantic to the Midwest and the West Coast. This case, however, differs in a significant way that might suggest an emerging trajectory for marriage challenges: procreation and parenting were barely mentioned until a whole three hours into the oral argument. It took the presentations of private social conservative advocacy groups to put arguments based on procreation and childrearing before the court.<br /><br />The California marriage dispute represents the consolidation of six separate cases &#8212; three challenges by same-sex couples to the denial of marriage licenses, a suit by the city and county of San Francisco challenging the state's marriage restriction, and two actions by groups seeking declarations that California's marriage laws are constitutional. While the legal standing of social conservative groups Proposition 22 Legal Defense and Education Fund and the Campaign for California Families served as a significant side issue at the trial and appellate levels, all the interested parties eventually made their way to the California Supreme Court, where four attorneys argued for the petitioners &#8212; those seeking the right to marry for same-sex couples &#8212; and four attorneys argued for the respondents &#8212; those defending the state's restriction.<br /><br />The California Deputy Attorney General, Christopher Krueger, barely uttered "May it please the Court," before Justice Kennard noted at length that the petitioners presented a fairly unified front, while those in favor of the respondents were in seeming disarray. Justice Kennard distinguished between "the state entities," which included the Attorney General's office and Governor Schwarzenegger's attorney, and "the private entities," which included Proposition 22 Legal Defense and Education Fund and the Campaign for California Families.<br /><br />As Justice Kennard and her colleagues probed further, we learned that the state entities were willing to submit three main arguments in favor of the state's marriage restriction: tradition, legislative primacy, and the will of the people. The state entities were not willing to argue that the marriage restriction is reasonable to further responsible procreation, to provide an optimum environment for rearing children, or to protect or promote marriage between different-sex couples. And now we arrive at the exact reason that the private entities clung so fiercely to a place in the litigation &#8212; to put before the court arguments that they saw as justifying the restriction on marriage yet not advanced by the state's attorneys.<br /><br />Exposing these divergent positions appeared to undermine the state's position on multiple levels. The private entities presented arguments that even the most conservative justices found specious, including, for instance, the notion that the marriage restriction is necessary to ensure integration of the sexes. The private entities also presented a view of marriage as a universal, invaluable status and as vital to families and children. This stood in stark contrast to the state's attempt to minimize the symbolic differences between marriage and domestic partnership. Indeed, after the Campaign for California Families' presentation on the significance of marriage, Justice Chin, half in jest, asked the San Francisco Deputy City Attorney, "Did he just make your argument for you?" More interesting than these various moments in the argument and what they might mean for the court's decision, though, is what the inconsistencies between the state and private entities demonstrate on a broader scale. They serve as first-hand evidence of the installation of pro-gay decision-makers in official state positions and the mainstreaming of gay centrist positions.<br /><br />In previous marriage equality cases, the state willingly advanced or allowed arguments based on procreation and childrearing. In New York, the state's highest court relied primarily on these arguments to uphold the state's restriction. The New Jersey appellate court credited these ideas before reversal by the state supreme court. And in Massachusetts, the dissent strongly appealed to responsible procreation and the value of different-sex parents. Yet in California, the state made none of these arguments.<br /><br />The state's unwillingness to argue from procreation and childrearing makes sense as a matter of demographic reality; as the Williams Institute has shown, and as Chief Justice George pointed out, approximately 30% of same-sex couples in California are raising children. Yet recognition of demographics cannot account for this shift. After all, Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey certainly had a significant portion of children being raised by same-sex couples.<br /><br />The state's reluctance also makes sense in light of a domestic partnership statute that provides practically all the substantive benefits and obligations of marriage and numerous court decisions recognizing the ability of same-sex couples to parent effectively. Yet the law does not recognize actual marriage, and this certainly is tied up in normative notions of family. Moreover, other states have pro-gay law and policy. New Jersey's comprehensive domestic partnership scheme and favorable family law posture did not prevent the appeal to arguments from procreation and childrearing in that state.<br /><br />Rather, to fully understand the state's position, we must look to a shift in mainstream thought characterized by an increasingly institutionalized pro-gay perspective that hews to a gay centrist paradigm of coupling, parenting, and general respectability. What were once considered controversial, left/progressive positions, and what still constitute the dreaded "homosexual agenda" in social conservative circles, are now mainstream ideas held by those at the highest level of state government. And yet these same state decision-makers are charged with defending the state's marriage restriction, itself a remnant of ideas that have been displaced by these new pro-gay principles. It is a difficult balancing act that the state's advocates now attempt. Indeed, Mr. Krueger's seeming discomfort at the podium as he defended the state's marriage restriction perhaps best typifies the uneasy ground on which the state now stands. The fact that the Governor was represented by a separate attorney before the court, rather than Mr. Krueger, only underscores the fine lines being drawn within the state.<br /><br />Lesbians and gay men have made great strides in debunking harmful stereotypes and proving themselves capable citizens, yet the state still attempts to uphold restrictions that burden their participation. We just might find that it is impossible to defend such restrictions when those charged with the task are unwilling to appeal to the actual justifications animating them.<br /><br /><br /><em>Douglas NeJaime is the Williams Institute Law Teaching Fellow at UCLA School of Law</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.anu.edu.au/scripts/StaffDetails.asp?StaffID=393">Don Rothwell</a> of Australian National University College of Law, says that a looming May 2009 deadline for states to file data with the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf established under the Law of the Sea Convention (LOSC) may force the US to accede to the LOSC in the very near future if it does not wish to be left behind in the carving up of the Arctic seabed.... <br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/donrothwellnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>R</strong></font>ecent events suggest that the Arctic Ocean has the potential over coming years to be at the centre of a modern version of the last great land grab, except that on this occasion it will be the seabed that will be up for claim and counterclaim. Russia's 2007 flag planting on the North Pole seafloor, and recent comments by US government scientists over the potential for a clash with Canada over the seafloor north of Alaska illustrate why this issue is beginning to attract serious attention. Fortunately, there are mechanisms under the law of the sea to calm fears of an outbreak of tension over the polar north, but this will create some challenges given the US position towards the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC). <br /><br />The LOSC reinforced the right of coastal states to assert continental shelf claims, a right first recognised under the 1958 Geneva Convention on the Continental Shelf, and extended the minimum outer limit of a juridical continental shelf to 200 nautical miles. However, in an important concession to those coastal states with broad continental shelves, Article 76 of the LOSC permits the extension of the shelf beyond 200 nautical miles to the outer edge of the continental margin, which in some instances could be as distant as 350 nautical miles. There is no unilateral right to assert a claim to an 'outer continental shelf' (OCS), rather coastal states must first submit data supporting such a claim to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS), one of the more important LOSC institutions. In recognition that the final delimitation of the outer limits of the continental shelf would ultimately have an impact upon the 'area' of the deep sea-bed reserved for management by the International Sea-bed Authority, the LOSC provided for a ten year deadline within which coastal states were to assert their OCS claims. Following some modifications to the calculation of that deadline, May 2009 is looming as a critical date for the original state parties to the LOSC by which time those states who seek to assert such a claim must have submitted their data to the CLCS. <br /><br />The implications of the OCS regime for the Arctic Ocean are significant. Much of the Arctic remains beyond the limits of 200 nautical mile EEZ and continental shelf claims, including the seabed at the North Pole. A number of coastal states fronting the Arctic could potentially assert OCS claims including Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Finland, Russia, and the US. Russia was the first to make an OCS claim, presenting its submission before the CLCS in 2001, followed in 2006 by Norway. Denmark is reported to be close to making its claim and the others must be expected to follow soon. What can be anticipated is that over the course of the next few years the CLCS will be facing multiple claims to an OCS over the Arctic, a number of which will overlap. How can the Commission be expected to respond?<br /><br />The Commission, which operates under a mandate based upon Article 76 and Annex II of the LOSC, has in its Rules of Procedure made clear that it will not become engaged in political or legal disputes. To date the CLCS has sought to strictly maintain its role as a scientific and technical body, notwithstanding that its recommendations can have enormous significance as to the legitimacy of OCS claims. As such the Commission has sought to neatly sidestep OCS claims which have been asserted offshore disputed territories, or which may result in overlapping claims between two or more states. This has already been an issue in the context of OCS claims in the Southern Ocean with both Australia and New Zealand indicating their desire for the Commission to set aside for the time being claims which both country may be able to make offshore Antarctica, but which would raise considerable controversy because of the general lack of international recognition of those claims and their consistency with the Antarctic Treaty.<br /><br />The CLCS is therefore set to become an important forum in resolving some of the controversies over Arctic sea-bed claims, and this may prove to be a catalyst for forcing the US to reassess its position towards the LOSC. Because there is to date so little state practice with OCS claims under Article 76 of the LOSC, it cannot be said &#8212; unlike the general position with respect to 200 nautical mile continental shelf claims &#8212; to be reflective of customary international law. There could be no basis for the US asserting a unilateral claim to an OCS without having first acceded to the Convention and having made a submission before the CLCS. This is not to suggest that the US would have to sit on the sidelines whilst other Arctic states assert claims to the Arctic Ocean. Indeed the US already has an active program in place responding to OCS submissions by way of direct communications with the UN Secretary-General which in turn are made available to the CLCS. Therefore, whilst the US would most certainly be able to respond to Arctic Ocean claims, and in particular any claims which may overlap with those the US feels it may be entitled to assert offshore Alaska, it would not be able to officially make or assert such a claim until such time as it became a party to the Convention. It is for this reason, that the US may be forced in the very near future to accede to the LOSC if it does not wish to be left behind in the carving up of the Arctic seabed. <br /><br /><br /><em>Donald R.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.aup.fr/faculty/dept/icp/eaker.htm">Larry Eaker</a> of the American University of Paris says that EU law on the free movement of capital may significantly complicate the efforts of the French government to keep Societe Generale in French hands in the wake of the recent &quot;rogue trader&quot; episode that cost it billions in assets...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/larryeaker.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><em>&quot;Soci&Atilde;&copy;t&Atilde;&copy; G&Atilde;&copy;n&Atilde;&copy;rale is a great French bank and will remain a great French bank.&quot;</em> <br /><br />- Prime Minister Fran&Atilde;&#167;ois Fillon<br /><br /><font SIZE=3><strong>W</strong></font>hile Soci&Atilde;&copy;t&Atilde;&copy; G&Atilde;&copy;n&Atilde;&copy;rale is a major player in international banking - as evidenced by its recent takeover of Russia&#39;s Rosbank - it remains nevertheless a very &quot;French bank.&quot;  With retail banking facilities on almost every Parisian block, Soci&Atilde;&copy;t&Atilde;&copy; G&Atilde;&copy;n&Atilde;&copy;rale remains dear to the hearts of Madame and Monsieur Dupont - and, one can add, dear to the heart and electability of French politicians.  Thus, following release of the news of the billions in so-called &quot;rogue-trader&quot; losses, the French government quickly announced its intention to do whatever it found necessary to keep Soci&Atilde;&copy;t&Atilde;&copy; G&Atilde;&copy;n&Atilde;&copy;rale in French hands.<br /><br />Wish that it were so easy!  As many other protective European Union (EU) Member States have recently discovered, the EU&#39;s financial services sector has now come under the glaring spotlight of EU authorities. These authorities are strictly and consistently imposing the principles of non-discrimination, transparency, and proportionality upon Member States when dealing with proposed takeovers of home financial institutions by &quot;undertakings&quot; from other EU Member States. Accordingly, in the Soci&Atilde;&copy;t&Atilde;&copy; G&Atilde;&copy;n&Atilde;&copy;rale situation it did not take too long for the office of Charlie McCreevy - the EU&#39;s Internal Market Commissioner - to react to the French Prime Minister&#39;s statement and to &quot;read the law&quot; to French government officials.<br /><br /><strong>Limiting &quot;Golden Shares&quot; &amp; Special Rights Regimes</strong><br /><br />The body of EU law concerning the Free Movement of Capital and Right of Establishment (Articles 56 and 43 of the EC Treaty, respectively) has, over the past decade, greatly restricted the right of EU Member States to place obstacles in the path of further EU economic integration.  Over a long line of judicial rulings, culminating in the famous 2007 Volkswagen Law case decision, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has consistently thwarted Member States&#39; attempts to maintain for their respective governments a privileged status within a wide array of private economic sectors.  Almost all of the so-called &quot;Golden Shares&quot; and other special rights regimes have been swatted away.  One can cite, by way of limited example, the U.K.&#39;s attempt to shelter the British Airport Authority, the Netherlands&#39; &quot;Golden Shares&quot; status in KPN/TPG, and, most recently, the Spanish government&#39;s restrictions on foreign holdings within her nation&#39;s energy sectors.<br /><br />In one of the few examples of judicial approval, the Belgian government was allowed to retain special rights in the form of ex post facto review and approval of certain management decisions concerning the sensitive energy sector in a case dealing with the firm Distrigaz. It must be pointed out, however, that the court went to extraordinary lengths in evaluating the special rights granted the Belgian government in order to ensure compliance with the court-imposed condition of proportionality (including a strong dose of transparency and effective judicial review).<br /><br /><strong>A Continuing Political Dispute</strong><br /><br />Not only do these efforts at &quot;Economic Nationalism&quot; create intricate legal disputes, they also engender deep-seated and long-lasting political strains between EU Member States.  While France has just announced record-breaking inward foreign direct investment of over &acirc;&#8218;&not;107 billion in 2007, the Bank de France has simultaneously declared a record amount of outward foreign direct investment of over &acirc;&#8218;&not;160 billion. Included in these figures (and those of recent years) would be the takeovers within the energy sectors of other EU Member States by French government-protected Electricit&Atilde;&copy; de France and Gaz de France - something which greatly riles the political classes of those other EU Member States. The recently announced interest of Electricit&Atilde;&copy; de France in the Spanish energy company Iberdrola has, alas, only added more fuel to these political fires.<br /><br />Concerning the Soci&Atilde;&copy;t&Atilde;&copy; G&Atilde;&copy;n&Atilde;&copy;rale controversy, one must conclude that the French government has chosen an inopportune time and economic sector over which to pick a fight with EU authorities.  In effect, responding to serious concerns over the comparatively low amount of cross-border consolidation within the EU&#39;s financial sector (as outlined by the EU&#39;s ECOFIN 2004 meeting in Scheveningen, Netherlands), the EU has recently adopted a Directive to provide more transparency and legal certainty in the assessment processes utilized by Member States when evaluating cross-border financial sector takeovers.  It seems several Member States had been imposing upon potential acquirers from other Member States assessment criteria which had caught the eye of EU authorities. In particular, the EU Commission had initiated so-called &quot;Infringement Proceedings&quot; against Portugal (involving the Spanish Banco Santander&#39;s takeover bid for the Antonio Champalimaud Group) and against Italy (involving the Dutch ABN Ambro&#39;s takeover bid for Banca Antonveneta and the Spanish BBVA&#39;s bid for Banca Nazionale del Lavoro) challenging the lack of transparency within their respective legal regimes imposing assessment procedures.<br /><br />The EU Commission made it clear to both Portugal and Italy that while Article 58 of the EC Treaty permits the restriction of the Free Movement of Capital and Right of Establishment for the &quot;prudential supervision&quot; of financial institutions, this exception is to be narrowly applied and should never constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on the free movement of capital.  In order to reduce such disputes in the future, the new Directive, which must be transposed into national law by March 2009, establishes five clear criteria to be used by Member States in assessing the suitability of the acquirer and the financial soundness of the acquisition, namely: (a) the reputation of the acquirer; (b) the reputation and experience of any person who will direct the acquired institution; (c) the financial soundness of the acquirer; (d) the continued compliance with relevant EU Directives, and; (e) the risk of money laundering or terrorism financing.  Needless to say, the national origin of the potential acquirer is not included as a legitimate criterion.<br /><br /><strong>The Banking Industry as a &quot;Sensitive Sector&quot;</strong><br /><br />Some Member States have also relied upon the right of governments to protect their financial sectors on the basis of &quot;overriding requirements of the general interest&quot; as recognized by the ECJ in various decisions (e.g., the protection of consumers). It is settled case law, however, that &quot;economic grounds&quot; alone cannot serve as justification for obstacles to the Free Movement of Capital and Right of Establishment. In addition,
the ECJ has ruled that commercial banks are not undertakings whose objective is to provide public services as embodied in the EU&#39;s concept of &quot;Services of General Economic Interest.&quot; Accordingly, Portugal&#39;s attempt to restrict foreign ownership of Portuguese banks under the guise of general interest protection was disallowed by the ECJ.  It should be noted, in this regard, that the legally-challenged 2005 French law controlling foreign investment within certain &quot;sensitive sectors&quot; does not include, as such a sensitive sector, the French banking industry. <br /><br />Finally, as the French government is well aware, one of the considerations identified by the ECJ as such improper &quot;economic grounds&quot; is the decision of the Member State in choosing an economic partner.  Thus, it appears that the French government - like other EU Member States - will be held to the requirements of non-discrimination, transparency, and proportionality in any attempts to restrict the fundamental EU law principles involved in the cross-border consolidation of the EU&#39;s financial sector. While the French authorities may succeed in arranging a marriage between Soci&Atilde;&copy;t&Atilde;&copy; G&Atilde;&copy;n&Atilde;&copy;rale and BNP Paribas (or another possible French suitor) in the coming weeks, it is highly unlikely that any such &quot;Economic Nationalism&quot; will successfully escape the disapproving eyes of EU legal authorities if subjected to challenge. <br /><br /><br /><em>Larry Eaker is Associate Professor of International Law at the American University of Paris</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.goodwinprocter.com/People/Martin%20-%20Kevin.aspx"><strong>Kevin P. Martin</strong></a> [attorney of record for the <a href="http://www.nacdl.org/">National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers</a> on its brief for <u>Indiana v. Edwards</u>]: &quot;In <u>Faretta v. California</u>, 422 U.S. 806 (1975), the Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment provides a constitutional right to a criminal defendant to decline the assistance of counsel and instead to represent himself.  The Court explained that a defendant&#39;s decision to invoke this right should be honored even in instances in which a defendant would be better served with representation by counsel.  The National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL) agrees, and believes that a defendant&#39;s decision to waive the assistance of counsel should be overridden only in very rare circumstances.  <br /><br />NACDL believes that <u>Indiana v. Edwards</u> <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-self.php">presents such an occasion</a>.  The question presented in that case is whether and when a court can, over a mentally-infirm criminal defendant&#39;s objection, override the defendant&#39;s decision to represent himself and require defendant to receive assistance of counsel.  Where the mentally-infirm defendant is competent to stand trial because, under the well-known formulation of <u>Dusky v. United States</u>, 362 U.S. 402 (1960), he can &quot;assist counsel,&quot; but his mental abilities do not permit him to competently represent himself, NACDL believes that fair trial rights must trump the defendant&#39;s right to refuse counsel.  <br /><br />Ideally, however, this conflict between representational and due process rights would not arise in the first place.  In the law of competency as it existed at common law and until 1960, courts asked whether self-represented individuals were competent to represent themselves, not whether they were competent to assist a non-existent lawyer.  The question whether counsel can be forced on someone like Mr. Edwards would never have arisen because, without an attorney, he would not have been deemed competent to stand trial in the first place. <br />  <br />In the <u>Edwards</u> case, NACDL submitted an amicus brief arguing that the Court should eliminate the <u>Dusky</u> competency standard&#39;s assumption that counsel is present and refocus the test on the ability of the defendant to present a defense, with the presence of counsel &#8212; <em>only</em> in those cases where counsel <em>is</em> present &#8212; one factor to be considered.  This return to the common law standard respects both the due process right to be tried only if competent and the Sixth Amendment right to choose whether or not to waive counsel.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/about_us/staff/lanigan_k.htm"><strong>Kevin Lanigan</strong></a> [Law and Security Program Director, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org">Human Rights First</a>]: &quot;Last week I observed three military commissions hearings in Guant&aacute;namo: the arraignments of Afghani national <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/detainees/cases/jawad.htm">Mohammed Jawad</a> and Saudi national <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/detainees/cases/al-darbi.htm">Ahmed Mohammed Ahmed Haza al Darbi</a>, and a discovery motions hearing in the case of Canadian national <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/detainees/cases/khadr.htm">Omar Ahmed Khadr</a>. (Khadr&#39;s case, along with that of <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/inthecourts/supreme_court_hamdan.htm">Salim Ahmed Hamdan</a>, are the two cases now closest to trial.) <br /><br />It is well known that the &quot;high value&quot; detainees were subject to cruel treatment in secret CIA detention facilities prior to their September 2006 transfer to Guant&aacute;namo. It is less well known, however, that at least <span style="font-style:italic;">scores</span> of other Guant&aacute;namo detainees also allege they were subjected to torture and abusive interrogations &#8212; including Jawad, al Darbi and Khadr. Human Rights First has documented these allegations, several confirmed by current or former U.S. government sources, in our March 10 report, <span style="font-style:italic;"><a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.info/pdf/08307-etn-tortured-justice-web.pdf">Tortured Justice: Using Coerced Evidence to Prosecute Terrorist Suspects</a></span> [JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/military-commissions-tainted-by.php">report</a>]. <br /><br />The Military Commissions Act (MCA), 10 U.S.C. sec. 948a, et seq., ostensibly bans the introduction of statements obtained through torture. The Bush administration, of course, insists that neither waterboarding nor any other technique to which it has subjected detainees amount to torture. For statements obtained by coercive treatment falling short of &quot;torture&quot; &#8212; none of which would be admissible in any other U.S. state or federal criminal proceeding, including a military court-martial &#8212; the MCA is much more tolerant. Where &quot;the degree of coercion is disputed&quot; the statement still may be admitted if the military commissions judge finds that: <br /><ul>(1) the totality of the circumstances renders the statement reliable and possessing sufficient probative value; and<br /><br />(2) the interests of justice would best be served by admission of the statement into evidence.</ul> In addition, as for any statement obtained on or after December 30, 2005, &quot;the interrogation methods used to obtain the statement&quot; also must &quot;not amount to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment prohibited by section 1003 of the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005.&quot;<br /><br />Even these early military commissions cases &#8212; let alone the &quot;high value&quot; detainee cases that have not yet begun &#8212; are shaping up to be largely about the systemic cruel and abusive treatment through which U.S. government interrogators extracted statements from detainees. The Bush administration&#39;s very public insistence that no torture has occurred puts great pressure on military commission prosecutors and judges &#8212; pressure that may amount to unlawful command influence &#8212; who will be confronted in the coming months with decisions to offer, or to admit, coerced statements. The prosecutor who decides not to offer a statement on grounds it was obtained through torture, or the military commissions judge who excludes a statement on that basis, will unavoidably be contradicting his (or her) commander-in-chief. Ethical tensions such as these already have contributed to resignations or requested transfers by four prosecutors, even before the first case has been tried. More may come. And one of the most unfortunate consequences of all this will be further delays in bringing to justice some detainees who quite likely have committed horrific crimes.&quot;<br /><span style="font-style:italic;"><br />&quot;Report from Guantanamo&quot; features regular contributions to JURIST Hotline from <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/index.asp">Human Rights First</a>.</span><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www2.essex.ac.uk/human_rights_centre/people/fellows/reidy.shtm"><strong>Aisling Reidy</strong></a> [Senior Legal Advisor, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a>]: &quot;On March 13, the defense for Omar Khadr had some fairly basic objectives - to get the government to disclose evidence, such as notes relating to the interrogation of their client when he was 15 years old, so that they could prepare their defense. They also wanted to take a deposition from a witness, a commander who had filed contradictory reports on a grenade attack in Afghanistan on July 27, 2002, for which their client stands trial. They also sought to uncover more about the treatment of their client when he was detained at Bagram in Afghanistan, seriously wounded in 2002. The government strongly objected to all such requests, arguing that their legal duties under the Military Commissions Act of 2006 were fulfilled. The military commissions judge ultimately sided with the defense, <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/khadr-military-judge-orders-us-to-turn.php">granting the defense motions</a>, requiring the government to disclose more evidence than it was clearly ever prepared to do. This was a significant ruling in a case already controversial for its prosecution of a former child soldier, allegations of torture, and suggestions that evidence may have been amended to suit the government charges. <br /><br />Deposition<br /><br />On Friday, March 14, at the Military Commission at Guantanamo Bay, Army Col. Peter Brownback presiding in the case of <em>United States v. Omar Khadr</em>, ruled that the United States government had to make available for deposition a Lieutenant Colonel who was the on-scene commander on July 27, 2002, the day the then 15 year old, Omar Khadr is alleged to have thrown a grenade that killed a U.S. soldier. <br /><br />At hearings on March 13, the government had submitted that it &quot;strongly&quot; and &quot;vigorously&quot; opposed the deposition of the soldier known as LTC &quot;W&quot;. Invoking rule 702(c)3(a) of the Rules for Military Commissions, the prosecution claimed that the request should be denied &quot;for good cause&quot;, e.g. to protect classified information. Khadr&#39;s defense argued that this witness was a very important witness to recreating what happened on July 27. Moreover there was a clear discrepancy in reports that he had filed, the first on July 28, 2002, indicating the person who threw the grenade had been killed on the spot and the second, filed some two months later, claiming that the grenade thrower had survived -- directly implicating Khadr, who was seriously injured having been shot at least twice in the back. Despite the government&#39;s assertions that the defense would get their chance with the witness at trial, Judge Brownback agreed with the defense that the &quot;interest of justice&quot; would be better served by requiring his deposition: something that must now take place before April 4. The judge had pressed the government as to what the consequences would be if LTC &quot;W&quot; did not turn up for trial, but it was not something the government was prepared to speculate on. Judge Brownback clearly did not feel that leaving it to see whether or not the government would make this witness available when trial commences, was a risk that was worth taking &quot;in the interest of justice.&quot; Khadr&#39;s defense attorney, Lt. Cmdr. William Kuebler, has made it clear that he believes there are indications that the battlefield report may have been deliberately altered to cast blame on his client, a charge denied by the prosecution.<br /><br />&quot;Materiality&quot; <br /><br />The equally strident protests of the government team to further disclosure of many documents including, identification of interrogators, interrogation notes of Omar Khadr and correspondence between US and Canadian authorities about Omar Khadr (Khadr being a Canadian citizen) were also ultimately unpersuasive to the Judge. While the defense sought evidence that they determined to be &quot;material to the preparation of the defense,&quot; the government consistently repeated that it was satisfied that it had met its disclosure obligations under the Military Commissions Act, and there was nothing they had which would be &quot;exculpatory&quot; or &quot;helpful to Khadr&#39;s defense.&quot; The prosecution continued to point to the discussion section of the Rules of the Military Commission which directs that for guidance on what is &quot;material to the preparation of the defense,&quot; and thereby subject to disclosure, regard to <em>United States v. Yunis</em>, a case under the Classified Information Protection Act (CIPA), should be had. The argument was that the standard of &quot;materiality&quot; in such cases is a heightened one, and that the defense needed to show evidence would be &quot;relevant and helpful to the defense&quot; to achieve disclosure. Khadr&#39;s defense objected to an overly narrow application of what was &quot;material,&quot; arguing that the discovery must include that which is relevant to the defense case and which may lead to the discovery of other relevant and potentially exculpatory material. <br /><br />In the end Judge Brownback, while declining to define the scope of discovery, but specifically noting that the discussion section of the rules was non-binding, ordered the government to supply a list of personnel who conducted interrogations of Khadr, and make any such individual that the defense wishes to interview available at the end of a phone line. The government also has to hand over all notes at all interrogations taken by any government agents, including interrogators, since July 27, 2002. The government was also ordered to make available for examination the complete investigation file with regard to the allegations of political interference in the Office of the Chief Prosecutor by the legal advisor to the convening authority. <br /><br />Finally, the judge ordered the government to go back and re-examine communications between the United States and Canada, including U.S. forces&#39; battlefield communications from Afghanistan around the time of Khadr&#39;s capture and to identify all known witnesses of the firefight.<br /><br />In one exchange that hinted at a certain umbrage in having to account to the Commission, the prosecution at one stage seemed to challenge the judge&#39;s calling into question of their disclosure, or lack of it. &quot;If the military judge is not willing to accept our assertion &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; &quot; the prosecution began, at which stage the judge cut them off, as if to suggest &quot;don&#39;t even go there.&quot; Indeed the decision of the judge to order discovery shows that he was not satisfied to leave it up to the government to determine whether something was &quot;helpful&quot; to the defense. It now remains to be seen how the government complies with the judges instruction, and whether Khadr will finally get a chance to see the evidence against him or expose more details of his ill treatment.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.adebowale.org/adebowale.html"><strong>Samuel Abiodun Adebowale</strong></a> [coordinator, Concerned Nigerians Worldwide, Spain chapter; journalist, <a href="http://www.african-news.ch/">African News</a> in Switzerland]: &quot;In Chicago (USA), a U.S. District Court admitted a claim to investigate the responsibility of a former Nigerian head of state, Gen. Abubakar Abdulsalami, for <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/nigeria-police-routinely-violate-human.php">gross violation of human rights in Nigeria</a> between November 1993 and May 1999. The case was filed by some Nigerian victims under Abubakar&#39;s regime. The court examined &quot;the history of the Nigerian military regime and Abubakar&#39;s role in it, the regime&#39;s suppression of pro-democracy advocates; its use of arbitrary detention without trial, torture, extra-judicial killing, and restrictions of civil liberties in order to silence opponents.&quot; Meanwhile, in Abuja (Nigeria) a Nigerian Federal High Court&#39;s ruling barred the ex-dictator from declaring in any court about the alleged human rights abuses during his governance of the country. The court brings into play an Official Secrets Act that was in place during his regime, granting the dictator immunity before the Chicago Court. <br /><br />Until now the victims have not received any effective remedy either locally or internationally. They were been denied their right to know the truth surrounding the violation of their rights and the assurance that such violations will not be repeated in the future. This lack of remedy, on its own, is a violation of the natural rights of the victims to an effective remedy as enshrined in core international treaties. <br /><br />It is my view that the alleged widespread violation of fundamental rights while in Nigerian police custody is a process of crime against humanity. And I consider the absolute immunity of the former Nigerian leaders to the crime under their governance as the key factor to its continuity and the reason for its widespread practice. Meanwhile, the collective obligation of the international community to all members of the human family is to perform in good faith every treaty in force and binding upon them. This obligation is incompatible with the usual limitation to words and declarations without any effective or affirmative action to protect the UN charter in Nigeria. <br /><br />However, I have personally seen and witnessed that the present Nigerian government under President Umaru Musa Yar&#39;Adua is willing to abide by the rule of law and to protect the fundamental human rights of Nigerians. And defiantly, the Nigerian legal systems are under the supervision of the same judges who had served and are loyal to the previous government. They were the same systems that supported the governances who committed the violence cited in Nowak&#39;s report. This situation demonstrates the ineffectiveness of an internal remedy and the need for an alternative remedy to redress these violations according to international principles. Only by such redress will the present government willingness be motivated and strengthened to produce some positive and desired changes. Otherwise, we may be indirectly endorsing the continuity of these violations of human rights.<br /><br />Without a doubt, it is my considered view that there was a failure, by the past leaders, to take all the necessary and reasonable measures within their power to prevent the commission of this crime against humanity. And that the vivid first-hand accounts from two UN mandate holders are beyond doubt to establish a criminal responsibility of those leaders in question. They must be brought to justice. This is the most logical remedy to stop this tradition of violation in Nigeria. Nigeria has ratified the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, and the widespread use of torture and other violence falls under the ICC&#39;s jurisdiction. <br /><br />Where are the international judicial bodies having all the necessary mechanisms to redress this crime against humanity? When will they question the concerned Nigerian leaderships and their collaborators about this crime against humanity during their rule? I hereby recall again my summary of Nowak&#39;s reports to the UN Human Rights Council; there exists powerlessness and hopelessness in Nigeria, this situation will continue as long as the culture of immunity continues.&quot;<br />

		<title>Gun locks targeted in DC gun ban oral arguments</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://johnrlott.blogspot.com"><strong>John Lott</strong></a> [author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1596985062/ref=nosim/?tag=johnrlotttrip-20">Freedomnomics</a>; senior research scientist, University of Maryland]: &quot;Strangely, <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/supreme-court-considers-dc-handgun-ban.php  ">oral arguments</a> about DC&#39;s gun ban turned on discussions of gun locks as much as anything else.  Machine guns might have seemed to be a flashier topic, but gun locks were mentioned more frequently, being raised 31 times during the <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/07-290.pdf">arguments</a>.<br /><br />The question was central to the case because both the District of Columbia and the Department of Justice claimed that a ban on handguns didn&#39;t really prevent people from using a rifle or a shotgun for self-defense.  The plaintiffs responded that as soon as a long gun is unlocked and loaded it becomes illegal and thus doesn&#39;t provide much benefit to potential victims.  The benefits of gun locks protecting children also received some attention.<br /> <br />A few numbers probably would have provided some perspective and likely have reduced the Justices&#39; concern.  In 2004, for the United States, the Centers for Disease Control reports that 28 children under age 10 died from accidental shots. With some 90 million gun owners and about 40 million children under 10, it is hard to find any item as commonly owned in American homes, as potentially as lethal, that has as low of an accidental death rate.<br /> <br />These deaths also have little to do with &quot;naturally curious&quot; children shooting other children. From 1995 to 2001 only about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0895261146/ref=nosim/?tag=johnrlotttrip-20">nine</a> of these accidental gun deaths each year involve a child under 10 shooting another child or themselves. Overwhelmingly, the shooters are adult males with long histories of alcoholism, arrests for violent crimes, automobile crashes, and suspended or revoked driver&#39;s licenses.<br /> <br />Chief Justice Roberts amusing comment that <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/07-290.pdf">&quot;So then you turn on the lamp, you pick up your reading glasses . . . .&quot;</a> raised the serious question about whether gun locks interfere with people protecting themselves.  Locked guns are simply not as readily accessible for defensive gun uses. In addition, since potentially armed victims deter criminals, storing a gun locked and unloaded may therefore increase crime.  Indeed, research that I did examining all U.S. states from <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=228534">1977 to 1996</a> supported that contention.  The bottom line is that the 16 states that adopted safe-storage laws during this period faced over 300 more murders and almost 4,000 more rapes per year. Burglaries also increased dramatically.<br /> <br />Walter Dellinger, representing DC, claimed &quot;It took me 3 seconds [to remove the lock]. I&#39;m not kidding. It&#39;s -- it&#39;s not that difficult to do it. That was in daylight.&quot;  Yet, not everyone should depend upon Dellinger&#39;s luck.  One almost humorous example of the problems gun locks pose was provided by former Maryland governor Parris Glendening, who set up a press conference to generate support for his gun lock proposals. As the centerpiece of the press conference, the governor planned to demonstrate how easy it was to work a gun lock. Yet, the demonstration did not work as planned. One newspaper described the governor &quot;struggling numerous times to remove it. He eventually got it after returning to the podium to try a few more times.&quot;  Indeed, he received the help of several police officers in removing the lock. <br /> <br />As one state legislator noted after the press conference: &quot;Imagine what kind of trouble he&#39;d have if he were staring down some intruder in the dark. Maybe we should be able to work the thing before we bring it out. Clearly it&#39;s not ready for prime time.&quot;<br /> <br />For whatever strategic reason, Alan Gura decided not to bring these numbers into the discussion.  I hope that Chief Justice Roberts musing that the entire discussion on gun locks &quot;may not matter&quot; proves to be correct.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Alan Gura</strong> [attorney, <a href="http://www.gurapossessky.com/">Gura &amp; Possessky</a>, PLLC, lead counsel for plaintiffs in <em>Parker v. District of Columbia</em>, on appeal as <em>District of Columbia v. Heller</em>]: &quot;As advocates, our role is to respond to the actual questions posed by the Justices, in a direct and honest manner, which would hopefully make the Court more comfortable with our respective positions. That&#39;s it.<br /><br />Members of the Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/supreme-court-considers-dc-handgun-ban.php">questioned</a> Petitioners&#39; version of history, and the Solicitor General&#39;s unsatisfying standard of review approach. Predictably, in querying me, the Justices wanted to know if I endorse a practical, common-sense Second Amendment. The Court&#39;s view of what is practical probably differs from that of extremists on either side of the gun debate. Petitioners, and to some extent, the Solicitor General, sanctioned the prohibitionist extreme: that a total ban on all handguns and all functional firearms in the home is (petitioners) or may be (Solicitor General Clement) constitutional. I was not about to mirror that by advocating for the pro-gun extreme: an absolute right not subject to regulation, and which encompasses machine guns. <br /><br />My decision to avoid extended discussion of social science data was conscious, and reflected the consensus of our team and everyone with whom we raised the issue. The social science overwhelmingly cuts in our favor, but it is the sort of argument best left for amici. Criminological data might make the Court more comfortable in reaching its decision, but ultimately the questions in <u>Heller</u> are legal, not scientific. A Justice is more likely to accept a legal position despite misgivings about its implications, than a social science position he or she finds debatable, at best. I was prepared to answer specific questions about various studies, but none came up. I was unwilling to actually raise the social science issue and turn the case into something it isn&#39;t.<br /><br />Extended scientific discussion would have also invited more discussion of standards of review. But a core strategic decision made at the outset of the litigation, which may yet be vindicated, was to keep the case as narrow as possible by observing that these laws fail any conceivable standard of review. The Court does not decide cases not before it. To decide <em>this</em> case, it is enough to declare an operative individual right. Some Justices appeared open to that viewpoint, underscoring again our disappointment with the Solicitor General&#39;s position.<br /><br />The one Second Amendment test we do have &#8212; for delineating protected from unprotected arms &#8212; is found in <u>Miller</u>. Nobody seems to like <u>Miller</u> much, but we do win our case if it is faithfully applied, as it was by the D.C. Circuit. So it would have made no sense for me to seek <u>Miller&#39;s</u> destruction and thereby start from an argument against precedent. Justice Kennedy could, and did, signal <u>Miller&#39;s</u> deficiency, and that allowed me to discuss the issue. But it wasn&#39;t my task to undo <u>Miller</u>, however desirable that may be. Along the same lines, several Justices appeared to have almost no use for the Second Amendment&#39;s preamble, but as an advocate, I could not over-argue the matter.<br /><br />Finally, among the most heartening moments, for me, were Dellinger&#39;s pejorative uses of the word &quot;libertarian&quot; to describe our position. Everyone arguing for an individual right &#8212; <em>any</em> individual right &#8212; may be said to be taking a libertarian position. That perspective comes from trusting people. We trust the people of Washington, D.C., like those in half of all American households, would responsibly use firearms in lawful fashion. We believe that trust is reflected in the Second Amendment. We hope the Court will agree.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Joe Stork</strong> [Program Director, Middle East &amp; North Africa, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a>]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/ban-calls-for-israel-to-end-attacks-in.php">conflict</a> between Israel and Hamas-led forces in the Gaza Strip has taken a terrible toll among civilians. <br /><br />Palestinian rocket attacks that in late February killed one Israeli civilian and wounded others violated the international humanitarian law prohibition against deliberate or indiscriminate attacks against civilians. It is unlawful to fire into populated areas weapons, such as Palestinian locally-made rockets, that cannot discriminate between civilians and military targets. <br /><br />Israeli military operations over the following days killed 52 civilians, including 27children, according to the United Nations, which has field staff throughout the Gaza Strip. Some fifty-five Palestinian fighters were also reported killed. About 100 of the estimated 250 persons wounded were civilians. <br /><br />Civilian casualties alone do not necessarily signify laws of war violations. In cases where fire is directed at areas that contain legitimate military objectives, it is necessary to investigate individual incidents to determine whether those carrying out the attack were targeting a military object and, if so, whether all feasible precautions were taken to minimize harm to civilians. Given the number of civilians killed in the Gaza operations, Israel should conduct serious and impartial investigations to determine how civilians died and whether all feasible measures were taken to avoid those deaths. <br /><br />Israel has violated international humanitarian law with its blockade of the Gaza Strip, which prevents almost all movement of goods and persons into or out of the territory, including its cuts of fuel and electricity, and constitutes a policy of collective punishment. The laws of war prohibit a state that has effective control over an area &#8212; as Israel does in Gaza &#8212; from attacking or withholding objects that are essential to the survival of the civilian population. Such a policy also violates Israel&#39;s duty as an occupying power to safeguard the health and welfare of the population under occupation.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Terry Gorman</strong> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.riile.org/">Rhode Islanders for Immigration Law Enforcement</a>]: &quot;At a press conference on March 27,2008, Rhode Island Governor Carcieri issued an <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/rhode-island-governor-signs-order.php">Executive Order</a> to control rapidly escalating cost of illegal immigration in Rhode Island.<br /><br />The Order requires the Executive Branch to register and use E-verify for all new hires, check the validity of Social Security numbers that are submitted and report anyone not legally present in the US. The Department of Administration shall require that all persons and businesses doing business with our state to register and use the E-verify program in order to acquire state contracts. It also requires the Rhode Island State Police, the Department of Corrections and the Parole Board to secure respective Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) to train and work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).<br /><br />Rhode Islanders for Immigration Law Enforcement(RIILE)believes the Governor&#39;s Executive Order complies with Congress&#39; 1996 amendment to the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=f3829c7755cb9010VgnVCM10000045f3d6a1RCRD&vgnextchannel=f3829c7755cb9010VgnVCM10000045f3d6a1RCRD">Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)</a>, 8 U.S.C. 1373(c), and the Section 287(g) of the <a href="http://www.lib.umich.edu/govdocs/text/104208.txt">Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act</a> (IIRAIRA), which set out the processes for the E-Verify Program which electronically verifies the legal status in the US of anyone applying for a job. It also creates a working relationship between local Law Enforcement and US Customs and Immigration Services and (USCIS) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).<br /><br />RIILE also believes this is a long overdue GIANT step forward in controlling the burgeoning problems associated with providing social services to Illegal Aliens in our state. We estimate that between Education (10,700 English Language Learners statewide in our schools), Medical services (emergency rooms, Anchor babies,etc.) and Incarceration ($8.2 million to detain at least 225 Illegal Alien felons in our Adult Corrections Institute), the cost to the taxpayers of Rhode Island is at least $350 million. If these costs are not reigned in Rhode Island will soon have to be absorbed by Massachusetts or Connecticut as one of their counties in order to survive.<br /><br />If you&#39;re carrying a 20 pound bag of potatoes on your shoulder and every 20 feet someone adds 20 additional potatoes it isn&#39;t long before you collapse under the weight. The Governor&#39;s Executive Order will prevent Rhode Island from collapsing under the weight of Illegal Aliens.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.csdcambodia.org/staffprofile.html">Theary Seng</a></strong> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.csdcambodia.org/en_index.html">The Center for Social Development</a>]: &quot;A criminal proceeding in any environment - be it in a developed state or here in developing Cambodia - is a serious matter because an individual&#39;s liberty and rights are at stake. Before any rights or freedom of a person is to be limited by the State (e.g. imprisonment), extreme due care must be taken to ascertain that the curbing of these rights/liberties are justified and followed established due process. <br /><br />The adherence of due process is more urgently needed here in Cambodia where the legal and penal system is embryonic and fragile, prone to abuses, without adequate balance of powers among the different parties in the criminal case and generally among the three branches of government. <br /><br />Moreover, greater scrutiny of these criminal proceedings must be had in light of our dark, recent history of gross violations of human rights on a massive scale.<br /><br />We, at CSD, are abhorred by the high rate of <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/cambodia-still-obtaining-criminal.php">torture and coercion</a> used to extract confessions &#8212; 1 in 4 as you accurately noted from our <a href="http://www.csdcambodia.org/pdf/2008/Annual%20Report%202007.pdf">Annual Report</a>. A confession given as a result of coercion and torture cannot be deemed reliable or accurate. Consequently, it means that one in four defendants run the high, unacceptable risk of being wrongly convicted &#8212; i.e., having their rights curbed and violated &#8212; as a result not of having committed a crime but of fear for life resulting from coercion and torture. This 25% rate of confession due to coercion and torture also put into question all convictions, whether they are safe. We are deeply concerned that they are not safe and that many innocent people are being put in prison or having their rights and liberties curbed in other manners without proper due process of law.&quot;<br />

		<title>Inside the Supreme Court: oral arguments in Munaf and Omar</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="URL of your webpage"><strong>Sharon Bradford Franklin</strong></a> [senior counsel,<br /> <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/">Constitution Project</a>; amicus in the US Supreme Court in support of habeas petitioners <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=munaf">Mohammed Munaf</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Shawqi">Shawqi Omar</a>]: &quot;The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/dnp-supreme-court-considers-war-on.php">heard oral argument today</a> in <u>Munaf v. Geren</u> and <u>Geren v. Omar</u>, in which two American citizens being detained by U.S. authorities in Iraq seek judicial review of their detentions through <em>habeas corpus</em>. The United States government argues that the American military personnel detaining Mr. Munaf and Mr. Omar are participating in a multi-national force, and that consequently, United States courts have no jurisdiction to consider the challenges to these detentions. <br /><br />Arguing on behalf of the government, Deputy Solicitor General Gregory Garre urged that the Court should follow <u>Hirota v. MacArthur</u>, a nine sentence long per curiam decision issued by the Court in 1948. In <u>Hirota</u>, the Court held that United States courts lacked jurisdiction over <em>habeas</em> petitions filed by Japanese nationals who were also held abroad by United States officials acting as part of a multi-national force. He stated that ultimately, the United Nations is in control of the multi-national force in Iraq. In response, Joseph Margulies, argued on behalf of the detainees that unlike the petitioners in <u>Hirota</u>, Mr. Munaf and Mr. Omar are American citizens and they are not seeking to attack the judgments of foreign tribunals. He also pointed out that, as the government concedes, the authorities holding the detainees answer only to an American chain of command.<br /><br />The Justices&#39; questions focused largely on four different issues in the case: the extent of United States control within the multi-national force; the practicality of a remedy; the importance of American citizenship as a criterion for the availability of <em>habeas</em> review; and the location of the detainees in Iraq &#8212; whether or not the prison is within a zone of hostilities. Justices Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer asked several questions about the reality of United States control over the detainees, despite the fact that U.S. forces are participating in a multi-national force and that the detainees are being held in Iraq. Chief Justice Roberts focused largely on questions about what remedy might be available under <em>habeas</em>. Mr. Omar is currently awaiting trial in the Iraqi court system, and Mr. Munaf had been convicted by an Iraqi court on charges of kidnapping and sentenced to death. Although Mr. Munaf&#39;s conviction was recently overturned on appeal in the Iraqi court system, his case is still being reviewed by Iraq. Thus, Chief Justice Roberts questioned whether the traditional <em>habeas</em> remedy of release would be either practical or desirable for these men, since they then would risk being picked up immediately by Iraqi authorities. Justice Kennedy expressed similar concerns.<br /><br />Justices Stevens, Kennedy, Scalia, and Alito all asked Mr. Margulies about the significance of the fact that Mr. Munaf and Mr. Omar are American citizens and whether, of the 24,000 people being detained abroad by the multi-national force, <em>habeas</em> should only be available for American citizens. Justice Stevens focused particularly on the place of detention, and his view that the entire country of Iraq is part of a zone of active hostilities and thus this case may be different from <u>Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</u> (2004), which involved an American citizen captured on the battlefield but then held within the United States. Mr. Garre stated that the government is <em>not</em> arguing that Mr. Munaf and Mr. Omar are being detained on the battlefield, to which Justice Stevens responded that perhaps the government was failing to make its strongest argument. Justice Breyer, however, noted that in his understanding, the detentions at issue here are more comparable to detentions during a peacetime military occupation.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Aung Din</strong> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.uscampaignforburma.org/">U.S. Campaign for Burma</a>]: &quot;All the points mentioned in the <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/un-council-deplores-myanmar-rights.php">resolution</a> are truly strong and necessary. However, this resolution can not be called &quot;strong&quot; as it does not have binding power and enforcement mechanism. There were more than a dozen resolutions adopted by the then UN Commission on Human Rights and now UNHRC with strong languages and these resolutions were simply ignored by the Burmese military junta. This resolution will face the same fate. The junta does not care naming and shaming. The world needs to do more to save the people of Burma.<br /><br />The three Permanent Members of the UN Security Council, US, UK, France, and three alternate members Belgium, Italy, and Slovenia are among the nations which proposed the UNHRC resolution. I understand that they tried hard to get the approve the resolution without vote. I wish they will use same energy and enthusiasm at the UN Security Council, organize other members, especially China and Russia, to have a resolution on Burma with the same level of strong language and legally binding.&quot;<br />

It wounds deeply-held spiritual feelings of millions of Muslims around the world. It is a call for hatred and discrimination against Muslims in the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe. Made by a race-supremacist Dutch parliamentarian, the film argues that the Quran incites violence. <br /><br />The <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/NewsRoom?OpenFrameSet">Special Rapporteur</a> on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and other UN experts, have condemned the film in the following words: &quot;While on the one hand, freedom of expression is a fundamental human right that must be respected, it does not extend to include incitement to racial or religious hatred which is itself clearly a violation of human rights. Public expressions that paint adherents of a particular religion as a threat to peace or global stability are irresponsible.&quot;<br /><br />The European Union (EU), however, has drawn an opposite conclusion from that of the UN experts. While condemning the film as an unjustified attack on Islam, the 27 EU foreign ministers support the freedom of speech that the Dutch parliamentarian exercised in making the film. <br /><br />Muslims are outraged. They too have the right to free speech in peacefully condemning the film and its hateful producer. They must, however, refrain from any over-reaction. The European history of attacking Islam is old. Centuries before the Europeans embraced the notion of freedom of speech, vicious attacks on the Quran, Prophet Muhammad, and Muslims have been encouraged, tolerated, and disseminated. I document the European hatred against Islam in an article <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=952827">Free Markets of Islamic Jurisprudence</a>. <br /><br />Muslims must ignore the film, read the Quran, and always remember what the Quran advises them to say on such insulting occasions: &quot;To you be your Way, and to me my Way.&quot; <em>Sura al ka</em>afiruun 109:6. Insulting religions is a European problem and they will have to deal with it.<em></em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="URL of your webpage"><strong>Asim Qureshi</strong></a> [Senior Researcher, <a href="http://www.cageprisoners.com/">Cageprisoners</a>]: &quot;Two weeks after the 11th September 2001 attacks, Nihad Karsic and Almin Hardaus were kidnapped off the streets of Bosnia and flown in helicopters to a US base where they were held in a shipping container in conditions which would later perfectly resonate with those detained in Afghanistan and sent to Guantanamo Bay. Those early detentions served as a practice ground for what would later be policies of detention and sensory deprivation in Afghanistan, Iraq and Guantanamo Bay. <br /><br /><a href="/paperchase/2008/03/ex-guantanamo-bay-detainee-describes.php">The latest revelations by Murat Kurnaz</a> in his book &quot;Five Year Detention at Guantanamo Bay&quot; only add to the plethora of corroborated evidence that unlawful detention and torture policies have been systematically used by the US military since the start of the &quot;War on Terror.&quot; Although there is no way of corroborating the story of Mr Kurnaz without soldiers based at Guantanamo Bay breaking their imposed silence, the wealth of information that is seeping out through the statements of former detainees is quickly building a case against the military. Once abuse and torture is proven to be systematic, then there is nowhere in the world that those criminals who misuse their positions can hide, the universal jurisdiction of international criminal law relating to torture makes sure of that. <br /><br />Mr Kurnaz, an innocent man detained in Guantanamo Bay for five years, known to be innocent by his captors for four of those years; is the unfortunate victim of US neo-military justice. This justice, through the Combatant Status Review Tribunals and now Military Commissions, is a system which does not allow for defendants to appoint their own counsel, to view the evidence against them, for their counsel to view the evidence against, or to call for any witnesses in their defence. This system recognises that men under its extra-judicial jurisdiction may be innocent, but lacks adequate legal mechanisms to have them released.&quot;<br />

		<title>Pakistan: new PM&#039;s order to release ousted judges is denunciation of Musharraf</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Baseer Naveed</strong> [senior researcher, <a href="http://www.ahrchk.net/index.php">Asian Human Rights Commission</a>]: &quot;The election of Mr. Mohammad Yousaf Raza Gillani as prime minister of Pakistan is itself a threat of the old regime of President General (retired) Musharraf and even his very existence. Mr. Gillani was loyal to Ms. Benazir Bhutto, the lifetime chairperson of the Pakistan People&#39;s Party and is also very loyal to Mr. Asif Zardari, the widower and co-chairman of the party and its chairman Mr. Bilawal Bhutto Zardari. The new prime minister is thought to be a hawk and is very anti the Musharraf government. This is a clear signal from the coalition partners of the newly elected parliament. <br /><br />The newly elected prime minister&#39;s first order was to <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/new-pakistan-pm-seeking-immediate.php">release the deposed judges</a> who were arrested after the imposition of state of emergency on November 3, 2007. The prime minister before that requested the speaker and members of the National Assembly to issue two resolutions, one for a probe of the murder of Ms. Benazir Bhutto on December 27, 2007 and the second one to apologize on the &#39;judicial&#39; murder of Mr. Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, former prime minister and father of Ms. Bhutto, who was hanged on April 5, 1979 on the orders of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. <br /><br />The first order of the release of the deposed judges was a clear denunciation of the actions of President Musharraf against the superior judiciary. The issue of chief justice of Pakistan and restoration of the judiciary is an irritating one for President Musharraf, as he has announced that the deposed judges will never be re-instated at any cost, and that the deposed chief justice is the most corrupt man in the country and a curse on the earth. <br /><br />The deposed judiciary and judges are to be re-instated within 30 days through the resolution passed by the National Assembly. After the restoration of the deposed judiciary, all the cases that have been decided or are still pending before the courts, which were formed illegally and unconstitutionally by President Musharraf through the state of emergency and Provisional Constitution Order (PCO), will have to be revised as the deposed judges had already declared the state of emergency illegal and unconstitutional. Therefore the cases which were decided by the PCO judges will not have any legal bases. <br /><br />When the previously deposed judges are back in their seats, the first thing they will follow up on will be their own previous ruling against the emergency and by virtue of their decision the country will go back to the position of November 2, 2007 in the political sense. President Musharraf will be declared as the &quot;usurper&quot; who abrogated the constitution and is liable to be challenged by any citizen according to Article 6 of the constitution of Pakistan, which has the punishment of the death penalty. <br /><br />The deposed judges of Sindh High Court will restart the proceedings against the carnage of Karachi of May 12, 2007, in which 140 persons were killed on the same day, when deposed chief justice Mr. Iftekhar Choudhry arrived in the city. It was the case which was taken by the high court itself when judges of the court were detained for almost 18 hours in their chambers and were beaten by the workers of Mutehda Qaumi Movement (MQM), the coalition partner in Musharraf government. During the proceedings of the full bench of Sindh High Court, the workers of MQM stormed the court building and again detained and beat the judges for several hours. <br /><br />A good aspect of the order of the prime minister would be the close contact between the judiciary and the lawyers for the rule of law and supremacy of judiciary which will remain a sharp sword over the coming governments and politicians as well. A strong civil society will emerge. <br /><br />Regarding the two resolutions of the enquiry into the murder of Ms. Benazir Bhutto through UNO and the apology from the parliament on the judicial murder of Mr. Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, the implications will have a far reaching effect on the judiciary and army officers. The old judiciary, prior to March 9, 2007, was a poodle in the hands of military dictators and usurpers. If the resolution is passed in favor of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto then it would result in the shape of the Nuremberg Tribunal and the army of Pakistan will have to face the consequences. <br /><br />The probe into the murder of Ms Benazir Bhutto through UNO will lead to the role of state intelligence agencies being investigated. A whole new chapter will be opened in the political history of Pakistan about the criminal role of intelligence agencies who had a hand in killing so many political leaders of the country, in the training of terrorists, even international terrorists like some Arab, Afghan and Asian and African terrorists. This would yield dangerous results as it will expose how the military governments and rulers were involved in international terrorism, including some affairs of the Usama Bin Laden.<br />

		<title>Medellin v. Texas: state law trumps treaty obligations... unless Congress acts</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www3.sympatico.ca/aiwarren/"><strong>Mark Warren</strong></a> [legal researcher, Human Rights Research]: &quot;Along with charting the boundaries of the President&#39;s foreign relations powers, the <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/supreme-court-rules-in-federally.php">Medellin decision</a> confirms the steady drift of the Roberts Court towards a major revision of the canons of treaty construction. The Court now claims that its many prior decisions upholding individual treaty rights stand for no more than the &quot;unremarkable proposition that some international agreements are self-executing and others are not.&quot; Perhaps so, but the novel reasoning that a treaty must be non-self-executing whenever its compulsory enforcement can be vetoed by the United States at the UN Security Council leaves a disturbing whiff of &#39;might makes right&#39; that the Court&#39;s conciliatory references to &quot;international obligations&quot; fail to conceal.<br /><br />Particularly revealing is the majority&#39;s accusation that the President&#39;s memorandum (and by extension, the ICJ decision itself) is anathema because it &quot;reaches deep into the heart of the State&#39;s police powers and compels state courts to reopen final criminal judgments and set aside neutrally applicable state laws.&quot; Yet, at least as far back as Chief Justice Marshall&#39;s 1832 decision in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/31/515/">Worcester v. Georgia</a> it was recognized that a treaty does indeed trump a state criminal law or conviction, just as <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/3/199/case.html">Ware v. Hylton</a> confirmed in 1796 that state statutes of limitation must yield before a conflicting treaty obligation. The majority also suggests that it would be &quot;extraordinary&quot; for the ICJ&#39;s Avena decision to be binding domestically because even &quot;basic rights guaranteed by our own Constitution do not have the effect of displacing state procedural rules.&quot; This unbounded deference to state criminal rules obscures the fact that procedural default is already subject to judge-made exceptions and can be waived for compelling reasons. As Justice Stevens noted in concurrence, the &quot;entire Court and the President agree&quot; that failing to implement the Avena Judgment will jeopardize the United States&#39; &quot;plainly compelling&quot; interests. It is hard to imagine that the legal skies would fall by carving out another limited exception to procedural default, particularly one so clearly serving the national purpose.<br /><br />Significantly, all of the Justices agreed on one central point: Congress has the clear authority to implement Avena, if it so wishes. According to the majority, the President has &quot;an array of political and diplomatic means available to enforce international obligations,&quot; but the &quot;responsibility for transforming an international obligation arising from a non-self-executing treaty into domestic law falls to Congress.&quot; It remains to be seen if this Administration is prepared to ask Congress to exercise that responsibility by implementing the United States&#39; indisputably binding obligations under the Avena Judgment.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist Sharon Bradford Franklin, senior counsel at the <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/">Constitution Project</a>, amicus in the US Supreme Court in support of <em>habeas</em> petitioners Mohammed Munaf and Shawqi Omar in <em>Munaf v. Geren</em> and <em>Geren v. Omar</em>, says that American citizens should be able to challenge their detentions in federal court whenever they are held in the custody of American officials...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/SharonFranklin.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he greatest threat to American liberty has long been that, in times of crisis, we are too willing to sacrifice the rights safeguarded by the Constitution. On March 25, as our military is engaged in multiple wars abroad against stateless enemies, the United States Supreme Court considers one such challenge when it hears oral arguments in <em>Munaf v. Geren</em> and <em>Geren v. Omar</em>, two cases that will assess America's commitment to liberty through challenges to the detention of American citizens held in Iraq by U.S. authorities.<br /><br />Separately detained by American-led military forces in Iraq, Mohammad Munaf and Shwaqi Omar are U.S. citizens who seek access to the basic procedural safeguards afforded by the Constitution &#8212; judicial review of their detention through the writ of <em>habeas corpus</em>. Together, both cases ask the Court to adopt a firm rule that allows an American citizen to challenge his or her detention in federal court whenever he or she is held in the custody of American officials.<br /><br />Mohammad Munaf, an Iraqi-born, naturalized United States citizen, was arrested in Iraq in May 2005 and has spent almost three years in the custody of American military personnel without access to U.S. judicial review. Although, Mr. Munaf had been convicted by the Central Criminal Court of Iraq on charges of kidnapping and was sentenced in October 2006 to death by hanging, on February 29, 2008, the Iraqi Court of Cassation affirmed Mr. Munaf's pleas of innocence and overturned his conviction. Shwaqi Omar, also a naturalized United States citizen, was arrested in Baghdad in 2004. Mr. Omar is currently imprisoned by American military forces and has been held at various prison facilities in Iraq, including Abu Ghraib. He is currently awaiting trial in the Iraqi court system.<br /><br />Attorneys for the Bush Administration have argued that the American military personnel detaining Mr. Munaf and Mr. Omar are participating in a multi-national force, and that consequently, United States courts have no jurisdiction to consider the challenges to these detentions. But the executive branch's position would create perverse incentives to detain American citizens under the auspices of multinational military operations as a way to circumvent judicial review. Contrary to the Administration's arguments, U.S. authorities should not be permitted to indefinitely hold and interrogate American citizens simply because the arresting forces operate with a United Nations or similar international mandate. Indeed, such interpretations would allow the government to arrest American citizens around the world with impunity and deny them the due process rights afforded by their national judicial system simply by convening the arresting authority under an international charter.<br /><br />One might imagine that as American citizens, these men would be assured of their constitutional rights and provided with a day in court to contest their detentions. But it appears that the government is determined to make <em>habeas corpus</em> review a casualty of its efforts to fight international terrorism. For the hundreds of foreign nationals being held at Guantanamo Bay, the government has attempted to repeal the right to <em>habeas</em> review through the Military Commissions Act (MCA) of 2006. Now, while the Supreme Court is still considering challenges to the <em>habeas</em>-stripping provision of the MCA, the Court must also evaluate the administration's efforts in the <u>Munaf</u> and <u>Omar</u> cases to evade habeas review for United States citizens as well.<br /><br />The government's efforts to deny habeas corpus for "enemy combatants," has already cost this country the moral high ground and international legitimacy in its fight against terrorism; denying <em>habeas</em> rights to our own citizens will only erode any remaining goodwill (both abroad and at home) and provide our enemies with yet another recruiting tool. This is why the independent Constitution Project has brought together a bipartisan coalition of policy experts, political leaders, and legal scholars, to call for the immediate restoration of <em>habeas corpus</em> rights for all detainees. We have also urged the Supreme Court to uphold constitutional safeguards and independent <em>habeas</em> review, and to ensure that the people caught up in America's efforts to fight international terrorism are actually the terrorists we should rightfully detain.<br /><br />Day in and day out, American military and law enforcement personnel forego their own safety and well being to guarantee the liberty and security of U.S. citizens around the world. As we argued in our <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/pdf/Green_v_Omar--SCOTUS--CP_and_Rutherford_Institute.pdf">brief</a> before the Court, "a multinational-forces fig leaf" is not enough to hide our citizens from those liberties American men and women have fought and died to protect.<br /><br /><br /><em>Sharon Bradford Franklin is senior counsel at the Constitution Project.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.kramerlevin.com/ssaifee/">Seema Saifee</a>, a litigator at Kramer Levin Naftalis &amp; Frankel LLP in New York representing several Uighurs detained at the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay, says the US government continues to damage its own image by holding the men - all cleared for release - in complete isolation in the supermax-style facility known as "Camp VI" ...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/uighuremblemlong.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>B</strong></font>ritish historian and journalist Andy Worthington has described Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo as part of "a cruel and misguided response by the Bush administration to the September 11 attacks." Among the casualties of this cruel and misguided response are 17 Uighurs. My firm represents 4.<br /><br />The Uighurs are a Muslim ethnic minority from the Xinjiang province of far-western China, a region they call "East Turkestan." Like the Tibetans, though less well-known, the Uighurs have faced systematic persecution under China's brutal control. Many of the Uighurs &#8212; or "Turkestanis" as they identify themselves &#8212; including our clients, fled their homeland to escape persecution and torture for their religious and political (or imputed political) beliefs. <br /><br />In the fall of 2001, the United States military littered Pakistani and Afghan soil with leaflets offering "millions of dollars" to catch "murderers" and "enough money to take care of your family, your village, your tribe for the rest of your life." In response to these promises, local tribesmen and warlords captured twenty-two Uighurs and sold them to the United States for substantial bounties. Quickly realizing its error, the United States military told the Uighurs they were mistakenly picked up and would soon be released. This was several years ago. In May 2006, 5 Uighurs were released to a refugee camp in Albania. The remaining 17, in the words of our client Abdulghappar, are "cleared for release but have nowhere to go." <br /><br />In a twist of irony, the Uighurs regarded the United States as one of their strongest allies in their struggle for human rights and self-determination. Indeed, when locals turned them over to the United States, the Uighurs were relieved, even comforted. "We trusted the Americans. We believed in them. We believed all the promises they made to us." Abdulghappar, the man whose bright smile has been dimmed by six years of desperation, explained that he and the other Uighurs believed that the United States would be sympathetic to them and their plight. <br /><br />But the United States has failed to abide by the promises it has made to the Uighurs. Now, more than six years later, the Uighurs remain imprisoned, without charge, and with no meaningful opportunity to contest their incarceration, which has left them estranged from their wives, parents, and children. The United States has reportedly lobbied more than one hundred countries to resettle the Uighurs, assuring these countries that the Uighurs pose no security threat. However, from the other side of its mouth, the United States continues to classify the Uighurs as "enemy combatants" &#8212; an invented term it uses in order to maintain its asserted authority to imprison them indefinitely. <br /><br />In the meantime, conditions at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo have only worsened for these men. The Uighurs are currently confined in individual steel cells, which Abdulghappar refers to as a "metal box," in a supermax-style facility known as "Camp VI." Human contact is restricted to two hours a day of "rec" in individual units enclosed by chain-link fences, and ill-fated visits by riot guards (called the "Emergency Reaction Force") too frequently resulting in physical abuse.<br /><br />But lawyers for the Uighur 17 will never give up. Oral argument is scheduled for April 4 in another Uighur case <em>Parhat v. Gates</em>, an action filed in the D.C. Circuit pursuant to the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 ("DTA"). In the first ever dispositive motion to be heard in a DTA case, the Court will consider whether &#8212; as a matter of law &#8212; Huzaifa Parhat is a non-combatant and should therefore be immediately released. <br /><br />Other Uighur counsel are trying a different approach. In a petition for extraordinary relief filed last month, 6 Uighurs petitioned the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces for a writ mandating that the government treat them in accordance with the Geneva Conventions and a writ prohibiting their confinement in Camp VI. If the government wishes to maintain its position that the Uighurs are "enemy combatants," it must afford them the treatment to which they are entitled as presumptive prisoners of war. Two weeks ago, the Armed Forces court ordered the government to show cause why the Uighurs should not be treated in accordance with the Geneva Conventions. <br /><br />U.S. officials have publicly confirmed that the only obstacle to the Uighurs' release is locating a country of resettlement, a task that has proven arduous and as indefinite as their imprisonment. Though there is much lawlessness to Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo, that a complete standstill in diplomatic efforts can render stateless men "enemy combatants," excuse their indefinite imprisonment, and justify their accommodations in the worst conditions available at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo is beyond irrational. The Uighurs have no intelligence value to the United States. Indeed, our clients have not been interrogated for years. Clearly, the only basis for their continued imprisonment in Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo is a lodging concern. Solitary confinement is not the answer to diplomatic deadlock. <br /><br />Abdulghappar became a hero, and risked reprisal by the Chinese, when he released (through his lawyers) a <a href="/pdf/abdulghapparletter.doc">letter</a> to the public candidly portraying the desperation and injustice suffered by the Uighurs in Camp VI. Indeed, the physical and psychological impact of Camp VI on these men is beyond description. One of our clients commenced a severe hunger strike as an act of protest against the military's refusal to transfer him to a more humane camp to alleviate his health troubles. Another client spoke to us about the things crawling into his head as a result of living in solitary confinement day after day after day. <br /><br />Our government continues to damage its own image by holding these men &#8212; who have all been cleared for release &#8212; in complete isolation. Indeed, the United States has another option. Many of Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo's inmates reside in Camp IV, a communal facility where prisoners are entitled to live, dine and pray together. Camp IV, though not a substitute for due process, provides relatively more suitable living arrangements for those men who are simply awaiting a boarding call to that C-17 to fly them to their new home. The United States can easily move the Uighurs to Camp IV pending the resolution of diplomatic efforts. Though political arrangements might have reached a temporary impasse, transferring the Uighurs to Camp IV requires only a simple phone call. <br /><br /><br /><em>Seema Saifee is a litigator at Kramer Levin Naftalis &amp; Frankel LLP in New York</em><br />

		<title>Iraq Five Years On: An Iraqi Legislative Perspective</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/faculty/researchpost.php?postid=427">Haider Ala Hamoudi</a> of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law says that the mixed success to date of Iraqi legislative initiatives aimed at rebuilding the country&#39;s legal order suggests that true progress and stabilization beyond the mere enactment of laws may require an Iraqi commitment to a long term US troop presence, even though many Iraqi lawmakers would balk at that...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/hamoudi.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>M</strong></font>uch has been said and written about the fifth anniversary of the Iraq war on television, in the print media, and on the Internet. Most, though certainly not all, of this excess of verbiage tends to be rather polemical, extolling the magnificent successes of the American venture, or decrying it as the worst foreign policy venture in American history. Sometimes more nuanced analyses are given, but nearly all view the entire affair through the prism of the interests of the United States. To the extent that the Iraqis are discussed, they tend to be externalized and reduced to a passive polity awaiting liberation from an evil dictator, a vengeful lot more concerned about settling old grievances than running the country, or an unfortunate people poorly represented by a venal and corrupt set of politicians who cannot make necessary compromises, ungratefully debating endlessly while American blood and treasure is wasted on them. <br /><br />I would like to take the occasion of the anniversary to provide a different, legal perspective, a quintessentially Iraqi one, relating to the American experience in Iraq. I highlight the factors that provide a better gauge of the manner in which Iraqis relate to the American invasion, to show why Iraqis tend to be so confused and of two minds about a continued American presence, and how that might relate to legal process and legislative developments inside of the country.<br /><br /><strong>1.The surge is working.</strong> This seems evident. Levels of violence are deeply reduced in nearly all Iraqi cities, shops and restaurants have been reopened, and legislative achievements are being made, even if far more fitfully than the Bush administration has claimed. This naturally tends to lead Iraqis to favor a continued troop presence. If, after all, life on the streets can be improved with more US troops, followed by the enactment of laws in the Parliament, then retaining the status quo appears somewhat attractive.<br /><br />The hope, of course, is that the Iraqi Parliament would move beyond the laws that it has already passed, concerning de-Ba'athification, amnesty, provincial elections and the budget, to tackle even harder issues, such as constitutional reform and the Oil Law, with a view to re-establishing a sensible legal and economic order.<br /><br /><strong>2. It is not working fast enough.</strong> There are problems with this, however. In the first place, the parties appear nowhere near agreement on constitutional reforms or on the Oil Law. The same issues that have divided them for months, and in some cases years, continue to divide them, and no movement has been seen. The Constitutional Reform Committee constantly updates its number of "approved" changes to the Constitution, it is now somewhere in the hundreds, but on the central issues of contention&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;the fate of Kirkuk, the power of the presidency, the creating of federal regions&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;nothing has happened, it seems. As for the Oil Law, the entire affair seems to have been reduced to a name-calling exercise between Hussein Shahristani, the Oil Minister, and Nechervan Barzani, the head of the Kurdistan Regional Government ("KRG"). What is worse, their dispute is not even about a future Oil Law, but rather a number of contracts already signed by the KRG under its own Oil Law without central government approval.<br /><br />More importantly, while in the US it is the passage of these laws that seems to provide the only meaningful benchmark, Iraqis tend to look beyond this. Given the rather young and fragile state of Iraq's democracy, mere legislative enactment, while welcome, hardly seems sufficient. Certainly the laws that have already been passed seem to demonstrate this. The provincial elections law has been derailed by the Iraqi Vice President. Sunnis are deeply dissatisfied with the pace of the implementation of the amnesty law. The de-Ba'athification law is a mess. There is no doubt that problems can be worked out, but this requires time, measured in significant numbers of years, to develop trust and to strengthen the institutions and agencies that will be responsible for interpretation and implementation of these laws. Time, however, appears to be in very short supply, and American interest in Iraqi legislation to date does not extend very far beyond enactment. <br /><br /><strong>3. It will be difficult to persuade the Iraqi Parliament to accept a long term presence of American troops in Iraq.</strong> The anti-colonial, regional liberation fervor that runs strong in the Middle East is equally powerful in Iraq, making Iraqis, even those who feel that the American presence is necessary to achieve legislative priorities, reluctant to openly endorse the presence of American troops. Political leaders in Iraq use some level of dissembling to mediate this divide between resentment of the United States and a popular recognition that its presence is important. They will thus, for example, criticize the "forces of occupation", while relying on American policymakers to assist in the bridging of significant divides. Even Muqtada al-Sadr, the fiery anti-American cleric, will rail against the forces of occupation while doing nothing substantive, of either a military or legislative sort, to advance their departure. Americans in Iraq seem aware of this incongruity and at least somewhat tolerant of it. There has been talk in Congress in the past to require the Iraqi Parliament to endorse the American troop presence, but the Bush administration, aware of what kind of dilemma that would impose on most parliamentarians, who would prefer to see the United States remain even while they rail against it, has never seriously considered it.<br /><br />Matters will change soon, however. American troops cannot remain in Iraq forever under the provisions of Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, which deal with international breaches of the peace. At some point, a long term Status of Forces Agreement will have to be concluded, and every indication is that the Bush administration hopes to complete precisely such an agreement by the summer. While most of the press concerning this has been with respect to whether the Bush Administration will seek Congressional approval for such an agreement, and whether or not Congress will in fact approve, there is an equally serious concern respecting the Iraq Parliament, which Prime Minister Maliki has said must approve any final deal. <br /><br />If forced to vote, the rhetoric of so many representatives, and the fervor against the "occupier" that they helped stir up, makes it very difficult to vote in favor of a long term Status of Forces Agreement, no matter how much they might prefer a prolonged US presence. One can hardly rail against an army being a "force of occupation" after voting in favor of an agreement that authorized its presence on Iraqi soil. Perhaps Iraqis could be persuaded to do away with the regional liberation language, but this seems difficult, given its broad popularity and the extent to which it has infected the popular imagination in the region. Sadr's ability to tap into this sort of sentiment among disillusioned Shi'a is the basis of his popularity, to abandon it would, it seems, almost finish him. If this is true of Sadr, it is doubly so of the more extreme Sunni parli
amentarians, who have made insults against the United States into a daily exercise but who rely on American intervention to keep them relevant.<br /><br />Taking these factors together, it seems that modest progress is being made, but slowly, and that American endurance is limited. Even assuming that the United States were willing and able to commit to a long term troop presence to enable the types of broad legislative achievements (and their implementation) to rebuild the legal order, it is not clear that the treaty that would enable that - a long term Status of Forces Agreement - would be approved by the Iraq Parliament, as the Prime Minister insists is necessary. Five years on, despite recent improvements, that is hardly cause for celebration.<br /><br /><br /><em>Haider Ala Hamoudi is a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.

Five years on, the most tangible lesson of Iraq is that our nation ignores international law at its peril. <br /><br />Going into Iraq, we ignored the UN Charter, which prohibits the use of force except in self-defense or with Security Council authorization. Once in Iraq, we ignored the Hague Regulations, requiring us to put a stop to looting and to make only necessary changes to local law and government. We ignored the Geneva Conventions, which prohibit secret detention and abuse of prisoners of the kind we saw at Abu Ghraib.<br /><br />The talk on Iraq is all about what went wrong, whether the surge is working, and when we can get out. We hear virtually nothing about international law and look set to repeat our mistakes. Violating the law has cost our nation and Iraq dearly. It has denied us the guidance of rules based on long experience and moral consensus. We have lost standing in the world, a literal fortune, and precious lives. Rather than internalizing the lesson of law violation in Iraq, we continue to defy the law in serious and self-destructive ways. <br /><br />The United Nations Charter restricts the use of force to self-defense to an armed attack or to use with Security Council authorization. We had the legal right to go to the aid of Kuwait in collective self-defense after Saddam Hussein attacked that country in 1990. The Security Council also authorized Kuwait's liberation and authorized certain limited measures to ensure Kuwait's future security. We were permitted to use force in Afghanistan in 2001 if it was true, as the British argued, that the Taliban had made common cause with al Qaeda in the 9/11 attacks. <br /><br />As a Pentagon report released in mid-March shows, however, there was no attack on the United States by Iraq&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;no role in 9/11. Indeed, the U.S. did not even try to say on March 19, 2003, that an attack was the legal basis of the invasion. Rather, we tried to argue the Security Council authorized the invasion in 1990-1991. The Security Council did not, of course, authorize an invasion in 2003 thirteen years earlier. We made this implausible argument because we could not get fresh authorization on the eve of the invasion since most members of the Security Council wanted more evidence of Saddam Hussein's defiance of Council disarmament mandates. They wanted to wait for real evidence. We should have heeded that collective wisdom. It was, after all, what the law required.<br /><br />Some may believe Security Council authorization is no longer needed if an invasion removes a dictator from power. That is not the law, however. It never was the law, nor, after Iraq and other failed invasions to impose new political arrangements, is it likely to become the law. At the United Nations World Summit in September 2005, representatives of the international community overwhelmingly endorsed the continued obligation to limit the use of force to self-defense, unless authorized by the Security Council.<br /><br />Our failure to follow the law in resorting to force in Iraq was compounded by our failure to obey the law governing occupation. Running roughshod over the Hague Regulations on occupation and the Geneva Conventions on detention created the conditions for the insurgency to succeed and helped give our adversaries' greater will to fight. This error was repeated when President Bush vetoed a bill on March 11, 2008, requiring the C.I.A. to comply with international law in the conduct of interrogation and when it was revealed a day later that we have held another individual in secret detention for the last six months. <br /><br />Again, we sent the message that we do not fight by the rules; we do not respect fundamental human rights. The President's veto cannot change the international law governing interrogation or the absolute prohibition on prolonged, secret detention. C.I.A. personnel should be on notice that secret detention and cruelty to detainees remains unlawful under international law and participants in such crimes may one day be held accountable. As with our failure to follow the rules on use of force and occupation, our failure to follow the rules on interrogation hurts us in quite tangible, immediate ways. Cruelty is immoral and unlawful; its results are unreliable. <br /><br />Most worrying of all on this fifth anniversary is the talk of yet another unlawful war. The Central Command's Admiral Fallon resigned after media reports of his opposition to attacking Iran. According to an article in Esquire magazine, with Fallon out "it may well mean that the president and the vice-president intend to take military action against Iran before the end of the year&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;." (Thomas P.M. Barnett, <a href="http://www.esquire.com/features/fox-fallon?click=pp">The Man Between War and Peace</a>, ESQUIRE, Mar. 11, 2008) Iran would have to launch a significant attack on the United States or launch a significant attack on another state that formally requested our assistance to lawfully attack Iran in self-defense. The Security Council, after the debacle in Iraq, will rightly be cautious about authorizing any such war.<br /><br />The President, his advisers, and too many members of Congress have not, apparently, learned the essential lesson of the Iraq War at five years. They are not looking to international law to guide our conduct. Even critics of the administration are not discussing international law. The world is discussing international law, however. They hold us to this standard, to which we should hold ourselves. And even if complying with international law were not the right thing to do, it is the wise thing to do: The lesson of Iraq could not be plainer. <br /><br />------------------<br /><br /><font SIZE=2 style='font-size: 8pt'>For more on the topics addressed here, see, also by the author:<br /><br />Responsibility to Peace, Dec. 27, 2007, available at <a href="http://www.sefbonn.org/en/events/index.php">http://www.sefbonn.org/en/events/index.php</a><br /><br /><em>The Ban on the Bomb&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;and Bombing: Iran, the U.S. and the International Law of Self-Defense</em>, 57 SYR.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.missouri.edu/faculty/wellsc.html">Christina Wells</a> of the University of Missouri School of Law says that while the House version of a bill amending the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act forces the Bush administration to actually prove that disclosing surveillance information would endanger national security, the Senate version of the legislation insulates the administration from having to account for itself at all....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/christinawells.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he Bush Administration's warrantless surveillance program has stymied Congress since its revelation in 2005. Should Congress legitimize the program through legislation, essentially gutting existing restrictions on domestic surveillance and concentrating power in the executive branch, or should it provide meaningful oversight of a potentially far-reaching and otherwise illegal operation? The approach chosen has far-reaching ramifications for executive surveillance initiatives yet Congress is at an impasse, with both houses enacting vastly differing legislation.<br /><br />The current battle arises out of the "Terrorist Surveillance Program" (TSP) authorized by President Bush soon after September 11, 2001. Although most of the program's details are unknown, the administration has described it as involving warrantless NSA surveillance of information related to electronic communications where the government reasonably believed a party was associated with Al Qaeda and another party to the communication was outside the United States. The Bush administration has acknowledged that the program intercepted electronic information from people in the United States who were not involved with terrorism.<br /><br />Because the TSP involved warrantless domestic surveillance, it was illegal. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), arguably the exclusive mechanism for conducting such surveillance, requires a warrant from a special intelligence court to engage in domestic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes. To obtain that warrant, government officials must provide certain specific information about the intelligence operation to the court. None of the statutory exceptions to the warrant requirement apply to the TSP.<br /><br />Almost immediately, Congress began investigating the TSP. Instead of reining it in, however, Congress enacted the "Protect America Act" last August. That Act amended FISA to allow warrantless surveillance of people "reasonably believed to be outside of the United States." The Act allowed such surveillance for up to a year with the Attorney General or Director of National Intelligence's authorization, did not require specific identification of targets, and provided little meaningful judicial review. Worried about the Bush administration's failure to provide specific information and the Act's potential ramifications, Congress also included a sunset provision causing it to expire in early 2008. The ensuing months have involved a series of battles over the future of the warrantless wiretap program.<br /><br />In February, the Senate passed a bill that largely extends the Protect America Act and grants retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies who assisted the TSP and are now defending against civil lawsuits alleging that their actions violated the law. The Senate also rejected an amendment clarifying that FISA is the exclusive means under which surveillance can be conducted, thus encouraging the administration's continuing arguments that inherent executive authority and congressional authorization for the use of force in Iraq and Afghanistan justify warrantless surveillance.<br /><br />In contrast, the House bill, passed in March, contains an exclusivity provision, a provision requiring prior intelligence court approval of surveillance measures except in emergencies, and various oversight mechanisms including audit and reporting requirements. The House bill rejects blanket immunity for telecommunications companies although it makes clear that they can defend themselves by presenting evidence of compliance with the law.<br /><br />The differences between the oversight and accountability mechanisms in the Senate and House bills are manifest. The Senate bill leaves unchecked the NSA's surveillance abilities. Government officials can easily justify an interception of domestic electronic communications under a standard requiring only that they "reasonably believe" that the target was outside of the United States. Nothing in this standard protects communications to which Americans are parties from being swept up in surveillance dragnets. Indeed, the government may never need to justify such an interception as the Senate will not commit to FISA as the exclusive means of conducting surveillance.<br /><br />This represents a substantial step backward from FISA's original purposes. Congress enacted FISA after revelations of widespread NSA domestic surveillance abuses in the 1970s &#8212; specifically that the NSA had, with the cooperation of U.S. telegraph companies, intercepted all American overseas telegraphic communications. FISA was designed to provide clear guidelines for surveillance and stop its unwarranted expansion. The Senate bill effectively rolls back those safeguards. In contrast, the House bill's warrant requirement and other oversight mechanisms are more consistent with FISA's original purposes. Until the Bush administration can show (and to date it has not shown) that such oversight poses a threat to national security there is no reason to give it carte blanche with respect to surveillance.<br /><br />The same is true regarding retroactive immunity. The Bush administration has characterized that provision as vital to national security and chastised the House for threatening telecommunications companies with financial ruin merely for helping their country. Such companies, the Bush administration claims, will be unwilling to cooperate with intelligence activities absent retroactive immunity.<br /><br />The administration's arguments are misleading. The House bill unquestionably forces telecommunications companies to defend their actions in court but it hardly forces them to the brink of financial ruin. In fact, it allows those companies to present evidence to exonerate themselves. Furthermore, the Bush administration's real concern is not that telecommunications companies will walk away from the intelligence game &#8212; what remotely sane, public-minded, heavily regulated industry would refuse to cooperate with legal intelligence activities? The telecommunications industry hasn't and it wouldn't and the Bush administration knows it.<br /><br />The Bush administration's real concern centers on the "state secrets" privilege at the heart of these lawsuits. That privilege allows courts to exclude evidence revealing information potentially endangering national security. Courts often defer to government assertions of this privilege, even dismissing whole cases based on it. As a result, government officials can hide wrongdoing behind broad assertions of the privilege.<br /><br />The Bush administration has asserted the state secrets privilege in the telecommunications lawsuits but some courts have nevertheless refused to dismiss the lawsuits. The administration thus faces the possibility of having to account for itself and its warrantless surveillance program in court (albeit behind closed doors). Retroactive immunity prevents the lawsuits from reaching court altogether and achieves the administration's goal via a different route. Hence, the Bush administration's call for retroactive immunity has far more to do with keeping its own secrets than with protecting the telecommunications industry or national security.<br /><br />The House bill adequately protects the secrecy of national security info
rmation revealed in the telecommunications lawsuits while forcing the Bush administration to provide actual proof that information endangers national security instead of ill-defined assertions of harm. The Senate bill insulates the Bush administration from having to account for itself at all. Is there really any debate as to the right choice?<br /><br /><br /><em>Christina Wells is the Enoch H.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bingham.com/Lawyer.aspx?LawyerID=59"><strong>Sabin P. Willett</strong></a> [attorney for Guantanamo Uighur detainee Huzaifa Parhat; <a href="http://www.bingham.com/Default.aspx">Bingham McCutchen LLP</a>]: &quot;For years, lawyers for Guantanamo detainees have argued that the &quot;evidence&quot; on which their clients were held is remarkably flimsy. On Friday, April 4, 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit got its first close look at the proposition, <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/doj-defends-detention-of-uighur-at.php">hearing arguments</a> in <u>Parhat v. Gates</u>, the first case whose merits the court has considered under the Detainee Treatment Act. Congress enacted the DTA in 2005 as a purported &quot;substitute&quot; for habeas corpus. Detainee lawyers have denounced it as hopelessly rigged, as it prevents them from introducing evidence or effectively traversing the government&#39;s evidence, but until now the courts had never considered a record. The record in <u>Parhat</u> is remarkable, for it takes the idea of military detention through the looking glass -- indeed, Chief Judge David Sentelle quoted from Lewis Carroll&#39;s &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; during the argument. <br /><br />The government&#39;s proposition comes to this: we have no personal knowledge of who the enemy is. In <u>Parhat</u>, the government argues that an organization is the military enemy of the United States not because Congress said so, nor yet because that group engaged in hostilities against our forces, but because someone else -- identity unknown -- once said the group is our enemy, and that statement, whose source the Justice Department could not identify, made its way into &quot;military intelligence.&quot; <br /><br />Parhat is a Uighur held at Guantanamo Bay, who has now entered his seventh year of U.S. captivity. He is held as an &quot;enemy combatant,&quot; despite the fact that his circumstances were identical in all respects to five Uighur men who in 2004 were determined to be noncombatants by military panels at Guantanamo. It is undisputed that Parhat never engaged in battle. A task force commander recommended his release in 2003, and the same CSRT panel that found him to be an &quot;enemy combatant&quot; commented that it could find &quot;no source evidence&quot; to support the finding, and then &quot;urged&quot; release. We have argued that his status determination is obviously pretextual, a product of the fact that he cannot be released to China, where he would be tortured as an enemy of the regime, and no other country would take him.<br /><br />The government&#39;s theory is that Parhat is affiliated with the &quot;East Turkestan Islamic Movement,&quot; and that ETIM, in turn, is affiliated with al Qaeda in Afghanistan. The second step of this theory is based entirely on unsourced intelligence. It raises an almost bizarre idea -- we are detaining an &quot;enemy combatant&quot; because of an alleged affiliation with a group, and yet, our own government can&#39;t cite any authoritative source that the group is our enemy at all. The group&#39;s U.S. &quot;enemy&quot; status depends entirely on unsourced allegations that circumstantial evidence strongly suggests were fed to us by Communist China.<br /><br />In Friday&#39;s arguments, the panel, which consisted of Chief Judge Sentelle and circuit judges Garland and Griffith, expressed considerable frustration with the reliability of such intelligence.<br /><br />The case also raises the thorny issue of remedy. We have argued in Parhat&#39;s behalf that, with all other remedies having failed, he is entitled to release into the United States. The government stoutly resists the proposition, and the court appeared to find the question of remedy a difficult one in the present context.&quot;<br />

		<title>Despite Kentucky death penalty ruling, Supreme Court justices offer hope</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Sarah Tofte</span> [researcher, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a>]: &quot;On April 16, in <u>Baze v. Rees</u>, the <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/supreme-court-upholds-kentucky-lethal.php">US Supreme Court issued its highly anticipated ruling</a> on the constitutionality of Kentucky&#39;s use of lethal injection as a method of execution. Although on the surface the Court&#39;s decision, by a vote of 7-2, to uphold Kentucky&#39;s lethal injection protocol looks like a clear endorsement of current execution methods, the deeply fractured opinions of the seven justices who voted in the majority make it highly likely that <u>Baze</u> will not resolve the rising concern of lawyers, judges, medical experts, and the public that lethal injection is inhumane.<br /><br />When the <u>Baze</u> decision came down, the immediate headlines announced that opponents of lethal injection had lost. But those who believe that lethal injection is an unacceptably risky way to kill found hope in the language of Chief Justice Roberts, who noted that if there is an alternative to the current lethal injection protocol that is &quot;feasible, readily implemented, and in fact significantly reduce[s] a substantial risk of severe pain,&quot; then a state&#39;s refusal to adopt that alternative could constitute cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. <br /><br />In a 2006 <a href="http://hrw.org/reports/2006/us0406/">report</a>, Human Rights Watch found that death penalty states had paid little or no heed to the risk that lethal injection may cause unnecessary pain and suffering. In fact, lethal injection poses many hazards, including a significant risk that the condemned prisoner will suffer excruciating pain, yet be unable to move or cry out because of a paralytic drug that is administered as part of the execution protocol. These concerns are not merely hypothetical. Just consider the 2006 Florida execution of Angel Nieves Diaz, who was given a second dose of the three-drug protocol after the first dose failed to kill him. An autopsy revealed that the needle inserted into Mr. Diaz had gone through his vein and into his soft tissue, where the deadly chemicals were not absorbed fast enough to cause a swift death. It took Mr. Diaz thirty-four minutes to die. <br /><br />It is also important to note another milestone of the <u>Baze</u> case. For the first time, Justice Stevens made clear his view that the death penalty is unconstitutional, in an eloquent and damning opinion listing the reasons why Americans should halt the failed experiment of capital punishment. The list is long, but includes the dozens of wrongfully convicted death row prisoners later exonerated by DNA testing; the racially discriminatory application of the death penalty; and the lack of any clear evidence that the death penalty deters violent crime. <br /><br />Support for the death penalty runs deep on the current Court, and few expected a ruling that would have brought executions to a halt for the foreseeable future. But even as it upheld Kentucky&#39;s protocol, the Court made unmistakably clear that executions must not involve gratuitous suffering. Death penalty states should carefully review their execution protocols with this warning in mind, rather than engaging in an unseemly rush to kill.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Frank Kendall</strong> [volunteer consultant, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.com/">Human Rights First</a>]: &quot;Last week I traveled to Guant&aacute;namo Navy Base as a monitor for Human Rights First. I observed pretrial hearings in the cases of Ibrahim Ahmed Mahmoud al Qosi, Ahmed Mohammed Ahmed Haza al Darbi, and Omar Ahmed Khadr. The ostensible goal of the military commissions is to provide fair trials for a subset of the Guant&aacute;namo prisoners being held as &quot;unlawful enemy combatants.&quot; I must report that the commissions are not on the path to success. Success is probably not even possible under the Military Commissions Act (MCA) or the rules that implement it, but the hearings I attended convinced me that the implementation itself is also deeply flawed.<br /><br />The three defendants whose hearings I observed were not the &quot;high value&quot; prisoners who were moved to Guant&aacute;namo in 2006. They are people who have been at Guant&aacute;namo for several years, since shortly after the detention facility was established. Mr. al Darbi, a 32 year old Saudi national, is alleged to have purchased a boat in the Middle East to use in a terrorist attack against shipping in the Straits of Hormuz. Mr. a Qosi, a 47 year old Sudanese national, is charged with being a security guard, driver and fighter with Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan up until the fight at Tora Bora. Mr. Khadr, a 21 year old Canadian citizen, is accused of killing an American soldier in a firefight in Afghanistan in June 2002 when he was age 15. <br /><br />There are fairly detailed accounts of the hearings I observed at the <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.com/">Human Rights First</a> and <a href="http://www.acslaw.org/">American Constitution Society</a> websites. Here I would like to focus on two aspects of the military commissions: (1) the dilemma facing attorneys who are forced to represent clients against their wishes, and (2) the problem of military judges who lack power to enforce defendants&#39; rights.<br /><br />Three Guant&aacute;namo defendants have rejected their attorneys&#39; representation and have said they will boycott the proceedings. Two of the three, Mr. al Darbi and Mr. al Qosi, did so while I was at Guant&aacute;namo. Now their military defense counsel must decide whether to refuse to participate in the proceedings, as their clients wish, or to provide a defense, as the MCA rules and their military orders demand. It is an ethical quandary. If their clients&#39; strategy is to protest the legitimacy of the proceedings, how can the lawyers represent the clients&#39; wishes and interests by acting in direct opposition to that strategy and mounting a defense in the clients&#39; absence? <br /><br />The two defense attorneys I saw and spoke with in Guant&aacute;namo are going to consult their state bars for ethical guidance. For military lawyers, this is not as simple as it might be for civilians. Military lawyers have to follow orders, and at least one military judge made it clear that this is what is expected (and what the MCA requires). One alternative for defense counsel is to sit in court without providing a defense (or, as one attorney put it, like &quot;a potted plant&quot;). Another alternative is for the military to &quot;forum shop&quot; for lawyers whose state bars will allow them to disregard their clients&#39; wishes. Neither alternative makes for trials with the appearance or fact of adequate representation.<br /><br />The second issue I referred to &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; which occurred to me during Mr. al Qosi&#39;s arraignment &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; was even more troubling. Mr. al Qosi appears to have refused to meet with or talk to his new defense counsel, Navy Commander Lachelier. Mr. al Qosi&#39;s first counsel, who had gained his trust and cooperation over a long period, has moved on to her next military assignment (another issue, but for another time). Cmdr Lachelier has repeatedly asked to meet with Mr. al Qosi in his cell or from outside his cell, but her requests have been denied for &quot;security reasons.&quot; Now her only means of communicating with Mr. al Qosi and requesting an in-person meeting is through written notes. Her notes are delivered and read to Mr. al Qosi by the prison guards. She is only allowed to send one note a day and was told that more than one a day would be &quot;harassing&quot; Mr. al Qosi. Mr. al Qosi is permitted to provide a verbal response, which is relayed by the prison guards back to her. <br /><br />Last week, Cmdr Lachelier asked the military judge to direct that she be given an adequate opportunity to communicate with her client in person so as to gain his trust. But the judge believed she had no authority to take corrective action. Her exact response was: &quot;I do not have the authority nor do I desire to alter the security procedures. You will use the normal procedures.&quot; <br /><br />Because the MCA is a new body of law, there is no precedent to guide judges as to their authority beyond the courtroom. There is no apparent reason why the judge could not have delayed the proceedings until those responsible for security devised a way to provide Cmdr Lachelier with access to her client. As an alternative, the judge could have required that Mr. Qosi be brought to a holding cell in the commissions building to meet with Cmdr Lachelier. It is difficult to imagine how a judge may conduct a fair trial and protect the rights of the accused when that judge lacks the authority to ensure that the defendant&#39;s rights are enforced.<br /><br />If the people who set up the military commissions believed that they would provide even the <em>appearance</em> of fair trials, then they have a lot to be worried about. If they believed that the military commissions would <em>in fact</em> provide fair trials, then that would seem to be a prospect without hope.&quot;<br /><br /><em>&quot;Report from Guantanamo&quot; features regular contributions to JURIST Hotline from <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.com">Human Rights First</a>.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Betsy Griffing</strong> [legal program director, <a href="http://www.aclumontana.org/">ACLU of Montana</a>]: &quot;<a href="/paperchase/2008/04/montana-death-row-inmate-files.php">This challenge</a> to the lethal injection protocol is based primarily upon violation of the Montana Constitution, rather than violations of the United States Constitution. We feel that two provisions in the Montana Constitution make this challenge particularly strong. First, we are claiming that the three-drug formula used by the Montana Department of Corrections violates the state constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments. This state constitutional provision has been interpreted by our Montana Supreme Court as granting broader protections than the US Constitution. The basis for this broader protection is the provision in the Montana Constitution guaranteeing the right of human dignity. Art. II Section 4, of the Montana Constitution states, in the first sentence, that &quot;The dignity of the human being is inviolable.&quot; The Montana Supreme Court has interpreted this right of dignity as enhancing or broadening the protection against cruel and unusual punishments in our jails and prisons. In the <u>Smith</u> case, we are claiming that this elevated protection should apply when the Montana Courts look at the lethal injection process as well. If the Courts do evaluate the lethal injection process under this standard, we believe they will conclude the process is cruel and unusual as it exposes the condemned inmate to the very great and grave possibility of significant pain and suffering during the execution.<br /><br />Also, the lethal injection process in Montana is shrouded in secrecy. Part of this challenge is to seek, under the Montana Constitutional &quot;right to know provision&quot; (Art. II, Section 9, Mont. Const.), full disclosure of the training and qualifications of the execution personnel. Currently, the Montana DOC has not provided any information on the training and qualifications of the executioner or execution team. While there is a statute that provides for the confidentiality of the identity and training of the executioner, we believe that statute is unconstitutional under the &quot;right to know&quot; provision. We believe that it is important that the people of Montana be fully informed about how executions are carried out in their name.&quot;<br />

		<title>Tibet: will political power defy international law?</title>
		<link>https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2008/04/tibet-will-political-power-defy/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Eva Herzer</strong> [co-founder, <a href="http://www.tibetnetwork.org/">International Tibet Support Network</a> and the <a href="http://www.tibetjustice.org/">Tibet Justice Center</a>]: &quot;The United Nations Charter, Covenants and Declarations set forth the internationally agreed upon standards of human ethics and decency necessary to protect the integrity and dignity of individuals and peoples. The current massive <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/pro-tibet-protesters-rally-at-nepal-un.php">uprising of the Tibetan people</a> is a textbook example of what happens when the politically powerful defy these standards. China can not longer contain the long standing suffering and resentment in Tibet. Tibetans, from Lhasa to the most remote villages and monasteries, are risking imprisonment, torture and their lives to assert their right to self-determination, which China forcefully took from them over half a century ago. Tibetans are taking to the streets, carrying the picture of their leader, the Dalai Lama, calling for freedom and raising their national flag, all acts strictly prohibited in Chinese occupied Tibet.<br /><br />China&#39;s propaganda efforts of portraying Tibetans as violent people who will send suicide terrorist squads to the Olympic Games and of accusing their Noble laureate leader, the Dalai Lama, of being &quot;a jackal wrapped in a habit, a monster with human face and animal heart&quot; is a desperate attempt to divert international attention from the inevitable necessity to respect the Tibetans&#39; right to self-determination. This right is anchored in Chapter 1, Article 1 of the UN Charter. In 1970, the UN General Assembly declared the right to self-determination to entitle a people, such as the Tibetans, to freely determine their own political status and to pursue their economic, social and cultural development. This right is independent of and separate from the right to territorial integrity, i.e. historical sovereignty. In other words, regardless of whether Tibetans were a sovereign nation in the past, a matter of disagreement between Tibet and China, Tibetans do have the right to self-determination under the UN Charter. Further, the UN Vienna Declaration of 1993 states that when there is a conflict between a state&#39;s claim to territorial integrity and a people&#39;s right to self-determination, the people&#39;s right to all expressions of self-determination (including independence) prevails if the state has not protected the rights of the people or promoted their welfare and human rights. This is clearly the case in Tibet.<br /><br />However, under the non-violent leadership of the Dalai Lama, Tibetans are demanding much less than they are entitled to. They are willing to compromise on an autonomous arrangement for Tibet by which they would govern their internal affairs and China would have power over defense and most matters of foreign affairs (however not just for the so called &quot;Tibet Autonomous Region&quot; but for all of their historical Tibetan territory). This presents a unique opportunity for China to develop national harmony, end the suffering of the Tibetans and, in the process, gain the long sought after moral legitimacy necessary for the claim to world power status, which has eluded China so far.<br /><br />The international community also has an important role to play in assuring respect for international law. With the Olympics approaching fast, international political leaders and corporate sponsors should take a decisive stance to condition their participation in Olympic events on China&#39;s immediate stop of the military lock up of Tibet and a prompt start of negotiations with the Dalai Lama and his exile government. International leaders should remember from the 1936 Berlin Olympics how standing in the Olympic limelight, shoulder to shoulder, with a totalitarian Olympic host strengthens and legitimizes totalitarian regimes and their defiance of international norms. <br /><br />So long as political power and economic interests are prioritized over compliance with international law and non-violent solutions, the message to those who are oppressed, colonized and discriminated against will be that peaceful solutions are impossible. What options does that leave open? Violence? And who suffers when violence prevails?&quot;<br />

The plurality opinion confirms that the safeguards contained in Kentucky&#39;s lethal injection protocol eliminate any substantial risk of harm to condemned inmates. The decision also confirms the competence and professionalism of the Department of Corrections personnel who carry out the protocol. The standard announced in the plurality opinion will greatly simplify, if not eliminate, the repetitious litigation challenging the constitutionality of similar lethal injection protocols in other States across the nation.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Laura Porter</strong> [Director of Organizing, <a href="http://www.ejusa.org/">Equal Justice USA</a>]: &quot;The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/supreme-court-upholds-kentucky-lethal.php">issued its decision</a> in the case of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-5439.ZO.html"><strong>Baze v Rees</strong></a> this week, upholding the constitutionality of Kentucky&#39;s lethal injection protocols.  Texas has already taken the Court&#39;s ruling as a green light to set an execution date - the first of dozens of cases that have been on hold in anticipation of the ruling - and other states like Florida have announced that they will resume their schedule of executions as well.  <br /><br />But the 7-2 decision in <u>Baze</u> belies a deeply fractured consensus on the Court.  The seven jurists in the majority expressed different reasons and differing opinions as to how this will effect future executions.  Justice Alito acknowledged that &quot;[t]he issue presented in this case &#8212; the constitutionality of a method of execution &#8212; should be kept separate&quot; from more fundamental questions about the death penalty itself.  Others noted that the fate of capital punishment remains in the hands of the states.  In that regard, this messy decision reflects the deep uncertainty as to the future of that fate &#8212; uncertainty that continues to grow well beyond the issue of lethal injection.<br /><br />Death sentences &#8212; which were free to continue unabated during the lethal injection moratorium &#8212; are at an all-time low.  Juries are consistently choosing life without parole over the death penalty.  Meanwhile, across the nation lawmakers are asking whether the penalty makes sense anymore. California, Tennessee and Maryland are conducting statewide studies to examine the death penalty system. New York&#39;s death penalty has been permanently suspended and there&#39;s little appetite to bring it back.  New Jersey fully abolished the death penalty last year, while Montana, Nebraska and New Mexico have come close to doing the same. <br /><br />This trend is hardly surprising.  The risk of executing an innocent person continues to haunt the American public.  Just last week another wrongfully convicted man walked off death row after a court found that evidence pointing to his innocence was hidden from his attorneys for over a decade.  We also know more today than ever before about the ways the death penalty impedes law enforcement efforts and harms victims&#39; family members. <br /><br />Police Chief James Abbott, a death penalty supporter who served on the <a href="http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/committees/njdeath_penalty.asp">New Jersey Death Penalty Study Commission</a>, recently wrote, &quot;I no longer believe that you can fix the death penalty. Six months of study opened my eyes to its shocking reality. I learned that the death penalty throws millions of dollars down the drain &#8212; money that I could be putting directly to work fighting crime every day &#8212; while dragging victims&#39; families through a long and tortuous process that only exacerbates their pain.&quot;  Law enforcement officials in Maryland, California, and New York have concurred, coming forward to say that the death penalty is simply not an effective law enforcement tool.   <br /><br />In one way, the ruling in <u>Baze</u> will have a clear effect: it puts an end to the longest period without a single execution in our country in decades.  After such an extended moratorium, we can expect to see a slew of executions in the coming year.  But that will not affect the sea change in public opinion and state policy &#8212; a shift that, despite the collateral matter addressed in <u>Baze</u>, is moving us beyond the death penalty altogether.&quot;<br />

Dieter</span> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/">Death Penalty Information Center</a>]: &quot;On April 16, the <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/supreme-court-upholds-kentucky-lethal.php">U.S. Supreme Court issued a splintered decision</a> on the constitutionality of Kentucky&#39;s lethal injection process.  Despite the seven different opinions, there were many aspects of the decision that were not surprising, and a few aspects which most people did not see coming.  It was not surprising that Chief Justice Roberts held that as long as the death penalty is constitutional, there must be a lawful way of carrying it out.  And it is long-standing doctrine that the Eighth Amendment does not require that methods for carrying out punishment be absolutely painless.  It was not even surprising that the Court upheld Kentucky&#39;s execution process, given that the state had only carried out one lethal injection and did not have an extensive record revealing the myriad problems that have been exposed in other states.<br /><br />It is likely that challenges to lethal injection will continue around the country.  Inmates will attempt to show, based on extensive hearings, recent discovery, and examples of botched executions, that their state differs substantially from Kentucky in the way it carries out lethal injections. In some instances, they will be able to show that alternatives are readily available and have been recommended by a variety of experts.  Some states may have to make changes in their training of personnel, supervision of the execution, or the drugs they apply if executions are to resume.<br /><br />It was perhaps surprising that a number of the Justices expressed their concerns about the paralyzing effects of the second drug, pancuronium bromide.  This is the drug that hides the inmate&#39;s pain that is at the core of this controversy.  Although states are not compelled to abandon this paralytic and change from the three-drug protocol based on Kentucky&#39;s experience, part of the Court seemed to be saying that it would be wise for them to do so.  Chief Justice Roberts said that the Court has relied on the states to find more humane methods of execution, even when they are not specifically compelled to do so.<br /><br />Finally, Justice Stevens&#39; conclusion that he now regards the death penalty itself as unconstitutional came as a revelation to many people. On the whole, the arguments and decision in <u>Baze v. Rees</u> were devoid of the larger questions that usually surround capital punishment.  Justice Stevens forced the Court to consider whether death penalty itself had become detached from any discernible state purpose.  If it is just the pointless extinguishing of human life, then it cannot be justified, no matter what the method being used.  Judging by the many editorials that have been written since the decision last week, this issue may have struck a chord that is reverberating around the country.  That challenge may be much harder for the Court to resolve.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://frg.sin-online.nl/staff/index.html?lia=3215"><strong>Aleksandar Momirov</strong></a> [lecturer, <a href="http://www.eur.nl/english/">Erasmus University</a>]: &quot;In what has been perceived as an astonishing judgment by many, the Trial Chamber of the <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/">International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia </a>(ICTY) <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/serbia-officials-denounce-acquittal-of.php">acquitted Ramush Haradinaj</a> and Idriz Balaj of all charges, while finding the third co-accused in the Haradinaj et al. case, Lahi Brahimaj, guilty under two counts of the indictment for violations of the laws or customs of war and sentencing him to a single sentence of 6 years imprisonment. The three accused, high-ranking members of the so called Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), were charged with, among other things, war crimes and crimes against humanity. Turning to the acquittal of Haradinaj, not being the Tribunal&#39;s first acquittal related to the activities of the KLA (see Limaj et al.), the Trial Chamber agreed unanimously that numerous charges accusing the former KLA commander were not proven.<br /><br />The case, tainted by intrigue and peculiarities, has been followed by the Serbian and Albanian societies in Kosovo and Serbia proper with great anticipation. Consequently, the impact of Haradinaj&#39;s acquittal, celebrated by some and derided by others, was felt throughout the region. The legal sustainability of the judgment may be examined on appeal. However, the legitimacy of the acquittal promises to remain a matter of debate for the months to come. <br /><br />From the outset, the Haradinaj case proved to be exceptionally convoluted. As the judgment emphasizes, major difficulties were encountered regarding the collection of exhibits and the hearing of witnesses. A distinctive feature of the case is reflected in the numerous charges dealing with crimes committed within the Albanian ethnic group, against supposed Kosovo Albanian collaborators during the conflict. This, together with Haradinaj&#39;s influence and support among an influential and significant part of the Kosovo Albanian population, determined the political atmosphere in which witnesses needed to be found. Nine potential high-profile witnesses, 3 of whom were under the witness protection program offered by the ICTY, were killed, thus adding to the environment of fear in which the remaining witnesses, many of which appeared only after numerous subpoenas and court orders, were found &#39;willing&#39; to testify. <br /><br />Not only was it hard to convince the witnesses to testify but the <a href="http://www.unmikonline.org/">UN administration in Kosovo </a>(UNMIK), approached by the Tribunal as the de facto authority in Kosovo, was less than enthusiastic in its cooperation with the Tribunal. Throughout the case, the office of the prosecutor (OTP) pointed out that these difficulties made it virtually impossible for the OTP to substantiate its indictment; something in which the OTP was proven quite correct by the Haradinaj acquittal. <br /><br />This situation was made more difficult by the overt support of UNMIK that war crimes suspect Haradinaj enjoyed throughout his trial. S&oslash;ren Jessen-Petersen, head of UNMIK at the time when Haradinaj stepped down as Prime-minister of Kosovo and surrendered to the UN Detention Unit in Scheveningen, stated that he saw Haradinaj as a friend whose presence in Kosovo would be greatly missed. Such flagrant partisanship by UNMIK continued, to the frustration of the OTP and Serbia, where 180 war crime-related criminal complaints against Haradinaj have been filed. During his highly criticized provisional release in 2007, Haradinaj met with Joachim R&uuml;cker, then and current head of UNMIK, and was subsequently allowed, in an unprecedented move by both the Trial Chamber and UNMIK, to engage in Kosovo&#39;s political life. <br /><br />Being faced with a nearly paralyzed prosecution, Haradinaj&#39;s highly esteemed defense team decided there was no case to answer and refrained from calling upon any witnesses or adducing any evidence to rebut the prosecutions charges. The current acquittal, at least so far, showed that this remarkable legal gamble was justified. Indeed, the judgment is replete with references to the insufficiency, vagueness, inconclusiveness or non-existence of evidence. The Trial Chamber even largely dismissed the OTP&#39;s ballistics expertise, crucial to some of the charges; a dismissal rarely seen even in cases where similar reports were rebutted by counter-expertise of the Defense. Despite efforts of the OTP to bring the case before the Trial Chamber at all, considering the circumstances, the conclusions of the Trial Chamber cast a doubt on the sufficiency and determination of the OTP&#39;s approach to the case. <br /><br />So what can be drawn from the acquittal itself and its consequences? According to the judgment, the OTP failed to prove and the Trial Chamber failed to find that the listed incidents amounted to an attack against a civilian population, let alone a campaign conducted by members of a joint criminal enterprise. In fact, the judgment emphasizes the incidental character of and personal motives behind the incidents in a manner not often seen in ICTY practice. All this being inherent to a conflict in which neighbors face neighbors, the contrast between the way in which relevant legal standards were applied in this case as opposed to certain previous landmark cases of the ICTY leaves many stranded with a hangover. Kosovo&#39;s capital Prishtina was left with a completely different kind of hangover, after Haradinaj&#39;s acquittal was received with street celebrations and official praise. Across the disputed &#39;border&#39;, Serbia&#39;s otherwise hopelessly divided political scene reacted with rarely witnessed unanimity. President Tadi&Auml;&#8225;, Prime-minister Ko&Aring;&iexcl;tunica, the opposition and several NGO&#39;s reacted with amazement and condemnation. Obviously not discharging Serbia of its outstanding obligations towards the ICTY, it is clear that by rocking the fragile legitimacy of the Tribunal once again, for many these obligations have become even more difficult to digest, confirming for many, that justice depends very much on the political favor, or disfavor, in which the accused and the victims happen to stand. <br /><br />The OTP is considering whether it will appeal the judgment.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Maureen Aung-Thwin</strong> [director, Burma Project/Southeast Asia Initiative of the <a href="http://www.soros.org/">Open Society Institute</a>]: &quot;Over the past two decades, various United Nations entities - the General Assembly, the Human Rights Commission (now Council) and the Security Council, have all <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/un-council-deplores-myanmar-rights.php">condemned the Burmese military regime</a> for egregious abuse of the rights of its roughly 50 million citizens. <br /><br />For one last time, Brazilian law professor Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, the outgoing UN Special Rapporteur on Myanmar, delivered a heart-felt, exasperated appeal to the Human Rights Council last month in Geneva. <br /><br />He had completed a full term of seven years and evidently felt it was not the time to mince words. &quot;I did not create my mandate,&quot; he told the hushed and packed room. &quot;You have entrusted me with the follow-up of your resolutions&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;read the resolutions that you have adopted and see if they have been respected or not in Myanmar&quot; he asked rhetorically. The chamber broke out in thunderous applause. <br /><br />Later at a press briefing Pinheiro added: &quot;If you believe in gnomes, trolls and elves, you can believe in this democratic process in Myanmar [Burma].&quot; <br /><br />Unfortunately the HRC does not have enforcement powers. Only the UN Security Council, the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court do. Even with no enforceable powers, it is important for members of the international community - which includes the Burmese regime - to hear a spade being called a spade in an august public forum. <br /><br />Such statements help keep psychological pressure on the UN organs that do have enforcement powers. Perhaps Pinheiro&#39;s parting shots will remind the UN Security Council that the demands of its highly unusual Presidential Statement issued last October have also been totally ignored. That consensus statement, signed off by China and Russia - the regime&#39;s biggest supporters - asked the Burmese simply to urge the generals to talk, instead of jailing and harassing their opponents.&quot;<br />

		<title>Domestic surveillance oversight necessary to prevent FBI abuse</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Melissa Goodman</strong> [staff attorney, <a href="http://www.aclu.org/index.html">ACLU</a>, National Security Project]: &quot;When Americans hear that the <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/dod-using-fbi-to-circumvent-security.php">military is conducting domestic surveillance</a> we tend to get a little squeamish. Isn&#39;t that the FBI&#39;s job? What is the military doing exactly? Who are they investigating and why? Well, here is what we <span style="font-style:italic;">do</span> know, thanks to over 1,000 pages of records released to the ACLU by the Department of Defense (DoD) in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit: <ul><span style="font-weight:bold;">(1) The military is using an intrusive domestic surveillance tool &#8212; National Security Letters (NSLs) &#8212; secretly to obtain private and sensitive records about people in the U.S., without court approval, and without any real oversight.</span> Unlike court approved search warrants, NSLs are issued unilaterally by a government agency, without court approval, when the agency itself determines that the information is relevant to a terrorism or intelligence investigation. In response to our FOIA lawsuit, the military released copies of over 450 NSLs issued since 9/11 by the Army, Air Force, and Navy that demanded people&#39;s sensitive financial or credit records. [NSL <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/nationalsecurityletters/32088res20071014.html">documents</a>; NSL statistics, <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/nationalsecurityletters/released/nsl_stats.pdf">PDF</a>]<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">(2) The military might be circumventing the legal limits on its own NSL power by getting the FBI to issue NSLs for Defense Department investigations.</span> There are five statutes that grant power to issue NSLs. 18 U.S.C. &Acirc;&sect; 2709 grants the FBI alone the power to demand Internet, email and phone records from electronic communication service providers and states that businesses &quot;shall comply.&quot; Similarly, 15 U.S.C. &Acirc;&sect; 1681u grants the FBI alone the power to demand credit account information and states that the institution &quot;shall furnish&quot; the records. 12 U.S.C. &Acirc;&sect; 3414, 15 U.S.C. &Acirc;&sect; 1681v, by contrast, grant agencies authorized to conduct intelligence or terrorism investigations the power to demand financial and credit records but compliance is mandatory only if the request comes from the FBI. Finally, 50 U.S.C. &Acirc;&sect; 436 allows government agencies <em>to request</em> financial, credit, and travel information about employees suspected of espionage or terrorism.</ul> Under some of these statutes, the military might have limited authority to request financial or credit records and compliance with Defense Department-issued NSLs is voluntary. By contrast, the FBI can demand not only financial and credit records but also Internet, email and phone records and can <em>compel compliance</em>. Given these important differences, we were quite concerned to learn that the military may be evading the limits on its NSL power by simply asking the FBI to demand the records for DoD in strictly-DoD investigations. For example, an internal report on the military&#39;s NSL use &#8212; recently redacted as a result of our lawsuit &#8212; reveals that &quot;a DoD component can submit a Request for Assistance (RFA) where the FBI issues an NSL on a DoD investigation (not joint with FBI),&quot; [<a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/nationalsecurityletters/released/60.pdf">report</a>, PDF] that the internal report suggested that the military should start tracking &quot;[t]he number of NSLs issued by the FBI at the request of a DoD component <em>or</em> as part of a joint DOJ/DoD investigation,&quot; [<a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/nationalsecurityletters/released/dod_100207release_49_98_new.pdf#page=24">report</a>, PDF] and that the internal report suggested the military start training people as to &quot;[h]ow to make an NSL request thorough the FBI&quot; [<a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/nationalsecurityletters/released/dod_100207release_49_98_new.pdf#page=24">report</a>, PDF]. These records are hard to square with DoD&#39;s misleading assertion to Congress that &quot;DoD does not ask FBI to issue NSLs in conjunction with a DoD investigation [DoD <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/nationalsecurityletters/released/178.pdf">response</a>].<br /><br />If the military is accessing information it is not legally entitled to (or is getting &quot;mandatory&quot; NSLs rather than &quot;voluntary&quot; ones) simply by asking the FBI to do its bidding, there is a real problem within both agencies. The FBI&#39;s NSL power is limited to <span style="font-style:italic;">FBI</span> investigations, and the DoD should not be allowed to do an end run around the statutory limits on its power by simply calling the FBI. <ul><span style="font-weight:bold;">(3) The military was (and still may be) accessing private domestic records with little oversight, training, or guidance.</span> The FOIA documents also reveal that the military did not even bother to keep track of how many NSLs it issued or what kinds of information it obtained through NSLs. Nor did the military provide real training or guidance on NSL use. [Documents <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/nationalsecurityletters/released/dod_100207release_49_98_new.pdf#page=8">56</a>, <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/nationalsecurityletters/released/dod_100207release_49_98_new.pdf#page=9">57</a>, and <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/nationalsecurityletters/released/dod_100207release_49_98_new.pdf#page=24">72</a>, PDFs]. This shows that there is a dangerous lack of internal oversight, let alone necessary external checks on the military&#39;s activity.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">(4) The military is gagging the businesses it demands records from.</span> Military NSLs come with gags. One of the most troubling aspects of the NSL power generally is that the agencies can forbid businesses, financial, and credit institutions from ever disclosing the military has demanded records from them. Every single one of the nearly 450 NSLs released through the FOIA imposed gags on the recipients. </ul> In many ways, these documents raise more questions than they answer. But one thing is clear: whenever the government is permitted to use an intrusive surveillance power in total secrecy, abuse is inevitable. It&#39;s worth remembering that the last major revelation about military domestic spying concerned the Pentagon&#39;s monitoring of peaceful anti-war protesters and that it tracked protests in a &quot;terrorist threat&quot; database [ACLU <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/spyfiles_norealthreat_20070117.pdf">report</a>, PDF]. And now, thanks to reports issued by the Department of Justice Inspector General, we already know the FBI has seriously abused its NSL power [ACLU <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/general/34464prs20080313.html">press release</a>]. These agencies cannot and should not be trusted to police themselves.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/about_us/staff/colson_d.htm"><strong>Deborah Colson</strong></a> [senior associate, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.com/">Human Rights First</a>, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/us_law.asp">Law and Security</a>]: &quot;In a <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/doj-memo-advised-military-that.php">March 2003 Office of Legal Counsel memorandum</a>, released for the first time last week, John Yoo justified the use of cruel interrogation techniques on &quot;unlawful combatants held outside the United States&quot; - including prisoners at Guant&aacute;namo Bay - by claiming that the president&#39;s commander-in-chief authority trumps federal and international law against torture. The Justice Department rescinded Yoo&#39;s memorandum nine months after it was issued. But the reverberations continue to be felt far and wide - both within the CIA&#39;s current &quot;enhanced&quot; interrogation program and, increasingly, in the military commission proceedings at Guant&aacute;namo.<br /><br />Yoo&#39;s &quot;shock the conscience&quot; test for evaluating the legality of interrogation techniques is reflected in the Bush administration&#39;s current policy governing the CIA program. This policy, which was established by executive order last July, appears to permit even &quot;willful and outrageous acts of personal abuse&quot; so long as their primary purpose is to gain intelligence rather than to humiliate or degrade the prisoner. The effect is to blur the line of prohibited conduct to the point where any cruel treatment may be justified if said to be needed for intelligence purposes.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/detainees/militarytribunals.htm">military commission</a> system at Guant&aacute;namo is also tainted by those within the Bush administration who justified and authorized prisoner abuse. <br /><br />Human Rights First is one of four advocacy organization that have been granted permission to monitor the military commission proceedings. We have attended every hearing held at Guant&aacute;namo since 2004 and have sent an observer again this week to observe proceedings in four separate cases: continuing pre-trial proceedings in the cases of <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/detainees/cases/khadr.htm">Omar Khadr</a> and <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/detainees/cases/al-darbi.htm">Ahmed al Darbi</a>, and the arraignments of <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/detainees/cases/bahlul.htm">Ali Hamza Ahmed Suliyman al Bahul</a> and <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/detainees/cases/qosi.htm">Ibrahim Ahmed Mahmoud al Qosi</a>. Khadr, al Darbi and al Qosi are among scores of Guant&aacute;namo prisoners who allege abuse in custody. To date, fifteen Guantanamo prisoners, including the four men who will have hearings this week, have been criminally charged. The first military commission trial is expected to begin sometime this year.<br /><br />The military commission system was designed to legally sanitize evidence obtained through abusive interrogation techniques, both at Guant&aacute;namo and by the CIA. The Military Commissions Act allows the introduction of statements extracted through coercion and cruel treatment, ignoring fundamental fair trial standards that have been part and parcel of the American justice system for more than 200 years.<br /><br />Terrorist suspects should be vigorously prosecuted, but no trial held under this system will be viewed as legitimate. In fact, the continued existence of these military commissions only undermines the nation&#39;s ability to bring accused terrorists to justice. <br /><br />So what is the alternative? In a recent posting on <span style="font-style:italic;"><a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2187870/">Slate</a></span>, Harvard Law School professor Jack Goldsmith suggested trying Guant&aacute;namo prisoners and other suspected terrorists in &quot;national security&quot; courts under modified rules of evidence, secrecy and security. But national security courts do not yet exist, and - like the military commission system - they would have to be created from scratch. Among other problems, modifying the rules that govern ordinary criminal courts only guarantees protracted litigation and unnecessary delay. The U.S. government should try terrorist suspects in federal criminal courts or by military courts-martial, according to time-tested procedures and protections that ensure fair process under the law.&quot;<br /><span style="font-style:italic;"><br />&quot;Report from Guantanamo&quot; features regular contributions to JURIST Hotline from <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.com">Human Rights First</a>.</span><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Dr. <a href="http://www.nuigalway.ie/law/Staff/laurent_pech.html">Laurent Pech</a>, Jean Monnet Lecturer in European Union Law at the National University of Ireland, Galway, says that the controversy over ratification of the European Union&#39;s Lisbon Treaty is somewhat strange as the Treaty represents no radical alteration of the current &quot;constitutional&quot; relationship between the EU and its member states...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/laurentpechnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>W</strong></font>ith a view to devising a new set of rules for the enlarged European Union (EU), 25 governments signed the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe in October 2004 (and generally referred to as the EU "Constitutional Treaty"). Following two negative referenda in <a href="/forumy/2005/05/eu-constitution-and-french-referendum.php">France</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/breaking-news-exit-poll-says-dutch.php">Netherlands</a> in 2005, the European Council &#8212; the EU institution which gathers together the Heads of State or Government of the Member States &#8212; reluctantly agreed in 2007 to abandon the "constitutional concept" and to draw up a new Treaty which will amend rather than supersede the two existing Treaties: the 1957 Treaty establishing the European Community and the 1992 Treaty on European Union. If this were not confusing enough, the new Treaty, signed in December 2007 in Lisbon (Portugal), initially branded as the "Reform Treaty" or "Simplified Treaty", is now generally known as the <a href="http://europa.eu/lisbon_treaty/full_text/index_en.htm">"Lisbon Treaty"</a>. <br /><br />One controversial question has animated public debate ever since: does the Lisbon Treaty differ fundamentally from the defunct Constitutional Treaty?<br /><br />National governments keen to avoid popular ratification of the new text by means of a referendum have constantly stressed that the "constitutional concept" has now been abandoned. <br /><br />The meaning of this expression, however, is far from clear. As a preliminary matter, it is important to note that the constitutional nature of the 2004 text can be disputed. Indeed, unanimous ratification was required before it could enter into force. Had the Constitutional Treaty been ratified, the Member States would have continued to retain the entirety of the <em>pouvoir constituant</em>, the supreme power to decide one's own constitutional arrangements. To put it concisely, the so-called "Constitutional Treaty" was formally speaking another Treaty rather than a constitution. It would not have given life to a new sovereign power in the absence of a European-wide referendum of self-determination. <br /><br />Yet, from the point of view of its contents, one may legitimately retort that the 2004 text was "materially" constitutional. In other words, although the Treaty Establishing a Constitution for Europe did not obviously pursue the objective of giving birth to a new and sovereign state entity, it included some characteristic and decisive components of any constitution. For instance, it clearly organised the government of the entity to which it applies and it also included a Bill of Rights. As far as substance is concerned, the comparison with the constitution of a state hence appeared reasonable. But if one agrees with this line of reasoning, it is then plausible to argue that the EU already possesses a "constitution" as both the EC Treaty and EU Treaty offer a set of justiciable written rules that define the main organs of government and powers, which are viewed as superior law and can only be amended by special procedures.<br /><br />To bring to a close this rather theoretical discussion, my main point is that the abandonment of the Constitutional Treaty &#8212; if one agrees to view it as a constitution &#8212; does not deprive the EU of a constitution because it has had one since 1957. Therefore it makes little sense to give any weight to the fact that the term "constitution" has disappeared, although one can understand the political motivations for removing it. The two key questions must instead be as follows: Does the new text differ in form and substance from the previous abandoned text? Does it radically alter the current relationship between the EU and Member States? <br /><br />In form: the drafters of the 2004 text sought to simplify the EU's institutional and legal architecture by repealing the EC Treaty and EU Treaty and replacing them with a new text. The decision to abandon the Constitutional Treaty unfortunately means that the present and not easily readable Treaties will continue to remain in force. <br /><br />In substance: the decision to abandon the Constitutional Treaty was a difficult one to make considering the fact that 18 countries &acirc;&#8364;&#8226; representing a majority of the Member States and of the EU population &acirc;&#8364;&#8226; had already ratified it. This explains why, to the palpable satisfaction of those countries reluctant to completely discard the Constitutional Treaty, the Lisbon Treaty retains most of its key provisions. In the much-quoted words of Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, "90 percent of it is still there." The 10 percent &quot;lost&quot; includes the provisions that were said &#8212; inaccurately &#8212; to impinge on statehood: the term "constitution", the definition of the EU as a Union of citizens and states, the reference to an EU flag and hymn, the title "foreign minister" and the provision which stated that EU law must have primacy over national law. This diagnosis was later further confirmed by the UK House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee, which expressed the view that "[T]aken as a whole, the Reform Treaty produces a general framework which is substantially equivalent to the Constitutional Treaty". It seems, therefore, fair to oppose ratification of the Lisbon Treaty on the ground that it is the Constitutional Treaty in all but name. Yet, as pointed out by <a href="http://www.richardcorbett.org.uk">Richard Corbett MEP</a>, although mice and men are 90 percent identical, the 10 per cent difference is rather important. Furthermore, I would argue that the Constitutional Treaty was more than the sum of its parts. Despite its formal treaty format, its constitution-like structure and the first official use of the term constitution would have considerably strengthened the EU's symbolic authority.<br /><br />To some extent, however, this quarrel is irrelevant as most critics preferred to rely on the tired argument that the Constitutional Treaty was the first step on the path towards an undemocratic European Leviathan. But with the exception of the unprecedented official use of the term "constitution", the Constitutional Treaty clearly confirmed that the EU was no federal "superstate" in the making. It only contained a set of modest reforms aimed at improving the effectiveness and accountability of EU institutions. These reforms can be said to be "modest" as they did not &#8212; and will not as far as they are reproduced in the Lisbon Treaty &#8212; substantially alter national sovereignty. Among those modest reforms, one may mention the creation of the posts of president of the European Council and of high representative for foreign affairs (but both actors will remain the servants of the leaders of the Member States), the change to a double-majority voting system in the Council of Ministers (55 per cent of Member States representing 65 per cent of the EU's Population) and the inclusion of a Charter of Fundamental Rights (whose legal impact should not be overestimated because its provisions do not extend the powers of the EU). <br /><br />While the Lisbon Treaty safeguards much of the substance of the Constitutional Treaty and contains limited yet positive institutional changes, one should not expect radical changes from its ratification. As no
 radical alteration of the current "constitutional" relationship between the EU and the Member States is to be expected, it's strange that the Lisbon Treaty inspires so much passion and deceptive analysis from its critics. <br /><br /><br /><em>Laurent Pech is Jean Monnet Lecturer in European Union Law at the National University of Ireland, Galway and the author of <a href="http://www.claruspress.ie/laurent%20pech.html">The European Union and its Constitution.

		<title>Military Jurisdiction Over Civilians: Opening a Can of Worms?</title>

Given the number of civilian contractors that have been part of the war in Iraq over the past five years, the possibility that one of those contractors may be involved in misconduct is certainly no surprise. What is a surprise is that with this particular contractor the military is proceeding with charges of aggravated assault under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). In other words, Ali will be charged, and if there is a trial, he will be tried as a civilian under military law.<br /><br />The military is proceeding under a recent revision of the UCMJ that went largely unnoticed by commentators outside of the military. In the fiscal year 2007 Defense Authorization Act, Senator Lindsay Graham added an amendment to Article 2(a)(10) of the UCMJ which expands military jurisdiction to civilians accompanying the force in contingency operations. The amendment passed into law largely unnoticed and now seems to give military commanders the authority to discipline civilian contractors accompanying the force in Iraq and anywhere else U.S. forces are engaged in contingency operations. <br /><br />This amendment to the UCMJ is seen by some as a tacit recognition that the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act (MEJA), PUBLIC LAW 106&#8212;523, has failed to live up to its intended purpose which was to extend federal criminal jurisdiction to civilians working with U.S. forces overseas. The track record for MEJA over the past eight years has shown the statute to be largely ineffectual for a variety of reasons not the least of which is the significant practical hurdles a federal prosecutor must overcome in order to successfully prosecute these cases. The most recent incidents with Blackwater contractors illustrate some of the difficulty if not impossibility of effectively applying MEJA to civilian contractors accompanying the forces.<br /><br />Even so, the conventional wisdom seemed to be that the new expansion of military jurisdiction over civilians accompanying the force would go largely unused. The thought was that military commanders had enough on their plates as it is and they had little interest in court-martialing civilian contractors. Especially since the more expedient solution would be to simply ship the contractor out of theater. The conventional wisdom also held that if the military were to exercise jurisdiction over a civilian contractor, it would be in only very serious or extreme cases. This wisdom seems not to be holding true as demonstrated by this first case where the military is exercising jurisdiction. Mr. Ali is being charged with aggravated assault for stabbing a fellow contractor. While these charges are potentially serious, they lack the kind of headline grabbing misconduct that many experts expected would precede the first "test case."<br /><br />The military's decision to assert jurisdiction over this contractor raises many questions that will not be easily answered. The first is whether subjecting a civilian to military jurisdiction in this case is even constitutional. While both civilian and military courts have addressed this question on a number of occasions, the Supreme Court has never directly addressed the question of how broad the military commander's powers are in time of war let alone in contingency operations.<br /><br />Another open question is what specific punitive articles of the UCMJ should apply to civilians. For example, some military crimes specifically require that the accused person be a service member. Other crimes, particularly those associated with common law criminal offenses have no such requirement. It is not clear then how much of the UCMJ should or would apply.<br /><br />Another important and yet unresolved question is how does the expansion of UCMJ authority over civilians impact on the scope of a commander's responsibility under the law of war. The doctrine of command responsibility holds that military commanders can be criminally liable for the conduct of the forces under their command if those commanders fail to prevent, suppress, or punish law of war violations committed by their forces. While this doctrine has not been codified under the UCMJ, is has been codified in a number of forms in various international treaties and statutes and the doctrine has obtained the status of customary international law. With the expansion of military jurisdiction over civilians, and with the military now indicating that it is willing to apply this expanded jurisdiction, one important question is whether military commanders can now be held criminally responsible for the law of war violations, such as abuse of detainees, committed by civilians accompanying the force. <br /><br />While seemingly unremarkable for its facts, the case of Alaa "Alex" Mohammad Ali could have a significant impact on military law and bears careful attention as it moves forward. <br /><br /><br /><em>Victor Hansen was a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army JAG Corps and currently teaches at New England School of Law</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist Beenish Gaya, sister to one of the accused in the Canadian terrorism trial of members of the &quot;Toronto 18&quot; who supposedly planned to storm the Canadian parliament and take hostages, says that unbalanced and sensational media coverage of the case and Islam, growing Islamophobia and resulting hatred against Muslims clearly disadvantage and prejudice the accused in this landmark case...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/beenishgaya.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he trial of the only remaining youth in the &quot;Toronto 18&quot; case commenced last week in a Brampton, Ontario courtroom. The new details disclosed in the Crown factum filed in the case elicited depressingly new emotional lows in all of the accused and their families. Reminiscent of that fateful day in June, 2006, the media sensationalism started all over again, with the reporting of incomplete evidence and outrageous headlines. Having attended the entire preliminary hearing, I must confess my shock and disbelief at the fact that these allegations continue to be presented in a manner which precludes the public from seeing a complete or accurate picture.<br /><br />In the Canadian legal system, a preliminary hearing is held for the purpose of determining if there is enough evidence to warrant having an accused person proceed to trial. It gives the accused person and his lawyer an opportunity to learn what evidence the police and prosecution plan to use against them. At the end of the preliminary hearing, the judge decides if there is enough evidence to put the accused on trial, and then the case would proceed to the Superior Court. Unfortunately, in the case at hand, in what can reasonably be seen as an attempt to keep alive the climate of fear and sensationalism, the prosecution abruptly halted the preliminary hearing before the defense lawyers had an opportunity to begin to test and challenge the evidence. As some media have reported based on statements from the informant and others, the preliminary hearing was not going as planned by the prosecution; they were far from proving anything coming even close to an Al Qaeda inspired homegrown terror plot. As lawyer Michael Moon has publicly stated, the "evidence" lacks any substance and reveals nothing more insidious than a bunch of guys talking, camping and goofing around. <br /><br />Against this backdrop, the prosecutors were able to pull out their "wild card" and abruptly end the preliminary hearing. This strategic move unfairly gives the government the ability to keep up the drama and prolong the climate of fear. As documented by leading researchers, the psychology of fear is an effective tool against an uninformed and apathetic public. This is clearly evident from the superficial facts and out-of-context statements being thrown out to an unsuspecting, trusting and fearful public. These young men and youth, who are supposed to be innocent until proven guilty according to our own fundamental democratic right, have been painted as foreign and threatening.<br /><br />I feel obligated to respond to the recent splash of terrorist allegations and to provide some balance and context (with the limited information that I am allowed to disclose as a result of the publication ban). I direct my comments more specifically to two recent articles that got extensive exposure: <a href="http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/350909">&#39;Alleged Toronto terror plot detailed in court&#39;</a> by Isabel Teotonio (<em>Toronto Star</em>, March 26, 2008) and <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2Fstory%2FRTGAM.20080325.young26%2FBNStory%2FNational%2Fhome&ord=14288752&brand=theglobeandmail&force_login=true">&#39;Video calls for defeat of &#39;Rome&#39; in Canadian terror case&#39;</a> by Colin Freeze (<em>Globe &amp; Mail</em>, March 26, 2008). My comments are as follows:<ol><li>It is alleged that these teens/young adults were planning "the plotting of an attack &quot;much greater&quot; in scale than the London 2005 bombings that killed 52 people". As stated in the material released by Justice Sproat in the factum of Michael Moon, this is incorrect. These men were incapable of doing so based on the fact that they lacked the financing and the planning required to plot, let alone, carry out something this outrageous. Moreover, they did not undergo any real training. There is almost a total reliance on the informants in this case by the RCMP and CSIS, which hopefully the public will see as the case unfolds.<br /><br /><li>"According to the allegations, the so-called Toronto 18 were attempting to secure a safe house to store weapons and practice military drills, and embarking on a mission to destroy the West "one they should be willing to die for." This is extremely sensationalized, and exaggerates and decontextualizes the actual evidence. If this is in reference to the trip to Opasatika, then, as stated in the material released by Justice Sproat in the factum of Michael Moon, discussion about Operation BADR, during this trip were even described by Mubin Shaikh (the government's own agent) as "fanciful plans" and constituted a very very minor portion of a 20 + hour trip.<br /><br /><li>"Storming Parliament Hill and beheading politicians." This entire conversation, as Michael Moon suggested in 'Terror schemes exaggerated, lawyer says' by Colin Freeze (The Globe and Mail, March 27, 2008) referred to a 10 hour long car ride, and the conversations during this ride which were completely innocuous and reveal nothing more than a bunch of guys camping and horsing around. Their level of knowledge and sophistication is almost laughable given the seriousness of the allegations against them. In fact, they did not even know the name of the prime minister, and there were no maps, pictures, plans, any course of action, computers, or anything that would suggest they were really plotting something, let alone a terrorist attack. As stated in the material released by Justice Sproat, in the factum of Michael Moon, they lacked the finances and the plans to carry out such deeds.<br /><br /><li>The fragments of conversations that are presented are problematic. The reference to the London bombings and the quotes used are cut and pasted with the elimination of any laughter, and the context of how it is said. Moreover, the public is even more in the dark in that the demeanor and backdrop against which these statements are made are not visible. These decontextualized quotes and statements leave a far more sinister image then would actually be supported if these conversations are presented in the proper context.<br /><br /><li>It has been reported that there were videos of "terrorist indoctrination," in which the accused are exhorted to wage battle in the new empire of &quot;Rome&quot; in North America, &quot;whether we get arrested, whether we get killed.&quot; This video as stated in the material released by Justice Sproat, in the factum of Michael Moon, must be considered in the context of a &quot;hapless `F-Troop,&#39; who ventured into the deathly cold of winter without a proper tent, or in fact sufficient or proper supplies of any kind, was reduced to sleeping in the vehicles at night to prevent freezing to death; trooping off to Tim Horton's multiple times per day for coffee and use of the bathroom, tending the fire, and marching with the primary purpose of staying warm".<br /><br /><li>As described in the press, "the accused attended two training camps. One was a 12-day camp near the town of Washago, Ont., where they practiced military-style exercises in camouflage gear and undertook firearms training with a 9-mm firearm. The second was a two-day camp at the Rockwood Conservation Area, where they donned camouflage clothing and made a propaganda-style video of their military drills." As made clear in the material released by Justice Sproat, in the
factum of Michael Moon, these were not training camps and there was nothing even vaguely military about these camps except that which was orchestrated by Mubin Shaikh, the government's own agent.</ol>Based on the foregoing and what I have seen in court during the preliminary hearing there is nothing to justify a belief that there was a danger to Canada. Indeed this is reinforced by the fact that much of the "evidence" and training appears to come from the government's own discredited agent, Mubin Shaikh, and the fact that the ordering, delivery and control over the fertilizer rested fully in the hands of another government agent and the RCMP.<br /><br />The unbalanced and sensational media coverage of the case and Islam, the growing trend of Islamophobia and the resulting hatred against Muslims clearly disadvantage and prejudice the accused. In fact, those who are identified closely with Islam are easily associated with terrorism through guilt by association and the presumption of guilt. The restrictions imposed by the publication bans preclude an effective voice in opposition to this hatemongering. As a result Muslims have to relive the sensationalist propaganda and the characterization of innocent boys and young men (after all they are all to be treated as innocent until proven guilty, which seems more and more difficult as time passes and the prosecution continues to use the media for misinformation and propaganda) as 'scary monsters'. This only creates an environment that further marginalizes Muslims (particularly those who are seen as openly practicing) and makes it all the more difficult for the accused to be tried in a fair, open and expeditious manner. <br /><br />As a born and raised Canadian, who believes in the freedom and equality of all people, I am seriously appalled at the way a young Canadian's life can be portrayed as a scary troubling demon, i.e. an Al Qaeda inspired terrorist based on scant evidence, out of context statements, one's religiosity and even one's political views. Like any other Canadian, now I patiently await to see if justice will see the light of day given the cloud hanging over the head of the accused and their families as a result of the biased release of information, reported without question, by the media who, for the most part, only seem interested in sensationalism and pushing their "product." In all fairness, I must add that the job of journalists is made all the more difficult as a result of the publication ban and I must also note that some have tried to give voice to the accused and bring some balance. I hope and pray that this will increase as the cases progress so that the accused can get their day in court for fair, transparent and expeditious trials and not trial by media. <br /><br /><br /><em>Beenish Gaya is a Toronto-based writer and sister of <a href="http://toronto18.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogsection&id=12&Itemid=37">Saad Gaya</a>, one of the accused in the Toronto 18 trial.

		<title>Will the Universal Periodic Review Save the UN Human Rights Council?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist Oph&amp;eacute;lie Namiech, a Legacy Heritage Fellow working for UN Watch in Geneva, says that to restore the credibility of the UN Human Rights Council governments that care about human rights must commit themselves to do everything in their power to ensure that the current Universal Periodic Review process succeeds...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/ophelienamiech.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>W</strong></font>hen the UN Human Rights Council wrapped up its main annual session last week, human rights organizations criticized its silence over abuses in Tibet, Zimbabwe and Iran, as well as its redefinition of the freedom of expression mandate to conform to the sensitivities of Islamic states.<br /><br />Nevertheless, many activists and diplomats insist that the Council's relevance and reputation will be saved by a new procedure that opened this week, the Universal Periodic Review (UPR). A key feature of the 2006 reform of the Council, UPR was designed to end selectivity and double standards by ensuring an objective examination of every UN member's human rights record.<br /><br />Will UPR save the Council from the fate of its discredited predecessor? A close analysis of the new mechanism reveals both opportunities as well as difficult challenges.<br /><br />On the optimistic side, two key elements stand out.<br /><br />First, unlike the old Commission on Human Rights, UPR's coverage of all 192 states promotes the principle of universality, and upholds the UN Charter's guarantee of equal treatment to all nations large and small.<br /><br />Every year the Council will devote three sessions to examine a total of 48 countries so that over four years, all 192 will be reviewed. <br /><br />Bolstering the principles of universality and equality is vital given that the Council's plenary sessions have, like the old Commission, continued to ignore most of the world's violations.<br /><br />Indeed, after two years of existence, the world's highest human rights body has fallen short of its promise to ensure "universal respect for the protection of all human rights."<br /><br />The Council has been silent on Zimbabwe's attacks against journalists, political dissidents, minorities, gays, lesbians, and human rights activists. <br /><br />It has been silent on Saudi Arabia's lashing of women who dare to walk the streets without their official "guardians."<br /><br />It has been silent on China's banning of foreign journalists from Lhasa, following the killings and arrests in the Tibetan capital.<br /><br />It has been silent on Iran's summary executions of individuals charged with homosexuality.<br /><br />The list goes on.<br /><br />Under the UPR procedure, however, even the most oppressive regimes will be subject to examination. China, Russia and Saudi Arabia will have their human rights records reviewed in 2009, Iran and Libya in 2010, and Zimbabwe in 2011. <br /><br />The second positive element of UPR is the participation of non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Under the procedure, the Council's review will consider NGO submissions, as summarized by the UN secretariat. <br /><br />These two positive elements -- universal review and NGO participation -- are indeed encouraging signs. <br /><br />Still, there at least three major concerns with UPR.<br /><br />First, despite the consideration of NGO information, the country reviewed maintains significant control over the outcome of the process. The rules established in June 2007 require that the UPR be an "intergovernmental process" and not be "overly burdensome for the concerned State." <br /><br />Consequently, one should hardly expect North Korea to volunteer information on its extrajudicial killings and Burma on its jailing of political prisoners.<br /><br />Second, not only does the country under examination get to be the main supplier of information, but the review process itself is conducted by its peers -- the 47 members of the Council, many of whom are themselves recognized human rights violators.<br /><br />When Algeria is reviewed on April 14, does anyone really expect to see tough questions from China, Russia, Egypt, Pakistan, and Cuba, and all of the others at the Council who work in close alliance with Algeria? Those belonging to the most powerful political or regional alliances -- the African Group chaired by Egypt, the Islamic group chaired by Pakistan, the Non-Aligned Movement chaired by Cuba -- are guaranteed virtual immunity.<br /><br />Third, not only does the UPR have weaknesses as a remedy, but it may even serve as a weapon. Those opposed to robust country review mechanisms of the UN human rights system -- country mandates and resolutions -- now argue that these are rendered unnecessary by the introduction of the UPR.<br /><br />One target of theirs is the system of independent experts on country situations, such as Myanmar and Sudan. The investigators provide valuable reports that raise international awareness of violations, and cause them to be at least addressed by the Council's debates.<br /><br />For that very reason, these mandates are opposed by countries that are not free. In the last session, Cuba, China, North Korea, Zimbabwe and Algeria all slammed the experts for what they called "naming and shaming," and demanded the mandates be terminated. Sadly, they succeeded in eliminating the expert on the Democratic Republic of Congo. It will be a tragic irony if UPR is turned into a weapon in the arsenal of those seeking to minimize or eliminate scrutiny, instead of increasing it.<br /><br />What should be done? Governments that care about human rights must commit themselves to do everything in their power to ensure that UPR succeeds. Democratic member states of the Council like the U.K., France, Germany and Canada must show the courage to ask challenging questions that rely not only on states' reports but also on NGO submissions to all countries reviewed &#8212; including those with whom they are most closely allied.<br /><br />This might help restore the credibility of the Council. More importantly, it might begin to meet the expectations of those who need the Council most: the millions of victims of human rights violations around the world.<br /><br /><br /><em>Oph&Atilde;&copy;lie Namiech is a Legacy Heritage Fellow working for UN Watch in Geneva currently reporting on the Human Rights Council's UPR.</em><br />

		<title>Flag of Convenience? Bush Administration Toutings of  International Law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.nesl.edu/faculty/facProfile.cfm?facID=4">John Cerone</a> of New England School of Law says that while we are accustomed to seeing the US president wrap himself in the US flag to avoid the restraints of international law, his posture in recent cases reveals that he occasionally dons the UN banner as well, perhaps for inverse purposes....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/johncerone.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>E</strong></font>arlier this year, I was invited to participate in a symposium on the case of <em>Medellin v. Texas</em>, in which US President George W. Bush had intervened in support of Ernesto Medellin, a Mexican citizen on death row in Texas. Medellin was seeking review of his case in light of a judgment of the International Court of Justice requiring the United States to reconsider his conviction and sentence. The Court had found that the United States had violated its international obligation to inform Medellin, upon arrest, of his right to have the Mexican consular authorities notified of his situation.<br /><br />This case was of particular interest to international lawyers for a variety of reasons, not least of which was the peculiar posture of the Bush Administration. Essentially, the Executive had intervened 1) on behalf of a (non-whitecollar) criminal defendant, 2) in a death penalty case, 3) in Texas, 4) invoking principles of comity, 5) with reference to an international legal obligation on the United States, 6) as determined by an international court, 7) in a judgment that penetrates deeply into the domestic criminal justice system, 8) of Texas.<br /><br />What&#39;s not wrong with this picture?<br /><br />In my analysis, prepared prior to the recent Supreme Court judgment in that case, I speculated that, despite all indications to the contrary, Hell had not actually frozen over. While acknowledging that the President&#39;s intervention may have been motivated by the interests cited in his brief -- ensuring reciprocal observance of the Vienna Convention, protecting relations with foreign governments, and demonstrating commitment to the role of international law -- parallel developments suggested that the intervention may also have been prompted by a narrower interest that this Administration has sought consistently to advance. <br /><br />When viewed in light of the U.S. Executive&#39;s invocation of international law in a counter-terrorism context, a pattern seems to emerge. In particular, throughout the &quot;War on Terror,&quot; the White House has invoked international law to expand its authority, both externally and internally, while rejecting the limitations imposed by international law. A prime example has been the invocation of the law of war as granting virtually unfettered discretion to detain and kill those deemed &quot;enemy combatants,&quot; while simultaneously ignoring those rules of international and US law that would restrain this discretion. <br /><br />In its March 25 judgment in <em>Medellin</em>, the Supreme Court, following its own recently established pattern, rejected the President&#39;s exorbitant assertion of authority. Reflecting upon the judgment, and in particular the Supreme Court&#39;s refusal to order review and reconsideration of the petitioner&#39;s conviction and sentence, I&#39;ve re-examined whether my own hasty analysis may have been a bit cynical, and considered that perhaps the predominant interests underlying the President&#39;s intervention were indeed those it purported to serve. Fortunately, the Supreme Court has pointed a way forward. The review and reconsideration indicated by the ICJ can yet be achieved in a way that would address all of the interests cited in the Executive&#39;s brief. The President need only ask Congress to accord the Court&#39;s judgment the status of federal law. While the 110th Congress may be reluctant to cooperate with the Bush Administration, simply making the request would be a sign of good faith. <br /><br />I&#39;m not inclined to hold my breath.<br /><br />On the same day that <em>Medellin</em> was handed down, the US Executive appeared before the Supreme Court to argue the case of <em>Munaf v. Geren</em>. The Deputy Solicitor General argued that US courts lacked jurisdiction to hear <em>habeas</em> petitions by US citizens held by US troops in Iraq because the petitioners were &quot;being held under international authority pursuant to determinations made by an international multinational force acting and carrying out a United Nations mandate...&quot; As pointed out by Justice Souter, this would mean that &quot;the president acting alone can make an agreement for an international force or a cooperative force and that agreement of the executive alone in effect eliminates habeas jurisdiction over an American citizen.&quot; This would seem even more striking as applied to an international force that is in reality a US force with an international veneer. <br /><br />Unlike the Executive&#39;s argument in <em>Medellin</em>, which may be seen to evince bad faith, can their argument in <em>Munaf</em> be seen as anything but? Viewed in the context of this continuing pattern of opportunistic invocation of international law, the President&#39;s intervention in <em>Medellin</em> is stripped of the legitimacy of the interests it claims to serve, leaving only the bare power-grab.<br /><br /><br /><em>John Cerone is Associate Professor of Law &amp; Director of the Center for International Law &amp; Policy at the New England School of Law.</em><br />

The memo (here are <a href="http://gulcfac.typepad.com/georgetown_university_law/files/march.14.memo.part1.pdf">parts 1</a> and <a href="http://gulcfac.typepad.com/georgetown_university_law/files/march14.memo.part2.pdf">2</a>) was declassified in the face of a judicial inquiry into why it was not disclosed as part of the torture FOIA brought by our organization, the <a href="http://www.ccr.org">Center for Constitutional Rights</a>, as well as the ACLU, PHR, and two veterans groups. Almost as astonishing is an <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2008/05/guantanamo200805">excellent article</a> in the latest issue of <em>Vanity Fair</em> by another lawyer, Philippe Sands Q.C., that details the evolution of the Bush administration's torture policies up through early 2003 - policies which culminated in the &quot;First Special Interrogation Plan&quot; devised for our client <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/al-qahtani-v.-bush,-al-qahtani-v.-gates">Mohammed al Qahtani</a>, now a capital defendant in the military commissions. <br /><br />Those torture policies were the predictable result of our government&#39;s response to 9/11. Whenever intelligence and law enforcement agencies are caught off guard, as they were by the 9/11 attacks and by the size and strength of the insurgency in Iraq, governments have responded by sweeping huge numbers of people into detention without real cause for suspicion, based on profiling criteria &#8212; being Arab in Afghanistan, being Sunni in the wrong Baghdad neighborhood &#8212; and then relying on the interrogation process to find the suspects from among the mass of detainees. It happened domestically here after 9/11 with immigration detentions, it happened in Afghanistan and it happened in Iraq. And while everyone knows that sweeps end up punishing the innocent, they also generate pressure to torture &#8212; because the &quot;sweep-first-and-ask-questions-later&quot; policy puts tremendous pressure on the interrogation process to make wheat out of chaff. Abuses predictably follow.<br /><br />Like a law of bureaucratic physics, the process generates the pressure &#8212; but did this manifest itself from the bottom up, or the top down? Since the invisible hand of history always works through the actions of real people, we must ask: was the torture revolution the product of the masses or the vanguard? Did the Yoo memos reflect a desire to defend what soldiers and CIA officers in the field had already started doing, as the administration has implied, or did pressure from political officials in Washington drive a change in interrogation policy on the ground?<br /><br />Professor Sands&#39; detective work brilliantly shows that the &quot;trickle up&quot; theory that the administration has consistently put forward &#8212; that the torture memos were shaped in response to the demands of the interrogation experts working on the ground &#8212; is nonsense:<blockquote>The real story, pieced together from many hours of interviews with most of the people involved in the decisions about interrogation, goes something like this: The Geneva decision was not a case of following the logic of the law but rather was designed to give effect to a prior decision to take the gloves off and allow coercive interrogation; it deliberately created a legal black hole into which the detainees were meant to fall. The new interrogation techniques did not arise spontaneously from the field but came about as a direct result of intense pressure and input from Rumsfeld&#39;s office. The Yoo-Bybee Memo was not simply some theoretical document, an academic exercise in blue-sky hypothesizing, but rather played a crucial role in giving those at the top the confidence to put pressure on those at the bottom. And the practices employed at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo led to abuses at Abu Ghraib.</blockquote>As the <a href="http://balkin.blogspot.com/2008/04/convicting-torture-opinion.html">indispensable Marty Lederman points out</a>, the informal advice given to people on the ground, so brilliantly exposed by Sands, &quot;almost certainly served as the go-ahead&quot; for torture that preceded the issuance of formal written opinions from the Office of Legal Counsel and Department of Defense. The process was anything but bottom-up. This may have been obvious to anyone who has noted the many similarities between the techniques used in Abu Ghraib and the harrowing tales of released detainees from Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo. Perhaps not surprisingly, John Yoo, <a href="http://www.esquire.com/print-this/qa/john-yoo-responds">interviewed</a> in <em>Esquire</em> on Wednesday, himself is one of the few people who does not recognize a connection:<blockquote>&quot;The memo released yesterday does not apply to Iraq. It applied to interrogations of al Qaeda detained at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo Bay. I don&#39;t [necessarily] agree that the methods did migrate to Iraq, because I don't know for a fact that they did. The analysis of the memo released yesterday was not to apply to Iraq, and we made clear in other settings that the Geneva Conventions fully applied to the war in Iraq. There was no intention or desire that the memo released yesterday apply to Iraq.&quot;</blockquote>This makes Yoo the last person on earth to fail to realize that the techniques developed at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo migrated to Abu Ghraib. We&#39;ve long known that Maj. Gen. Geoffrey Miller, commander at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo during some of the worst interrogation abuses there (including the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/files/Publication_AlQahtaniLog.pdf">brutal interrogations</a> of Mohammed al Qahtani), was sent to Iraq with an imperative to increased the flow of intelligence from Abu Ghraib prisoners and told subordinates that he was going to &quot;Gitmoize&quot; interrogation practices there. Indeed, we know from Jane Mayer&#39;s work that Miller was secretly briefed on the conclusions of this newly-released March 14, 2003 Yoo memo before his transfer to Abu Ghraib in August 2003. <br /><br />The techniques themselves tell the story. Systematic use of sleep deprivation, hypothermia, intimidation by dogs, and nudity and other sexualized humiliation techniques &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; all were present in both facilities. And the majority of these techniques were obviously calculated to humiliate Muslim men (though logic would dictate that any such techniques could just as well have been calculated to make the Muslim world despise the United States). It&#39;s as if a memo were written about how to break Muslim detainees down psychologically. One day perhaps that memo (likely based on Raphael Patai&#39;s &quot;The Arab Mind&quot;) will see the light of day.<br /><br />Speaking of which, we know that many other specific memos exist but have yet to be declassified or leaked to the public:<ul><li>a 2001 directive to CIA authorizing it to set up overseas dete
ntion facilities;<br /><br /><li>an August 2002 authorizing CIA to use specific interrogation methods (including waterboarding);<br /><br /><li>a memo of October 23, 2001, arguing that the Posse Comitatus Act, which places restrictions on the use of the armed forces to quell unrest within the United States, cannot bind the President in efforts to &quot;prevent and deter terrorism&quot; domestically, and arguing that the Fourth Amendment generally does not place restrictions on such presidential military activities domestically (keep in mind the NSA is a branch of the Department of Defense, and protections against indiscriminate warrantless wiretapping derive from the Fourth Amendment);<br /><br /><li>according to the administration, a separate memo justifying the legality of the NSA Program (James Risen&#39;s book (<em>State of War</em>) on the program cites to &quot;a series of secret legal opinions&quot;).</ul>The fact that these memos remain classified at this point is absurd; equally absurd is the fact they seem still hidden from Congress (how, for instance, can legislation validating aspects of the NSA program remain on the table so long as Congress has not examined the last two memos above). The very existence of the October 23, 2001 memo is only known to us because it was cited in other Yoo memos which have appeared over the years. The Posse Comitatus element of the October 23 memo was revealed because it was cited in a footnote in Jay Bybee&#39;s leaked memo of February 26, 2002 on the law governing interrogation of detainees in Afghanistan; the memo released this week cites the same October 23 memo for the Fourth Amendment point. I suppose we should be thankful that Yoo cites himself so much, although that habit (a favorite of law professors!) also meant that his bad advice spread from issue to issue as easily as the abusive interrogation practices he was an apologist for spread from place to place.<br /><br />And if we trace the bad advice back in time, it all returns to one point of origin: the series of initial memos issued in the Fall 2001 advocating the position that the executive enjoys essentially unlimited power to defend the United States from threats, and that Congress fundamentally lacks the constitutional authority to check or regulate his exercise of power in any way. While the actual text of the Constitution begs to differ in several places, the just-released Yoo memo seems willfully blind to that: it cites only once to the provisions of Article I which specifically assign to Congress the power to make rules for governing and regulating the armed forces, and not once to those giving Congress the power to define and punish war crimes. Indeed, a large chunk of the new memo is dedicated to the proposition that criminal statutes are inapplicable to government officials generally.<br /><br />The true outrage is when <em>federal judges</em> accept these theories about law-free zones, place huge gaping holes in the Geneva Conventions, buy into the idea of executive military discretion to wiretap and torture rooted in an imaginary uncheckable power to move troops on the battlefield, and in general acquiesce to the policies of the executive. And, ironically enough, several of the guys <a href="http://balkin.blogspot.com/2008/04/post-no-4-yoochertoffashcroft-memo-how.html">who either did (Michael Chertoff) or should have (Jay Bybee) checked off on Yoo&#39;s memo</a> were people who President Bush named to the federal bench. <br /><br />The &quot;trickle-up&quot; theory of torture &#8212; blaming abusive interrogation on the few bad (enlisted) apples, and their immediate supervisors who neglected to rein in &quot;animal house on the night shift&quot; &#8212; has always been nonsense. The fish rots from the head, and this memo is just a bit more proof that the torture policy emanated from the swamp of Washington, D.C. &#8212; not the bowels of Abu Ghraib.<br /><br />But the fish will have a new head in nine months. And upon that new head will fall intense public pressure to continue some of the same misguided preventative policies of the past seven years. Those policies naturally generate tremendous pressure in favor of abusive interrogation techniques. The next President will also face enormous pressure to use the products of interrogation under torture against defendants in the military commissions system the current administration is rushing to get underway&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;a system whose <em>raison d&#39;etre</em> is the admissibility of torture evidence. Will Americans remember this next year, when Bush and his cronies go back to mismanaging private sector enterprises? Or will the story of how a few corrupt conspirators in the White House and OLC managed to undo generations of military culture and sound interrogation practice and replace them with a culture of torture become the new "animal house on the night shift" trope &#8212; distracting us from the fuller truth, and letting us miss the pressures that might even afflict that very nice Mr. Obama should he occupy the throne of the Presidency come next January?<br /><br /><br /><em>Shayana Kadidal is senior managing attorney of the Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo project at the Center for Constitutional Rights.</em><br />

Heller</em> case in a spirit of conciliation and compromise rather than extremism, the Court can make its ruling on the interpretation of the Second Amendment a victory for everyone...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/allenrostronnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>n a few months, the U.S. Supreme Court will issue the most important decision it has ever made about the Second Amendment. Who will win? If the Court wisely heads for the sensible middle ground, everybody will win.<br /><br />The last time the Court made a significant pronouncement about the meaning of the right "to keep and bear arms" was in <em>United States v. Miller</em> (1939), a cryptic opinion which raised more questions than it answered. After avoiding the issue for nearly seventy years, the Court is finally poised to shed new light on the Second Amendment's meaning in <em>District of Columbia v. Heller</em>. That case concerns the constitutionality of D.C. laws that essentially ban handguns and require other firearms, such as rifles and shotguns, to be kept unloaded and disassembled or bound by a trigger lock or similar device while stored in gun owners' homes.<br /><br />Since the Court heard oral argument in the <em>Heller</em> case on March 18, gun control supporters and opponents alike have been busy scrutinizing the justices' questions and remarks for clues to how they will rule. <br /><br />Some press coverage of the case has had an unfortunate tendency to oversimplify the legal issues, suggesting that the key question is whether the Court will decide that the Second Amendment protects an "individual right" as opposed to a "state right." In fact, the District of Columbia does not deny that the Second Amendment protects a right that belongs to individuals, so that point is not even disputed in the case.<br /><br />Instead, the real question that has been hotly debated for several decades is the scope or breadth of that right. Is it a right that applies only in connection with public, organized, military activity? Or is it a right that applies more broadly to self-defense and other private uses of guns?<br /><br />Thousands of pages of law journals, books, and briefs have been filled with arguments about that question over the years. The result essentially has been an unsatisfying draw. There is ample material to support both sides of the debate, whether one looks at the constitutional text, the historical record surrounding its adoption, the underlying concerns that inspired the provision, or its origins in English legal history. <br /><br />Reading the endless stream of writing on this question, both as a lawyer for a gun control organization and then as a law professor, convinced me that there simply is no clear "correct" answer to the question of how broadly the Second Amendment should reach. The meaning of the Amendment is in the eye of the beholder, with both sides equally and sincerely able to find what they want to see.<br /> <br />I am convinced that if we could go back in time and ask the Framers about the scope of the Amendment, we would hear a wide range of different views. Military use of guns was the overwhelming focus of the discussion for those who drafted and adopted the Amendment. But did they also expect it to cover other uses of guns? Surely some did, and some did not, and most probably never thought about it one way or the other. To say that we can look back now and determine what was the majority view, on an issue that was clearly not the center of attention, is to pretend that we know more than we really do.<br /><br />No matter how much of a genuine toss-up the issue may be, the Supreme Court probably cannot avoid picking one side or the other. The justices' statements at the oral argument, as well as their previous comments and general ideological leanings, strongly suggest that at least five of them will endorse the view that the Second Amendment extends broadly to reach more than just military activities.<br /><br />Rather than resolving the case, that will merely lead to the most crucial question of all. How strong is the right protected by the Second Amendment? In other words, what level of scrutiny or review should be applied to decide the constitutionality of the host of federal, state, and local gun laws in force today?<br /><br />The District of Columbia argues that laws should be upheld if they represent "reasonable restrictions." If the Supreme Court agrees, it will be supported by an overwhelming consensus that already exists at the state constitutional level. Adam Winkler, a professor of constitutional law at UCLA, has done magnificent work showing that there has long been widespread agreement in state courts across the country on the test that should be used in gun cases. Forty-two states have constitutional provisions that give individuals a right to have guns for non-military activities. In every instance, courts have held that this right protects people from being completely disarmed, but gives governments wide room to impose reasonable regulations on guns.<br /><br />Heller, and <em>amici</em> like the National Rifle Association, urge the Court to apply strict scrutiny. That would be an unprecedented and enormous mistake. None of the lower federal or state courts that have recognized a broad individual right to guns has concluded that strict scrutiny should apply. Strict scrutiny would lead to a crushing wave of constitutional challenges to every firearm law in the nation and risk invalidation of even the most reasonable, common sense restrictions on guns.<br /><br />If the Court agrees with Heller that the Second Amendment protects a broad individual right to have guns for non-military purposes, but also concludes that the right is subject to reasonable regulations, the Court will have made a decision that both sides truly could call a victory. In particular, gun owners would be reassured that they are protected by a constitutional right. They could stop being afraid that every gun regulation, no matter how modest, will lead the country down a "slippery slope" to bans and confiscations of all guns.<br /><br />The ultimate fate of the statutes at issue in the <em>District of Columbia v. Heller</em> case &#8212; D.C.'s handgun ban and gun storage requirements &#8212; matter much less than the crucial question of what test or standard of scrutiny comes out of the Court's decision and applies in future cases. Indeed, if the Court really wants to emphasize that it is coming down squarely in the middle on this often polarizing subject, it could strike down one part of the D.C. law and uphold the other. Chief Justice John Roberts gave tantalizing hints during oral arguments that he might support such a compromise, suggesting several times that he could not regard a complete ban on handguns as reasonable, but also that he might be more inclined to uphold the safe storage law. The Court also could easily split the case in the opposite direction, concluding that D.C. homeowners should be allowed to store guns unlocked and ready to be used against criminals, but that banning handguns is a reasonable restriction considering that shotguns traditionally have been regarded as excellent weapons for home security.<br /><br />Whatever decision the Court makes about the validity of the D.C. laws, the most important thing the Court will do is set the legal standard that governs future challenges to gun control laws. The vast majority of the American people oppose complete bans on guns, but support reasonable restrictions. By approaching the Heller case in a spirit of conciliation and compromise rather than extremism, the Court can make the decision a victory for ev
eryone, affirming the validity of reasonable regulations while respecting the interests of gun owners. <br />    <br /><br /><em>Allen Rostron is an Associate Professor at the University of Missouri &#8212; Kansas City School of Law and a former senior staff attorney for the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence. He is the author of "Incrementalism, Comprehensive Rationality, and the Future of Gun Control," appearing in the next issue of the </em>Maryland Review<em>. It looks at the D.C. gun case in more detail, as well as at other recent gun control controversies such as the Virginia Tech shootings and seizures of guns after Hurricane Katrina.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/students/faculty/BDavis/BDavis.htm">Benjamin Davis</a> of the University of Toledo College of Law says the recently released 2003 John Yoo memo on US military interrogation techniques opened up a path to torture and leaves a great number of persons potentially criminally liable for the acts that occurred pursuant to the memo, if only we break the &quot;silence of the lambs&quot; and speak out...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/benjamindavisnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font> series of events over the past two weeks prompts me to write again in this space, breaking the silence of the lambs and inviting all of us to revisit together the "severe pain" analysis of the newly released March 14, 2003 Yoo memo. <br /><br /><strong>I. Events prompting this comment</strong><br /><br />The first event that prompts this comment was on March 27, 2008, when I was informed of the decision of the Executive Committee of the American Society of International Law that a <a href="http://www.law.utoledo.edu/students/faculty/BDavis/ASIL/Resolution2008.htm">member-initiated draft proposed resolution</a> on the United States and detainee treatment, waterboarding, and calling for criminal prosecution for torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment was "inadmissible". Thus, members were being deprived of the opportunity to discuss the draft proposal at the Annual Meeting starting this week. It is an untenable decision for reasons I have explained elsewhere, but its effect is to silence the draft proposal.<br /><br />The second event was on March 30, 2008, when Murat Kurnaz, as a guest on <em>60 Minutes</em>, recited the treatment he allegedly received at the hands of the U.S. military during his detention in Afghanistan and Guantanamo. He described having been hung from the ceiling in an aircraft hangar in Afghanistan for five days by his arms (checked by doctors every six hours to see if he could still stand it), being electrically shocked, and having his head put underwater and punched in the stomach to make him inhale water. He alleged being placed in cold and hot rooms at Guantanamo. All allegations were considered to be unsubstantiated by the U.S. military. Kurnaz's complaints are met with silence.<br /><br />The third event was on April 1, 2008, when a march 14, 2003 memo on the Military Interrogation of Alien Unlawful Combatants Held Outside the United States written by John Yoo to the General Counsel of the Department of Defense, was released. The memo has been discussed by others, but in short it is another torture memo.<br /><br />The fourth event was on April 2, 2008, in response to a question over at opiniojuris.org I offered a comment on the "severe pain" analysis done by Yoo in his memo at pages 36-39 demonstrating, on its own terms, it was untenable. I had not seen this type of analysis done before and thought it would be a contribution to discussion. The response on the merits of the analysis was silence.<br /><br />The fifth event was on April 3, 2008, when I received from "UNKNOWN" a text message with my name in it that was a death threat of the "we know where you live" and "we are watching you" kind. I felt that someone wanted me to be silent.<br /><br />The sixth event was on April 4, 2008 when I was reminded of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s life. I remembered how he was silenced. <br /><br /><strong>II. Fallout from the memo</strong><br /><br />On April 2, 2008, Marty Lederman <a href="http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/04/the_timeline_behind_yoos_memo.php ">argued</a> that Yoo&#39;s March 2003 memo is &quot;in effect, the blueprint that led to Abu Ghraib and the other abuses within the armed forces in 2003 and early 2004.&quot; <br /><br />In an <em>Esquire</em> <a href="http://www.esquire.com/the-side/qa/john-yoo-responds">interview</a> published on April 3, 2008 Yoo stated, "The memo released yesterday does not apply to Iraq. It applied to interrogations of al Qaeda detained at Guantanamo Bay. I don't [necessarily] agree that the methods did migrate to Iraq, because I don't know for a fact that they did. The analysis of the memo released yesterday was not to apply to Iraq, and we made clear in other settings that the Geneva Conventions fully applied to the war in Iraq. There was no intention or desire that the memo released yesterday apply to Iraq." <br /><br />On April 4, 2008, it was <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/03/AR2008040304136.html">stated</a> that the Yoo memo was probably part of the reason why 22 of 24 criminal prosecutions referred by the CIA and Defense Department had been dropped. Denials of knowledge of the memo were issued by the then Attorney General, John D. Ashcroft, the then Deputy Attorney General Larry D. Thompson, and the then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Retired Air Force General Richard B. Myers. Lawyers for defendant Charles Graner convicted in the Abu Ghraib abuse scandal said the memo should have been released as part of the ordinary discovery process in those cases and they were going to submit it to Graner's parole board in the next few weeks.<br /><br /><strong>III. The hole in the "severe pain" analysis</strong> <br /><br />The Yoo memo tries to set out what interrogators could do. For that to be done the memo had to define "severe pain" from the torture statute.<br /><br />The relevant sections of the memo are around pages 36-39 and 40 where it is stated:<blockquote>Section 2340 defines the act of torture as an: act committed by a person acting under the color of law specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering (other than pain or suffering incidental to lawful sanctions) upon another person within his custody or physical control....<br /><br />The key statutory phrase in the definition of torture is the statement that acts amount to torture if they cause &quot;severe physical or mental pain or suffering.&quot; In examining the meaning of a statute, its text must be the starting point. See INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 189 (1984). Section 2340 makes plain that the infliction of pain or suffering per se, whether it is physical or mental, is insufficient to amount to torture. Instead, the pain or suffering must be &quot;severe.&quot; The statute does not, however, define the term &quot;severe.&quot; &quot;In the absence of such a definition, we construe a statutory term in accordance with its ordinary or natural meaning.&quot; FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 476 (1994). The dictionary defines &quot;severe&quot; as &quot;[u]nsparing in exaction, punishment, or censure&quot; or &quot;[I]nflicting discomfort or pain hard to endure; sharp; afflictive; distressing; violent; extreme; as severe pain, anguish, torture.&quot; Webster&#39;s New International Dictionary 2295 (2d ed. 1935); see American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1653 (3d ed. 1992) (&quot;extremely violent or grievous: severe pain&quot;) (emphasis in original); IX The Oxford English Dictionary 572(1978) (&quot;Of pain, suffering, loss, or the like: Grievous, extreme&quot; and &quot;of circumstances ...: hard to sustain or endure&quot;). Thus, the adjective &quot;severe&quot; conveys that the pain or suffering must be of such a high level of intensity that the pain is difficult for the subject to endure.<br /><br />Congress&#39;s use of the phrase &quot;severe pain&quot; elsewhere in the U. S. Code can shed more light on its meaning. See, e.g., West Va. Univ. Hosps., Inc. v. Casey, 499 U.S. 83, 100 (1991) (&quot;[W]e construe [a statutory term] to contain that permissible meaning which fits most logically and, comfortably into the body of both previously and subsequently enacted law.). Significantly, the phrase &quot;severe pain&quot; appears in statutes defining an emergency medical condition for the purpose of p
roviding health benefits. See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. &Acirc;&#167; 1369 (2000); 42 U.S.C &Acirc;&#167; l395w-22 (2000); id. &Acirc;&#167; 1395x (2000); id. &Acirc;&#167; 1395dd (2000); id &Acirc;&#167; 1396b (2000); id &Acirc;&#167; 1396u-2 (2000). These statutes define an emergency condition as one &quot;manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that a prudent lay person, who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine, could reasonably expect the absence of &#39;immediate medical attention to result in-placing the health of the individual ... (i) in serious jeopardy, (ii) serious impairment to bodily functions, or (iii) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.&quot; Id. &Acirc;&#167; 1395w-22(d)(3)(B) (emphasis added). Although these statutes address a substantially different subject from section 2340, they are nonetheless helpful for understanding what constitutes severe physical pain. They treat severe pain as an indicator of ailments that are, likely to result in permanent and serious physical damage in the absence of immediate medical treatment. Such damage must rise to the level of death, organ failure, or the permanent, impairment of a significant body function. These statutes suggest that to constitute torture &quot;severe pain&quot; must rise to a similarly high level-the level that would ordinarily be associated with a physical condition or injury sufficiently serious that it would result in death, organ failure, or serious impairment of body functions.</blockquote>One weakness of the rules of statutory construction (or rules of interpretation) approach is that everyone knows (as said Justice Kennedy in 2006 at the Nabrit Lecture at Howard Law School) that one can always find a rule that works for what you want to do. <br /><br />I could spend time trying to look for this or that rule and focus on said rule as an alternative to the Yoo approach. The essence of this approach is that my discussion here would become kind of a more sterile exercise of &quot;ah yes there are many ways to do this&quot; and we would proceed off to our next article. For example, one could try to look at the same statutory language under a cumulative approach and look at the variety of answers and say isn&#39;t that fascinating. One is left with a kind of bewilderment at the possibilities.<br /><br />Sorry to speak plainly, but I think JURIST would want me to speak plainly. Maybe because I am too lazy or something, I simplified my life a bit by taking Yoo at his own words. I assume that he means the words he writes so I look at them.<br /><br /><strong>IV. Taking Yoo at his own words</strong><br /><br />For example Yoo says the medical emergency standard is:<blockquote>These statutes define an emergency condition as one &quot;manifesting itself by ,&#39;acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that a prudent lay person, who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine, could reasonably expect the absence of &#39;immediate medical attention to result in-placing the health of the individual ... <br />(i) in serious jeopardy, (ii) serious impairment to bodily functions, or (iii) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.&quot; Id. &Acirc;&#167; 1395w-22(d)(3)(B) (emphasis added).</blockquote>This language is the same in the other statutes to which Yoo refers in that section of the text (See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. &Acirc;&#167; 1369 (2000); 42 U.S.C &Acirc;&#167; l395w-22 (2000); id. &Acirc;&#167; 1395x (2000); id. &Acirc;&#167; 1395dd (2000); id &Acirc;&#167; 1396b (2000); id &Acirc;&#167; 1396u-2 (2000)).<br /><br />Note that language and then note the next sentence which is on page 38:<blockquote>They treat severe pain as an indicator of ailments that are, likely to result in permanent and serious physical damage in the absence of immediate medical treatment. Such damage must rise to the level of death, organ failure, or the permanent impairment of a significant body function.</blockquote>But none of the statutes Yoo cites treat the damage as that rising to the level of death, organ failure or the permanent impairment of a significant body function. <br /><br />Yoo&#39;s language in the sentence above on its face appears to contemplate to me a definition that restricts &quot;severe pain&quot; to something more narrow than does the statute to which he has chosen to make reference - let alone any more capacious definition from another rule of construction. <br /><br />The language of the statute he cites does not make reference to anything permanent - it focuses on seriousness. While it could certainly contemplate at the high end of its seriousness - quoting further - &quot;physical condition or injury sufficiently serious that it would result in death, organ failure, or serious impairment of body functions.&quot;<br /><br />It also can include lower level types of seriousness that he has decided to exclude. So while starting from the language of a statute, to which he refers pursuant to a rule of construction, what he is doing is putting his own gloss on that statute &#8212; giving his own hypernarrow definition of &quot;severe pain&quot;. No statutory backup for that Yoo version.<br /><br />In his own words, and I believe that he believes what he wrote, he is giving advice that &quot;severe pain&quot; (Yoo version) is not &quot;severe pain&quot; (statute version) - a nice sleight of hand it seems to me. As we can presume he specifically intended to write this memo, his words are done with the specific intent of narrowing the limit of what is prohibited. <br /><br />The difficulty that Yoo faces is that a prosecutor might say that even on the basis he has taken (the statue to which he refers), the rule prohibits more types of actions than Yoo's standard prohibits. Putting it another way, Yoo got it wrong and the consequence of his getting it wrong was that those who relied on his wrong analysis did acts that were severe pain (meaning torture). His pen flowed to torture. <br /><br />And the prosecutor could argue that Yoo was not mistaken out of &quot;misfeasance&quot; but rather &quot;malfeasance&quot; in that Yoo was working overtime to come up with narrowed rationalizations that would &quot;protect&quot; those below when they did acts that were in fact torture: he had the specific intent required for conspiracy to torture for example. <br /><br />The prosecutor could bring in someone who for example tortured Murat Kurnaz and ask him to tell what he had done and whether he had been instructed to do that and by who, etc. and up the chain until you find where the Yoo memo was made operational. <br /><br />Working on Yoo&#39;s standard, the fact that they brought in a doctor every 6 hours to check if Murat Kurnaz was still in good enough shape to be hung up indicates to me that - even with the doctor saying the guy was OK - &quot;a prudent lay person, who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine, could reasonably expect the absence of &#39;immediate medical attention to result in-placing the health of the individual ...&quot;.<br /><br />That lay person might not consider the damage &quot;permanent&quot; (Yoo&#39;s word sleight of hand) but enough to meet the standard of the statute cited by Yoo. <br /><br />It is Yoo who then takes the step to push even the statute he is citing to an interpretation that permits torture. That was his choice and I presume that he had the specific intent to write the analysis that he did. That conduct is his <em>actus reus</em> and from conduct one can intimate <em>mens rea</em> - though I expect that from the collection of his work there may be further evidence that corroborates the <em>mens rea</em>. <br /><br />After all, Yoo states in his interview in <em>Esquire</em>:<blockquote>The other thing I was quite conscious of was I didn't want the opinion to be vague so that the people who actually have to carry these things out don't have a clear line, because I think that would be very damaging and unfair to the people who are actually asked to do these things. The way I read what the department did two years later, was
they just made the line blurry again. And -- you can have the dispute -- you can say I don't think the line you've drawn is in the right place. That's fine. But I think its not fair to say, which I think they did, which I feel -- people say its slapdash -- I think it's not right when they say "I don't want to be very clear." Because that's just people protecting their own backs. So...</blockquote>He had the specific intent to do what he did. And what he did was create a standard for "severe pain" out of whole cloth that was unsupported by the statute he cited.<br /><br /><strong>V. Breaking the silence of the lambs</strong><br /><br />For those who relied on this Yoo standard (such as the Working Group at the Department of Defense who were required by the General Counsel to write their analysis based on the Yoo memo, or anyone else above or below Yoo who operationalized the Yoo memo) they would assert reasonable reliance on the Yoo analysis to seek to avoid criminal prosecution. However, from what I showed above, the Yoo analysis is untenable on its face. In addition, given that the exercise I just went through took me about five minutes of looking up the relevant statutes that Yoo cites, I must question whether any lawyer in this process or layperson with the reasonable sense to ask a lawyer to check the point could be seen as being reasonable in relying on a "severe pain" standard that is made up from thin air. <br /><br />I would think a question might be asked as to where the Yoo-included-language came from since it is not in the statute that Yoo cites. I can speculate on where it might have come from (a Presidential finding?). <br /><br />The key is that a jury confronted with this evidence would not consider the Yoo standard as reasonable and would not consider reliance on that standard as reasonable. That would appear to me to leave open a great number of persons as potentially criminally liable for the acts that occurred pursuant to this memo. Of course, the memo has been withdrawn, but all those persons in the chain of command in the relevant 2003 period who operationalized the Yoo standard should be contacting lawyers. Maybe that is the reason that so many potential persons of interest are denying any knowledge of the memo at this time. I cannot believe them. There has been too much of this obfuscation about detainee treatment.<br /><br />Ah, if the ASIL would have put its considerable authority behind the idea of further investigation of these points that would have been nice, but, of course the resolution was "inadmissible." Civil society wants silence. The military and civilian authority wants silence.<br /><br />This reminds me of the <em>Lions for Lambs</em> comment. The recent movie <em>Lions for Lambs</em> takes its name from a comment made by a German officer during World War I, comparing British soldiers&#39; bravery with the calculated criminality of their commanders. All that the elite appears to want is silence from the lions so that the lambs escape liability.<br /><br />As I have said before, not good enough. To keep our honor clean, break the silence of the lambs. All we need is evidence, a prosecutor, a grand jury indictment, a trial, and a conviction. Bring light. Bring light.<br /><br /><br /><em>Benjamin Davis is a professor at the University of Toledo College of Law</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Julien Ball</strong> [administrative coordinator, <a href="http://nodeathpenalty.org/content/index.php">Campaign to End the Death Penalty</a>]: &quot;Back to the killing game. That is what the Supreme Court&#39;s decision <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/supreme-court-upholds-kentucky-lethal.php">upholding the method of execution</a> known as &quot;lethal injection&quot; means. <br /><br />Thirty-five states that use the death penalty put prisoners to death by lethal injection &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; where a prisoner is given three different drugs to bring about his or her death. This method does not violate the constitutions ban on cruel and unusual punishment, according to the Supreme Courts decision.<br /><br />This gives a <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/some-us-states-to-resume-executions.php">green light to these states</a> to dust of their death machines and start up their engines.<br /><br />For seven months we got a taste of what it would be like without the death machine after a de facto halt on executions was in place. Now it&#39;s lifted. And many poor and disproportionately minority prisoners that had exhausted their appeals will likely find themselves on an execution list in the not too distant future. During that seven months we saw the &quot;exonerated from death row&quot; list climb to 128. Isn&#39;t it time to to recognize the unfairness, racism and error prone nature of the death penalty and do away with it?<br /><br />But the Supreme Court didn&#39;t address the larger issues of the use of the death penalty itself. They instead focused on the aspect of the procedure of how someone is executed &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; specifically lethal injection. And even here they failed to grasp the torturous nature of this method of execution.<br /><br />The problems surrounding the lethal injection protocol used in 35 states are indisputable. It is well-documented that the first drug administered often fails to sedate death row prisoners, ensuring that they suffer excruciating pain as the second and third drugs paralyze them, then stop their heart. In April 2005, the British medical journal <em>The Lancet</em> published a report, finding &quot;that in 43 of the 49 executed prisoners studied the anesthetic administered during lethal injection was lower than required for surgery. In 43 percent of cases, drug levels were consistent with awareness.&quot;<br /><br />The ruling in <u>Baze v. Rees</u> is a setback. It reverses the trend of the U.S. Supreme Court to limit the scope of the death penalty. In 2002, the court declared the execution of the mentally retarded unconstitutional, and in 2005, it banned the execution of juveniles, citing &quot;evolving standards of decency.&quot; States, too, have bolstered this trend, as New Jersey became the first state to abolish the death penalty legislatively last December. <br /><br />The Supreme Court has declared that torturing someone to death is not cruel and unusual punishment. But no matter how the chemicals are mixed, the death penalty is still cruel. It&#39;s cruel that it punishes the poor; it&#39;s cruel that it targets African-Americans and Latinos; and it&#39;s cruel that it condemns the innocent to die. The death penalty is wrong, and there&#39;s just no right way to do the wrong thing.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.fcnl.org/about/bios/dan_smith.htm"><strong>Daniel M. Smith</strong></a> [Colonel, USA (Ret.); Senior Fellow for Military Affairs, <a href="http://www.fcnl.org/index.htm">Friends Committee on National Legislation</a>]: &quot;<blockquote><em>I believe there are more instances of the abridgement of the freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments of those in power than by violent and sudden usurpation.</em> <strong>James Madison, 1788</strong></blockquote> <br />October 23, 2001. For sixteen days, U.S. warplanes had been dropping the very latest GPS-guided iron bombs on Afghanistan after that country&#39;s ruling Taliban faction refused to surrender Osama bin Laden to stand trial for the murder of more than 2,935 people on 9/11. On that same October day but physically half-way around the globe and a universe apart in experience and opportunity, Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo of the Department of Justice&#39;s Office of Legal Counsel, finished a classified legal memorandum that discussed the extent to which the president could restrict or suspend entirely fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution during &quot;domestic military operations.&quot;<br /><br />Somehow, citizens and legal residents of the United States had become the enemy or, at the very least, collaborators simply because of the freedoms enumerated in the Constitution. The pen, so fervently and frequently hailed as mightier than the sword in enumerating democracy&#39;s gifts, was being used to scratch all of them from the nation&#39;s chronicles. <br /><br />On April 10, 2008, six years, five months, 17 days after Yoo finished his memo, members of the Senate Appropriations Committee <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/mukasey-says-fourth-amendment-applies.php">challenged</a> the current Attorney General, Michael Mukasey, to declassify that Yoo memo which is but one of a number of legal opinions that purported to justify radical steps to expand presidential power within the United States in the aftermath of an attack that President Bush responded to &#8212; erroneously &#8212; with military forces rather than the judicial system within the United States and the cooperation of allied nations around the world. <br /><br />Regrettably, for most of the nearly 6&Acirc;&frac12; years since the October memo was penned, the public failed to mount sustained pressure on Congress to repudiate the White House power grab. While more voices are being raised in protest, the administration is attempting to consolidate its &quot;gains&quot; by demanding that Congress not only re-authorize expanded surveillance powers that have or are about to expire but make them permanent. And because the administration can conceal so much by simply classifying documents and records, the scope of its subterfuge may never be discovered until historians gain access to government records &#8212; if then. <br /><br />In truth, it was pure accident that the existence of the October 23 memo became public. Administration redactors failed to black-out a footnote in another OLC memo dated in March 2003 that described the earlier memo as concluding &quot;that the Fourth Amendment had no application to domestic military operations.&quot; (The Fourth Amendment reads: &quot;The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.&quot;) Moreover, what was not revealed by the Attorney General is how long OLC&#39;s finding with regard to the Fourth Amendment was in force; Mukasey noted that the Justice Department &quot;withdrew the March 2003 memo nine months after it was issued,&quot; but he declined to be drawn out on the October 2001 finding.<br /><br />From what has become public through Freedom of Information (FOI) requests, associated FOI judicial rulings, and challenges to the Bush administration attempts to devise non-standard courts and associated judicial structures, it is clear that the White House was engaged in a wide-ranging effort to deprive the public of the very liberties that are the hallmark of a free society. How close we came &#8212; and how close we still may be &#8212; to the abridgement of individual rights by the administration may come to light only when the official history of the first decade of the 21st century is written.<br /><br />To that end, the Congress might invite the Attorney General to come to Capitol Hill to elaborate on what he means by &quot;<em>the principle</em> that the Fourth [or any other] Amendment doesn&#39;t apply.&quot;&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php"><strong>Ali Khan</strong></a> [Washburn University School of Law]: &quot;Pakistan&#39;s ruling Coalition has less than forty-eight hours left to fulfill their pre-election promise with the nation to restore the high court judges that General Musharraf fired by means of the 2007 Emergency Proclamation last November, an action contrary to the Constitution.  The country&#39;s lawyers are likely to protest hard and refuse to cooperate with the new government if the Coalition fails to deliver the promise.<br /><br />The Pakistan Peoples Party, the chief party of the Coalition, appears to be uncertain about the modalities of restoration even though it had previously agreed that the judges would be restored through a Parliamentary resolution followed by an executive order. Since the sacking of the judges was unconstitutional per se, the cumbersome constitutional procedures were deemed unnecessary for the restoration. <br /><br />More pressing problems await the Coalition. The shortage of food items and electricity frustrates the common people on a daily basis.  The court system is less than fully functional. The economy is sliding into non-performance. The national debt is high. Pervez Musharraf refuses to step down. The Attorney General who engineered the undermining of the Constitution is still in office. The Prime Minister should have fired the Attorney General right away, for his continued occupation of the highest law office is an affront to the supremacy of the Constitution. The Coalition must move fast on the primary logistics of cleaning the constitutional mess. If the Coalition fails to handle the relatively easier issue of the restoration of judges, it is unlikely to stand the pressures of solving the more serious problems.&quot;<br />

		<title>Restoring Pakistan&#039;s ousted judges: betrayal in the name of reconciliation</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Faisal Naseem Chaudhry</strong> [advocate, Lahore High Court, Lahore, Pakistan]: &quot;In Pakistan&#39;s February 18 elections, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), i.e. the PML (N), emerged as the two major parties in parliament respectively. On March 09 this year, both parties signed the six-point &quot;Murree Declaration&quot;, the second point of which indicated that the judges ousted by President Musharraf under last November&#39;s proclamation of emergency rule shall be restored within 30 days of the formation of the Federal Government through a Parliamentary Resolution. The countdown to restoration commenced on March 30 when the Federal Cabinet took its oath of office, but the whole thing has proved to be a waste of time while the entire nation was glued to the tele-screens waiting for the promise to materialize. April 30th became part of history today but the deposed judges of Pakistan remain deposed. All credit for this goes to the gimmicks of Mr. Asif Ali Zardari (AAZ), the Co-Chairman of the PPP.<br /><br />It is not that easy for Mr. Mian Nawaz Sharif (MNS) to step out of the coalition. This is why he may prefer to step out of Federal Cabinet (for face-saving) but shall continue to support the PPP Government. Becoming an opposition party in the National Assembly would authorize the PPP to use all fair and unfair means for toppling the PML (N) government in the Province of Punjab, the most important of the four provinces where the Chief Minister belongs to PML (N) and PPP holds some ministries. Ruling the province of Punjab, the most thickly populated and the most resourceful part of Pakistan, has been an unfulfilled dream of PPP for a long time.<br /><br />AAZ has not only let down the deposed judges but most notably the lawyers headed by Aitzaz Ahsan, President of the Supreme Court Bar Association, who is also a Member of the PPP&#39;s Central Executive Committee. According to news items appearing on April 04, there had been an exchange of harsh words between Zardari and Ahsan (though Ahsan later termed it a mere conflict of opinion) to the extent that AAZ kind of threw a challenge to Ahsan daring him to go ahead with his &#39;Long March&#39; pressing for restoration. AAZ intentionally did not implement the most important part of the Murree Declaration for the purpose of showing Ahsan that he, his lawyers, his deposed judges and his movement are not worth anything to the PPP.<br /><br />A few days before the April 30th deadline, AAZ opened his mind with BBC and secondly with a GEO News Interview not only in respect of the proposed constitutional package rather also the person of ousted Chief Justice Chaudhry. Most Pakistanis have regarded it unfair that AAZ is ready to reconcile with every political force in Pakistan, even the MQM of Karachi which burnt alive a number of lawyers in Karachi a couple of weeks ago, yet maintains personal venom and vendetta against the person of Chief Justice Chaudhry. It is not the old memories of the BMW case before the Supreme Court, rather the National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO) which is his point of concern.<br /><br />When Benazir Bhutto (BB) was returning to Pakistan in the last quarter of 2007, President Musharraf promulgated the NRO (also regarded as National Humiliation Ordinance by some writers) chiefly to facilitate BB and AAZ in respect of their cases involving huge corruption and kick-backs. Chief Justice Chaudhry had issued an injunctive order against the Ordinance and then everything changed with November 3 Martial Law sugarcoated as Emergency. Mr. Dogar became the Chief Justice and favourable judgments pleased Zardari including one upholding the operation of NRO. Justice Dogar had been working as a Junior Associate of Mr. Qaim Ali Shah, the incumbent Chief Minister of Sindh who managed to have him recruited as Additional District Judge during the first tenure of BB (1986-1988). <br /><br />Zardari feels comfortable with Justice Dogar, a man from the Province of Sindh where the Bhutto shrine is situated. If Justice Chaudhry becomes Chief Justice again with the same conventional judicial and administrative powers a Chief Justice enjoys, Zardari is apprehensive of the striking down of NRO which will again send him behind the bars or at least into exile. He does not want to take any chances particularly when it shall merely add more votes into the vote bank of Nawaz Sharif who contested the February 18 elections with the solemn pledge of reinstatement of deposed judges. Voters voted for PML (N) for the restoration of judiciary. For PPP, it was the blood of slain BB which resulted in a good harvest.<br /><br />So AAZ wishes to either circumscribe the tenure of Chief Justice Chaudhry or curtail his unbridled administrative powers including the power to constitute a Bench of own choice, fixing cases of own choice. He also desires to retain the Judges who took oaths under the Provisional Constitution Order on Nov 3 last year and thereafter as fresh appointees. Anything short of this shall be ostensibly unacceptable to AAZ. Can he survive without the support of PML (N)? Certainly not only in Centre but in all the four provinces too. Only for Punjab, he shall have to put in little effort for a successful vote of no-confidence against the PML (N) Chief Minister. MNS is not likely to step out of coalition even for the sake of deposed judges. He will give more time to AAZ for the reinstatement yet where do the lawyers stand in this standoff?<br /><br />A third round of talks between AAZ and MNS is going to take place tomorrow on May 01 in Dubai. Maybe by tomorrow evening a firm roadmap will be provided for the reinstatement through a simple majority resolution of the National Assembly, yet the point is simple. How can you trust this man whose ego is superior to a superior court?&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Asim Qureshi</strong> [senior researcher, <a href="http://www.cageprisoners.com/">Cageprisoners</a>]: &quot;After years of being held in detention without charge, the British men released from Guantanamo Bay who are pursuing <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/uk-ex-guantanamo-prisoners-suing.php">legal action against the intelligence services</a> are sending a very clear message to both governments and security services: there is no room for arbitrary detention and torture. <br /><br />The released men - who were never charged with any crime during their imprisonment - have never received a formal apology from the US or UK governments for the ordeal they underwent. The process of taking action against the UK administration clearly seeks to redress the complicity of the British government in rendition to torture and false imprisonment at secret detention sites, culminating in incarceration at Guantanamo Bay. <br /><br />Whatever may result in the outcome of these claims, it is not acceptable that British citizens (indeed any citizens), are detained beyond the protection of the law, interrogated by British security services and then simply handed over, extrajudicially, to third party countries.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="URL of your webpage"><strong>Faisal Naseem Chaudhry</strong></a> [advocate, Lahore High Court, Lahore, Pakistan]: &quot;On April 22, a delegation of Lahore-based lawyers called on deposed Pakistan Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry at his residence in the capital Islamabad. Since many could had wished to become part of the delegation, the leaders of the Bar Association kept the visit quite secret. Luckily, the brother-in-law of the deposed Chief Justice (Mr. Awais Rana) is a colleague, another Lahore-based lawyer who managed to put my name on the approved list of visitors. <br /><br />We reached the residence around 11 AM, as the meeting was to start by 11:45. We arrived early mindful of security measures, yet there was no hindrance. Chief Justice House is located at a prime location in Islamabad, opposite Sindh House. There were barriers as well as police checkposts since it was a high security area, yet the police officers were aware of our arrival and there was no trouble coming from any quarter. The renowned Mr. Athar Minallah, one of the leaders of the Lawyers&#39; Movement, was waiting for us so that everything went smoothly, and everyone appreciated his concern and efforts.<br /><br />The delegation was headed by Lahore High Court Bar President Mr. Anwar Kamal, included the leaders of the Lahore High Court Bar, Lahore District Bar, and Lahore Tax Bar. Some of the participants were ex-office holder like the well-known Mr. Muhammad Shah, the former president of the Lahore District Bar who faced the entire wrath of the Lahore police from March 09, 2007 (when Chief Justice Chaudhry was first suspended from office) to Jan 2008 i.e. until the time new elections took place replacing him with a new President.<br /><br />We were a total of 20, and were invited to sit in the comfortable spacious visitor&#39;s room of the Chief Justice House. Within minutes, the Chief Justice was with us. He greeted and welcomed every guest personally and very warmly. The meeting continued for more than an hour during which all the participants expressed their views about the Lawyers&#39; Movement, the steadfastness of the Chief Justice, as well as the &#39;Muree Declaration&#39; signed by the two major political parties promising the restoration of the deposed judges. Some concerns were also voiced about the so-called &#39;Minus One Formula&#39; appearing in the press according to which the judiciary shall be restored but without the Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry.  A little discussion followed on the possibility of curtailing the tenure of Chief Justice Chaudhry through a constitutional amendment. <br /><br />&quot;Discussion&quot; may not be a proper word for all this, however, as all the little speeches were made by the office holders of the bar and the Chief Justice kept quiet, smiling. It was natural. He is undoubtedly the most important man in today&#39;s Pakistan and his every single word means a lot to many. He was courteous, asking an assistant to serve us with soft drinks and cake yet not speaking much except making the obvious pledge to uphold the rule of law and the Constitution. <br /><br />After the meeting, we asked the Chief Justice to join us for a little photo session to which he graciously consented. <br /><br /><img src="/hotline/chaudhrymeeting.JPG"/><br /><br />We moved to the rear lawn of the Chief Justice House and I was the only lucky one who managed to take a solo flight i.e. a solitary photo with His Lordship. <br /><br /><img src="/hotline/faisalchaudhrymeeting.jpg"/><br /><br />Again he individually thanked all of us for coming all the way from Lahore and we said goodbye where the media was waiting out on the road for Mr. Anwar Kamal to say few words.<br /><br />My personal feeling was that the Chief Justice was under great pressure; it was not pressure from the Presidency nor from the Parliament. The nature of this pressure is a little hard to explain. More than his job is at stake, more than his future is at stake, more than a Constitution is at stake. Every minute was taking us to April 30 when the deadline for action is over and if Chief Justice Chaudhry is not restored to his November 02 position, there will be chaos. According that, Chief Justice Chaudhry is to retire on 11 December, 2013 and not any earlier. Apart from this unexplainable pressure, His Lordship was in great spirits. He was not a &#39;worried man&#39; by any stretch of imagination.<br /><br />The Chief Justice did not speak much, did not comment much. Only thanked and encouraged us to remain faithful to the supremacy of rule of law which is the cornerstone of the Lawyers&#39; Movement. Meeting him in the spectacular Chief Justice House was a more than pleasant experience. My personal thanks to Mr. Awais Rana, although Mr. Anwar Kamal was little surprised to see me there.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Sahr MuhammedAlly</strong> [senior associate, Law and Security program, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/">Human Rights First</a>]: &quot;While pre-trial motions continue at Guant&aacute;namo Bay, Cuba, at other end of the globe in Afghanistan more than 60 former Guant&aacute;namo and Bagram detainees <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/afghan-court-trying-ex-us-detainees.php">have been convicted</a> based on little more than mere allegations by the United States. After years of detention in U.S. custody without any due process, these detainees, although now finally in some legal process, are being tried by the Afghans in violation of basic fair trial standards.<br /><br />Earlier this year I was in Kabul, Afghanistan, to examine the prosecutions of former Guant&aacute;namo and Bagram detainees. Over 250 Afghans from Guant&aacute;namo and Bagram have been transferred since April 2007 to the American-built Afghan National Defense Facility (ANDF) in Pul-i-Charkhi prison in the outskirts of Kabul. Defendants are being tried under a Soviet-era Afghan national security law and are being charged with crimes ranging from destruction of government and private property to assisting enemy forces. Of the 160 persons referred for prosecutions, since October 2007 over 60 have been convicted, and more than 40 have been sentenced to imprisonment for up to 20 years. Trials last between 30 minutes and an hour. There are no prosecution witnesses at the proceedings, no out-of-court sworn prosecution witnesses, and little or no physical evidence is presented. [See Human Rights First, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.info/pdf/USLS-080409-arbitrary-justice-report.pdf"><em>Arbitrary Justice: Trial of Bagram and Guant&aacute;namo Detainees in Afghanistan</em></a>]. <br /><br />I personally observed two trials while I was in Kabul - each lasting around 30-35 minutes. The prosecutor stood up and read a statement of the charges and the evidence to support the charges. The evidence consisted simply of what the United States military had accused the defendant of doing, including a summary of the circumstances of capture, and what the Afghan intelligence agency - the National Directorate of Security (NDS) - had found, years after the capture, to support the allegations. The defense counsel then stood, denied the allegations, and repeatedly enquired as to the source and validity of &quot;evidence&quot; relied on by the prosecutor. Members of the three-panel judge then asked the defendant questions and one judge read from the dossier (evidence file). In one trial, a judge showed a photograph to the courtroom of captured ammunition that was allegedly linked to a defendant. There was no discussion of the type of ammunition, who found it, who is now in possession of those weapons, or how the ammunition was allegedly - if at all - linked to the defendant. <br /><br />There were no witnesses at either proceeding. One defendant was sentenced to 8 years and the other to 10. <br /><br />In one of the trials I observed, the defendant did not even speak Dari - the language of the court proceedings - but spoke Pushto (which, like Dari, is one of the two official national languages of Afghanistan), and repeatedly looked to his lawyer for translation assistance because the court provided no translator.<br /><br />I was also able to examine the &quot;evidence&quot; the United States provided to the Afghans in these cases, and the results of the Afghan intelligence agency&#39;s own investigation. The U.S. evidence consisted of second-hand interrogation summaries; a two- to three-page form, which included a short description of the circumstances of arrest; and information about whether the detainee had undergone a polygraph test and the result of the test. There were no witness statements or even identification of government witnesses in these documents other than generically naming the detaining entities as Coalition Forces or Afghan National Army. <br /><br />The Afghan intelligence agency documents included summary findings by the local NDS office where the alleged incident took place, and summarized incriminating statements about the detainee by unidentified witnesses. The NDS and national security prosecutor also interview every detainee and the answers to their questions were included as part of the dossier. <br /><br />I asked a national security prosecutor about the quality of evidence, and he acknowledged that there are problems regarding the evidence, but he too was unable to get more from the United States. Still, he admitted, there is pressure from the United States to prosecute all the detainees.<br /><br />A fundamental requirement of any fair criminal proceeding is that the defendant must be able to confront the evidence and question witnesses to the allegations. The former Bagram and Guant&aacute;namo detainees are completely denied of this right, in violation of both Afghan and international law. <br /><br />The ANDF undoubtedly will continue to receive detainees in U.S. custody as more than 600 remain in Bagram and more than 30 Afghans are still in Guant&aacute;namo. But it is critical that, after <em>years</em> of confinement, any U.S. detainees transferred to Afghan custody who are charged with criminal violations of Afghan law have a fair adjudication of their cases. One way is for the Afghan government to demand from the United States names of witnesses to the allegations so that the prosecution can support any charges and the defense has the ability to mount a real defense. The United States, as the capturing and detaining power, should be willing make available witnesses for prosecutions. <br /><br />The United States has made a policy decision to do just that in Iraq - where U.S. service members appear every day as witnesses in trials of suspected insurgents in the Central Criminal Court of Iraq. In Iraq the U.S. military trains soldiers and Marines in evidence collection and makes available soldiers for testimony in Iraqi trials of persons captured by the United States. The same principle should apply in Afghanistan. <br /><br />The U.S. government&#39;s response to the findings of unfair trials has been to say that the trials are being conducted according to the Afghan justice system. These trials in fact are being conducted <em>in contravention of</em> the 2004 Afghan criminal procedure law, which on its face largely meets international fair trial standards. The United States is one of the largest donors supporting justice sector reform in Afghanistan and is involved in writing laws, training judges, prosecutors, and mentoring the Afghan Attorney General&#39;s office. But in the case of these trials the United States is actively complicit in pressuring the Afghan government to disregard its own law and fundamental due process standards. If these trials are evidence of how justice reform donor countries in Afghanistan work to foster the rule of law, the snail&#39;s pace of judicial reform in Afghanistan is regrettably more understandable. <br /><br />Once U.S. detainees who are Afghan nationals are turned over to the Afghan government, Afghan courts should be allowed - and equipped - to fairly decide the outcome. The rule of law should be the goal here, not the rubber-stamping of U.S. allegations.&quot;<br />

		<title>Reformist Muslims need legal protection from blasphemy accusations</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Farzana Hassan</strong> [president, <a href="http://www.muslimcanadiancongress.org/index.html">Muslim Canadian Congress</a>] and <strong>Tarek Fatah</strong> [founder, <a href="http://www.muslimcanadiancongress.org/index.html">Muslim Canadian Congress</a>]: &quot;How long will it take the leadership of North America&#39;s traditional Muslim leadership to embrace the First amendment of the United Sates constitution and the doctrine of the separation of religion and state? Will the concept of freedom of expression survive ever-new challenges from the defenders of medieval traditions that bar any discussion or critique of religion? <br /><br />These are questions bubbling below the surface right now, but eventually are bound to erupt into the open. Moreover, when they do, chances of a rise in overt racist backlash against Muslims of all shades and opinions is a likely outcome. Certainly, the events of the past few months provide ample evidence for this trend, with two human rights complaints making newspaper headlines and leading to fierce debates about the limits of free speech and what might constitute hate literature. <br /><br />The first involved a human rights complaint against Ezra Levant, the editor of the defunct [Canadian magazine the] <em>Western Standard</em>, while the second, more recent one, was filed against <em>Macleans</em> magazine, by four Osgoode law students on behalf of the Canadian Islamic Congress. Needless to say, these complaints are justifiably interpreted as assaults on freedom of speech and conscience by Canadians both Muslim and non-Muslim, leading many to question the mandate of these commissions as well as the validity or otherwise of these human rights complaints.<br /><br />Historically, orthodoxy has demanded abject compliance to the closed belief systems it guards. Therefore, the freedom to question, challenge, and evaluate dogma remains an elusive ideal for those who practice it, often at great risk to their lives and persons. Though in the West, &quot;heresy&quot; came to be accepted as valid religious expression in the seventeen hundreds in keeping with the first amendment; Muslim societies continue to be dogged by obscurantism and a stubborn resistance to modernity. Many a time, such intransigence results in lawsuits, human rights complaints and conspiracy theories against individuals perceived as threats to the status quo.<br /><br />As an example, the United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) recently <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/un-rights-council-passes-resolution.php">approved a resolution</a> protecting religion from &quot;defamation&quot;. Once again, the drivers of this move were Islamist organizations who refuse to tolerate the slightest dissent over religious matters. What these tyrants and monarchs from the Arab world fail to realize or choose to pretend otherwise is the fact that critics of Islamist ideologies are not opposing Islam as a religion, but the use of Islam as a political ideology that hides behind religion for protection, while seeking political ascendancy.<br /><br />For Muslims who believe in challenging religious dogma, who actively pursue the goal of bringing about reform in Muslim societies and who advocate the separation of religion and state, this becomes a particularly threatening scenario as charges of blasphemy and apostasy often occasion calls for the execution of &quot;apostates&quot; and &quot;heretics&quot;. A Turkish man recently convicted of &quot;ridiculing god&quot; faces the death penalty in a Saudi prison while secular and moderate Muslims living in the West are frequently the targets of death threats or bullying tactics to silence them one way or another.<br /><br />The law in Canada and the United States must look into formulating legal measures that protect reformists within various faith traditions. In particular, given the serious consequences that secular and reformist Muslims face in their efforts to challenge orthodox positions, charges of apostasy and blasphemy leveled against them by fundamentalists should be criminalized as legal safeguards against such bullying and silencing tactics. The United States and Canada must look into introducing legislation that will protect such individuals from these accusations often laden with threats to their lives and security.<br /><br />As long as Islamists around the world use Islam as a political ideology in the footsteps of such jihadi ideologues as Hassan Al-Banna, Syed Qutb, Abul Ala Maudoodi and Ayatollah Khomeini, their Muslim, and non-Muslim opponents will have the right to challenge this ideology with full vigour. Hiding behind the skirts of religion to avoid being critiqued, these fascist cults demonstrate not just cowardice, but a cunningness that is fooling large segments of the liberal-left intelligentsia in the West, which will be among the first to suffer if and when Islamists use liberal democracy to extinguish its light.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.asil.org/aboutasil/leadershipbios.html#Kirgis"><strong>Rick Kirgis</strong></a> [Secretary, <a href="http://www.asil.org/index.html">American Society of International Law</a>]: &quot;If the state of Texas goes ahead with the planned execution of Jos&eacute; Ernesto Medell&iacute;n without allowing him any judicial reconsideration of his murder conviction and his death sentence (to determine whether he was prejudiced by the Texas authorities&#39; failure to notify him of his right to contact the Mexican consulate after he was arrested), the United States will breach its obligation under the United Nations Charter and the Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to comply with the decision of the ICJ against the United States in the <u>Avena</u> case. In that case the ICJ held that the failure to provide review and reconsideration for Medell&iacute;n and similarly-situated Mexican nationals convicted of murder in the United States was a violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (the Vienna Convention). Under the UN Charter and ICJ Statute, the ICJ decision is final and binding on the United States.<br /><br />The ICJ in the <u>Avena</u> case said that the availability of a clemency process (in this instance, potentially by the governor of Texas) would not qualify as an appropriate means of undertaking the review and reconsideration. According to the ICJ, a judicial process is required.<br /><br />It is immaterial for international law purposes that it is the state of Texas, rather than the federal government of the United States, that has failed to provide the required review and reconsideration. The ICJ made that clear in the <u>LaGrand</u> case, which also involved state courts&#39; failure to comply with the Vienna Convention. The International Law Commission&#39;s widely-accepted Articles on State Responsibility also make it clear that the conduct of a territorial unit of a federal State is considered an act of the federal State under international law. The fact that President Bush made an effort to get Texas and other states to comply with the ICJ judgment would be no excuse because the United States Supreme Court held not only that the judgment was not directly enforceable in American courts, but also that the President did not have the authority under federal law to determine that state courts must give effect to the judgment.<br /><br />The ICJ in the <u>Avena</u> case made the point that the U.S. obligation under the Vienna Convention exists irrespective of due process principles under U.S. constitutional law. Consequently, even if the execution of Medell&iacute;n is permissible under the U.S. Constitution without any further judicial review, there still would be a violation not only of the international law consular-assistance rules in the Vienna Convention, but also of the rules in the UN Charter and ICJ Statute relating to compliance with ICJ judgments.<br /><br />Subjecting Medell&iacute;n to the death penalty would not, of itself, be a failure to comply with the <u>Avena</u> decision. The ICJ did not address the international legality of the death penalty, as such, in the United States or elsewhere.&quot;<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">The views expressed are those of the author, not of <a href="http://www.asil.org/">ASIL</a></span><br />

		<title>Georgia lethal injection procedures still flawed despite post-Baze ruling</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Michael Siem</strong> [lawyer for Jack Alderman, <a href="http://www.cliffordchance.com/home/?LangID=UK&">Clifford Chance</a>]: &quot;In <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/federal-judge-rejects-challenge-to.php">applying the US Supreme Court&#39;s holding</a> in <u>Baze v. Rees</u> [last week], Judge Martin found the Georgia Lethal Injection Procedures constitutional despite the Procedures&#39; failure to provide the safeguards required by the plurality opinion. Accordingly, Mr. Alderman intends to appeal. <br /><br />Specifically, Georgia&#39;s Procedures are flawed even after <u>Baze</u> because they do not require the following safeguards: there are no assurances that the inmate is properly anesthetized prior to the injection of the two painful drugs: pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride; no confirmation of unconsciousness; no requirement that the team practices prior to an execution, and no specified minimum qualifications for those involved in the executions. Furthermore, Georgia uses one less gram of sodium pentothal and a longer tube than Kentucky. Despite the shortcomings, Judge Martin upheld the constitutionality of the Georgia Procedures based on the State&#39;s assurances that while these requirement are not present in the Procedures, in practice they perform some of these safeguards. Judge Martin, ruling on Defendants&#39; Motion for Summary Judgment, resolved the material facts regarding the evidence that the individuals involved in the executions are untrained, unqualified, do not check for unconsciousness, and cannot distinguish between unconsciousness and merely being asleep in Defendants favor. <br /><br />Further undermining the assurance that executions will be carried out in a constitutional manner is the 11th Circuit&#39;s decision in <u>McNair et al., v. Allen</u>, et al., __ F.3d___, 2008 U.S. App. Lexis 1919 (11th Circuit January 29, 2008). The 11th Circuit held that the statute of limitations on &Acirc;&sect; 1983 method of execution claims begin to run when an inmate completes his direct appeal. According to the 11th Circuit, a condemned inmate will have to file a method of execution challenge simultaneous with his habeas petition. This means that an inmate is forced to challenge the method of his potential execution before knowing whether his sentence of death will be upheld upon federal review. This decisions is even more disturbing when put in context. Mr. Alderman was precluded from bringing his claim prior to 2006 because the 11th Circuit barred &Acirc;&sect; 1983 method of execution claims until the Supreme Court&#39;s decision in <u>Hill v. McDonough</u>, 547 U.S. 573 (2006). Thus, the 11th Circuit has made is procedurally impossible for Mr. Alderman to challenge the method of execution in Georgia. <br /><br />There continue to be significant risks with the lethal injection procedures around the country. States are in the best position to determine whether the inmate is properly anesthetized by merely drawing samples (of the inmate&#39;s blood) within one hour after death, yet they refuse to take this step because they are concerned what the results might reveal. Furthermore, states prefer to rely on procedural bars instead of drafting procedures that ameliorate the substantial risks of pain and suffering.&quot;<br />

		<title>Australian legislation on same-sex couples helpful, but not enough</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://lgbtlawblog.blogspot.com"><strong>Stephen Page</strong></a> [partner, <a href="http://lawyerlist.com.au/5704-Harrington-Family-Lawyers.aspx">Harrington Family Lawyers</a>]: &quot;Australia, like the USA, has a two party system. On the left side of the fence is the Australian Labor Party and on the right the Liberal/National coalition. Australia is now at an historic point because for the first time in its history, with the election of Kevin Rudd as Prime Minister, there are Labor governments in every State and Territory and at the Federal level.<br /><br />Labor policy is to oppose same-sex marriage, but to remove other discrimination against same-sex couples, and to allow for State based relationship registers for same-sex and de facto couples along the Tasmanian model. So far this year both Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory have passed (or are about to pass) <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/australian-capital-region-passes-same.php">legislation for relationship registers</a>. Similarly, the Rudd Government has announced legislation to remove discrimination against same-sex couples in 100 pieces of Federal legislation (except for the Marriage Act, which remains one man and one woman).<br /><br />The Rudd Government, like the Howard Government before it, indicated that it would veto legislation from the ACT that would allow civil unions, because they &quot;mimic&quot; marriage, which it is argued can only be between a man and a woman. The argument between the two governments got down to the nature of the ceremony! Instead the ACT government has now allowed for its Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages to preside over &quot;non-legal&quot; ceremonies for de facto and same-sex couples, whatever that might mean. It&#39;s not what the ACT wants, but what it&#39;s stuck with.<br /><br />The words of the President of the Law Council of Australia Ross Ray QC are apt: &quot;Any step towards eliminating discrimination brings us closer to meeting our international human rights obligations, makes us a fairer, more just community and ought to be greeted with strong approval&quot;; but &quot;as long as the Government remains intent on preserving a special class of state-sanctioned relationship which is closed to same-sex couples, discrimination will persist.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Faisal Naseem Chaudhry</strong> [advocate, Lahore High Court; Lahore, Pakistan]: &quot;The Dubai deliberations are over. In a Friday press conference, Mian Nawaz Sharif (MNS) announced that a Resolution restoring Pakistan&#39;s ousted judges shall be tabled before the National Assembly on May 12; shall be passed by a simple majority of the House and the executive authority (Prime Minister) shall honour the resolution by passing an Executive Order reinstating the Nov 3 deposed judges. MNS also mentioned the establishment of a committee that will finalize the modalities of restoration including, but not limited to, the language of the Draft Resolution. <br /><br />Shortly after the above-noted press conference as of May 01, Pakistan People&#39;s Party leader Asif Ali Zardari (AAZ) clarified that yet a &#39;formula&#39; is required for the restoration and the &#39;committee&#39; shall decide the fate of the deposed judges.<br /><br />AAZ&#39;s Federal Law Minister Mr. Farooq Naik further clarified that the &#39;committee&#39; has been given an assignment which can only be accomplished with consensus. In case of divergent views, even the slightest, the matter shall again be forwarded to the leadership of both the main political parties, i.e. AAZ and MNS. Most importantly, Mr. Naik said &#39;yes&#39; to the possibility that restoration may not take place on 12 May if the committee fails in its deliberations and consensus.<br /><br />MNS categorically stated that the Resolution shall not be directly linked with any Constitutional Package; yet Mr. Naik rebutted the same, reiterating that both shall be tabled on the same day. He said &#39;the same day&#39;; he did not say &#39;on 12 May&#39;.<br /><br />MNS in his press conference accepted the continuity of PCO judges in the Supreme as well as all the 04 High Courts. On Saturday the Pakistan Bar Council in its afternoon Resolution restated that the lawyers&#39; fraternity shall not accept the PCO judges. It further stated that in case nothing happens on 12 May, a convention of Pakistan Bar shall be convened on 16 May.<br /><br />All this makes one wonder if in fact the deposed judges will be restored May 12. I fear not, for the following reasons:<br /><br />Notwithstanding whether Chief Justice Chaudhry&#39;s position is made tenure-based, both the political parties had divergent views vis-&agrave;-vis the modalities of restoration. The very first difference of opinion was that MNS preferred a Simple Majority Resolution whereas AAZ had been advocating a Constitutional Amendment through a Composite Constitutional Package. The difference between the two is obvious:<BLOCKQUOTE>a. A Simple Majority Resolution is not of a binding nature; rather, under the rules and procedures of the National Assembly, it is regarded as a request to the Executive which alone is competent to decide how to honour it i.e. either through an Executive Order or by an Act of Parliament. The Executive can also put the matter in limbo. Our constitutional history is replete with such examples of &#39;Simple Majority Resolutions&#39; which have never been acted upon.<br /><br />b. A constitutional Amendment passed by a two-thirds majority of both houses of parliament (the National Assembly &amp; the Senate) is not only of a binding nature, but it also amends the constitution. The parliament is the supreme legislative body and it can make any law whatsoever not in conflict with humanity, decency, federation of Pakistan (it can not make Pakistan a Confederation), and the independence of judiciary etc.<br /><br />c. MNS is of the view that if you bring a constitutional amendment for the restoration of the deposed judges, that would mean you accept not only the Nov 3 PCO but also subsequent extra-constitutional alterations in the Constitution incorporated by President Musharraf.<br /><br />d. But MNS does not realize that a Supreme Court headed by current PCO Chief Justice Abdul Hameed Dogar cannot issue an injunction preventing parliament from amending the constitution. The same court can, however, issue an injunction preventing the Executive Authority from honouring a Simple Majority Resolution. An Executive headed by a PPP&#39;s Prime Minster is not likely to disobey Justice Dogar. What will happen in this case? A few demonstrations, another few rallies, some tele-programmes. The clock will continue ticking.</BLOCKQUOTE>AAZ has played this situation smartly, cleverly, and rather cunningly. By having the dialogues at Dubai, he has successfully avoided public as well as lawyers&#39; pressure. If the dialogues had been conducted even in the remotest part of Pakistan, there would had been crowds standing out on the road and some lawyers too, holding black flags. AAZ may have some real &#39;family engagements&#39; in Dubai but equally surprising is the fact that he was back to Pakistan on May 02.<br /><br />AAZ has also undermined the PML(N) while inducing them to accept Federal Ministries on the sole condition that judiciary shall be restored to Nov 3 position. Once they accepted the portfolios literally half-heartedly, AAZ was saying on 29 April, &quot;Muree Declaration was a political statement&#39;.<br /><br />I have every good reason to wonder how AAZ will live with Chief Justice Chaudhry even till June 2010 once AAZ has openly spoken against him with BBC&#39;s correspondent. You may curtail his powers even by a constitutional amendment, yet a man occupying such a powerful seat can be dangerous for AAZ. This is Pakistan, where you will find conflicting judgements on every proposition of law and I will not be surprised if a petition challenging the curtailment of administrative powers is filed before Chief Justice Chaudhry. He will issue notice and may suspend the amendment. Again what will happen? The Executive will have to contest the petition even if the injunctive order was wrong and during the entire cushion period, Chief Justice Chaudhry will continue exercising his previously taken-away administrative powers. Will such a possibility be acceptable to AAZ?<br /><br />Our constitution is silent on the number of judges to be present in the Supreme Court. The 1997 Judges Act requires the Supreme Court not to exceed 17 judges, including the Chief Justice. On Nov 3, 13 were deposed. Justice Bhagwandas retired at the age of 65 leaving behind 12. The present Supreme Court is composed of 16 PCO judges including Justice Dogar. Adding another 12 will make it the largest Supreme Court in this world. But most importantly, even if an Executive Order is passed on the evening of 12 May, how can these 28 work together once the 1997 Judges Act does not allow more than 17 judges. Hence, technically speaking, before an Executive Order is passed, an amendment shall be required to modify the 1997 Judges Act. A bill shall be required by simple majority requiring assent of the President, to make the Bill an Act of Parliament thereby raising the upper limit to 28 judges. Can all this exercise take place on the afternoon of 12 May?<br /><br />Following the statement of Mr. Naik, the Federal Law Minster, that the Resolution and Constitutional Amendment shall be tabled on the same day, again all this exercise cannot for all practical reasons take place on the same day. If the instruments are not tabled the same day, I am 100% sure the judges shall not be restored. The reason why is simple. AAZ will not accept an all-powerful Chief Justice Chaudhry.<br /><br />One should not forget which type of working relationship there will be among the deposed and the PCO judges. One shall not be surprised if there are little altercations between the two groups reported in press.<br /><br />If PCO judges continue as even accepted by MNS, the lawyers&#39; community shall protest. The Pakistan Bar Council is not that concerned about the PCO judges who took oaths on the evening of Nov 3. Eyebrows are raised in respect of those subsequent appointments where the &#39;consultation&#39; for this purpose took place between Justice Dogar and President Musharraf. The lawyers regard Justice Dogar as an illegal de facto Chief Justice of Pakistan and hold the view that the mandatory &#39;consultation&#39; as required by the constitution was erroneous. Hence, all the subsequent appointments to the Supreme Court and the Provincial High Courts are void.<br /><br />President Musharraf&#39;s reaction cannot be ignored. Friday, two news items caught my attention. Firstly that he would not oppose the reinstatement; secondly that he is ready to live without Article 58(2)(b) of the Constitution (giving him draconian powers to dissolve the National Assembly and the Government). <br /><br />I believe the first was incorrect. If President Musharraf asks AAZ not to reinstate the deposed judges and in return AAZ make take away the above mentioned draconian powers ensuring 05 years uninterrupted rule to AAZ, what would be his reaction? AAZ would accept the proposal. For President Musharraf, the reinstatement of deposed judges is more than a nightmare. He was scared of and uncomfortable with one Iftikhar Chaudhry; now there are 60 of him. So, the Presidency will not keep silent on reinstatement particularly when Justice Dogar would also not like to remain indolent on 12 May and thereafter. For the last 6 months, he has been enjoying the trappings of a Chief Justice. If he has decided to live with those trappings, he can offer anything to AAZ. Two attractive proposals from two pillars of state. AAZ cannot ask for more.<br /><br />Six months have passed since Nov 3 and every passing day had been adding more complexities to this already so tricky situation. So much is up for discussion; a de facto Supreme Court, a de jure Supreme Court, a de facto Chief Justice, a de jure Chief Justice, an injunction against the Executive Order, the legality of an Executive Order, the non-binding nature of a Simple Majority Resolution, the total number of judges in the Supreme Court, the fate of Justice Dogar&#39;s judgment legalizing the Nov 3 PCO and so on and so forth.<br /><br />I sincerely hope my assessment proves wrong and that the deposed judges shall be restored on 12 May. The fate of Chief Justice Chaudhry is also unclear. It does not matter what MNS says. What matters are the words coming from the mouth of AAZ.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/about_us/staff/colson_d.htm"><strong>Deborah Colson</strong></a> [Senior Associate, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/index.asp">Human Rights First</a>]: &quot; &#39;America tells the whole world that it has freedom and justice. I do not see that...You do not give us the least bit of humanity&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;Give me a just court&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;Try me with a just law.&#39; <br /><br />Those were the words of <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/inthecourts/supreme_court_hamdan.htm">Salim Ahmed Hamdan</a> at his military commission proceeding in Guantanamo Bay this week. Mr. Hamdan interrupted a pretrial hearing during which the lawyers were mired in technical legal arguments to question why the government is trying him in a made-up system pursuant to made-up rules, and to observe that he always loses&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;even when he wins&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;because the government repeatedly changes the rules midstream.<br /><br />Mr. Hamdan, a 36-year old Yemeni citizen, was captured in Afghanistan in November 2001 and has been detained at Guantanamo for nearly six years. He is accused of working as Osama bin Laden&#39;s personal driver and armed bodyguard and transporting missiles for use against American soldiers. Mr. Hamdan&#39;s lawyers acknowledge that he worked as bin Laden&#39;s driver, but they say he was never a member of al Qaeda and never conspired to engage in any terrorist acts.<br /><br />On Tuesday, Mr. Hamdan became the <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/hamdan-plans-boycott-of-guantanamo.php">fourth Guantanamo prisoner to boycott</a> the <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/detainees/militarytribunals.htm">military commission</a> system. After a 20-minute exchange with the judge, Navy Capt. Keith Allred, Mr. Hamdan announced his refusal to participate in any future proceedings, and he forbade his attorneys from speaking on his behalf without him there. <br /><br />It is difficult to know why Mr. Hamdan finally gave up on the system this week after having cooperated with his attorneys and the court for so long. One of his lawyers suggested at a press conference that seven years of confinement and several rounds of wins and losses have left Mr. Hamdan feeling increasingly frustrated and depressed.<br /><br />And no wonder. Up to this point, victory has done Mr. Hamdan virtually no good. <br /><br />His challenge to the first military commission system established by President Bush made it all the way to the Supreme Court, where he won. In 2006, the <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/breaking-news-supreme-court-rules.php">Supreme Court held</a> that President Bush&#39;s system violated international and U.S. military law. Following the Supreme Court&#39;s holding, however, Congress established a new military commission system under the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (&quot;MCA&quot;), shortly after which Mr. Hamdan was re-charged. In December 2006, he was also transferred&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;with no explanation&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;from a medium security facility at Guantanamo to solitary confinement. For the past sixteen months, Mr. Hamdan has had practically no human contact and little access to natural light and air. So when Judge Allred told Mr. Hamdan on Tuesday that his victory before the Supreme Court should inspire &quot;great faith in America law,&quot; it was only fitting when Mr. Hamdan responded: &quot;I didn&#39;t win the case.&quot;<br /><br />Mr. Hamdan&#39;s critique was not the only indictment of the military commission system we heard this week. On Monday, Air Force Col. <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/guantanamo-ex-prosecutor-testifies-on.php">Morris Davis</a>, the former chief prosecutor at Guantanamo, testified on behalf of Mr. Hamdan. Col. Davis has spoken publicly about the flaws in the system many times since his resignation in October 2007, and most of what he said on the witness stand had already been reported in the press. <br /><br />But his testimony was remarkable nonetheless. Until several months before he resigned, Col. Davis was a staunch defender of the military commissions. In fact, in June 2007, he published an op-ed in the New York Times in which he stated that &quot;the Military Commissions Act provides a fair process to adjudicate the guilt or innocence of those alleged to have committed crimes.&quot; Col. Davis also has no qualms about the case against Mr. Hamdan. He testified on Monday that he believes the charges against Mr. Hamdan are &quot;warranted by the evidence.&quot;<br /><br />And yet this former chief prosecutor agreed to testify for the defense. He subjected himself to cross-examination by the new chief prosecutor; he endured questions about his prior conversations with two former employees who were sitting in the courtroom and continue to work on the Hamdan case; and he opened himself to public scrutiny and the judgment of the court. <br /><br />He did this because he believes the military commission system will never achieve just results. His concerns are twofold: Col. Davis criticizes the government&#39;s willingness to rely on coerced evidence, and he asserts that the system is being run by politically-motivated administration appointees who have repeatedly attempted to interfere with the professional judgment of the chief prosecutor and members of his staff. He spoke of the pressure he received to charge &quot;sexy cases&quot; and to file charges against the high-value prisoners before the next presidential election because, once he &quot;g[ot] the train rolling,&quot; &quot;it would be hard for the next president to stop the process.&quot;<br /><br />Col. Davis is not the only Guantanamo prosecutor to have resigned. In fact, four others &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; Major Robert Preston, Captain John Carr, Captain Carrie Wolf, and Lieutenant Colonel Stuart Couch &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; preceded him and made similar allegations of political interference and pressure to rely on coerced evidence. It is widely believed that additional prosecutors have also raised the prospect of resignation.<br /><br />Public confidence in Guantanamo is already at an all-time low. But it is bound to sink even lower if more defendants boycott, and the prosecutors who remain end up trying a series of empty chairs.&quot;<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Report from Guantanamo&quot; features regular contributions to JURIST Hotline from <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/">Human Rights First</a>.</span><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://frg.sin-online.nl/staff/index.html?lia=3215"><strong>Aleksandar Momirov</strong></a> [Lecturer, <a href="http://www.eur.nl/english/">Erasmus University of Rotterdam</a>]: &quot;If the recent acquittal of Ramush Haradinaj by the Trial Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) had all the characteristics of a judicial earthquake, then it is only fair to say that the subsequent Appeals Chamber&#39;s Judgment in the <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/icty-partially-overturns-war-crimes.php">case against Enver Hadzihasanovic and Amir Kubura</a>, rendered on 22 April 2008, had the impact of a significant aftershock. <br /><br />The case covers the activities of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina (commonly known as &#39;ABiH&#39; and considered by many to merely have been the military wing of the Bosnian Muslim political party, the SDA), defending the interests of the Sarajevo based Muslim government of Bosnia during 1993 and 1994. During the fighting against the other warring factions in the divided state, Had&Aring;&frac34;ihasanovi&Auml;&#8225; was Commander of the ABiH 3rd Corps, later becoming Chief of the Supreme Command Staff of ABiH. Kubura was Chief of Staff of the 7th Muslim Mountain Brigade of the ABiH 3rd Corps. In 2006 both men were convicted, based exclusively on Article 7 (3) of the ICTY Statute (superior criminal responsibility) for violations of laws or customs of war, having failed to prevent or punish the crimes committed under their command. Had&Aring;&frac34;ihasanovi&Auml;&#8225; was sentenced to five years of imprisonment. Kubura received a sentence of two and a half years and was granted early release less than one month after his conviction. Upholding the Trial Chamber&#39;s judgment in part, partially granting the appeal of the Defense and dismissing all points of appeal coming from the Prosecution, the Appeals Chamber reversed several points of conviction and reduced Had&Aring;&frac34;ihasanovi&Auml;&#8225;&#39;s sentence to 3 years and 6 months. Kubura saw his sentence drop to 2 years. <br /><br />At best, the Had&Aring;&frac34;ihasanovi&Auml;&#8225; and Kubura case deserves the epithet of &#39;striking&#39;; an epithet justified by substance, proceedings and final outcome alike. Some noteworthy tidbits are illustrative. <br /><br />The Had&Aring;&frac34;ihasanovi&Auml;&#8225; case is remarkable for it is the Tribunal&#39;s principal case where the presence and infamous conduct of the Mujahedin in Bosnia is considered in some depth. Often euphemistically referred to as &#39;foreign combatants&#39;, the Mujahedin were comprised of men from the Middle East, Northern Africa and local Muslim fighters and were notorious for their &#39;fighting tactics&#39; throughout central Bosnia. The Mujahedin had training camps all across territory held by the ABiH. Their combat related conduct, including practices such as ritual decapitation of hostage-taken Serbs and Croats, as well as their demeanor in general was widely deemed repugnant. While under-reported during the war and at times even dismissed as an imaginary product of the Serbian propaganda machinery, elements of the Mujahedin and controversies surrounding their naturalization have remained embedded in Bosnia up until today. (for a fascinating read see OTP expert witness in Deli&Auml;&#8225;, Evan F. Kohlmann: Al-Qaida&#39;s Jihad in Europe: The Afghan-Bosnian Network)<br /><br />Going beyond factual substance, the current case dealt with the question of whether the activities of the Mujahedin could be linked to the ABiH, and more specifically to the ABiH 3rd Corps which was under the command of Had&Aring;&frac34;ihasanovi&Auml;&#8225;. While the Trial Chamber had found that Had&Aring;&frac34;ihasanovi&Auml;&#8225; indeed had effective command and control over the El Mujahedin unit, the Appeals Chamber reversed this finding. Some of the Mujahedin were simultaneously members of the ABiH. Above all, the El Mujahedin detachment came de jure under the authority of Had&Aring;&frac34;ihasanovi&Auml;&#8225;. The Appeals Chamber, however, reaffirmed that de jure authority &#8212; in and of itself - does not axiomatically imply effective command and control: de jure or de facto authority are merely indicators helpful in determining whether a relationship including effective command and control exists. Thus, the Appeals Chamber concluded that while de jure or de facto authority justifies a prima facie assumption of effective command and control, the burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt that effective command and control exists remains with the Prosecution. Three distinct elements remain crucial in the establishment thereof:<br /><br />1. The power to give orders and have them executed. <br /><br />During trial, the Chamber relied heavily on numerous re-subordination orders concerning the El Mujahedin detachment in dealing with this initial criterion. Previously, re-subordination orders have been considered essential in other cases where the link needed to be established between separate units such as police units on the one side and military units on the other. However, the Appeals Chamber sets these orders aside as insufficient, arguing that some of these orders were not followed by the Mujahedin. Indeed, several incidental refusals were not considered a matter of internal disobedience but were taken as indicative of the independence of the Mujahedin. <br /><br />2. The conduct of joint military operations. <br /><br />Again the Appeals Chamber dismissed the way in which the Trial Chamber interpreted and applied this criterion. In essence, cooperation during military missions does not indicate effective control. Numerous joint missions were conducted and exhibits showed that the ABiH, in planning certain operations, counted on the engagement of the El Mujahedin detachment. In practice it seems that, however, the El Mujahedin unit often acted recklessly and beyond the requirements of the ABiH. Nevertheless, the Appeals Chamber applied a similar reasoning as regarding the first criterion and argued that such conduct illustrated the independence of the unit. Again, recalcitrant and excessive behavior, sometimes even resulting to outright hostility, was considered to indicate independence rather than turmoil within an otherwise cooperative, often mutually dependent and generally hierarchical constellation. <br /><br />3. The absence of any other authority. <br /><br />Finally, the Appeals Chamber made it clear that this third criterion was not to be seen as a tool through which, by way of elimination, effective command and control could be established. While the support of certain Sarajevo based state organs and high-ranking clergymen remained undisputed, the absence of real control by others was not sufficient to indicate effective command and control. <br /><br />Consequently, Had&Aring;&frac34;ihasanovi&Auml;&#8225; was acquitted of any responsibility for the conduct of the Mujahedin or the failure to prevent and punish their activities &#8212; - even though the facts indisputably demonstrate that the ABiH 3rd Corps, at a minimum, coordinated with and relied on the Mujahedin in carrying out operations. The test itself, as fine-tuned throughout the case, seems not objectionable. However, it remains worrying that the Appeals Chamber in fact engaged in second-guessing the Trial Chamber&#39;s discretionary assessment of adduced evidence, witness testimonies and in essence the facts, to the extent that it completely overturned the findings. Probably being aware of the heavy-handedness thereof and the arguable inconsistency regarding the application of the effective command and control criteria between the current and some previous judgments, the Appeals Chamber reiterated that the probative value of existing indicators will have to be assessed on a case-to-case basis; a part of the Appeals judgment which most likely will be endorsed by a majority of the former Yugoslav communities. Albeit, rather as a potential sign of bias than of judicial caution. <br /><br />Sticking to alleged bias, from a procedural point of view, the Appeals Chamber devoted considerable attention to the claims made by the Had&Aring;&frac34;ihasanovi&Auml;&#8225; Defense that the Trial Chamber at times showed unacceptable signs of animosity and outright offensive behavior toward defense witnesses. Despite unusual generosity towards the Defense coming from the Trial Chamber in terms of time allocation and approval of witnesses, the Had&Aring;&frac34;ihasanovi&Auml;&#8225; Defense argued that on several occasions the Trial Chamber failed to use its discretionary power in a neutral manner. The Defense gave examples of the bench questioning, virtually cross-examining, a defense witness for eight hours (though the Defense was informed in advance), and treating several others in an intimidating manner. The Appeals Chamber dismissed these allegations. Leaving aside the accuracy of the Defense allegations and the Appeals Chamber&#39;s findings, the current judgment clearly demonstrates an issue which remains intricate: the position of the bench in criminal proceedings before the ICTY. It reflects the uncertainty with which parties and witnesses are confronted in a legally hybrid system and institution, where the limits of the judges&#39; discretionary powers are determined mostly by their personal habits (considering that in an international legal institution, parties and judges to a large extent remain hostages of their original jurisdictions) instead of statutory standards. As long as the current scope of the judges&#39; discretionary powers is left undefined, the risk remains that despite assumed neutrality and benevolence, the conduct of judges throughout a specific case may at the end of the road be perceived as unfair and biased, consequently frustrating the process and ultimately compromising the legitimacy of the trial and its final outcome. This issue remains troublesome and continues to play a crucial role in ongoing proceedings before the ICTY. <br /><br />Concluding, both substantive and procedural elements determine the way in which this latest ICTY judgment will be assessed in the following period. The reversals of the Appeals Chamber were accompanied with the lowering of already confounding and inconsequential sentences. Bearing in mind cases such as Halilovi&Auml;&#8225;, Ori&Auml;&#8225;, Limaj et al. and Haradinaj et al., and in considering the final findings and sentences in light of the rank of both individuals as well as the factual underpinnings of the case, this de facto acquittal again leaves many with the question of how justice is done and whether it, when done in such a manner, furthers the individualization of guilt and strengthens reconciliation.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Tara Lee, a former Navy JAG now practising national security law, says that kicking contractors off the American battlefield in Iraq and Afghanistan is not the answer to alleged problems and abuses; security contractors aren't mercenaries and they can be held accountable for their actions....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/taralee.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>M</strong></font>ichael Walzer is wrong. That&#39;s not an easy sentence for me to type. I&#39;m a Naval Academy graduate and a former JAG. Most of what I know about the law of war was taught to me straight from the text of Walzer&#39;s <em>Just and Unjust Wars.</em> You can't study ethical warfighting without concluding that Michael Walzer knows his stuff. But, in a <a href="http://www.tnr.com/story.html?id=a498d530-e959-4f1e-8432-8851075ac657&p=1">recent piece</a> in <em>The New Republic</em>, Walzer lent his voice to the swelling chorus condemning the use of private security contractors in Iraq. Walzer is wrong, and so is everyone else who argues that private security contractors are mercenaries who can't be held accountable. <br /><br />This is not just an academic error. When our respected scholars (like Walzer) get it wrong, it leads our politicians towards unnecessary and potentially harmful legislation (like the pending bill to ban the use of private security contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan) and creates momentum for misguided political pledges ("If elected President I will cut 500,000 federal contractors"). So, before our candidates get too far down the wrong path, let's be clear: private security companies are not mercenaries and they can be held accountable. <br /><br />Walzer and others have been using "mercenary" as an interchangeable synonym for "private security firm." According to Webster's, "mercenaries" are professional soldiers hired for service in a foreign army. Not all private security firms are mercenaries, and none of the American companies currently working in Iraq and Afghanistan meet that definition. The private security firms working in Iraq and Afghanistan are not there to engage in offensive force. DoD regulations expressly prohibit contractor personnel from participating in direct combat activities. Multiple U.S. laws, such as the Federal Activities Inventory Reform (FAIR) Act of 1998 and 5 U.S.C. 3108 (the "Anti-Pinkerton Act"), already prohibit contracting out inherently governmental functions, especially combat roles. According to the Office of Management and Budget, "protection of property and persons is not an inherently governmental function." That basic protection is all that contracted security companies can and do provide in Iraq and Afghanistan. Calling these companies "mercenaries" is irresponsible invective that diminishes the important debate about battlefield roles and responsibilities.<br /><br />But Walzer and the other critics of private security companies are doing worse than just mislabeling for dramatic effect. They also brashly advance a flawed argument -- that the use of private security contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan is ethically unsound because those firms are insufficiently accountable to the state. They say that when the government contracts private security companies to do work in dangerous places, individuals aren&#39;t accountable and politicians aren&#39;t accountable. That's wrong on both counts. <br /><br />The first inaccuracy of the accountability argument is the sweeping assertion that our politicians are not accountable to the public when contractors are sent to Iraq and Afghanistan. In fact, both our executive and our legislature are directly accountable to voters for the choices they make in the conduct of and accounting for this war. Our politicians are as accountable for choices made in government contracting as they are for any other choices made in the process of governing. (Thus the race to gain votes with the vague and dangerous "I'll cut contractors" soundbite.)<br /><br />After political accountability, the contractors' critics decry an absence of criminal accountability. Walzer in particular, like others before him, points with umbrage and outrage to "Order 17." "Order 17" is the Transitional Administrative Law signed by Paul Bremer in 2004 giving contractors in Iraq immunity from prosecution in Iraqi courts. The cite to this particular order is made as though it is something uniquely troubling, a specific exception carved out to accommodate our government&#39;s increased reliance on contractors in Iraq. But Order 17 is not unique or unusual. Immunity from local prosecution for contractors accompanying the armed forces is a standard term of the Status of Forces Agreements that the United States has signed with countless other countries. There are military attorneys who spend entire careers keeping Americans deployed abroad out of foreign courts and foreign jails. Our preference for our own court systems isn&#39;t new and it doesn&#39;t strike me as particularly controversial. <br /><br />Criminal accountability for battlefield misconduct is complicated and elusive, no matter who the actor. Successful prosecutions are rare, and even then usually unsatisfying and underinclusive, whether the wrongdoers are soldiers at My Lai and Haditha or contractors in Baghdad's Nissor Square. U.S. laws already exist subjecting American citizens employed by contractors in Iraq to criminal prosecution under both the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act. If there's an accountability gap remaining, it derives from our limited reach over contractor-employed foreign citizens who commit crimes in foreign countries, and that's a narrow problem that could be remedied by Congressional extension of U.S. federal court jurisdiction. That potential jurisdictional limitation is not, however, a per se ethical bar to all battlefield use of contractors and it does not equate to the total absence of accountability that Walzer and others bemoan. <br /><br />Instead of narrowly identifying the jurisdictional gaps, acknowledging the efforts of our Congress to bridge those gaps, and recommending ways to effectuate existing accountability mechanisms and develop the necessary prosecutorial will, Walzer summarily declares that &quot;mercenaries in Iraq are radically unaccountable; their fire is free.&quot; That&#39;s lovely writing, but it's just an inaccurate assessment of the current contractor accountability matrix. It's also shamefully shallow criticism in an area where deep thinking and real solutions are required. <br /><br />The last erroneous and oft-stated criticism of private security contractors relies on the suggestion that contractors are not as well-trained for their roles on the battlefield as soldiers. Walzer, for example, argues that using soldiers for all security-related missions in Iraq would be better because &quot;soldiers are trained to fight in accordance with a code of conduct.&quot; Well, DoD regulations also require law of war training for every contractor in Iraq. Under those regulations, every contractor gets the same training we give our soldiers. Arguably, private security companies have even more motivation to give effective training than the military does, because they are subject to civil lawsuits when they violate the law of war, while the military is not. In addition to training their employees in the laws of war and the proper use of force because it&#39;s the right thing to do and because the government tells them to do it, contractors also have to do it, and do it well, as a matter of litigation risk management and corporate governance. <br /><br />There are ample reasons why using contractors in certain roles makes sense, not least of which is the fact that we plainly don't have a large enough military to support every aspect of all the missions we have undertaken. We c
an't argue against the use of contractors (or announce that we'll just cut half a million of them) without either proposing alternate solutions or accepting mission degradations. <br /><br />We should use this election cycle to clamor for real solutions from our scholars and leaders, rather than settling for their blithe condemnation of the use of contractors. The current threats to our national security and to global stability are going to continue to require solutions that leverage our full range of resources -- military and civilian. We need an ethical warfighting plan that properly marshals and controls all those resources, one that acknowledges a third type of battlefield actor that is neither an unarmed civilian nor a soldier. <br /><br />The binary soldier-or-civilian rubrics we have used to measure ethical warfighting in the past -- from Walzer&#39;s <em>Just and Unjust Wars</em> to the Geneva Conventions -- all pre-date the emergence of a powerful non-state actor with the declared intent and evident capacity to do colossal harm to American civilians. Lawyerly adherence to those outdated rubrics and a scholarly unwillingness to think beyond the old paradigm is failing us. It has led us, for example, to the non-sensical and amoral legal conclusion that none of our current enemies qualify as enemy combatants. Clearly, we need our scholars (like Walzer) to develop new ethical paradigms that better address the nature of current conflicts. We also need our prospective leaders to offer more than undeveloped reactionary soundbites. <br /><br />Public responsibility for the conduct of war can include the ethical and accountable management of contractors. It&#39;s not time to kick the contractors off the battlefield, it&#39;s just time to recognize and address the implications of all types of actors on the battlefield: soldiers, civilians, insurgents, and contractors.<br /><br /><br /><em>Tara Lee is a former Navy JAG and former Resident Fellow at the Center for the Study of Professional Military Ethics at the United States Naval Academy.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/main.asp?PID=34">Jordan Paust</a> of the University of Houston Law Center says that recently disclosed US Department of Justice letters to US Senate Intelligence Committee member Ron Wyden (D-OR) on detainee interrogations reflect a misleading and erroneous understanding of the Geneva Conventions in the Bush Administration...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/paustbig.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>wo recently disclosed letters from Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski to U.S. Senator Ron Wyden on September 27, 2007 and March 6, 2008 reveal that misleading and erroneous analyses of rights and prohibitions reflected in the Geneva Conventions still exist as part of the Bush Administration's unlawful program of mistreatment of persons detained from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. <br /><br />Regarding the first letter, one finds a misleading statement that Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions (which, among other things, requires humane treatment of any detainee in all circumstances) "provides content" regarding the meaning of the word humane "by enumerating the specific prohibitions that would contravene that standard.... In particular, ... four specific and serious acts." Actually, the four acts mentioned are merely illustrative of some of the forms of unlawful treatment. They do not comprise an exclusive list of prohibitions. As the authoritative commentary of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) states: "What Article 3 guarantees such persons is humane treatment.... The definition [of humane] is not ... precise.... On the other hand, there is less difficulty in enumerating things which are incompatible with humane treatment. That is the method followed in the Convention when it proclaims four absolute prohibitions... [and uses the phrase "To this end"]." With respect to "grave breaches" of Geneva law, the commentary notes that an "inhuman treatment" is "one which ceased to be humane" and Article 147 of the Geneva Civilian Convention lists "inhuman treatment" as a grave breach separate from "wilfully causing great suffering" (which the commentary relates to torture) and "serious injury to body or health." The ICRC commentary adds: "It seems useless and even dangerous to attempt to make a list of all the factors which make treatment 'humane'.... The requirement of human treatment and the prohibition of certain acts incompatible with it are general and absolute." Dangerous indeed if someone erroneously advises that the four specific sets of acts provide exclusive normative content.<br /><br />The first letter also states that international tribunals "have had difficulty identifying content ... that is distinct from the four specified prohibitions." If meant to apply with respect to all international tribunals, the statement would not be correct. As documented in part in my book, Beyond the Law: The Bush Administration's Unlawful Responses in the "War" on Terror, there are several useful clarifications and examples of what constitutes cruel, inhumane, degrading, or humiliating treatment &#8212; each of which is separately proscribed under treaty-based and customary Geneva law, as well as under other relevant international law. As the book notes, there is even useful guidance from U.S. cases applying international law and cases applying a U.S. constitutional standard with respect to "cruel" treatment. Water-boarding, the cold cell, stripping detainees naked and use of snarling dogs for interrogation, threatening to kill a detainee or family members, and fear-up harsh are examples of outlawed tactics.<br /><br />The first letter quotes a manifestly erroneous standard set forth by the Administration in 2007 in Executive Order 13440 &Acirc;&#167; 3(h)(i)(E) that seems to fuse several types of inhumane treatment together in a way that would produce too high a threshold with respect to criminality, listing the need for "'wilful and outrageous acts of personal abuse' that are 'done for the purpose of humiliating or degrading the individual' and that are 'so serious that any reasonable person, considering all the circumstances, would deem the acts to be beyond the bounds of human decency.'" The letter adds that this "requires ... an intent to humiliate or degrade." First, not all (and hardly any) inhumane acts need to be "outrageous." Second, international criminal law does not require that relevant illegal conduct be engaged in "for the purpose" of creating, for example, an outcome of humiliation or degradation as such. As others have recognized, such an approach confuses awareness of the factual quality of one's conduct with awareness of its legal nature and, more generally of course, ignorance of the law is no excuse. A direct perpetrator need only intend to engage in relevant conduct that objectively constitutes "cruel," "inhumane," "degrading," or "humiliating" treatment. For example, it would not be a defense that the alleged perpetrator did not intend or have a "purpose" to produce an outcome of "cruelty" as such. The elements of the war crime of "torture" articulated for the International Criminal Court provide that the perpetrator of "torture" need only inflict "severe physical or mental pain or suffering" and need not intend that his or her conduct will constitute "torture" as such. The trier of fact would conclude whether the conduct intentionally engaged in by the alleged perpetrator was objectively "severe" and produced physical or mental pain or suffering. Similarly, with respect to cruelty, one need not intend to be cruel. Merely an intent to engage in conduct that we judge to be cruel will suffice. Further, the word "severe" is a criterion that generally distinguishes torture from mere inhumane treatment. As noted by the ICTY and ICTR, all forms of treatment prohibited under Common Article 3 are "serious," since they are war crimes. As noted in Mehinovic v. Vuckovic, "cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment includes acts which inflict mental or physical suffering, anguish, humiliation, fear and debasement, which do not rise to the level of 'torture.'"<br /><br />The second letter reiterates manifest error when stating that "the fact that an act is undertaken to prevent a threatened terrorist attack, rather than for the purpose of humiliation and abuse, would be relevant." The letter quotes language from one ICTY case addressing "'physical or mental effects'" as part of a circumstantial inquiry, but the letter misses the point that it is not a defense that the accused did not have a "purpose of humiliation and abuse." The trier of fact will judge whether the conduct engaged in produced the outcome of humiliation or abuse or, to use language from the case, whether the conduct of the accused had the relevant "physical or mental effects." Additionally, it is not a defense that the perpetrator had a purpose "to prevent a threatened terrorist attack." As documented in my book, the purpose of torture or cruel, inhumane, degrading, or humiliating treatment is irrelevant because each is proscribed absolutely and "in all circumstances" under several forms of customary and treaty-based international law.<br /><br />The first letter is also patently in error when it states that Common Article 3 "does not directly prohibit" cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment. It most assuredly does and it does so "in all circumstances." As the Supreme Court recognized in Hamdan, and as documented in my book, Common Article 3 applies with respect to all detainees in all armed conflicts and provides a minimum set of customary and treaty-based rights and prohibitions. No one is outside the law and the law of war prohibits torture, cruel treatment, inhumane treatment, degrading treatment, and humiliating treatment. <br /><br />Under international law, it is entirely irrelevant whet
her or not any particular U.S. constitutional amendment (1) applies abroad to protect an alien detainee, and (2) whether it applies only to punishment as opposed to treatment. There are no relevant U.S. reservations to the absolute rights and prohibitions contained in the Geneva Conventions and, as universally applicable customary international law, what is reflected in Geneva law would not be subject to attempted reservations in any event. As documented in my book, a putative reservation to the Convention Against Torture attempting to limit coverage merely to what is prohibited under the U.S. Constitution is void ab initio as a matter of law because, as the CAT Committee and others have recognized, it is inconsistent with the object and purpose of the treaty. Each treaty prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment of any detainee within the jurisdiction or under effective control of U.S. personnel anywhere in the world regardless of purpose and regardless of any claimed exception on the basis of alleged necessity. Customary law reflected in each treaty is also universally applicable without restriction and implicates universal jurisdiction and responsibility. Moreover, as documented in my book, both forms of international law are supreme law of the United States binding on all members of the executive branch as well as any other citizen of the United States.<br /><br />John Yoo had disclosed in 2006 that there was a "common, unifying approach" or plan developed by an "inner circle" of the Bush Administration to ignore the strictures of Geneva law and to engage in what is unlawful "coercive interrogation." As my book demonstrates, various memos and letters substantially facilitated the effectuation of the common, unifying plan to use coercive interrogation. In early April, 2008, ABC News disclosed that an inner "inner circle" composed of the National Security Council's Principals Committee conducted meetings to approve various specific coercive interrogation tactics, including water boarding, and that meetings were attended by Cheney, Rice, Rumsfeld, Tenet, Ashcroft, and others. President Bush was quoted as stating "yes, I'm aware our national security team met on this issue. And I approved." As noted in my book, President Bush also admitted in September 2006 that he had authorized a program of secret detention (which constitutes the unlawful forced disappearance of persons) and "tough" treatment, and he stated that his program will continue. There have also been other presidential authorizations, directives, and findings that authorized and facilitated effectuation of the common, unifying plan. It is in this context that the manifest errors in the Benczkowski letters are doubly disturbing.<br /><br />Quite clearly, it is time for a change. It is time to end the "dirty war" tactics that have degraded this country, its values, and its influence. It is time to end impunity, to rid our government of "the suits" who place our military and CIA personnel in harms way, and to recreate a Justice Department that will actually support the rule of law.<br /><br /><br /><em>Jordan J.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist Abigail Salisbury says that the recent war crimes acquittal of former Kosovo prime minister and Kosovo Liberation Army leader Ramush Haradinaj before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia - a ruling now under prosecution appeal - may compound existing tensions in the Balkans and provide a platform for his return to international affairs...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/abigailsalisbury.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>lthough largely unknown outside the Balkans, Ramush Haradinaj is a figure of great importance in Kosovo. Last month, when this ethnic Albanian was acquitted of war crimes charges following lengthy legal proceedings at The Hague, the usually-worldly BBC but made small mention of the event, in passing. Their television anchors clearly had no idea who the man was, stumbling over the unfamiliar syllables of his name. In tribute to Haradinaj&#39;s leadership of Kosovo Liberation Army soldiers during the 1990s, people have displayed his likeness on buildings and billboards all over the region. Admired for his driven nature and his military accomplishments, he is seen as a sort of contemporary folk hero and his story has even been recounted in book form. He enjoyed support not only from Kosovars, but also from a number of high-level officials abroad. After the conflict, he used his wartime achievements to leverage a political career, eventually becoming Prime Minister of Kosovo. His term was cut short, however, when he stepped down following his indictment for war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. This gesture garnered still more support for the leader, who then chose to support the ICTY legal process rather than challenge its authority or go into hiding as so many others had done. <br /><br />Given his extraordinary achievements and popular support, it seems odd that when compared to the trials of Serbian criminals, Haradinaj's legal troubles were practically invisible to the general outside world. The landmark <em>Tadi&Auml;</em> case, for example, involved the conviction of a relatively small-time Bosnian-Serb but is now required reading for most students of international law. Haradinaj's acquittal was not the result of any earth-shattering new legal reasoning, but it does raise a variety of concerns over the utility and politics of the ICTY and the future of war crimes tribunals in general. JURIST recently spoke to Michael O'Reilly, coordinator of Haradinaj's London-based defense team, about some of the many issues surrounding the Haradinaj case.<br /><br />Although Haradinaj's admirers likely feel that their hero has been vindicated, others question what message his now-erstwhile acquittal has sent. The unpopular former Chief Prosecutor Carla Del Ponte's claims of witness intimidation at trial were constantly at issue, and unfortunate accidents involving planned witnesses did give the appearance of foul play. Persuasive evidence of such intimidation failed to materialize, however. <br /><br />Why was obtaining testimony so troublesome? O'Reilly told JURIST that those who had provided statements originally did so believing that they were cooperating with investigations of Serbs' alleged criminal activities in Kosovo and had no idea that anyone would try to use their words against Haradinaj. He also attributed some of the difficulty to public opinion of the ICTY: "Properly established courts, operating under international treaties, are more likely to be successful in getting full witness trust and cooperation. The ICC is of course the example to watch." But one musn&#39;t overlook the fact that the availability of reliable testimony also diminished naturally because events are forgotten and witnesses die as the years pass.<br /><br />Even those who believe the ICTY represents the rule of law often question its functionality. Indeed, one of the main reasons Haradinaj's trial should have attracted more attention is the mere fact that it happened at all. Del Ponte has said that these proceedings comprised an essential part of the post-conflict process and helped to quell lasting animosities by providing closure and encouraging stability. Recent events in Kosovo and Serbia do not indicate that the prosecutions have had the effect she desired, however. Reflecting on Del Ponte's beliefs, O'Reilly told JURIST, "In general I am doubtful. The process is too long, too inept and too politically compromised&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;.It simply keeps old wounds open. The South African Truth and Reconciliation commission model seems to offer more hope." <br /><br />The majority of those sought for prosecution by the Hague-based tribunal have fled, with protectionist governments doing little to aid in their capture. The mid-war creation of the ICTY is said to have actually caused a lull in fighting, but hostilities resumed once the court's impotence became known. Nevertheless, Haradinaj promptly traveled to The Hague following his indictment because "he is much more politically sophisticated that most of the other indictees," according to O'Reilly, who added that for his client "non-cooperation&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;was never even considered." Despite the former Prime Minister's confidence, the ICTY has disappointed many with its slow progress, made even more frustrating because the court is required to complete all of its activities by 2010. At the current rate, it looks as if there will be much left unfinished. One wonders what the Balkans will look like in the post-ICTY years, and whether infamous outlaws such as Karadzi&Auml; and Mladi&Auml; will feel safe enough to reappear. <br /><br />The tribunal's proceedings have been seen not just as as inefficient, but prejudiced as well. Many Serbs have viewed it as a political tool being unfairly used against them, evidenced by the few Albanians prosecuted relative to the larger number of Serbs charged with criminal conduct. When questioned about the problem, O'Reilly noted, "The trials at The Hague continue to fuel nationalist and anti-western political sentiment." Some critics of the ICTY's conduct believe that Albanians such as Haradinaj were indicted without any real proof of wrongdoing, just to provide the impression of equality that the court wanted desperately to project. These "hopelessly inadequate indictments," O'Reilly finds, "have only served to increase Serbian fury and resentment." Those who watched footage of rioters setting fire to the U.S. embassy in Belgrade earlier this year might agree with his assessment that "The unfortunate coincidence of the Haradinaj acquittal coming at the same time as Kosovo's independence has aggravated matters." It is difficult to see how Carla Del Ponte's vision of the ICTY healing the Balkans can manifest itself when the court's actions are perceived to be illegitimate.<br /><br />Strangely enough for a former KLA leader, some people look to Haradinaj as a force potentially capable of bringing some unity to the region. He actually enjoys a fair amount of approval among Serbs as well as Albanians, and has built relationships with influential UN dignitaries and foreign politicians, some of whom have publicly supported him in his defense effort. O'Reilly pointed out that Haradinaj is not yet forty years of age and holds university degrees in both law and business. The fact that his entire &acirc;&#8218;&not;9 million defense costs were financed by private donors in Kosovo gives some idea of the sort of backing this man has. With his battle at The Hague behind him, Haradinaj has returned his focus to politics and is now an opposition leader. Thus, although most Westerners have not yet heard of Ramush Haradinaj, much is expected of him. Barring a successful prosecution appeal leading to retrial and conviction, it seems inevitable that he will rise in prominence. We should kee
p an eye on him.<br /><br /><br /><em>Abigail Salisbury is a 2007 graduate of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law. She worked in Kosovo in the summer of 2006.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php">Ali Khan</a> of Washburn University School of Law says that Pakistan&#39;s &quot;establishment&quot; of generals, intelligence chiefs, and top bureaucrats may yet preserve its longtime hold on power by effectively playing off restored Supreme Court judges against its own retained appointees...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/alikhan.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>P</strong></font>akistan&#39;s constitutional shenanigans permit the fox to eat the lion. <br /><br />Invoking the non-existent powers of the Army Chief last November under a declaration of emergency rule, Pervez Musharraf dismissed sixty high court judges and implanted the dismissal order in the Constitution as an amendment. The order/amendment reads: "A Judge including the Chief Justice, of the Supreme Court, a High Court or Federal Shariat Court who had, not been given or taken oath under the Oath of Office (Judges) Order, 2007, had ceased to hold office on and with effect from the 3rd day of November, 2007." That a single person can amend the Constitution is egregious. Even more egregious is the demand that the democratically elected Parliament, if it wishes to restore the sacked judges, must repeal the order/amendment with the constitutionally required "votes of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of (each) House." <br /><br />Furthermore, the President is armed with the disreputable 58 (2) (b) constitutional power - a provision that General Zial ul Haq inserted in the Constitution - to dissolve the National Assembly if in his opinion a situation has arisen in which the Government of the Federation cannot be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and an appeal to the electorate is necessary. Even though Musharraf, who occupies the Presidency through constitutional manipulations, is unlikely to dissolve the newly elected National Assembly in the near future, the new Coalition government which has taken office is frightened by what it calls "the Establishment." <br /><br /><strong>The Establishment</strong><br /><br />The Establishment is a quasi-pejorative label to describe the combined forces of Pakistan Army generals, intelligence chiefs, and top bureaucrats. In reality, the Establishment is a group of powerful government officials who pool their resources to checkmate policies and persons that cross their path or wish to weaken their grip on power. Founded on vertical hierarchy, the Establishment effectively demands that human resources in the armed forces, intelligence agencies, and bureaucracy take an oath &quot;to discharge their duties, and perform their functions, to the best of their ability, faithfully and always in the interest of the sovereignty, integrity, solidarity, well-being and prosperity of the Establishment.&quot;<br /><br />The Establishment has no use for an independent judiciary. For decades, the judiciary itself mangled the Constitution to favor and support the Establishment. In a dramatic shift, however, a defiant judiciary under the maverick leadership of Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry began to confront the Establishment. The Supreme Court exercised <em>suo motu</em> jurisdiction to dismantle questionable state policies. The Court summoned the heads of agencies to demand explanation for state-sponsored disappearances. The Court nullified the privatization of steel mills, frustrating the Establishment that was hoping to please friends and make money. All this and more infuriated the Establishment. According to the unwritten rules of the Establishment, the invocation of human rights is blasphemy, the incantation of constitutional supremacy is treason, and the slogan of Sovereign Parliament is rebellion.<br /><br /><strong>The Parliament</strong><br /><br />Even the concept of Sovereign Parliament is a constitutional shenanigan. Politicians and the media take pride in talking about the sovereignty of the Parliament. It is ironic, however, that Pakistan&#39;s Constitution in its preamble establishes the sovereignty of God, and not of the Parliament. Under the Constitution, the Parliament exercises authority as a "sacred trust" within the limits prescribed by God. The Establishment sincerely believes that it alone has the keys to the sacred trust. Ignoring the preamble and defying the Establishment, politicians and the media harp the mantra of Sovereign Parliament. <br /><br />The idea of Sovereign Parliament, which Pakistani barristers unwittingly borrowed from the United Kingdom, makes no sense even under secular law. In the age of rights and separation of powers, no state institution ought to be sovereign. Each institution must be checked and restrained from committing excesses. Does a sovereign Parliament have the lawful authority to commission genocide or torture?<br /><br />Following dictates of the Establishment, Musharraf ignored the Parliament, even though his own party (the &quot;King's Party&quot;, as it were) enjoyed a solid majority in both Houses. To further discount the Parliament, Musharraf imported a naturalized American citizen to be the Prime Minister, rebuffing the native leaders of the King&#39;s Party. Despite suffering incessant indignities, the Parliament wasted no time in "re-electing" Army Chief Musharraf for a second Presidential term of five years starting in 2007.<br /><br />The nation hoped that the Parliament would indeed become the center of power after the February 2008 democratic elections. The King's Party was thoroughly defeated. The opposition parties of the two former prime ministers, whom the Establishment had forcibly removed from power in the previous decades, won in a big way and formed a Coalition government--a political union that pleased the nation. But contrary to all bets, the Parliament has come to be as irrelevant as it has been under the King&#39;s Party. <br /><br />The Coalition chiefs, Asif Ali Zardari and Mian Nawaz Sharif, are not themselves members of the Parliament. Yet they - and not the Parliament - hold the ultimate power to make decisions. In matters relating to the restoration of judges, the National Assembly has been kept out of negotiations. Instead of debating the judges&#39; issues openly on the floor of the National Assembly, the Coalition chiefs debated the issues in secret in a hotel in a foreign country. Even Pakistan&#39;s Prime Minister, presumably the strongest person under the Constitution, was left out of the deliberations. Just as the Prime Minster under the Musharraf regime was no more than a deferential pawn, so is the new Prime Minister under the Coalition government.<br /><br /><strong>The Supreme Court</strong><br /><br />Given that the decision-making power belongs neither to the Prime Minister and not to the Parliament, the question arises whether the sacked judges will be restored as promised. The answer, as usual, lies with the Chief and not with the tribe. Chief Zardari is determined to safeguard the Establishment judges who upheld the National Reconciliation Ordinance that manumitted Zardari from all criminal action. Even the other Coalition chief, who has been a fierce advocate for the independence of judiciary, has quietly agreed to let the Establishment judges stay on the Supreme Court.<br /><br />As is customary, all roads lead toward the Establishment. If the sacked judges are not restored, the Supreme Court belongs exclusively to the Establishment. If, perchance, the sacked judges are reinstated, they will have to share the Court with the Establishment judges. A crowded but weakened Supreme Court, fighting with itself, is a godsend for the Establishment.<br /><br /><br /><em>Ali Khan is professor of law at Washburn University School of Law in Topeka, Kansas, and the author of the book, <em>A Theory of Universal Democracy</em> (2003).

They are all <em>jus cogens</em>. That's Latin for &quot;higher law&quot; or &quot;compelling law.&quot; This means that no country can ever pass a law that allows torture. There can be no immunity from criminal liability for violation of a jus cogens prohibition.<br /><br />The United States has always prohibited torture in our Constitution, laws, executive statements, judicial decisions, and treaties. When the U.S. ratifies a treaty, it becomes part of American law under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution. <br /><br />The Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, says, &quot;No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification for torture.&quot;<br /><br />Whether someone is a POW or not, he must always be treated humanely; there are no gaps in the Geneva Conventions. <br /><br />The US War Crimes Act, and 18 USC sections 818 and 3231, punish torture, willfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health, and inhuman, humiliating or degrading treatment.<br /><br />The Torture Statute criminalizes the commission, attempt, or conspiracy to commit torture outside the United States. <br /><br />The Constitution gives Congress the power to make laws and the President the duty to enforce them. Yet Bush, relying on memos by lawyers including John Yoo, announced the Geneva Conventions did not apply to alleged Taliban and Al Qaeda members. But torture and inhumane treatment are never allowed under our laws.<br /><br />Justice Department lawyers wrote memos at the request of Bush officials to insulate them from prosecution for torture. In memos dated August 1, 2002 and March 14, 2003, John Yoo wrote the DOJ would not enforce U.S. laws against torture, assault, maiming and stalking, in the detention and interrogation of enemy combatants.<br /><br />The maiming statute makes it a crime for someone &quot;with the intent to torture, maim, or disfigure&quot; to &quot;cut, bite, or slit the nose, ear or lip, or cut out or disable the tongue, or put out or destroy an eye, or cut off or disable a limb, or any member of another person" or throw or pour upon another person any scalding water, corrosive acid, or caustic substance.<br /><br />Yoo said, &quot;just because the statute says -- that doesn&#39;t mean you have to do it.&quot; In a debate with Notre Dame Professor Doug Cassell, Yoo said there is no treaty that prohibits the President from torturing someone by crushing the testicles of the person&#39;s child. It depends on the President&#39;s motive, Yoo said, notwithstanding the absolute prohibition on torture. <br /><br />Yoo twisted the law and redefined torture much more narrowly than the Torture Convention and the Torture Statute. Under Yoo&#39;s definition, you have to nearly kill the person to constitute torture.<br /><br />Yoo wrote that self-defense or necessity could be defenses to war crimes prosecutions, notwithstanding the Torture Convention&#39;s absolute prohibition against torture in all circumstances. <br /><br />After the August 1, 2002 memo was made public, the DOJ knew it was indefensible. It was withdrawn as of June 1, 2004, and a new opinion, dated December 30, 2004, specifically rejected Yoo's definition of torture, and admitted that a defendant's motives to protect national security won't shield him from prosecution. The rescission of the prior memo is an admission by the DOJ that the legal reasoning was wrong. But for the 22 months it was in effect, it sanctioned and caused the torture of myriad prisoners.<br /><br />Yoo and other DOJ lawyers were part of a common plan to violate U.S. and international laws outlawing torture. It was reasonably foreseeable their advice would result in great physical or mental harm or death to many detainees. Indeed, more than 100 have died, many from torture. Yoo admitted recently he knew interrogators would take action based on what he advised. <br /><br />Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, Donald Rumsfeld, Colin Powell, George Tenet, and John Ashcroft met in the White House and micromanaged the torture by approving specific torture techniques such as waterboarding. Bush admitted he knew and approved of their actions.<br /><br />They are all liable under the War Crimes Act and the Torture Statute. Under the doctrine of command responsibility, commanders, all the way up the chain of command to the commander in chief, are liable for war crimes if they knew or should have known their subordinates would commit them, and they did nothing to stop or prevent it. The Bush officials ordered the torture after seeking legal cover from their lawyers. <br /><br />The President can no more order the commission of torture than he can order the commission of genocide, or establish a system of slavery, or wage a war of aggression. <br /><br />A Select Committee of Congress should launch an immediate and thorough investigation of the circumstances under which torture was authorized and rationalized. The high officials of our government, and the lawyers who advised them, should be investigated and prosecuted by a Special Prosecutor, independent of the Justice Department, for their roles in misusing the rule of law and legal analysis to justify torture and other crimes in flagrant violation of our laws.<br /><br /><br /><em>Marjorie Cohn is a professor at Thomas Jefferson School of Law and president of the National Lawyers Guild.

Canada is no exception.<br /><br />Few presidential contests have been followed north of the border with such detailed interest. And it&#39;s no wonder. Mr. Obama&#39;s &quot;Yes We Can&quot; campaign has captured the hearts and minds of young and old, black and white, rich and poor. Virtually everyone can find something to focus on for the upcoming American election.<br /><br />The Muslim community has also found something to focus on, but unfortunately, it has been rather unpleasant - the tactic of associating Mr. Obama with Muslims in efforts to derail the &quot;Obamamania&quot; phenomenon, notwithstanding his sincere devotion to his Christian faith.<br /><br />Examples of this negative-association tactic have included photographs of a younger Obama in the white turban and robes of a Somalian elder during a visit to Kenya and talk show host Bill Cunningham&#39;s pointed emphasis on Mr. Obama&#39;s middle name, Hussein. Now in the heat of an election, Obama has been introduced as "Osama" a not so subtle reference to Osama bin Laden. The message is clear: perceived ties to Muslims are a clear liability when fighting for the hearts and minds of the Western world.<br /><br />The fact of racism against Muslims can no longer be denied. In a 2004 Heritage Canada survey, 80% of Canadians agreed that Muslims and Arabs are the main targets of discrimination in Canada today.<br /><br />The media cannot shy away from its contributory role in the discrimination of Muslims any longer. As the Ontario Human Rights Commission said in a historic public statement issued last week: &quot;the media has a significant role to play in either combating societal racism or refraining from communicating and reproducing it.&quot;<br /><br />The statement was the result of human rights complaints filed by my clients - the Canadian Islamic Congress and a group of Osgoode Hall law students - against <em>Maclean&#39;s</em> magazine for its refusal to publish a mutually acceptable response to just one of more than twenty Islamophobic articles published between January 2005 and July 2007. Among others, these articles allege that &quot;enough&quot; Muslims share the basic objectives of terrorists; refer to Muslims as &quot;sheep-shaggers&quot;; and allege an impending, &quot;bloody&quot; Muslim takeover of the West.<br /><br />In response to the complaints, the Commission exercised its mandate to speak out against actions it saw as &quot;inconsistent with the spirit of the [Ontario Human Rights] Code.&quot; In doing so, the Commission strongly condemned &quot;the targeting of Muslims, Arabs, [and] South Asians ... by the media as being inconsistent with the values enshrined in the Code.&quot;<br /><br />In particular, the Commission expressed &quot;serious concerns about the content of a number of articles concerning Muslims that have been published by <em>Maclean&#39;s</em> Magazine and other media outlets,&quot; noting that &quot;this type of media coverage has been identified as contributing to Islamophobia and promoting social intolerance towards Muslim, Arab, and South Asian Canadians.&quot;<br /><br />While recognizing the importance of the freedom of expression, the OHRC also stated that it could not be used as a guise to target vulnerable groups and for the dissemination of xenophobic opinions.<br /><br />Unfortunately, notwithstanding their recognition of the &quot;Islamophobic&quot; content of several articles published by <em>Maclean&#39;s</em>, the Commission was unable to proceed with my clients&#39; complaints because s. 13(1) of the Ontario Human Rights Code does not cover the content of newspapers and magazines. This gaping hole in the Code leaves minority groups, with little or no public voice, without a remedy for redressing group defamation and racism disseminated in our mass media.<br /><br />Alternative venues to combat media-promulgated racism are conspicuously limited. Yes, Canada has criminal hate speech laws, but when the sources of hate speech are found in our own print and broadcast journalism, they provide little or no protection to minorities. All hate speech prosecutions require the Attorney General&#39;s consent - an unlikely event if the potential defendant is a large media organization.<br /><br />Provincial press councils provide an avenue for reader complaints, but membership is voluntary and many offending media organizations, such as <em>Maclean&#39;s</em>, do not subscribe to them.<br /><br />In principle, we could encourage more and better speech to counter the effects of prejudicial and hateful speech. In practice, a review of major Canadian publications indicates that the &quot;more and better speech&quot; is disturbingly scarce. When it comes to Muslims, right-wing journalists across the country have plenty to say. But who is providing the &quot;more and better speech&quot; to mitigate their toxic effects? The &quot;more and better speech&quot; formula fails marginalized minorities - a lesson that Canadian Muslims have painfully learned. In my clients&#39; case, <em>Maclean&#39;s</em> preferred bankruptcy to publishing a mutually acceptable response to one of over twenty Islamophobic articles published in two-and-a-half years.<br /><br />Given the lack of viable alternatives, the Commission must be lauded for its courageous stance against media-promulgated racism and Islamophobia. Its clear and unambiguous public statement is a source of hope for minorities, particularly Muslims, who have consistently received the short-end of the media stick. A powerful and respected public institution has spoken out against the persistent denigration of the Muslim community in our mass media. We can only hope positive change is on its way.<br /><br /><br /><em>Faisal Joseph is a human rights advocate and litigation lawyer based in London, Ontario, Canada.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aleksandra (Sasha) Williams, Pitt Law &#39;10, files from <strong>Kiev</strong>:<br /><br />On May 16, 2008, Ukraine became the 152nd country member of the World Trade Organization. Although the general Kiev population seemed rather unimpressed by this event, especially in light of the impending mayoral elections and the associated campaign bedlam, the legal community met the news both cheerfully and cautiously. While the merriment can easily be explained by, at the very least, beating Russia to the punch, the weariness is well founded as well. It appears that the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine did little besides adopting a Protocol ratifying the WTO Accession Agreement - the existing legal framework for customs duties remains a confusing mystery to everyone involved. There is some doubt whether the government officials fully understood what was being adopted: the Ukrainian WTO negotiations package consisting of over 1500 pages was translated from English into Ukrainian only two days before the ratification. <br /><br />Although the pertinent tax regulations were annexed to the Protocol, they were never added to the effective Tax Code. The Customs Service decided to lower the customs duties for import of goods by the WTO members without waiting for the legislature. The Service reasoned that until the respective laws are adopted, customs will be governed by the Protocol. The Verhovna Rada considered this decision to be well outside of the Service&#39;s authority, but did not offer any practical solutions. Instead, it proposed lowering customs duties only for certain types of goods - a law which is at variance with the Protocol and the annexed Agreement. <br /><br />In keeping with the common Ukrainian idiom &quot;god loves trinity&quot; (similar to &quot;three is a charm&quot; or &quot;troubles always come in three&quot;), the Customs Service got hit with two additional problems on May 16: its server crashed and its Chief quit. Valerij Khoroshkovskyy, Head of the Customs Service of Ukraine, must have had to submit an old-fashioned ink-on-paper letter of resignation on Friday as the Service was completely cut off from Internet and electronic network access. Again, in keeping with the common Ukrainian tradition, while government officials boisterously herald the impending economic paradise (whether it is due to WTO membership or some other matter), businessmen are left without any idea about how import transactions should be conducted.<br />

		<title>Arizona school vouchers ruling casts doubt on future success of programs</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.perkinscoie.com/lstein/">Lee Stein</a> [partner, <a href="http://www.perkinscoie.com/home.aspx">Perkins Coie Brown &amp; Bain</a>] and <a href="http://www.perkinscoie.com/ekruschek/">Elizabeth Kruschek</a> [associate, <a href="http://www.perkinscoie.com/home.aspx">Perkins Coie Brown &amp; Bain</a>]: &quot;Last week, the Arizona Court of Appeals held that <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/arizona-appeals-court-strikes-down.php">two school voucher programs</a> created by the Arizona Legislature in 2006 were unconstitutional.  Those programs provided scholarships or grants of state money to the parents or guardians of foster children and students with disabilities to allow those children to attend private schools.  The Court determined that the voucher programs violated Article 9, Section 10 of the <a href="http://law.justia.com/arizona/constitution/">Arizona Constitution</a>, which has no federal counterpart and which prohibits &quot;appropriation of public money made in aid of any church, or private or sectarian school.&quot;<br /><br />The court&#39;s decision raises doubts about the future success of voucher programs in Arizona.  Because <a href="http://law.justia.com/arizona/constitution/9/10.htm">Article 9, Section 10</a> of Arizona&#39;s Constitution clearly prohibits state aid to private or sectarian schools - a provision that is not found in all state constitutions - it is more difficult to craft a voucher program that does not run afoul of the constitution.  Here, the legislature tried to circumvent Article 9, Section 10&#39;s prohibition on aid to private schools by issuing the grant or scholarship to the parent or guardian, who would then endorse that grant or scholarship to the private school of their choice.  However, the Court quite rightly saw through the Legislature&#39;s attempt to avoid the constitutional prohibition.<br /><br />Additionally, we hope that the decision will finally put to rest any further argument that the constitutional provisions at issue in this case are are tainted by religious bigotry (known as &quot;<a href="http://www.blaineamendments.org/Intro/whatis.html">Blaine Amendments</a>&quot;).  Those in favor of vouchers, like the Institute for Justice in this case, have repeatedly made this assertion, and the Court of Appeals directly - and correctly - disagreed, noting that no link has ever been established between the Blaine Amendment and Arizona&#39;s Constitution.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Khalid Sekander</strong> [former legal advisor to <a href="http://www.usaid.gov/">USAID</a>]: &quot;The U.S. Supreme Court said in 2006 that military commissions to try Guantanamo detainees were unconstitutional because they violated <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/91.htm">Common Article 3, Geneva Conventions</a>, which states that detainees must be treated humanely and be afforded the same judicial guarantees &quot;which are recognized as indispensable by civilized people.&quot; So earlier this month the U.S. shipped five of the Afghan-based Guantanamo detainees to Afghanistan so that the <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/freed-guantanamo-detainees-facing.php">Afghan legal system can try</a> to treat them humanely and afford them those judicial guarantees recognized by civilized peoples. <br /><br />The U.S. has high hopes the Afghan legal system can dispense justice in spite of possessing specific knowledge the Afghan legal system is still not functional after 30 years of war and despite law reform efforts capably led by the Italian government. No doubt the detainees are expected to defend against a system unequipped to satisfy international legal standards, including those protections recognized by civilized peoples, such as evidentiary standards, the right to defense attorneys, and a meaningful opportunity to cross-exam witnesses, among many others. <br /><br />At least the U.S. is off the hook.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/about_us/staff/lanigan_k.htm"><strong>Kevin Lanigan</strong></a> [Director, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/">Human Rights First</a>, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/us_law.asp">Law and Security Program</a>]: &quot;The U.S. military in Iraq is quickly moving toward its first <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/us-military-orders-first-court-martial.php">court-martial of a civilian contractor</a> since the Vietnam war.  The case holds some promise of beginning to reign in a pervasive culture of contractor impunity, but nevertheless raises important constitutional and human rights issues.  And the case begs a critical question too:  Why is the Justice Department not prosecuting it?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">The <u>Ali</u> case<br /></span><br />Alaa &quot;Alex&quot; Mohammad Ali is a dual citizen of Canada and Iraq; he left Iraq for Canada after the 1990-91 Persian Gulf War, as Saddam Hussein imposed repressive measures on Iraq&#39;s majority Shi&#39;a Arab population.  After the invasion of Iraq in 2003, Ali was hired as an interpreter and sent to Iraq by Reston, Virginia-based L-3 Communications Titan Group.  Under its contract with the U.S. Army, L3 Titan provides approximately 7,000 interpreters in Iraq; according to a <a href="http://www.l-3com.com/news-events/pressrelease.aspx?releaseID=1102562">January 2008 L3 press release</a>, this contract generated $738 million in &quot;sales&quot; in 2007.<br /><br />Ali is charged with stabbing a fellow L3 Titan interpreter on February 23, 2008, following an argument on a remote U.S. military forward operating base (FOB) in al Anbar province, where both interpreters lived and worked. Six days after the incident Ali was moved to Camp Victory in Baghdad, where he remains confined in the complex of military bases adjoining Baghdad International Airport that serves as the operational headquarters of the U.S. military in Iraq. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">UCMJ authority</span><br /><br />In October 2006, Congress amended the <a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/ucmj.htm">Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)</a> to extend the military&#39;s authority to prosecute crimes committed by civilians &quot;serving with or accompanying&quot; the armed forces.  Prior to this amendment, such jurisdiction existed only &quot;in time of war.&quot;  The 2006 amendment extended jurisdiction to civilians serving in a &quot;contingency operation,&quot; see <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/usc_sec_10_00000802----000-.html">10 U.S.C. &Acirc;&sect; 802(a)(10)</a> &#8212; the current doctrinal term for the sorts of military operation in which the United States is currently engaged in Iraq and Afghanistan.  <br /><br />It took nearly a year-and-a-half for the Department of Defense (DoD) to prepare initial implementing instructions for its expanded UCMJ authority.  On September 25, 2007 &#8212; just over a week after the notorious Blackwater International shooting incident in Baghdad&#39;s Nisoor Square in which 17 Iraqi civilians were killed &#8212; Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England issued a <a href="http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/pacc/cc/docs/DepSecDef%20Memo%20Mgt%20of%20Contractors%2025Sep07.pdf">directive encouraging legal proceedings against contractors who violate military law, but providing no specific implementation guidance</a>.  Unsurprisingly, no UCMJ prosecutions followed.  On March 10, 2008, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates issued a <a href="http://turcopolier.typepad.com/sic_semper_tyrannis/files/gates-ucmj.pdf">memorandum to senior DoD officials providing implementation guidance</a>.  The Gates memorandum was issued two weeks after Ali allegedly stabbed his colleague at the al Anbar FOB.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Initiating the prosecution</span><br /><br />Less than a month later, on April 5, Multi-National Corps &#8212; Iraq (MNC-I) announced that Ali had been charged with aggravated assault in violation of <a href="http://usmilitary.about.com/library/milinfo/ucmj/blart-128.htm">UCMJ Article 128</a>.  Under the guidelines issued by Secretary Gates, before the military could refer court-martial charges against Ali, the combatant commander (in this case acting Central Command commander U.S. Army Lieutenant General Martin Dempsey) was required to provide formal written notice of the case to the Justice Department (DoJ).  Under the Gates guidelines, such notice starts the clock on a 14-day period for DoJ to determine whether it intends to prosecute the case in civilian court, in which case the military would defer to civilian authorities.  If DoJ requires more time to make its assessment, it need merely ask the Deputy Secretary of Defense and &quot;an extension shall be granted . . . .&quot;  <br /><br />Although DoJ has been publicly silent in <u>Ali</u>, we can safely assume that General Dempsey followed Secretary Gates&#39; instructions and notified DoJ of the case, but the Department presumably decided &#8212; as it almost invariably seems to do when it comes to serious contractor crime &#8212; &quot;Not us.&quot;  Thus on May 11, U.S. Army Lieutenant General Lloyd Austin, III, the MNC-I commander and the &quot;general court-martial convening authority&quot; in Ali, formally referred the Ali case for a general court-martial on charges of aggravated assault.  <br /><br />Ali&#39;s court-martial will be held in Iraq.  Its date and location have not yet been disclosed.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"><br />Whither Justice?</span><br /><br />On the basis of the facts disclosed by the military, it seems clear there would be civilian court jurisdiction under the <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/18C212.txt">Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act (MEJA)</a>.  However, DoJ has little appetite for these cases:  There has been only one private contractor ever indicted by the Department under MEJA for any sort of physically abusive or violent crime &#8212; Aaron Langston of Snowflake, Arizona, charged with assaulting a fellow contractor in Iraq with a knife.  See <u>United States v. Aaron Bridges Langston</u>, CR-07-210-PHX (U.S. Dist. Ct., Dist. of Ariz., Indictment, Feb. 27, 2007).  Langston&#39;s case falls under MEJA jurisdiction &#8212; as presumably would Ali&#39;s &#8212; because he is charged with a felony-level offense falling within the U.S. government&#39;s <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00000007----000-.html">Special Maritime and Territorial Jurisdiction (SMTJ)</a>, and because through his job with DoD contractor Kellogg, Brown and Root (KBR), Langston was &quot;employed by the armed forces outside the United States.&quot; <br /><br />But DoJ has organized its approach to MEJA cases in a way that creates significant internal disincentives to prosecute.  Responsibility for initiating a MEJA prosecution is localized in individual U.S. Attorney&#39;s offices rather than &quot;Main Justice.&quot;  U.S. Attorneys who prosecute MEJA cases are required to bear the cost out of their own budgets &#8212; and prosecuting a crime that occurred in Iraq or Afghanistan will cost far more than a comparable case in the U.S. Attorney&#39;s home district.  In <u>Langston</u> at least, the defendant&#39;s permanent residence in the district provided some rationale for assuming the cost of the prosecution.  With Ali, though &#8212; a dual Canadian-Iraq citizen who has never resided in the United States &#8212; the Justice Department&#39;s approach almost ensures that no U.S. Attorney would be willing to bear the cost. <br /><br />Assuming that DoJ did take a pass on Ali, this is hardly the first time it has turned its back on contractor crime.  In January 2008, Human Rights First released <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.info/pdf/08115-usls-psc-final.pdf">Private Security Contractors at War: Ending the Culture of Impunity</a>, a groundbreaking report documenting a long series of contractor crimes and an equally long history of DoJ inaction, and setting forth a comprehensive set of recommendations for ending the impunity with which private contractors have come to operate over the last several years.  To date DoJ&#39;s only completed contractor prosecution under MEJA was the conviction in May 2007 of a DoD contractor who pled guilty to possession of child pornography in Baghdad.  In the last several years &#8212; going back at least to the revelation in 2004 of contractor involvement in the Abu Ghraib abuses &#8212; more than two dozen other contractor cases reportedly have been referred for prosecution under MEJA, but DoJ has not proceeded in any of them.<br /><br />At the core of Human Rights First&#39;s recommendations is that DoJ take the lead in aggressively investigating and prosecuting cases of violent private contractor crime abroad, with MEJA and the SMTJ as its principal jurisdictional vehicles.  Regrettably though, through the tenures of three Attorneys General &#8212; John Ashcroft, Alberto Gonzales and now Michael Mukasey &#8212; there has been no progress, or even apparent interest, by DoJ in stepping up to these responsibilities.<br /><br />It was largely for these reasons that Human Rights First also recommended that DoD implement its expanded court-martial authority to try private contractors in appropriate, limited circumstances.  However, subjecting civilians &#8212; even military contractors &#8212; to court-martial jurisdiction is controversial and carries risks of abuse, and in most cases prosecution by civilian authorities is preferred.  <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Legal Implications of Court-Martialing Civilians</span><br /><br />In his court-martial, Ali will be afforded the same rights that U.S. military personnel receive, including the right to appointed military defense counsel and to a speedy trial; protection against self-incrimination; and the presumption of innocence.  This may not be enough.  Courts-martial of civilians raise important constitutional and human rights issues.  <br /><br />The U.S. Supreme Court in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0354_0001_ZO.html"><u>Reid v. Covert</u>, 354 U.S. 1 (1957)</a>, and other cases has held (albeit in the context of peacetime courts-martial initiated against the civilian dependants of military personnel) that the Constitution prohibits the prosecution of civilians by courts-martial because it would violate the right to a fair trial, including trial by jury.  Indeed, under current rules, Ali&#39;s court-martial &quot;jury&quot; will be a military panel, which may convict and sentence him on the basis of a two-thirds majority vote.  Notwithstanding Secretary Gates&#39; implementing instructions, there have been no changes to the Rules for Courts-Martial to ameliorate such concerns. <br />   <br />Moreover, the UN Human Rights Committee (the body charged with responsibility to monitor state compliance with the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/a_ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a>, ratified by the United States in 1992) has stated that military trials of civilians should occur only in exceptional circumstances and with full due process rights.  Recent events in Pakistan and elsewhere provide a timely reminder of the potential for abuse when military courts displace the regular civilian courts in trying civilians. <br /> <br />Thus if Ali is convicted, the military&#39;s first prosecution of a civilian in more than thirty years inevitably will provide substantial legal arguments for an appeal.  Even before the court-martial is completed &#8212; and perhaps before it is underway &#8212; the legality of Ali&#39;s detention and prosecution by military authorities may be collaterally challenged in U.S. federal courts.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">The U.S. government&#39;s responsibility  </span><br /><br />When the U.S. (or any) government fields and directs personnel to implement national policy abroad, it is responsible for their conduct &#8212; even if they are private contractors rather than traditional military forces.  When contractors commit serious violent offenses, the government is further responsible for providing effective mechanisms for criminal prosecution.  This is especially true where, as in Iraq, the U.S. government officials imposed <a href="http://www.cpa-iraq.org/regulations/20040627_CPAORD_17_Status_of_Coalition__Rev__with_Annex_A.pdf">Coalition Provisional Authority Order No. 17</a>, which confers presumptive immunity from Iraqi law upon international contractors working for Coalition government agencies or international organizations.  It continues to be in force in Iraq largely because of the U.S. government&#39;s continuing behind-the-scenes influence with the Iraqi government. <br /><br />There are now more U.S. private contractors working in Iraq than U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines deployed there.  But the United States has yet to implement effective mechanisms to ensure accountability for serious contractor crimes committed against local populations, U.S. military personnel or each other.  <br /><br />Until now, the commission of serious crimes by private contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan has amounted &#8212; for the contractors &#8212; in almost all cases to nothing more than poor career moves.  Absent Secretary Gates&#39; March directive, if Ali&#39;s case had followed the typical pattern, it could be expected that Ali &#8212; whether innocent or guilty &#8212; simply would have been fired and flown home, possibly with adverse impact on his security clearance (if he has one), <span style="font-style:italic;">but nothing else</span>.  And then he might well have returned a few months later, with another company.<br />  <br />As with so many of its responsibilities in Iraq, in prosecuting Ali the U.S. military is doing what it has been tasked to do, trying to impose some measure of greater accountability on private contractors &#8212; even though it may not be the best-positioned or most appropriate agency for this role.  But it seems for now the only agency willing to do it.  We can only wait and see whether the military&#39;s new authority survives judicial scrutiny.  <br /><br />If there is indeed substantial evidence to support the charges against Ali, he should of course be prosecuted.  This court-martial, however, would not be occurring &#8212; indeed, it would not be necessary &#8212; if the Justice Department were doing its job with the tools it has to prosecute serious contractor crime abroad.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/about_us/staff/muhammedAlly_s.htm"><strong>Sahr MuhammedAlly</strong></a> [Senior Associate, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/us_law.asp">Law and Security Program</a>, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/">Human Rights First</a>]: &quot;On March 12, 2008, <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/guantanamo-detainee-asks-to-boycott.php">Mohammed Jawad</a> - an Afghan national who was 16 or 17 years old at the time of his arrest in Kabul in December 2002 - made his first public appearance to the world when he appeared before a military judge in pre-trial military commission proceedings at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Jawad has been in Guantanamo for over five years &#8212; a quarter of his life. Jawad is charged with attempted murder and intent to cause serious bodily injury in violation of the laws of war. The relevant incident involved a grenade that injured two US soldiers and an Afghan interpreter in Kabul on December 17, 2002. He faces no charges of terrorism, material support, or any connection to al-Qaeda or the Taliban. <br /><br />I observed Jawad at his pre-trial hearing on May 7 where Jawad consented to having defense counsel represent him, but only for the purpose of challenging the legitimacy of the military commission system. Air Force Major Reserve David Frakt, who was assigned to represent Jawad on April 28, told the court: &quot;Mr. Jawad is an innocent man. He has been held for five years. He was a homeless boy wrongfully accused and beaten into confession by the Afghanistan police.&quot; <br /><br />According to his lawyer, Jawad lived in a refugee camp in Miran Shah, Pakistan. His father died when he was very young. His mother remarried, but Jawad was thrown out of his home by his stepfather at age 13. At his Combatant Status Review Tribunal (CSRT) on October 19, 2004, Jawad said that he was approached by some men who offered to train him to clear landmines in Afghanistan. According to Major Frakt, Jawad told him that he was aware that mine clearing was dangerous work but that the money was good. <br /><br />Jawad claims that when he was taken to Afghanistan he was drugged and cannot recall many details. At his CSRT hearing, Jawad said that he was taken to a mountainous area for a few days and was given pills daily which made him &quot;sleepy and forget [about his] family.&quot; He also stated that he was given injections on his leg that made him hallucinate. On the day of the alleged grenade attack, Jawad said that that he was given orange chewing gum, chocolate candy and a tablet. &quot;When I took this pill I didn&#39;t know what I did. I was out of mind I couldn&#39;t think clearly,&quot; said Jawad at his CSRT hearing.<br /><br />On December 17, 2002, there was a grenade attack on a vehicle in broad daylight. Two American soldiers and their interpreter were injured. The grenade was thrown from the back window. Jawad and another man were arrested but the Afghans released the other man.<br /><br />According to Major Frakt, Jawad told him that he was taken to the police station, where Afghan police officers beat him just enough so that no marks were left. The police told him that if he confessed he would be released. They put a piece of paper in front of him to sign, but Jawad can barely read. &quot;They made him put his thumb print on the paper. The US is calling this a confession,&quot; said Major Frakt.<br /><br />Jawad spent a night with the Afghans and was handed over to the Americans. He was held in Bagram for a few weeks and then taken to Guantanamo, arriving in early 2003. <br /><br />At his arraignment in March, Jawad claimed that soldiers accused him of knowing about the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. He said he needed to know the reason that he was being held in prison, and he needed the world to hear him because his pleas of innocence had gone no further than his cell. He asked the judge: &quot;Is it in the US Constitution how to treat a 16-year-old with justice? I want justice and fairness.&quot; <br /><br />Major Frakt was appointed counsel to Jawad a week before Jawad&#39;s pre-trial hearing. Jawad&#39;s previous detailed military counsel Army Colonel J. Michael Sawyers &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; who was at the arraignment in March, and had met with Jawad numerous times and even traveled to Afghanistan to help prepare the defense &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; left active duty on March 18 to return to civilian life. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Conditions in Guantanamo</span><br /><br />Jawad has spent over five years in Guantanamo &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; most of it in solitary confinement. Major Frakt said that, &quot;Jawad&#39;s memory is shaky. Everything starts to blend together. He has no reference of time, except Ramadan. All days are the same. No change in season. He is not allowed outdoor activity except for under a covered roof.&quot; Camps 5 and 6 are maximum security prisons where detainees are confined to a 8 x 10 foot cell for 23 hours a day. There is no natural air or sunlight and artificial light is on 24 hours a day. At the hearing on May 7, Jawad corrected Major Frakt and said that once he saw a sliver of the sky &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; a comment indicative of someone treasuring a rare moment of seeing the blue sky.<br /><br />During the proceedings I observed, Jawad appeared agitated and told the court that he had &quot;been punished a lot.&quot; He described how he was coercively interrogated for hours on end in sealed rooms, sometimes after being woken up from sleep at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m., subjected to bright lights for 24 hours, threatened that he would spend his whole life in Guantanamo, and falsely promised that he would be able to get out. He also mentioned that he was moved from different camps and different cells and said that he could not remember how long he was in a particular camp. He seemed to have lost track of time. He told the court that he was promised books so he could study and told that he would be transferred to Camp 4, where he would be able to mingle with other detainees, but that these promises were not kept. During the hearing, he appeared confused and held his hand to his head several times while stating that he could not remember. He asked why he was in Guantanamo and kept saying that he wants to go home. He told the court that he is &quot;a human being&quot; and asked the court whether this was &quot;justice.&quot; <br /><br />Major Frakt is requesting a mental health evaluation for Jawad. He told me that, &quot;Jawad has mood swings. He seems paranoid at times. For instance he says, &#39;that&#39;s not what you told me before why are you changing your view now.&#39; He never stays happy for long. He is really desperate to get out. He gets frustrated easily. He has trouble concentrating for long periods of time and is bewildered by the complexity of the legal system.&quot; But Major Frakt also said that his client is polite, appreciative and always thanks him, and that Jawad has inquired whether Major Frakt would get in trouble for helping him.  <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">The Next Steps </span><br /><br />Although Jawad has instructed defense counsel to challenge the validity of the military commission proceedings, there are several hurdles in the way. In April 2008, Army Col. Judge Peter Brownback, who also is the presiding judge in Jawad&#39;s case ruled in the case of <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/detainees/cases/khadr.htm">Omar Khadr</a> &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; a Canadian national who was fifteen at the time of his capture by US forces &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; that there was no bar to subjecting child soldiers to military commission proceedings. Although children should be held accountable for their crimes, international law requires that they be treated in a manner that takes into account their particular vulnerability and relative culpability as children, and focuses primarily on rehabilitation and reintegration. <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu2/6/protocolchild.htm">The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child</a> on the involvement of children in armed conflict, to which the US is a party, explicitly prohibits the recruitment or use of children under 18 in armed conflict by non-state armed groups and requires state parties to criminalize such conduct. It regards child soldiers as victims in need of rehabilitation, not as volunteer &quot;soldiers&quot; capable of making an informed choice to join a military force. In the military commission system, however, US treaty obligations under the Optional Protocol have no bearing.<br /><br />Notably in 2003, the United States released three children, ages 13-15, from Guantanamo to UNICEF (The United Nations Children&#39;s Fund) to enable them to receive rehabilitation and reintegration assistance in Afghanistan. But the US government has not made any such rehabilitation assistance available to Mohammed Jawad. <br /><br />Another possible challenge to the jurisdiction of the military commissions is that the application of the <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.info/pdf/080515-USLS-military-commissions-act.pdf">Military Commissions Act (MCA)</a> to Jawad violates both constitutional and international legal principles banning <span style="font-style:italic;">ex post facto</span> laws because the MCA was not enacted until 2006 &acirc;&#8364;&#8221;four years after Jawad was captured. A similar motion was filed in the <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/inthecourts/supreme_court_hamdan.htm">Salim Hamdan</a> case in February 2007 and a decision is pending. The prosecution in that case argued that <span style="font-style:italic;">ex post facto</span> principles do not apply because the US Constitution does not protect aliens detained as enemy combatants at Guantanamo and international <span style="font-style:italic;">ex post facto</span> principles are irrelevant because Congress is not bound by international law. The government is expected to take the same position in Jawad&#39;s case.<br /> <br />&quot;Jawad told me that I should not come back unless I have good news. Our next reunion will be difficult,&quot; said Major Frakt. He is probably right; there may be no good news for Jawad in the imminent future given the difficulties in challenging the jurisdiction of the military commission proceedings. &quot;My hope is that if he understands that I am working on his behalf then he will allow me to continue representing him,&quot; added Major Frakt.&quot;<br /><br /><em>&quot;Report from Guantanamo&quot; features regular contributions to JURIST Hotline from <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.com/"><strong>Human Rights First</strong></a></em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.sosforests.com/?page_id=634">Mike Dubrasich</a></strong> [Executive Director, <a href="http://westinstenv.org/">Western Institute for Study of the Environment</a>]: &quot;After eight years of a planning exercise called the Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment (SNFPA) - one that involved thousands of people, hundreds of meetings, and tens of thousands of documents, studies, reviews, rehashes, monitoring, and re-monitoring - a Federal judge last week <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/federal-appeals-court-enjoins-forest.php">enjoined fire-preventative thinnings</a> created under SNFPA guidance with the judgment that the planning was not &quot;rigorous&quot; enough to satisfy.<br /><br />That suit was brought by the <a href="http://www.wilderness.org/">Wilderness Society</a>, and in effect destroyed eight years of effort by <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/">USFS</a> employees and an engaged public to comply with the law.<br /><br />The Wilderness Society had every opportunity to participate in the Sierra Nevada Forest Plan planning exercise. There was an open process with public hearings and public involvement every step of the way. Indeed, the Wilderness Society was invited and even begged to participate, to become part of the process, to meet with local residents, and to resolve differences in an amicable and collaborative fashion.<br /><br />Instead the Wilderness Society chose to shun that process and to sue to kill it, in concert with the Sierra Club, the Center For Biological Diversity, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and the Sierra Nevada Forest Protection Campaign (who recently changed their name to Sierra Forest Legacy in a marketing/branding move).<br /><br />Intervening on behalf of the unsuccessful Defendants were Tuolumne County Alliance For Resources &amp; Environment, California Forest Counties Schools Coalition, Regional Council Of Rural Counties, Western Council Of Industrial Workers, Klamath Alliance For Resources &amp; Environment, Coarse Gold Resource Conservation District/Eastern Madera County Fire Safe Council; Tulare County Resource Conservation District, Sierra Resource Conservation District, Strawberry Property Owners&#39; Association, Huntington Lake Association, Huntington Lake Big Creek Historical Conservancy, California Equestrian Trails &amp; Lands Coalition, California Forestry Association, California Licensed Foresters Association, California/Nevada Snowmobile Association, American Forest &amp; Paper Association, American Forest Resource Council, Blueribbon Coalition, California Ski Industry Association, California Cattlemen&#39;s Association, Quincy Library Group, and Plumas County.<br /><br />Judge Noonan first compared Federal timber sales to extortion. Then he called them collusion. Then he called them bribery. Yet the Plumas timber sales are standard and common transactions following all the rules. When the judge goes down to the lumber yard and buys boards with real money drawn from his federal paycheck, is that extortion, collusion, and bribery? Are all market transactions extortion, collusion, and bribery in the eyes of Noonan? The USFS has sold material harvested in forest practice operations for over 100 years because that is what they have been charged to do by the Organic Act, the Multiple Use Sustained Yield Act, the National Forest Management Act, and various other federal laws. What does the judge think the USFS is supposed to do, give the logs away? Burn them in a heap?<br /><br />The 2001 Fire Effects Information System (FEIS) includes selling timber and Possible Sale Quantities of green timber - thus the Forest Service can neatly sidestep Noonan&#39;s ridiculous tirade - and the proposed treatments include group selection harvests and DPFZs (Defensible Fuel Profile Zones: areas approximately 1/4 to 1/2 mile wide where fuel loadings are reduced, usually along roads, that would have saved hundreds of thousands of acres of Sierra forest from catastrophic fire). The timber harvest bulk of both Basin and Empire projects, sawlog-wise, are in group selection units; repackaging and selling them without the money-losing DPFZ units would ironically keep the commercial logging going, but shut down the landscape-scale strategic fuels work. That&#39;s what the 9th Circuit&#39;s order allows to be implemented.<br /><br />The landscape-scale fuels work <strong><em>is</em></strong> the basis of the 2001 Framework&#39;s California Spotted Owl Conservation Strategy (Conservation Strategy for Old Forest Ecosystems and Associated Species; <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/snfpa/library/archives/rod/rod.pdf">2001 ROD Appendix A pp.A-1 through A-4</a>). Look at the last sentence of the section: &quot;The goal is to strategically treat fuels across 30 to 40 percent of each landscape with the overall objective of reducing uncharacteristically severe wildland fire effects across the entire landscape.&quot; The treatments enjoined would have saved wildlife habitat from catastrophic destruction. The recent (last week) <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/363546_spottedowl17.html">USFWS Recovery Plan for the Northern Spotted Owl</a> calls for exactly such treatments and is based on the professional expertise of numerous owl and forest biologists. The plaintiffs have successfully written a death warrant for the very things they purport to save.&quot;<br />

		<title>California same-sex marriage decision an abuse of judicial authority</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://lc.org/index.cfm?PID=14096"><strong>Mathew D. Staver</strong></a> [Founder of <a href="http://www.lc.org/">Liberty Counsel</a>; Dean and Professor of Law, <a href="http://www.liberty.edu/">Liberty University School of Law</a>]: &quot;Yesterday&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/california-high-court-rules-same-sex.php">California Supreme Court decision</a> represents a raw abuse of judicial authority. In 2000, California voters overwhelmingly passed Proposition 22, defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman. The California Supreme Court overturned the will of the people by declaring Proposition 22 unconstitutional. In its decision, the court held what no other court had yet done  &#8212; that sexual orientation is a suspect classification, requiring application of a strict scrutiny analysis. <br /><br />For those states considering whether to reach a &quot;compromise&quot; on the issue of same-sex marriage by giving same-sex couples some benefits of marriage, yesterday&#39;s decision represents a warning bell. The court explained that because the state had gradually given more benefits to same-sex couples, the state constitution now required the state to confer the right of marriage.<br /><br />Addressing our argument that permitting same-sex couples to marry would sever the link between procreation and child-rearing and send a message to the next generation that children do not need a mom and dad, the court inexplicably concluded that it would not. But when California puts its stamp of approval on a relationship between two people of the same-sex, who by definition cannot procreate, and instructs our children in public schools that a family with two moms or two dads is just as normal and acceptable as a marriage between a man and a woman (which has happened in Massachusetts through mandated family diversity training), it necessarily sends the message to our children that moms and dads do not matter.<br /><br />While saddened by yesterday&#39;s decision, we are confident that the legal impact of this decision will spur voters in California to pass a state constitutional amendment and reinvigorate the national efforts for a federal constitutional amendment.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Stephen Behnke</strong> [Director of Ethics, <a href="http://www.apa.org">American Psychological Association</a>]: &quot;The American Psychological Association commends the American Civil Liberties Union for its commitment to uncovering <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/us-army-psychologists-medics-supported.php">details</a> surrounding the treatment of detainees at facilities run by the US government. APA shares the ACLU&#39;s resolve to ensure that human rights are protected in all settings throughout the world. <br /><br />Having read the government documents recently obtained by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">ACLU</a> under the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oip/">Freedom of Information Act</a>, we find what they reveal about abuse to be abhorrent. The position of the American Psychological Association is clear and unequivocal: There is never a justification for torture or abuse. In carefully reviewing the documents, we note they show that psychologists supporting interrogations &quot;emphasized their separation from detainee medical care,&quot; and that a psychologist who suspected abuse &quot;recommended the interrogation not proceed and brought in medical personnel to evaluate the detainee.&quot; Based on the information in these documents, APA&#39;s strategy of engagement &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; of having psychologists involved in interrogation processes &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; served its intended purpose: to stop interrogations that cross the bounds of ethical propriety. According to these documents, non-psychologist health care providers also took action to prevent abuse and protect detainees.<br /><br />The <em>Washington Post</em> called APA&#39;s August 2007 resolution a &quot;rebuke&quot; of the Bush Administration&#39;s interrogation policies, by virtue of APA&#39;s having condemned and prohibited specific techniques associated with &quot;harsh&quot; interrogations. <br /><br />For more than two decades, APA has been committed to promoting the humane treatment of detainees. We will adjudicate any allegation that an APA member has engaged in unethical conduct. APA asks that any individual having information that a psychologist has engaged in torture bring this information to the attention of the APA&#39;s Ethics Office.&quot;<br />

		<title>Constitution referendum amid cyclone exposes illegitimacy of Burma junta</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://ratchasima.net"><strong>Awzar Thi</strong></a> [member, <a href="http://www.ahrchk.net/index.php">Asian Human Rights Commission</a>, Hong Kong]: &quot;May 10 was supposed to be a big day for Burma&#39;s military, the day that it legitimated itself through the <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/eu-parliament-head-assails-myanmar.php">ballot box</a>. On that day, millions of eligible voters were supposed to come and freely express their approval of a constitution that would guarantee the army a quarter of seats in parliament and reaffirm its role as the leading state agency in a &quot;discipline-flourishing&quot; democracy, with a constitution of the generals, by the generals, for the generals. <br /><br />That was the plan. In reality, the military&#39;s legitimacy has been decided upon by something else entirely. Cyclone Nargis not only obliterated hundreds of coastal villages and with them prospects for a trouble-free poll, but also any chance that the regime can now or at any time in the future obtain the credibility at home or abroad that the referendum was intended to secure for it. Never mind the widespread claims of vote rigging, bullying and miscounting. That the referendum was held at all, that almost two weeks on cyclone victims have received no help and are dying in makeshift huts of cholera, that rivers and fields are still full of bloated corpses and that officials are selling or hoarding relief supplies delivered from well-meaning donors abroad all speak to the regime&#39;s barbarity and its absolute want of legitimacy. <br /><br />The junta&#39;s store of legitimacy, to the extent that it existed at all, was already greatly diminished by the events of September 2007. The putting down of the latest popular uprising was in some respects even more shocking than the crushing of protests in 1988, albeit less bloody, because this time around Buddhist monks were in the forefront of rallies. Not only do the majority of people in Burma venerate the monks but the generals too, in the absence of any singular unifying ideology of old, have used them as a central plank in the platform upon which they have stood for the last two decades. By pressing on since then and presenting themselves as pious leaders on a righteous path, the army leaders have instead consistently reminded the public of their sins rather than of any advertised virtues. <br /><br />The other main element in the propaganda, leaving aside the state stability humbug, has been national development. New roads, bridges, dams, weirs, universities, schools, hospitals and crops are the stuff from which the military has sought to build a legacy. People can travel more easily, grow more plants more often, study harder and get better medical treatment than ever before. Or so the story goes, thanks to the government&#39;s benevolence. It is a story that was never true, but in the aftermath of the cyclone has been shown to be so horribly wrong that even the most skeptical of citizens has been shocked that the regime would stoop to the point of blocking international aid from starving villagers and stealing from the small amounts that it has allowed in. Even the most cynical of observers has been alarmed that boxes of supplies from Thailand have had the names of senior officers plastered over the top of the kingdom&#39;s labels, only to be taken back from dazed ostensible recipients anyhow after the television cameras had been turned off. And that is just a little of what has happened in the past week and a half, a week and a half in which the ruling clique has really shown its true colours, their unsurpassed ugliness. <br /><br />The ballot boxes from May 10, and those from the remaining 47 townships where the vote was postponed to May 24, will be both full and empty: full of little papers that will one way or another be taken as an endorsement of the army&#39;s continued rule, but empty of substance and devoid of meaning. The referendum was not a sham, as so many commentators and political opponents have said so many times in recent weeks. It just wasn&#39;t anything at all. Whatever it was supposed to be it was not; whatever it was supposed to decide has been decided elsewhere: a great cost for absolutely nothing.&quot;<br />

A <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/muslim-woman-sues-michigan-judge-who.php">state judge gave her a choice</a>:  remove the niqab she wore as a matter of religious practice before testifying, or he would dismiss her claim.  As her beliefs did not permit her to remove her veil, her claim was dismissed.   This decision may surprise people, and it should.<br /><br />On Monday, a <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/federal-judge-dismisses-lawsuit-by.php">federal court declined to hold</a> that Muhammad&#39;s rights of access to the courts and religious freedom were violated. The federal judge&#39;s decision relies on a number of procedural doctrines intended to protect state courts from undue federal intervention.  It was not, in other words, a decision on the merits under federal or state law.<br /><br />Should the merits be addressed, Muhammad&#39;s case would be far more difficult.  The state judge declared he could not determine Muhammad&#39;s credibility without seeing her entire face, but judges frequently surmount such difficulties.  Witnesses may be distraught, may be unavailable to testify in person, may have relevant disabilities, or may have professional practice as, for example, actors or poker players.  Further, judges themselves may have limited or impaired eyesight.  In all of those situations, a judge must simply rely on other indicators to determine whether a witness is, or is not credible; this case is no different. Throwing Muhammad&#39;s claim out was a drastic and unnecessary solution to a common problem.  Principles of fairness, access to courts, and religious freedom demand better.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.aclu.org/about/staff/administrationoftorture.html"><strong>Amrit Singh</strong></a> [Staff attorney, <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">ACLU</a>]: &quot;For almost four years now, the ACLU has been litigating under the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oip/">Freedom of Information Act</a> for the disclosure of government documents relating to the torture of prisoners held in U.S. custody abroad since September 11, 2001. The Bush administration, however, continues to fight tooth and nail to withhold key policy documents authorizing the torture of prisoners. One such key policy document being withheld is an August 2002 Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) memo specifying for CIA use numerous abusive interrogation techniques, reportedly including waterboarding. (This document was issued at about the same time as the infamous &quot;torture memo&quot; in which then Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee took the position that abuse does not rise to the level of torture under U.S. law unless it inflicts pain &quot;equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or even death&quot;). In a significant ruling issued on May 8, 2008, Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/federal-judge-orders-handover-of-cia.php">ordered the CIA to produce</a> the August 2002 OLC memo in court for in camera review. <br /><br />At a hearing in January, the judge initially bought the government&#39;s argument that the August 2002 OLC memo could be withheld on grounds of the attorney client privilege, and declined at that time to conduct an in camera review of that document. He however reconsidered that decision in light of the ACLU&#39;s argument that the document could not be withheld under the attorney-client privilege because it had been adopted as official government policy. Indeed, on February 7, 2008, in an oversight hearing before the House Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Michael Mukasey specifically acknowledged that the OLC had issued an opinion &quot;authorizing&quot; the CIA to use a number of interrogation methods including waterboarding, and that the Justice Department could not therefore criminally investigate the CIA for using that method. <br /><br />The memo was reviewed in camera by Judge Hellerstein on May 12, 2008. That review should only confirm that the memo should be released so that the administration&#39;s illegal and immoral torture policies can be fully exposed.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.farzanahassan.com/">Farzana Hassan</a> </strong>[president, <a href="http://www.muslimcanadiancongress.org/index.html">Muslim Canadian Congress</a>]: &quot;For those who think the veil symbolizes the oppression of Muslim women - think again. In an American court in August of 2006, the veil instead became a symbol of clear defiance to legal protocol and authority. Ginnah Muhammad, who refused to remove her face-veil to identity herself as the complainant in a petty-claims case, rejected the authority of the judge who had earlier demanded she comply with court regulations by lifting her veil. His response to her refusal was merely to <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/federal-judge-dismisses-lawsuit-by.php">dismiss the case</a>, thereby denying Ginnah access to justice. Such incidents raise valid questions about the extent of faith accommodations in pluralistic societies, the conditions of denying justice, the clash of cultures and last but not least, the correctness or otherwise of Ginnah&#39;s extreme religious stance.<br /><br />Certainly, there exists a school of thought within Islam that believes it is better to err on the side of extreme expressions of piety rather than fall short thereof. Be that is it may, often in the West, refusal to remove head gear, or in this instance the face-veil, may constitute a political statement that Orthodox Islamic precept must be upheld over and above any temporal law or authority. There is no denying her opinion represents only a fraction, albeit a growing one, of what is believed about the veiling and segregation of women. Neither does her view find substantiation in religious texts. No explicit injunctions enjoining the face-veil on Muslim women exists either in the Quran or in the oral traditions attributed to the prophet Mohammad. But what is troubling is not as much Ginnnah Muhammad&#39;s extreme religiosity. It is more the politicization of her views and those who share it. Often these uncompromising attitudes surface in situations such as the above where these parties refuse to make concessions due to rigidity of religious outlook. This is the kind of radicalization that seeks to change existing public systems and mechanisms through such refusal.<br /><br />Often Islamists demand the imposition of Sharia law and excessive accommodations in public places while themselves refusing to budge an inch from their own extreme positions. This is how they are changing the world around them. Though the judges actions may be deemed excessive by some in dismissing the case, they are understandable in the interest of maintaining uniformity and transparency of the legal process. Moreover, moderate and secular Muslims who have embraced the liberalism of North American society, would most certainly welcome this decision. Its about time they stood up to the scare tactics of the Islamists and also found support for their stance from local authorities.&quot;<br />

		<title>California and marriage: suspect class or suspect ruling?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Jeffery J. Ventrella</span> [Senior Vice President of Strategic Training, <a href="http://www.alliancedefensefund.org/main/default.aspx">Alliance Defense Fund</a>]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/california-high-court-rules-same-sex.php">California Supreme Court</a> in an innocuously titled 4-3 split decision, <u>In re Marriage Cases</u>, sets forth an anything but innocuous ruling that imposes same-sex &quot;marriage&quot; despite a valid contrary expression by the citizens in the 2000 vote - 61% to 39%. Aside from the seismic effect created by the majority&#39;s rank judicial activism, lies the Court&#39;s rationale for its ruling: the assertion that homosexual behavior is entitled to &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; because homosexuals comprise a &quot;suspect class.&quot; This assertion is fundamentally flawed legally, empirically, biologically, and rationally. And, this is not overstatement.<br /><br />In the context of the battle to preserve marriage, many bright (but erroneous) scholars have tirelessly argued for same-sex &quot;marriage.&quot; They consistently assert that the extant marriage laws should be deemed unconstitutional because they allegedly &quot;discriminate on the basis of sex.&quot; Advocates of this view include Dr. Andrew Koppelman of Northwestern University School of Law and Professor William Eskridge of Yale Law School. Both men have written scholarly and lengthy books attempting to make this point. The California Court, however rejected these scholars&#39; rationale. Instead, the California Court has boldly gone where no federal court has gone: the court concluded that homosexuals are a &quot;suspect class&quot; and thereby are entitled to a legal status just like race and ethnicity. It is the court&#39;s reasoning that is suspect.<br /><br />Ask this question: Just how are &quot;members&quot; of this supposed &quot;suspect class&quot; to be identified? Are they those who possess homosexual ideations? Are they those who engage in homosexual conduct? If so, how often. Does one &quot;event&quot; permit membership into the &quot;suspect class?&quot; If not, why not? Is membership simply a matter of self-assertion, a product of self-serving autonomy? What if one &quot;identifies&quot; as being heterosexual, but engages in homosexual behavior for pay as a prostitute? What if one &quot;identifies&quot; as being homosexual, but engages in heterosexual behavior for pay as prostitute? What if one &quot;identifies&quot; as heterosexual, but has a moral lapse, ala Ted Haggard? Here is the deep analytic flaw in the court&#39;s assertion: behavior (ethics) is being confused with status (metaphysics).<br /><br />Moreover, those who contend that sexual behavior is legally &quot;like race&quot; crash upon the shores of scientific reality: race and ethnicity are genetic; sexual behavior is not. But, what about the so-called &quot;gay gene?&quot; Well, hear the actual words of the actual genetic researcher, Simon LeVay: &quot;I<span style="font-style:italic;"> did not prove that homosexuality is genetic, or find a genetic cause for being gay. I didn&#39;t show that gay men are born that way&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;the most common mistake people make in interpreting my work. Nor did I locate a gay center in the brain</span>.&quot; But, hey, let&#39;s not confuse the law with the facts.<br /><br />And, in any event, even if homosexual behavior were to be shown to be like race, it would be irrelevant to the legal question at hand. This is because the marriage laws do not inquire about &quot;sexual orientation.&quot; No DOMA bars practitioners of homosexual behavior from marrying. And, no marriage license application inquires about intimate sexual practices. The law is utterly neutral as to &quot;sexual orientation,&quot; and therefore, &quot;sexual orientation&quot; is legally irrelevant. Consequently, it is the California court&#39;s ruling that is suspect . . . and manifestly so. California&#39;s citizens should divorce themselves from their court&#39;s extreme deviation from rational jurisprudence.&quot;<br />

		<title>US practice of forcibly drugging deportees is torture</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Ahilan Arulanantham</span> [staff attorney, <a href="http://www.aclu-sc.org/">ACLU of Southern California</a>]: &quot;I need to start with two caveats.  First, I am no expert in either international or comparative law, and I know almost nothing about the law of Belgium or France.  Second, in the interest of full disclosure, I was lead counsel (along with Brad Phillips from Munger, Tolles, and Olson in Los Angeles) in the nationwide class action challenging the government&#39;s forcible drugging policy in <u>Diouf v. Chertoff</u>.  We settled that case after the government agreed to change its policy to never forcibly drug someone for deportation purposes without first obtaining an order from a federal court authorizing the drugging.<br /><br />That being said, I&#39;m not at all surprised that <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/us-immigration-agents-face-problems.php">other countries objected to our government&#39;s shocking practice </a>of forcibly injecting people with powerful antipsychotic drugs in order to deport them.  Article 1 of the <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cat.html">Convention Against Torture</a> explicitly defines torture to include &quot;severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental,&quot; and our own legislation implementing the Convention Against Torture defines torture to include &quot;the administration or application, or threatened administration or application, of mind-altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or the personality.&quot;  <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00002340----000-.html"><strong>18 U.S.C. 2340</strong></a>.  (In fact, under federal law, committing such acts outside of the United States is a very serious crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison.  <strong><a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00002340----000-.html">18 USC 2340A</a></strong>). <br /><br />I would like to know whether the officials in Belgium, France, or any other country ever put their objections to our practice in writing, but because the federal government has provided almost no documents in response to the ACLU&#39;s FOIA request on the subject, I can only speculate as to whether the officials objected to the practice because they thought it was torture. <br /> <br />As for our suit, we focused our objection to the policy on the Due Process Clause because it was such an obvious violation under the controlling cases.  As we explained in our preliminary injunction papers, it&#39;s crystal clear that the government cannot give antipsychotic drugs to people who are not mentally ill under <a href="http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/legal/l1990/Harper.htm"><u>Washington v. Harper</a></u>, <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/504/127/case.html"><u>Riggins v. Nevada</a></u>, <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/02pdf/02-5664.pdf"><u>Sell v. United States</a></u>, and every circuit that has addressed those Supreme Court cases.  I think it was very telling that the government chose to settle rather than attempting to defend the legality of its practice.  After the District Court rejected the government&#39;s motion to dismiss on jurisdictional grounds, the government changed the policy.           <br /> <br />It&#39;s also important to note that although the government uses the term &quot;sedation&quot; to describe the government practice, in fact the government was not using just sedatives, but also a powerful antipsychotic drug known as haldol (the technical name is haloperidol).  As several prominent psychiatrists (including our expert Dr. Mark Mills, whom the government had used as an expert in several other cases) have noted, antipsychotics are far more dangerous and profoundly disturbing when given to sane people than are sedatives.  That is why we try to refer to the practice as &quot;forcible drugging&quot; rather than &quot;forcible sedation.&quot;<br />

Rey</a></u> (incorrectly titled <u>CBD v. Rey</u>) challenges the 2004 Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment (also known as the &quot;2004 Framework&quot;), which establishes management direction for all 11 national forests in the Sierra Nevada.  The 2004 Framework replaced the original &quot;2001 Framework,&quot; which set forth a balanced approach for conserving species and reducing the risk of wildfire and was widely regarded as the new gold standard for ecosystem-based forest management.  The 2004 Framework abandoned the 2001 Framework&#39;s carefully crafted standards, and called for a drastic increase in logging of large, fire-resilient trees throughout the Sierra.<br /><br />When it adopted the 2004 Framework, the Forest Service acknowledged that logging large trees does not reduce the risk of wildfire, but it claimed that such logging was necessary to finance the removal of smaller trees and brush.  Quite literally, the 2004 Framework lost sight of the forest for the trees.  Our clients argued, and the Ninth Circuit agreed, that the Forest Service&#39;s failure to consider any alternative options for financing fuel reduction activities violated the <a href="http://www.nepa.gov/nepa/regs/nepa/nepaeqia.htm">National Environmental Policy Act</a>.  Accordingly, the Ninth Circuit enjoined the Forest Service from carrying out aspects of three logging projects - totaling 12,000 acres - in the northern Sierra Nevada that implement the 2004 Framework and would be inconsistent with the 2001 Framework.<br /><br />In our view, the Ninth Circuit&#39;s repudiation of the 2004 Framework is an important legal victory that should shift the Forest Service&#39;s attention away from the last big trees in the backcountry and back to the important fuel reduction activities that are needed around Sierra communities.&quot;<br />

		<title>Afghanistan: weak criminal justice system needs support</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/about_us/staff/muhammedAlly_s.htm"><strong>Sahr MuhammedAlly</strong></a> [Senior Associate,<a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/">Human Rights First</a>, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/us_law.asp">Law &amp; Security Program</a>]: &quot;The recent events about a <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/afghan-detainees-in-kandahar-end-hunger.php">week-long hunger strike</a>[JURIST report, <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/05/11/news/Afghan-Hunger-Strike.php">AP</a>] by hundreds of jailed men in Kandahar should be of concern to the international community. Their complaints are about unfair trials, indefinite detention, and lack of counsel.<br /><br />The Afghan criminal justice system needs help. After thirty years of conflict, the formal Afghan justice sector is weak and faces serious difficulties including, lack of professional capacity and resources for judges, lawyers, police and prison officers; physical infrastructure devastated by years of war; and institutionalized corruption. According to the 2007 United Nations Human Development Report little more than half of the judges in Afghanistan have the relevant formal higher education and have completed the requisite one-year period of judicial training. The remaining judges are graduates of madrassas or faculties other than law, with 20 percent having no university education at all. In addition, 36 percent of judges have no access to statutes, 54 percent have no access to legal textbooks, and 82 percent have no access to decisions of the Afghan Supreme Court [<a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/reports/nationalreports/asiathepacific/afghanistan/">UNDP</a> report].<br /><br />Afghan criminal procedure law does on its face meet international fair trial standards, but the problem lies in its application. For instance, the law allows pre-trial detention without charge up to one month. The 2004 Interim Criminal Procedure Code states that a detainee upon arrest must be charged within 72 hours and that within fifteen days of the arrest, the prosecutor must write up an indictment. An extension for detention may be granted for an additional 15 days. Defense lawyers in Afghanistan, however, have told Human Rights First that &quot;in reality these timelines are not followed,&quot; and further that there is no recourse for persons who are in detention for violation of the pre-trial detention period.<br /><br />Another common problem in criminal trials is the use of coerced evidence. Confessions are barred under Afghan law unless conducted before a judge. Yet, the reliance of confessions derived largely as a result of ill-treatment is common practice. Similarly, the right to counsel and legal aid for indigent defendants is provided for in the law but there are very few defense lawyers in Afghanistan. Thus many defendants are tried without counsel. Many trials are also conducted without any prosecution witnesses, thereby denying a defendant the right to confrontation [<a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/reports/arb-just/arb-just.asp">Human Rights First</a> report]. <br /><br />Modest progress in justice sector development has been made since the December 2001 Bonn Agreement. Donor governments have been involved in professional training and capacity building programs, the distribution of legal textbooks and materials, rebuilding of courts and prisons, and the adoption of new laws. Experts on rule of law reform in Afghanistan, however, say that there is a lack of strategic vision for rebuilding the justice system and a lack of effective coordination among donors and Afghan justice institutions, which has complicated reform efforts. But the responsibility also lies with the Afghans. Afghan officials must be committed to be bound by the rule of law otherwise reform efforts will likely fail.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.cfr.org/bios/13364/ashley_deeks.html"><strong>Ashley Deeks</strong></a> [International Affairs Fellow, <a href="http://www.cfr.org/">Council on Foreign Relations</a>, and Visiting Fellow, <a href="http://www.csis.org/">Center for Strategic and International Studies</a>]: &quot;Last week the Department of Defense confirmed that Abdullah Saleh Ali al Ajmi, <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/guantanamo-ex-detainee-was-iraq-suicide.php">a former Guantanamo detainee</a>, was one of the people responsible for three suicide bombings in Mosul in April, which reportedly killed seven members of the Iraqi security forces. While this event is, for several reasons, unlikely to cause significant changes to the U.S. government&#39;s policies on transferring detainees out of Guantanamo, it may prompt debate about how best to address the real risks involved in those decisions.<br /><br />The al-Ajmi case highlights just how tightly the U.S. government is wedged between a rock and a hard place when it comes to closing Guantanamo, whether one believes that the U.S. government finds itself in this situation for the right reasons or the wrong ones. On the one hand, the government faces huge pressure not to detain people at Guantanamo indefinitely; on the other, it must grapple with proven concerns about releasing people who will take up arms and possibly injure U.S. and allied forces and innocent civilians. The government must look for a balance that&#39;s neither too restrictive nor too lenient -- an exercise that will be impossible to get right every time.<br /><br />Al Ajmi&#39;s decision to become a suicide bomber in Iraq is an unfortunate illustration of how hard it is to assess the risk that someone poses if released from Guantanamo. Consider the facts that were before the government when it weighed al Ajmi&#39;s transfer: al Ajmi, a Kuwaiti citizen who admitted that he fought with the Taliban in Afghanistan for at least eight months, seemed to be an average Taliban foot soldier (albeit a foreign fighter). Further, Kuwaitis are not known for undertaking suicide bombings. While it&#39;s not clear what kind of &quot;security assurances&quot; the government of Kuwait gave the United States about steps Kuwait might take to ensure that it would mitigate any remaining threat posed by al Ajmi, presumably the Kuwaitis offered some comfort. Whatever the Kuwaitis may have said, it either proved insufficient or they didn&#39;t see their assurances through. The Kuwaiti government was unable to convict al Ajmi on charges of being a member of and raising money for al Qaeda; Kuwait then issued him a passport, facilitating his ability to travel to Syria and onward to Mosul.<br /><br />The al Ajmi bombing raises the question of whether the U.S. government should begin to pursue two avenues more aggressively. First, if it is not doing so already, the government might start to follow up systematically with the countries that have given it security assurances related to the detainees the United States transfers from Guantanamo. Just as the United States monitors certain promises by foreign governments to treat transferred detainees humanely, the U.S. government should be in close contact with receiving governments to determine if the latter know where the ex-detainees are and what they are doing. The United States would need to be careful not to be seen as urging foreign governments to take steps that are inconsistent with human rights or the rule of law, or to suggest that the former detainees be held at the behest of the United States. <br /><br />Second, the United States might increase its efforts to find ways to replicate the success of programs such as the Saudi government&#39;s program to de-radicalize (or disengage) and rehabilitate terror suspects. This program, like others in Egypt, Indonesia, and even Iraq, is in its early stages but seems to have had some successes. The U.S. government might explore whether there are ways to encourage other states receiving Guantanamo detainees to pursue similar paths, or even whether some elements of those programs could be replicated at Guantanamo itself. Some factors that have made the Saudi program a success will not be easy to replicate, but it is worth considering whether certain parts of it can be replicated elsewhere.<br /><br />Aside from the possible changes in approach discussed above, it seems unlikely that the al Ajmi case will have a drastic impact on U.S. decision-making on transferring other detainees from Guantanamo. In particular, it seems unlikely that the U.S. government will reconsider its charging decisions in military commissions and try to prosecute a greater number of people. It will be hard enough for the government to try the forty to eighty detainees currently designated for the commissions, given the myriad problems commissions have faced; it therefore seems unlikely that the United States will try to add to the charging pool people against whom it will be even more difficult to make a case. The U.S. government could go back through its files on al Ajmi to see if it missed something in approving his transfer, but such a step is unlikely to be of much help, given how different each transfer case is. Considering that the United States has continued to conduct transfers despite learning of other detainees who engaged in hostilities after being held at Guantanamo, it is doubtful that al Ajmi&#39;s case will prompt the government to reduce significantly its tolerance for risk when weighing whether to transfer or release people. (The government may be more reluctant to transfer detainees to Kuwait, though.)<br /><br />Will acts like al Ajmi&#39;s &#8212; and similar acts committed by others released from Guantanamo &#8212; deter people (including all three presidential candidates) from continuing to call for Guantanamo&#39;s close? Almost certainly not. One of the arguments offered by those who seek to close Guantanamo and transfer, release, or prosecute all of the detainees is that there are hundreds or thousands of people free in the world right now who wish to do the United States grievous harm. According to this argument, if al Ajmi hadn&#39;t been one of the Mosul bombers, someone else would have taken his place &#8212; and the symbolism of Guantanamo makes it more likely that someone else would be willing to do so. Whether or not that&#39;s true, al Ajmi&#39;s case -- and others like it -- illustrate in sharp relief that a decision to close Guantanamo and transfer or release those detainees the United States cannot prosecute will not be without costs.<br /><br /><em>The views expressed herein are the author&#39;s alone, and not those of the U.S. Department of State or the U.S. Government</em>.&quot;<br />

		<title>Do Funeral Protests Invade Mourners&#039; Privacy?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.missouri.edu/faculty/wellsc.html">Christina Wells</a> of the University of Missouri School of Law says that to restrict peaceful protests aimed at disseminating a message simply because we find that message offensive is inconsistent with common sense notions of privacy and the spirit of the First Amendment....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/christinawells.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>S</strong></font>ince 2006 the Reverend Fred Phelps and the Westboro Baptist Church have gained notoriety for their controversial protests at funerals of soldiers killed in the Iraq and Afghan wars.  Members of the church typically gather at such funerals chanting and displaying signs with slogans such as "God Hates You," "You're Going to Hell," "Semper Fi Fags" and "Thank God for Dead Soldiers."  According to church members, they protest at such funerals to disseminate their message that soldiers' deaths are a result of this country's willingness to embrace homosexuality.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, many people are outraged at the protestors' behavior, which they perceive as abhorrent and disrespectful of mourners during an especially vulnerable time.  Forty states have enacted laws restricting protests near funerals in order to protect the privacy of grieving friends and family.  At least one family has sued Phelps and other church members, claiming that protests at their son's funeral amounted to invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  A federal court recently upheld a multi-million dollar jury verdict in that case.  (<em>Snyder v. Phelps</em>, 533 F. Supp. 2d 567 (D. Md. 2008).<br /><br />These statutes and the individual invasion of privacy lawsuit raise an important question for free speech law &#8212; when do protestors invade the privacy of those attending a funeral?  This issue is of no small consequence for free expression.  Supreme Court precedents recognize privacy as an important interest supporting restrictions of speech in some instances but it is not clear what the term "privacy" means in the context of funeral protests or whether funeral protests invade mourners' privacy in any sense recognized by tort or free speech law.<br /><br />The argument that funeral protests invade mourners' privacy assumes that such protests are especially unwanted and invasive intrusions into mourners' grief.  Certainly, one can envision a number of scenarios in which protests would constitute such an intrusion &#8212; i.e., noisy and distracting protests near a funeral ceremony, persons who peacefully protest while actually attending a funeral ceremony, or protests that amount to harassment of mourners as they enter and leave funerals.  All such scenarios involve protestors who invade a relative zone of seclusion created by mourners in order to grieve with family and friends.  There is little argument that protestors' free speech rights outweigh mourners' privacy rights in such situations.<br /><br />Many funeral protests, however, do not involve such scenarios.  Yet government officials and individual families attempt to restrict them in the name of privacy nonetheless.  Such attempts reveal how nebulous the notion of "invasion of privacy" is and reflect the dangers of restricting expression based on such an amorphous interest.<br />  <br />In <em>Snyder v. Phelps</em>, for example, Matthew Snyder's father sued Phelps and other church members for invasion of privacy based upon their protests outside of Snyder's funeral.  Although the protestors held signs similar to those described above, they complied with all local laws and police orders and remained a certain distance from the funeral.  Nevertheless, Snyder sued for invasion of privacy because he viewed footage of the protests at his son's funeral on television later that day.  The federal court held that a reasonable jury could find that the protestors intruded upon Snyder's privacy because when he "turned on the television to see if there was footage of his son's funeral, he did not 'choose' to see close-ups of the defendants' signs and interviews with Phelps."<br /><br />The court's willingness to uphold the invasion of privacy verdict in Snyder ignores the law and erodes our right to free expression.  The invasion of privacy tort generally requires an intrusion into something, such as a home or other building, or interference with a zone of seclusion that an individual or group has created while in public, such as a funeral ceremony.  But Snyder's father did not allege interference with such a zone of privacy.  Rather, he alleged that his privacy was invaded by viewing footage of the funeral at some distance from it and well after the fact. <br /> <br />Such a claim does not involve speech that intrudes upon or substantially interferes with a secluded event. Rather it involves speech that offends the listener because of its outrageous content.  While Snyder's father has every reason to be outraged at the protestors' behavior, making their message actionable simply because it is offensive flies in the face of decades of free speech law, which protects speech that is "provocative and challenging," "induces conditions of unrest," and "even stirs people to anger."  (<em>Terminiello v. Chicago</em>, 337 U.S. 1 (1949)).<br /><br />Criminal statutes that restrict peaceful protests within certain distances and times of funeral ceremonies (usually 500 feet and an hour before and after) pose similar problems for free expression.  It is reasonable to restrict obstructive, disruptive and harassing protests at or near funeral ceremonies.  Statutes restricting peaceful protests, however, do not aim at preventing disruption.  Their sheer breadth precludes an argument that they aim only at speech that intrudes into a secluded space.  Rather, many statutes prohibit even the most peaceful of protests that occur near funerals.  Accordingly, such statutes protect mourners not from the intrusiveness of such protests but, rather, from the offensive of such protests.  Although free speech law protects "captive audiences" from certain kinds of unwanted speech, the Supreme Court has not recognized the right of captive audiences to be free from offensive messages when in public spaces.  To do so, it has noted "would effectively empower a majority to silence dissidents simply as a matter of personal predilections."  (<em>Cohen v. California</em>, 403 U.S. 15 (1971))<br /><br />It would be a mistake for courts to extend the captive audience doctrine to allow broad restrictions of peaceful funeral protests.  Our legitimate outrage at the behavior of the Westboro Baptist Church should not blind us to the state of the law.  There are many instances in which disruptive and harassing protests can be regulated.  Some of the Westboro Baptist Church's actions may fall within such regulations.  But to restrict peaceful protests aimed at disseminating a message simply because we find that message offensive is inconsistent with common sense notions of privacy and the spirit of the First Amendment.<br /><br /><br /><em>Christina Wells is the Enoch H.

		<title>The Role and Rule of Law in Iraq: An Insider&#039;s Perspective</title>

In it, I describe at some length a country in disintegration in every possible meaning of that word: physical, mental, logistical, spiritual - and, most importantly for purposes of this op-ed, legal. <br /><br />The notion of legal disintegration perhaps does not earn the attention is deserves among us lawyers, who often tend to emphasize legal codes as the only, or at least the premier, form of binding order in society. Two recent events, both of which call upon previous experiences in Iraq chronicled in my memoir, remind me of this. The first was a report I read in the New York Times, confirming something I had heard directly from my own friends in Basra, that the veil was being more stringently enforced by the Mahdi Army militia over the past several months, at least until recently. One sign reportedly read as follows:<blockquote><em>We warn girls not to put on makeup and to wear scarves. Anyone who does not follow these orders will be killed.</em></blockquote> As I noticed during my time in Basra, and as I reported in my book, it was exceedingly rare to find an unveiled woman in Basra, and posters of senior Muslim clerics, from Muqtada al-Sadr to America's one time nemesis, Ayatollah Khomeini, adorned the gates of the state university. None of this appears in the legal codes, neither Khomeini's theories of juristic rule nor any legal requirement of veiling will be found in any state text, and yet I fear for the woman who might dare to use this as her pretext for violating these rules, given the threatened punishment. <br /><br />As a result, I tend to take with a fair dose of skepticism, at least in the context of Iraq, Noah Feldman's recent claim in a piece in the <em>New York Times</em> Magazine that Islamists no longer seek to impose the veil through law, but rather only view it as a desirable social norm. I think a fair number of Iraqi Islamists might well regard that statement puzzlingly, as offering an insufficient set of alternatives. That is, there are legal requirements (for example, registering a company under the Company Law), there are desirable social norms (for example, giving money to the needy when encountering them on the street) and then there are norms that are expected to be entirely binding even if not strictly speaking a product of state law. The veil falls firmly into this category for Iraq's Islamists, as, for example, female virginity prior to marriage falls for most Iraqis. Read for as long as you like, and you will find nothing in the Iraqi codes that prohibits a woman from engaging in sexual intercourse prior to marriage. The shari'a's strict rules respecting pre- and extra-marital sexual activity are absent. Yet, as CNN tragically showed nearly a year ago, a non-Muslim woman can in Iraq be publicly on video and in full view of police officers stoned by her non-Muslim clan for having a clandestine relationship with a Muslim man she wished to marry, without proof or even allegation of sexual intercourse. The Islamist push is merely to place the veil, currently a matter of some debate within Iraq, into the same category as premarital sexual activity, wherein to publicly breach the requirement, or even come close, would be, for any variety of reasons having nothing to do with legal requirements, absolutely unthinkable.<br /><br />The second event that transpired recently related to a request I received for the advice of local Iraqi counsel, not an uncommon request these past few years. Yet this person wanted to know, from a practitioner's perspective, how Iraqi judges viewed personal injury cases, which was not something I had been asked about before. While the written law on the matter is fairly clear, and the standard of negligence entirely obvious from reading the Code and its commentaries, I could find no practitioners who could provide an insider's perspective. Between my wife, an Iraqi lawyer herself, and I, we called dozens of attorneys, and always received the same reply&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;in Iraq, such cases are very rare. This again was entirely consistent with my time in Iraq, where disputes involving car accidents, for example, were handled through clan mediation, and, in a particularly harrowing story reported in my book, encounters with police officers concerning regulatory matters are best handled with a bribe. The courts simply had almost no role to play in any of these matters. As a result, I found nobody who could provide the information I sought. I still could not say how, in practice as opposed to in theory, a personal injury case is handled in Iraq because neither I, nor the dozens of attorneys I know, has seen one.<br /><br />To be sure, I do not mean to suggest that law is entirely irrelevant, in Iraq or in any other (perhaps more stable) state where the shari'a might also serve to establish order in a non-legal capacity. Iraq has a long and proud legal tradition, and certainly boasts a large number of legal professionals who take their work very seriously and do it well. But at the same time, as my time in Iraq and as subsequent events have shown, there is much by way of rules, impediments and obligations, particularly though certainly not exclusively in these difficult times, that lies beyond the bounds of the law for so many of Iraq's citizens. That, too, deserves our attention. <br /><br /><br /><em>Haider Ala Hamoudi is a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist Taimur Malik, Executive Director of Pakistan&#39;s <a href="http://www.rsilpak.org/index.aspx">Research Society of International Law</a> (RSIL) think-tank and a High Court Advocate, says the country&#39;s lawyers and politicians must put aside differences and short-term concerns and come together if Pakistan is to achieve an independent judiciary...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/taimurmalik.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>n independent judiciary is essential for the development of a free, fair and equitable social system. The move by Pakistani President and then Army Chief General Pervez Musharraf to suspend the Chief Justice of Pakistan on 9th March 2007 was considered as an assault on the institution of the judiciary in Pakistan by lawyers, civil society and ordinary citizens alike. The ensuing popular movement for his reinstatement was seen by many as the ultimate opportunity for the justice-starved people of Pakistan to establish a truly independent judiciary and achieve separation of powers in the country. <br /><br />The movement secured Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry's return as the Chief Justice, but just as the nation was beginning to see hope for a strong judiciary, increasing judicial review of administrative actions by the Supreme Court resulted in the imposition of emergency in the Pakistan on 3rd November 2007 and the arbitrary removal of the majority of the country&#39;s superior court judges. This led to what Anne-Marie Slaughter has called Pakistan's 'black revolution' led by the country's lawyers. The results of the 18th February 2008 general election were considered a referendum against the former ruling party and a popular vote for the immediate restoration of the deposed judges.<br /><br />But the people of Pakistan are now not so hopeful anymore about the restoration of judges and attainment of an independent judiciary in the near future. The voluntary deadline of 12 May given by the political leadership of the country for the restoration of the ousted judges passed by without the realization of any of the promises and led to the premature departure of the PML (N), the second largest political party, from the newly formed coalition government.<br /><br />The political pundits are predicting fresh elections within one year while government-backed efforts are underway to convince some of the deposed judges to take oath as superior court judges and forget about the deposed Chief Justice. A number of senior judges in Punjab have already gone public with their refusal to serve under these conditions and insist that no selective restoration will be acceptable to them. The President of the Supreme Court Bar Association and leaders of many political parties including the PML (N) also want complete restoration but are not taking any immediate steps to start street protests as yet.<br /><br />Pakistan&#39;s bar councils also appear unwilling to take the streets right away in protest against the elected political government. The reason may partly be attributed to the fact that many of the bar council representatives are members of the ruling PPP and don't want to upset their political leadership unless overwhelmed by peer pressure from within the legal community.<br /><br />Some factions of the legal fraternity think that 20th July 2007 was the high point of the lawyer's movement when the apex court reinstated the Chief Justice and that he and his colleagues should have gone easy on the government institutions for some time and availed themselves of an opportunity to strengthen the judiciary. The majority still disagrees and believes that the courts are the only recourse available to ordinary citizens against state excesses and that therefore the Chief Justice was right in taking up thousands of <em>suo moto</em> and public interest litigation matters.<br /><br />There are nonetheless other pressing reasons for a slowdown in the lawyer's movement and these concern not the politics of the country but the economic implications which follow from any boycott of the courts and the present judges. <br /><br />The legal profession in Pakistan has indeed produced some of the country's most famous and richest individuals; nevertheless for most lawyers it remains a difficult profession with economic unpredictability a constant worry. The majority of the lawyers in Pakistan are self-employed and therefore boycott of the courts entails immediate loss of income and clientele, something only a few can afford to sustain for any long period of time. The sacrifices made by the majority of Pakistani lawyers and ordinary litigants during the last fourteen months are a testament to the courage, strength and perseverance of the country's lawyers, who have become the torch-bearers of an unusual revolution for the 160 million people of Pakistan. <br /><br />The fight for an independent judiciary at a time when the country is passing through wheat and electricity crises is an indication of the increasing awareness, maturity and development of a nation repeatedly ignored and deceived by its rulers in the past. In order to compel the present government to restore the judiciary to its 2nd November status, the lawyer's movement will need to be backed by the political forces and civil society in greater numbers. 90,000-odd lawyers can't be expected to continue to fight the battle for the future of the entire nation on their own. The PPP claims that the government is working on a constitutional package for the judiciary. But it needs to realize that the restoration of all deposed judges has to be the first and essential step towards strengthening the judiciary as an institution. <br /><br />The people also want a pro-poor budget next month, better wages and healthcare, uninterrupted electricity supply and availability of essential food commodities. They also want answers to recent unilateral breaches of Pakistan's territorial sovereignty by the world's superpower, resulting in the deaths of many in the tribal region. But they realize that for all this to be guaranteed, an independent and proactive judiciary is equally important.<br /><br />How can the nation expect justice from the present judges, especially in matters against government departments, when the judiciary has no security of tenure and continues to serve at the 'pleasure' of the ruler(s)? How can the nation expect judges, unless the deposed judges are restored with full honour and dignity, to look away from the doctrine of necessity and invalidate any future usurpation of power by a military chief?<br /><br />The next few weeks are crucial for Pakistan and its future. The lawyers must go on against all odds and the politicians must sacrifice short-term gains to rally for those judges who took a stand for Pakistan, hoping to be supported and vindicated by the nation.<br /><br /><br /><em>Taimur Malik is Executive Director of the Research Society of International Law (RSIL) Pakistan, a barrister of Lincoln&#39;s Inn (UK), and a High Court Advocate.

		<title>UKRAINE: Lax Enforcement of Disability Laws</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Carrie Cecil, Pitt Law &#39;10, files from <strong>Kiev</strong>:<br /><br />I&#39;ve been in Kiev for a little over a week, and every day something new in the landscape amuses or intrigues me, ranging from the incredible amount of cranes all over the city due to the lack of effective zoning to the incredibly long escalators rising out of the subway stations that also function as bomb shelters.<br /><br />Barrier-free accessibility for disabled persons has also piqued my interest. <br /><br />In the United States, there are a large variety of laws and regulations mandating accessibility for disabled persons. These regulations and laws mandate tiny details such as the height of sinks in public restrooms or the angle at which a ramp must be constructed to allow access into buildings. When I arrived in Kiev, I quickly realized that Ukrainians in wheelchairs lack access to much of the transport system and many buildings. In addition, many of the sidewalks lack ramps for easy entry and exit and often require the use of steps to cross under major intersections.  The terrain is often a combination of dilapidated concrete and dirt further acting as a barrier to movement around the city. There are some concrete rails constructed over some stairways leading into buildings and the subway stations, but these are constructed for mothers pushing baby carriages rather than those in wheelchairs. To be able to move around the city, disabled persons are dependent on family members or must call for public transport to pick them up at least 24 hours before the trip.<br /> <br />It&#39;s not that regulations promoting barrier-free access don&#39;t exist. They do. The problem is the result of a failure to enforce existing laws and regulations. There are no incentives for the construction business to provide barrier-free access and no penalties for failing to do so. Further, there continues to be a social stigma attached to disabled persons living in the Ukraine because in the former Soviet Union people with disabilities were mostly hidden from public view. Today, disabled persons are guaranteed equal rights by the Ukrainian Constitution and many receive meager government pensions. The problem is that most of the effective legislation regarding disabled persons in the Ukraine has to do with the awarding of pensions. These pensions are not enough to survive on and are awarded based on a classification system used in the former Soviet Union. The government has also created regulations promoting the employment of disabled persons, but companies avoid the regulations by paying them half of their salary to stay home instead of actually allowing them to work. The combination of barriers in the landscape and an inability to earn a living wage result in a seeming continuation of the Soviet system with disabled persons dependent on family members to care for them and still largely hidden from public view.<br />

		<title>GREECE: Same-sex Marriage</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elisa Mari, Pitt Law &#39;10, files from <strong>Athens</strong>:<br /><br />Tuesday morning at 7:30 am, Tasos Aliferis, the Mayor of Tilos - a small Greek island in the eastern Aegean - formally married two homosexual couples. The first couple to get married at dawn were gay, the second couple was lesbian. The whole ceremony happened without any publicity or debate preceding the event, but now all of Greece is debating the social and legal issues surrounding the marriages. <br /><br />The Greek Ministry of Justice was quick to condemn the marriages as legally baseless. Many lawyers and lay people view the marriages as a sham and say that the Mayor and the couples who got married were just playing theater. <br /><br />The public prosecutor of the Areos Pagos, the Supreme Court of Greece, has ordered the Mayor not to officially register the marriage certificates with the competent authority, stating that there is no legal base to support same-sex marriage. In addition, the Minister of Justice has said as far as the State is concerned, attempts at civil (i.e. non-religious) marriages between homosexuals are illegal and these specific &quot;marriages&quot; have no valid base in Greek law. <br /><br />On Wednesday, the Mayor was called to give an account before the court of Rhodes for his actions and is now facing charges for failure to perform his duty as mayor (at the hearing on Wednesday, the court decided not to hear the Mayor&#39;s case at that moment, and kept him waiting as they are still reviewing his case). As the Mayor of Athens commented, it is not a mayor&#39;s role to make law, or state what the law is - his role is simply to enforce the existing law. But the Mayor of Tilos has refused to take back the marriage certificates, stating that by performing the wedding ceremonies, he was merely upholding the law, the Greek Constitution as well as the Charter of the UN. <br /><br />The Greek Constitution itself defines marriage to be between two individuals, and makes no specification that the union requires a man and a woman to be legal. Greek family law, which is similarly codified, also fails to mention same-sex marriage while prohibiting marriages between individuals of vertical relationship, i.e. direct descendants, and horizontal relation, i.e. siblings and cousins up to the fourth degree. <br /><br />Lawyers debating the issue in the newspapers and on television are making the argument that the marriages are groundless because even if the Constitution and the Civil Code do not specifically prohibit same-sex marriage, at the time the law were written as well as today, it is generally understood in society that by definition marriage is obviously only for a man and a woman. Therefore the fact that there is no specific prohibition of homosexual marriage does not make that legal. <br /><br />Those in favor of same-sex marriage view these marriages - legal or illegal as still to be determined - as a big step for gay and lesbian rights in Greece. Those opposed are confident that these marriages will be declared illegal and seen as isolated events in which the Mayor of Tilos overstepped his authority. In the end, it will be up to the courts to decide. And this is only the beginning of the issue. The next big question on everyone&#39;s mind is if homosexual couples are given the right to marry, will they also have the right to adopt children?<br /><br />As for the Greek lawyers that I work with, the general consensus is that there doesn&#39;t seem to be any legal barrier in the Constitution or the Civil Code that would prohibit same-sex marriage in Greece. In addition, as they jokingly add, they are in favor of same-sex marriage if for no other reason than more marriages means an increase in inheritance issues and an eventual increase in divorces, which after all is good for business!<br />

		<title>UKRAINE: Land Use Deregulation in Kiev</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aleksandra (Sasha) Williams, Pitt Law &#39;10, files from <strong>Kiev</strong>:<br /><br />The last five years have dramatically changed the appearance of Kiev, the fabled &quot;Cradle of the Slavs&quot;.  Always admired for its green parks and gardens, its sensible city structure, and its historical sites preservation efforts, the city has now joined the ranks of randomly designed post-Soviet urban nightmares.  In part this is because the real estate market structure emerged practically overnight, amidst the remnants of the centralized Soviet land use regulations, in a place lacking any civic organizations, administrative agencies, independent objective media, or, as one activist put it, &quot;the necessary evil of multitude of lawyers who can tie up money interests in miles of red tape.&quot;  Therefore, as soon as the old government system collapsed and the new money arrived, Kiev responded with a grotesque building boom. <br /><br />Soviet land use and development laws were based on the premise that land was owned by the government.  After the demise of the Soviet Union, Ukraine inherited a few outdated regulations dealing mainly with agricultural and non-agricultural use distinctions.  Initially, growth and development were not at the top of the Ukrainian legislative priority list.  For example, the &quot;Law for Property Rights Classification, Recording and Registration&quot; was not passed until 2004.  Related legislature generally encouraged unrestricted development: there were no uniform city planning and construction codes until 2005 and real estate sale proceeds were not taxed as personal income until 2007.  Even when the planning code was adopted in 2005, it was enacted as a &quot;model code&quot; only, and compliance was left up to the developers.  Zoning regulations remained focused on the agricultural and non-agricultural use.  <br /><br />As a result, high-rise office buildings sprung up in low-slung quiet residential neighborhoods and park zones, and new residential buildings were constructed without any regard to the existing infrastructure.  One of the examples of such chaos is the fate of a piece of land located near the downtown area.  Initially the land belonged to the state, but was used by a hospital.  Before the hospital was able to officially claim and register the land, the lot was given to the Orthodox Church by a politician, in fulfillment of his campaign promise to improve &quot;morality and piety of the nation.&quot;  Again, ownership was never recorded, but a church was built.  It is unclear whether morality and piety were improved, but it is certain that the price of land in Kiev now exceeds $100,000.00 dollars per &quot;sotka&quot; (100 square meters).  Therefore, the current administration plans to level the church and sell the land to a developer who proposed to use the site for an office building.           <br /><br />Public protests caused by similar situations encouraged the local and national government to at least take a look at the building boom.  In 2006, the Kiev City Administration imposed an 18 month freeze on new development sites and a temporary moratorium on high rise construction.  At the same time Ministry of Construction, Architecture and Housing Economy relaxed its remodeling requirements to encourage reconstruction of already existing buildings.  However, in practice, even these regulations are frequently skirted or disregarded.  A well-connected developer can usually make a &quot;mutually beneficial&quot; deal with the administration, and, if there is no significant public opposition, the development goes forward.  Therefore, until some substantial and enforceable law is implemented, Kiev might as well borrow West Virginia&#39;s &quot;Open for Business&quot; sign.<br />

		<title>UKRAINE: Electing a Mayor in Kiev</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aleksandra (Sasha) Williams, Pitt Law &#39;10, files from <strong>Kiev</strong>:<br /><br />Until yesterday any American voter disgruntled by the current presidential election process could find comfort in realizing that at least there are several candidates to pick from.  For example, compared to Russian presidential elections, where the only plausible candidate was heavily endorsed by former President Vladimir Putin, American plurality appears very reasonable.  Yesterday Ukraine added another assurance that having only two candidates for one nomination is really not that bad: the Kiev mayoral ballot had over 70 names.  Moreover, a lot of the candidates ran in the election together with their blocs or political affiliates.<br /><br />On Sunday, May 25, 2008, residents of Kiev voted for the Kiev Mayor and members of the Kiev Sovet (the municipal decision-making committee).  The election was held on the same day as the &quot;City Holiday&quot; and several high school graduation parties.  All of these events usually involve general excitement, public performers, crowded streets and increased alcohol consumption, so it was hard to determine what exactly was being celebrated at any given moment.   Several Police and Special Forces units patrolled the city, but no substantial problems were reported.  The day concluded with a magnificent fireworks display over the Dnieper River.<br /><br />The official results of the mayoral elections will probably come out no earlier than May 30, 2008.  However, according to the exit polls and several preliminary  stimates reported by various local news agencies, Leonid Chernovetskyi will probably keep his job as the Kiev Mayor.  So far he is said to have about 37% of the total vote, while his closest opponents Aleksandr Turchinov and Vitaliy Klichko gathered 17% and 18% respectively.  The Kiev Sovet election showed similar preliminary results, but with a smaller gap between the Chernovetskyi bloc (29%) and its closest opponent (Julia Timoshenko bloc - 23%).  The rest of the candidates barely justified printing costs for their campaign ads which ranged from austere soviet-style directives for building a better future to silly random promises of world peace, happiness, prosperity and cheap diapers.<br /><br />For example the current prime-minister Julia Timoshenko (nicknamed by some as &quot;the woman with a braid&quot;, which due to peculiarities of the Russian and Ukrainian languages also means &quot;grim reaper&quot;) endorsed Turchinov by reminding voters that she worked very hard to get him on the ballot and urging them not to let her down. Another candidate, Nikolaj Katerinchuk, started his campaign on March 8, the International Women&#39;s Day, by announcing that Kiev women are the best in the world. He then posted blue signs with a single word &quot;ashamed&quot; everywhere and later replaced them with similar ones stating &quot;you will not be ashamed of your Mayor.&quot;  So far it appears that about 3% of the voters actually bought it.  Many promised better care for the elderly, rosy future for the children, more women in the parliament and less traffic jams, but did not otherwise substantiate their pledges.   Vasily Gorbal undoubtedly took the pinnacle of absurdity award by releasing ads where he silently parodied facial expressions of his opponents and ran around Kiev with a &quot;Free Hugs&quot; sign.  The incumbent Mayor, Leonid Chernovetskyi, (nicknamed by some as &quot;Lenia-Cosmos&quot; or &quot;the mayor of Martians&quot;) simply promised more buses, better hospitals and cheaper bread.  This may explain his success among Kiev citizens tired of the prevalent political idiocy.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elisa Mari, Pitt Law &#39;10, files from <strong>Athens</strong>:<br /><br />A huge public outcry erupted in Greece in March when NATO expanded its membership, the reason being that the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) wanted to join the alliance under the name of &quot;Macedonia&quot;. <br /><br />For nearly all the existing NATO members this is not a big deal. The United States, for example already officially recognizes the country as &quot;Macedonia&quot;. Greece, on the other hand, which refers to the country by the name of its capital Skopje, used its veto power to block FYROM&#39;s entrance under the name of Macedonia. Greece is afraid that FYROM will use the historic name of &quot;Macedonia&quot; to try to expand its territory, claiming the regions of Northern Greece that also are known by the name Macedonia. <br /><br />This is a very sensitive issue for the Greeks, and they are not completely paranoid in their fear. Nationalist movements in FYROM have called for an expansion of the territory and have even claimed the Greek city of Thessaloniki as their capital. To make matters worse and further validate Greek fears, portrayals of the Greek flag with a swastika instead of a cross have been circulating in FYROM.<br /><br />Greece&#39;s ruling New Democracy Party as well as the main opposition party (PASOK) while vehemently disagreeing with each other on practically every other issue, are in complete agreement over the Macedonia issue. In all honesty they have to be. The public is so united on this issue as well, and any government party that did not take a hard line would not survive a single day. Dora Bakogiannis, the Greek Foreign Ministe.r gave a clear explanation of Greece&#39;s position. Macedonia, is a larger region that encompasses Northern Greece, some of FYROM, a part of Albania, and a small part of Bulgaria. Therefore, one country cannot claim the title that belongs to the larger region, the majority of which is located in Greece. On the other hand, Bakogiannis has said that the government would be willing to accept the name of Northern Macedonia, or New Macedonia. Many think that even that is too much of a concession.<br /><br />This issue is of such a national concern and so pervasive that it recently made an appearance on the Greek &quot;Star Ellas&quot; beauty pageant, (the Greek version of Miss America). During the question and answer part of the competition one girl was asked, what would she do if she were Miss Greece and at an international beauty competition the candidate from Skopje was wearing a banner that read &quot;Macedonia&quot;? The girl hesitated, not knowing what to say, and had to be prompted by the event&#39;s host to reply. The correct answer? &quot;I would leave!&quot;<br />

		<title>Cluster munitions convention is an international humanitarian law milestone</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Bonnie Docherty</strong> [Researcher, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a>]: &quot;The pound of a gavel Friday ushered in a new era of international humanitarian law (IHL) and marked the beginning of the end for a weapon that has caused tens of thousands of civilian casualties over the past 40 years. Without a single objection, 111 states attending a negotiating conference in Dublin adopted a Cluster Munitions Convention on May 30. In the final speeches that followed, delegates repeatedly referred to the treaty as a &quot;groundbreaking&quot; instrument and a &quot;milestone&quot; of IHL.<br /><br />The Cluster Munitions Convention bans the use, production, stockpiling, and transfer of cluster munitions and will set new legal precedent in several ways. When the process began in February 2007 in Oslo, the treaty looked like it would be primarily an adapted version of the highly successful Mine Ban Treaty. The original draft borrowed heavily from the latter&#39;s structure, and like the mine ban process, the Oslo Process went outside of the traditional United Nations forum (the Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW)) and involved civil society. But the final text is much more than a second Mine Ban Treaty.<br /><br />First and probably foremost, the Cluster Munitions Convention revolutionizes the rules of victim assistance, which are laid out in a separate article as well as sprinkled through other parts of the text. It links IHL to human rights law to provide victims with physical and psychological aid. It also uses a broad definition of victim, which encompasses survivors, their families, and their communities. While containing elements of a disarmament treaty, this convention is at heart a humanitarian one.<br /><br />Second, the treaty structures the definition of &quot;cluster munitions&quot; in an innovative way. It describes the prohibited weapon in broad terms as a munition that contains submunitions. The definition then establishes five restrictive and cumulative technological criteria that exclude only such weapons that do not have an indiscriminate area effect and produce large numbers of explosive duds that endanger civilians. The comprehensive ban that results covers all types of cluster munitions that have ever been used and almost all of those stockpiled. It puts the onus on state parties to prove a weapon falls under the exclusion before using it.<br /><br />Third, the treaty includes a provision that places special responsibility on user states to assist with clearance of cluster munition duds that pre-date the treaty&#39;s entry into force. Although there is precedent for such a retroactive obligation in international law, this provision is the first of its kind in a weapons treaty. It was weakened somewhat during negotiations&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;&quot;shall&quot; assist become &quot;strongly encouraged to&quot; assist, but it still puts pressure on user states to accept legal responsibility for their actions and help expedite clearance of the deadly weapons they left behind.<br /><br />Finally, the treaty takes a step backwards on the issue of conduct during joint operations with non-states parties. Like at least a half a dozen other weapons treaties, the Cluster Munitions Convention obliges states parties not to assist non-states parties with acts prohibited under the treaty. Due to <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/cluster-bomb-ban-would-impede.php">US pressure on its allies</a>, however, drafters added a separate article that qualifies obligations during joint military operations. The new Article 21, which a Cluster Munition Coalition (CMC) co-chair referred to as a &quot;stain on the fine fabric&quot; of the convention, is drafted in a vague manner; as a result, contrary to the purpose of the treaty, some states parties might choose to interpret Article 21 as if they could host foreign stockpiles of cluster munitions and intentionally assist with violations of the treaty. The codification of a legal precedent qualifying the prohibition on assistance is unfortunate for the development of future weapons treaties, but in practice it is unlikely to cause a humanitarian problem. States can still make declarations explaining their understandings of the provision, and the United States will likely bow to political pressure and not put their allies in awkward positions.<br /><br />Despite the mixed feelings around the room about the controversial Article 21, negotiating states, observers, and the CMC all recognized the treaty for the historic achievement it was. When the conference president&#39;s gavel fell, hundreds of delegates rose clapping to their feet and tears welled up in many eyes. Now, as delegates from all sides began talking about at the CMC party Friday night, the work turns to the signature, ratification, universalization, and implementation campaigns to make the comprehensive ban on cluster munitions a legally binding reality.&quot;<br />

		<title>Court ruling on constitutionality of Voting Rights Act promotes democracy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/people/perez_myrna/"><strong>Myrna Perez</strong></a> [Counsel, Democracy Program, <a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/">Brennan Center for Justice</a>]: &quot;In what is arguably the most important voting rights case this year, a three-judge federal court in Washington, D.C. <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/federal-court-upholds-key-voting-rights.php">upheld a key provision </a>of the Voting Rights Act that prevents states and local governments from enacting discriminatory voting practices.  The provision at issue is Section 5, which applies to states and localities with a history of racially discriminatory voting practices.  Entities covered by Section 5 are prohibited from changing their election laws unless the Attorney General or a three-judge federal court has &quot;pre-cleared&quot; or approved the change.  Section 5 has been a cornerstone of the Voting Rights Act since it was originally passed in 1965 and has been repeatedly extended, most recently, in 2006 for 25 years.  <br /><br />Plaintiff in the case, an Austin water utility district in Travis County, Texas, sought a statutory exemption from Section 5 and ultimately challenged the constitutionality of Section 5, claiming that it exceeded congressional authority and improperly intruded into state sovereignty.  The court first concluded that the utility district did not qualify for any exemption and then determined that the voluminous legislative record documenting recent racial discrimination in elections provided Congress with the rational basis it needed to enact Section 5 in order to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment.  The court also concluded that Section 5 was constitutional pursuant to congressional authority to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment.  <br /><br />Legislative and early judicial history shows that under the original understanding of the Fifteenth Amendment, Congress was understood to have broad enforcement powers to protect the right to vote.  Though the Supreme Court has cut back on Congress&#39;s powers to protect certain civil and individual rights under the U.S. Constitution (by striking down all or portions of key federal laws, like the Americans with Disabilities Act), courts have recognized Congress&#39;s authority to prevent and remedy racial discrimination in voting since Reconstruction.  This decision confirms that Congress, under both the Fifteenth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment, has the power to protect the franchise against discriminatory election practices.  <br /><br />Throughout recent history, the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/voting/intro/intro_b.htm">Voting Rights Act</a> has been essential in preserving the voting rights of minorities and deterring states and local government from taking actions to disenfranchise people of color.  The court&#39;s ruling is a victory for civil rights because it means Section 5 will continue to be an effective and available tool for promoting a more expansive and inclusive democracy.&quot;<br />

The closure petition was <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/turkish-prosecutors-refuse-to-shut.php">dismissed by prosecutors</a>. Homosexuality has never been a crime in Turkey, and some clubs, cinemas  and LGBTT organizations in big cities openly cater to homosexuals. Freedom of expression and freedom of association are enshrined in the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/EnglishAnglais.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a>, which Turkey has ratified as a member of the Council of Europe.<br /><br />These positive developments are unfortunately not enough. We now have a good reason to realize this fact.<br /><br />Coincidently on May 20, 2008, Human Rights Watch issued a 123-page report, <a href="http://hrw.org/reports/2008/turkey0508/">&quot;We Need a Law for Liberation: Gender, Sexuality, and Human Rights in a Changing Turkey&quot;</a>, after conducting more than 70 interviews over three years. They have concluded that Turkey has yet to adopt a comprehensive anti-discrimination law that conforms to EU standards.<br /><br />As indicated numerous times in the past in any countries where LGBTT people are fighting for their rights, &quot;visibility breeds violence.&quot;<br /><br />It is really unfortunate that the court found the <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/turkish-court-rules-glbt-rights-group.php">association&#39;s name in violation of public morality</a> and they want <a href="http://www.lambdaistanbul.org/php/main.php?menuID=26">Lambda Istanbul</a> to take out the words lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transvestites - but what is our purpose then?<br /><br />Just like indicated on Lambda Istanbul&#39;s statement, we will appeal against the decision to a higher court and take it from there. But in the mean time Lambda Istanbul will continue to function.&quot;<br />

According to defense lawyer Air Force Major Dave Frakt, based on a review of DIMS (Detainee Information Management Systems - a daily log kept of detainees at Guant&aacute;namo), which was recently provided by the prosecution to the defense, during a two-week period, Jawad was woken up from him cell and moved to different cells 112 times every 2 hours 55 minutes. Jawad had been interrogated 21 times prior to being subjected to the frequent flyer program and was not interrogated during the two-week period. He was again interrogated in September 2004.<br /><br />(Notably, in the Omar Khadr case, another teen held at Guant&aacute;namo, the prosecution has resisted providing DIMS to the defense prompting military commission Judge Peter Brownback to threaten an abatement of the proceedings unless DIMS was produced to the defense by May 22).<br /><br />The FBI reported observing the use of the &quot;frequent flyer program&quot; on detainees in the fall of 2003. The program was used on detainees who were deemed uncooperative and were placed on a list to be subjected to special sleep-deprivation tactics. The prisoners were moved frequently from cellblock to cellblock at intervals of two to four hours to interrupt their sleep. The recently released 370-page Department of Justice Inspector General report describes key tactics used by the government after September 11 including the &quot;frequent flyer program,&quot; use of strobe lights in conjunction with loud rock music, twisting of thumbs backward, and exposure of detainees to extreme temperatures, threatening dogs, pornography and sexual taunting.<br /><br />In 2003, sleep deprivation was being used as an interrogation technique in Guant&aacute;namo. The 2003 Pentagon Working Group Report, approved by former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, lists sleep deprivation for 4 days as an approved interrogation method. A 2005 military investigation (<a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Jul2005/d20050714report.pdf">Army Regulation 15-16: Final Report</a>) noted that the frequent flyer program was used at Guant&aacute;namo but was terminated by JTF-GTMO commander in March 2004. Yet Jawad was subjected to the program in May 2004 - two months after it allegedly ended.<br /><br />On May 8, 2008, when I observed <a href="/hotline/2008/05/mohammed-jawad-is-another-teen-growing.php">Jawad at his pre-trial military commissions hearing</a> he appeared agitated and told the court that he had &quot;been punished a lot&quot; and was woken up from sleep at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m., subjected to bright lights for 24 hours, threatened that he would spend his whole life in Guant&aacute;namo, and falsely promised that he would be able to get out. The recent revelation by Jawad&#39;s lawyer based on a review of government records confirmed that Jawad indeed was subjected to sleep deprivation and the frequent flyer program.<br /><br />Major Frakt also discovered that Jawad had attempted to commit suicide in December 2003. Nevertheless, JTF-GTMO personnel chose to subject a suicidal prisoner to sleep deprivation four months later.<br /><br />Major Frakt has requested a mental health evaluation and has filed a motion to dismiss the charges based on the allegations he was subjected to the sleep deprivation technique. Major Frakt has also filed a motion to dismiss based on unlawful influence on the prosecution by the legal advisor to the convening authority Brigadier General Thomas Hartmann on the case. Jawad&#39;s next hearing is scheduled for June 18.<br /><br />Jawad is charged with attempted murder and intent to cause serious bodily injury in violation of the laws of war. The grenade incident injured two U.S. soldiers and an Afghan interpreter injured in Kabul on December 17, 2002. He faces no charges of terrorism, material support, or any connection to al-Qaeda or the Taliban.&quot;<br /><br /><em>&quot;Report from Guantanamo&quot; features regular contributions to JURIST Hotline from </em><a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.com/" target="_blank"><em>Human Rights First</em></a><br />

		<title>Status-of-forces agreement with Iraq must recognize detainee rights under international law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Joseph Logan</strong> [researcher, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/doc/?t=mideast">Middle East and North Africa Division</a>, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a>]: &quot;In the debate over the Bush administration&#39;s push to wrap up a status-of-forces agreement and strategic pact with Iraq, there&#39;s a concerned party you aren&#39;t hearing about: the more than <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/un-security-council-should-address-mnf.php">20,000 Iraqis in US military detention</a>.<br /><br />The status-of-forces agreement now under negotiation would supersede the current U.N. Security Council resolution which expires at the end of the year and provides the Chapter VII mandate of US-led Multi-National Force-Iraq (MNF), including MNF detention in Iraq.  This resolution provides the MNF authority to detain persons for &quot;imperative reasons of security.&quot;  <br /><br />The US argues that these detainees should be treated in conformity with the Fourth Geneva Convention, which is applicable during military occupations.  This interpretation of the Security Council resolution ignores the shift in the legal classification of the conflict with the declared end of the occupation in Iraq in 2004.  Because the conflict in Iraq no longer concerns two opposing governments nor is an occupation, but is instead a fight by governments against an insurgency, the law on non-international armed conflict applies.  During such conflicts, persons apprehended are to be treated in accordance with fundamental laws of war guarantees and international human rights law, but not the Fourth Geneva Convention as the US contends.  This means at a minimum that detainees should be charged with a specific offense, be brought before an independent and impartial judge, and have access to a lawyer.  The current US process for detainees does not meet these basic requirements.<br /><br />Iraqis negotiating the status-of-forces agreement cite the goal of transferring to their authority much of the MNF detainee population - which the MNF itself has said it hopes to trim substantially through its expedited review and release procedures.  No one, however, imagines a status-of-forces agreement bringing an end to the authority of a foreign military operating in Iraq to detain.  Any agreement must reflect the commitment of both parties to upholding international law, including the elements of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights pertaining to the rights of persons in custody.<br /><br />Critics of the proposed deal in Washington warn they won&#39;t be roped into an open-ended military commitment to Iraq.  They should also reject the prospect of enshrining their country&#39;s status as a jailer operating outside international law on foreign soil.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Zubair Butt Hussai</span> [spokesperson, <a href="http://www.mfr.nu/">Muslim Council of Denmark</a>]: &quot;It is with great regret and indignation that it has come to our knowledge that the Danish government now wishes to intervene in the <a href="https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=22053">Administration of Justice Act</a> [in Danish]. The <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/denmark-government-to-propose-headscarf.php">government has chosen</a> to disregard all reasonable arguments and traditions of freedom in Denmark under the guise of a need for neutral appearance of judges. The decision illustrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the rationale behind the dress-code among Muslim women, their integrity, and their professionalism. It also disregards the competence of resource persons in the Danish judicial system, who evaluate candidates to the office of judge.<br /><br />The government&#39;s drastic interference in the right of the Court Administration to lead a modern and inclusive personnel policy means that it finally signals that not everybody in this society is equal. In the Muslim Council of Denmark we are highly concerned that this may be the beginning of a tendency that will affect a growing number of professions. This is an extremely dangerous slippery slope that does not lead to the open and inclusive society that we wish to maintain in Denmark. <br /><br />In the Muslim Council of Denmark, we can only continue to encourage men and women to pursue their educational dreams. One may expect, though, that Danish Muslims will increasingly choose professions with international potentials, if the present tendency continues.&quot;<br />

		<title>Egypt&#039;s extension of emergency law means continued rights violations</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Bill Van Esveld</span> [Arthur Helton Fellow, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/doc/?t=mideast">Middle East and North Africa Division</a>, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a>]: &quot;The Egyptian government has <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/egypt-extends-emergency-laws-despite.php">extended for two more years Law 162 of 1958</a> that authorizes prolonged detention without charge and severe limitations on freedom of assembly and expression.  Egypt&#39;s state of emergency, first implemented in 1967, has been continuously in force throughout President Hosni Mubarak&#39;s 27-year rule.  The emergency law has provided a dubious basis in law for the government&#39;s systematic stifling of political opposition and violations of individual rights.  <br /><br />Law 162 allows the executive to indefinitely detain persons without charge, and an estimated 5,000 persons remain in long-term detention without charge or trial under the law.  The law also allows authorities to refer civilians to a separate system of military or exceptional state security courts, whose composition is determined by the president and where the accused has no right of appeal, in violation of international fair trial standards.  In February 2006 President Mubarak, using his authority as commander-in-chief, ordered a group of 40 senior Muslim Brotherhood members to be tried by a military court shortly after an ordinary criminal court had dismissed charges against 17 of them. The military tribunal recently sentenced 25 of the group to prison terms of up to 10 years. <br /><br />The emergency law allows the government to prohibit strikes, demonstrations and public meetings.  On April 6 and 7, 2008, security forces prevented textile workers from striking in the Nile delta city of Mahalla, violently dispersed protests against rising costs of food and basic goods, and detained scores, including many on-line activists who had promoted the strike.  When Egypt&#39;s prosecutor-general ordered the release of 20 detainees a week later, the Interior Ministry invoked the emergency law to re-arrest them, according to news reports. <br /><br />These human rights violations have made the law widely unpopular.  Opposition parties, the Muslim Brotherhood, NGOs, UN treaty-monitoring bodies, and Egypt&#39;s government-backed National Council for Human Rights have objected to the law.  Nonetheless, human rights defenders are anxious at the prospect of a counter-terrorism law that the government says is being drafted so that the state of emergency will no longer be &quot;necessary.&quot;&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Patrick Kar-wai Poon</strong> [Executive Secretary, <a href="http://www.chrlcg-hk.org/">China Human Rights Lawyers Concern Group</a>]: &quot;The lawyers who can&#39;t pass their <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/china-human-rights-lawyers-denied.php">annual registration</a> will not be able to practise as lawyers at least in the coming year. Article 13 of the PRC Law on Lawyers stipulates, &quot;a person who has not acquired a lawyer&#39;s practicing certificate shall not be engaged in legal service practices in the name of lawyer; and, except as otherwise provided for by law, shall not be engaged in a practice of representation or defense in litigation.&quot;<br /><br />However, they can still represent their clients by acting as &quot;agent ad litem&quot; (gongmin daili). According to Article 40 of the PRC Criminal Procedure Law, for instance, &quot;a victim in a case of public prosecution, his legal representatives or near relatives, and a party in an incidental civil action and his legal representatives shall, from the date on which the case is transferred for examination before prosecution, have the right to entrust agents ad litem.&quot; One reason why agents ad litem are recognised is that there are not enough lawyers in some parts of China. But according to a 1993 regulation of the Ministry of Justice, agent ad litem is not allowed to take fees. This means that the lawyers who cannot have their practice license renewed  will not be able to receive fees for their handling of cases as mere &#39;agents ad litem.&#39;<br /><br />Lawyers in some other provinces, such as Shaanxi, Shandong and Guangdong, are still undergoing the annual registration process. Some of them told us that they might also face difficulities in having their practice licenses renewed this year. Some were because of being involved in joining to express their willingness to offer legal assistance to the Tibetans suspected or accused of taking part in the violence in the &quot;Tibet Incident&quot; in March, while some were involved in other human rights cases. So, the problem we want to point out is that the annual registration system puts undue pressure on the lawyers and there has been no clear explanation from the local Justice Bureau about how they decide if they allow a lawyer to re-register or not. It gives the Justice Bureau too much power in deciding whether the lawyers can register or not which is against the spirit of the rule of law.&quot;<br />

		<title>Fourth Circuit ruling on late-term abortion highlights women&#039;s health as priority</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Courtney E. Jones</strong> [grassroots organizer, <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/virginia-league/">Virginia League for Planned Parenthood</a>]: &quot;Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia welcomes the US Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals&#39; decision to strike down Virginia&#39;s burdensome ban on late-term abortions.  The Court stated that the onerous 2003 law &quot;imposes an undue burden on a woman&#39;s right to obtain an abortion.&quot;<br /><br />This is the second time Virginia has disregarded the health of women when enacting an abortion ban, and it&#39;s the second time the courts have ruled that ignoring women&#39;s health violates the Constitution.  Given that the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals is one of the most conservative in the country, their decision emphasizes that protections for the woman&#39;s health must be the priority in cases like this.<br /><br />In 2000, the United States Supreme Court ruling in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/99-830.ZS.html">Stenberg v. Carhart</a> led to the reversal of Virginia&#39;s abortion ban of the late 1990s.  Though last year&#39;s Supreme Court decision in <a href="http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2006/2006_05_1382/">Gonzales v. Planned Parenthood</a> upheld the federal ban on late-term abortions, the Virginia ban is far more restrictive and vague. As a result, the appeals court struck down Virginia&#39;s latest abortion ban.<br />Virginia lawmakers can better reduce the incidence of abortion by empowering women rather than hurting them.  Our legislators can do far more to prevent unintended pregnancies and abortions by increasing access to family planning, comprehensive sex education, and affordable access to contraception. <br /><br />Planned Parenthood will continue to advocate at the state and federal levels for increased access to reproductive health care and for age-appropriate sexuality education that stresses abstinence and also provides birth control information.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Bonnie Docherty</strong> [Researcher, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a>]: &quot;Negotiations for a new convention banning cluster munitions are coming to a close, and perhaps the biggest remaining obstacle to achieving a strong treaty is a country not even present, the United States. The United States has applied pressure to states around the world, particularly to its NATO allies. Campaigners at the negotiating conference in Dublin have taken to referring to the United States as &quot;the elephant not in the room.&quot; <br /><br />Delegates have particularly sensed US influence in lengthy and contentious sessions dealing with &quot;interoperability.&quot; The original draft treaty text obliges state parties involved in joint operations not to assist non-states parties with the use, production, trade, or stockpiling of cluster munitions. The weapon causes civilian casualties both during attacks because of its area effect and after because of explosive duds. Based on extensive precedent, this provision would promote the stigmatization of the weapon, a decrease in use by all states, and ultimate universalization of the treaty. US allies, led by the United Kingdom, however, have called for additional language that in essence allows them to assist in violations of the treaty in the course of their military alliances with non-states parties. In the name of protecting their soldiers from criminal liability, they demand an article that allows them intentionally to assist with the use of cluster munitions and to &quot;host&quot; foreign stockpiles of cluster munitions on their own soil, two provisions that undermine the humanitarian spirit of the treaty as well as existing legal precedent. US pressure seems to have a great deal to do with the hard line some states are taking.<br /><br />Much of its work has been behind the scenes &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; a US official said the United States has communicated with at least 114 of the negotiating states, but it played its hand publicly last week. Stephen Mull, acting assistant secretary for political military affairs at the US Department of State, <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/cluster-bomb-ban-would-impede.php">told reporters</a>, &quot;&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;if the convention passes in its current form, any US military ship would be technically not able to get involved in a peacekeeping operation, in providing disaster relief or humanitarian assistance as we&#39;re doing right now in the aftermath of the earthquake in China and the typhoon in Burma, and not to mention everything that we did in Southeast Asia after the tsunami in December of 2004.&quot;  This statement is simply absurd; despite similar provisions in other weapons treaties, no country has ever banned from their ports US units on a humanitarian mission because of what arms might possibly be on board. Furthermore Mull&#39;s specific examples are disingenuous because cluster munitions are not appropriate for a humanitarian mission and neither China nor Burma are part of the cluster munitions treaty process. <br /><br />The time to resolve interoperability and other outstanding issues is short. The final text is due to translators on Wednesday night. To reach the necessary agreement, negotiating states need to ignore pressure from across the ocean and focus on voices from across the room, which seek to promote the humanitarian purpose of the treaty, rather than bow to the demands of the United States.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/students/faculty/BDavis/BDavis.htm">Benjamin Davis</a> of the University of Toledo College of Law says that the processes and procedures of the United States military commission system being used to try alleged terrorists at Guantanamo Bay (GTMO) are a betrayal of the high standards for international criminal justice pioneered by American officials at the Nuremberg trials after the end of World War II...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/benjamindavisnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>O</strong></font>n the day of the arraignment of alleged 9/11 plotters at GTMO, the use by the press of the term &quot;court&quot; about the GTMO procedures moves me to object. We should be loathe to use the term &quot;court&quot; - or even &quot;military tribunal&quot; - for these <em>ersatz</em> processes. The GTMO procedures besmirch our proud legacy from Nuremberg.<br /><br />Many have written on the problems with these processes put in place by the President and Congress in the Military Commissions Act and I will not repeat that analysis here.<br /><br />I would just remind all Americans of what Justice Robert H. Jackson said over 60 years ago, addressing the American Society of International Law in 1945 on courts set up to try alleged war criminals:<blockquote>The ultimate principle is that you must put no man on trial under the forms of judicial proceedings if you are not willing to see him freed if not proven guilty. If you are determined to execute a man in any case, there is no occasion for a trial; the world yields no respect to courts that are merely organized to convict. I am not arguing against bringing those accused of war-crimes to trial. I am pointing out hazards that attend such use of the judicial process - risk on the one hand that the decision that most of the world thinks should be made may not be justified as a judicial finding, even if perfectly justified as a political policy; and the alternative risk of damage to the future credit of judicial proceedings by manipulations of trial personnel or procedure temporarily to invest with judicial character what is in fact a political decision.</blockquote>As Jackson said in a concurrence in <em>Shepherd v. Florida</em> in 1951, let us not stress the trivial and ignore the important.<br /><br />The fundamental flaw this time is that the GTMO processes were created to make palatable in some way the fact of the horrendous treatment these detainees were subjected to over the past 5 or 6 years and to permit the state to murder or indefinite incarcerate these &quot;enemies of the state.&quot;<br /><br />That horrendous treatment was the result of the panic and improvisation of a criminal kind by high level civilians and military generals that is detailed in far too many places. And the lust for blood surrounding these <em>ersatz</em> GTMO processes is as palpable as it was in a small southern town in 1951.<br /><br />Because of the numerous failings of the structure, the GTMO processes are not courts or military tribunals in a judicial tradition. The yeomen work by lawyers (many of whom have now resigned) who understand the Jacksonian tradition to make these proceedings judicial simply can not mask the flaw.<br /><br />These are not judicial forms at GTMO, they are theater. Even if the Supreme Court in the heat of this moment were to make a decision tomorrow stating these GTMO processes were fine, the GTMO processes will be seen throughout history as one more in the line of show trials as opposed to processes that are consistent with judicial forms in the line of Nuremberg.<br /><br />I carry no brief for any of the defendants. I carry a brief for the idea of Anglo-Saxon justice. What should be done? The entire mess should be forced through the process of a normal civilian court. It is time for the tried and true, not the panicked and improvised. I have little faith that this country will do that now.<br /><br />There are two additional things that come to mind: each defendant should be provided the defense counsel of their choice. If Khalid Shaikh Mohammed (KSM) wants a lawyer from Pakistan, he should be provided that. At Nuremberg, when there were issues of national security present, the defendants were free to have any lawyer that they wanted including lawyers who had been Nazis. We should renew that tradition and not the tradition of the Iraqi Special Tribunal where Saddam Hussein was assigned lawyers who were Shia and the family lawyers were not permitted to play their full role.<br /><br />Second, KSM has children who have been held on dubious legal basis by the Americans. I have heard that one of them has been sent to Phillips Andover Academy. I am not aware of a rule of law that permits someone to hold a defendant&#39;s minor children. At a minimum, a <em>guardian ad litem</em> should be appointed for them in Massachusetts and a Massachusetts Court or Federal Court should determine what is to be done with these children during the course of these proceedings. And, if their mother or family in Pakistan seek to have those children returned that should be subject of a decision in a court of law. No child shields for this process. It is beneath the United States and besmirches the legacy of Jackson and Nuremberg.<br /><br /><br /><em>Benjamin Davis is a professor at the University of Toledo College of Law</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="mailto:dwrist@pitt.edu">Wes Rist</a> of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law says that the recent creation of a Ugandan war crimes court to deal with alleged war crimes committed by the Lord's Resistance Army is not a challenge to the International Criminal Court in The Hague, but is actually a victory for the ICC, the Rome Statute, and international criminal law.....<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/wes_rist.jpeg" width="120" height="152" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he Ugandan High Court has created a special division devoted to the prosecution of alleged war crimes committed over the past twenty plus years by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in Uganda. The move is part of an agreement reached in February between LRA leaders and the Ugandan government after nearly a year of stalled peace talks where the existence of indictments by the International Criminal Court against Joseph Kony and other LRA leaders has been a block to a permanent peace agreement. Indeed on May 25, ICC Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo told reporters that the ICC was exploring further criminal allegations against the LRA for alleged crimes committed in the months since the failed peace attempts in March and April. What the ICC seems to be missing, however, is that both the Court itself and the concept of international criminal law are winners in Uganda's creation of the special war crimes division.<br /><br />The Rome Statute makes it very clear that the ICC is to serve as a court of last resort. The goal is to ensure that individuals who have evaded justice at the domestic level will not simply be free from the threat of criminal prosecution because of the lack of capacity or political will in one or two countries. Ideally, the ICC is a court that would never be needed - primarily, we would hope, because the types of abuses it has jurisdiction over will become so abhorrent as to be unacceptable to world leaders. But given humanity's willingness to engage in just about any action, no matter how horrendous, the more realistic reason that the ICC should be simply the threat rather than the implementation of justice is that individual countries will take on the responsibility of prosecuting alleged violators of the Rome Statute in their own domestic legal systems. And this is exactly what the Ugandan Executive and Judiciary are attempting to do.<br /><br />By creating a special war crimes division in the Ugandan High Court, the government is taking the steps that the ICC was created to promote. This is not a failure for Ocampo or the ICC. In fact, this is the result that the ICC should be hoping for. The outstanding indictments against Joseph Kony, Vincent Otti, Okot Obhiambo, and Dominic Ongwen have been a persistent bar to the attempts by both sides to reach a permanent peace agreement. In addition, there seem to be substantial reports that the population of Uganda wishes to see these individuals face justice in their own country and not at the ICC. In this case, and certainly in cases to come, there is a very difficult and fine line that the ICC must walk between pursuing justice and preventing peace. But in this case, it seems that both objectives are obtainable if the ICC is willing to cooperate. <br /><br />The population of Uganda is eager to see a peace agreement and to see the accused face trial in their own judicial system. Kony and the other LRA leaders have expressed a willingness to reach a permanent peace agreement if the ICC indictments against them are withdrawn. In fact, to the ICC's credit, it was probably the continued pressure by the ICC Office of the Prosecutor that led the LRA to reach an agreement with the Ugandan government in February that a domestic war crimes court would be acceptable. Now the ICC has the opportunity to step back from the trenches of trying to enforce indictments against the LRA that neither the Ugandan government nor, by all accounts, the people of Uganda want, and instead offer its assistance to the High Court's war crimes division on how best to go about the prosecutions. The ICC can make this division and its future prosecutions all the more effective by handing over all of the evidence they have managed to gather against Kony and his lieutenants up to this point and make their investigators and prosecutors available to the Ugandan High Court as witnesses.<br /><br />But even if the ICC and the Office of the Prosecutor choose to ignore the significant benefit that cooperating with the Ugandan government on this issue, they will very quickly have little legal authority to pursue their own investigations or exercise their indictments. The Rome Statute is very clear that a case may only proceed when "the State is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution." (Article 17.1) Uganda's creation of the special war crimes division of the Ugandan High Court to address alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity by LRA leaders seems to be a very clear-cut indication of willingness to carry out a genuine investigation or prosecution. Even if the ICC is hesitant about whether the special war crimes division is actually undertaking a genuine investigation or prosecution, the Rome Statute provides clear instructions in Article 17.2 on how a finding of "unwillingness" may be reached. The only potential threat to the legitimacy of the Ugandan government's decision to create the war crimes division of the High Court is Article 17.2(a), which states that where "proceedings were or are being undertaken or the national decision was made for the purpose of shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court" the court may make a determination of unwillingness. <br /><br />There may very well be a strong argument that the Ugandan government decided to create the war crimes division of the High Court to shield the LRA officials from ICC prosecution. The ICC and the Office of the Prosecutor, however, should take a very long look at the process and instructions given to the Ugandan war crimes division and consider that it may be entirely possible for the explicit intention of the Ugandan High Court to be "shielding" the LRA officials and yet still be a court devoted to obtaining justice for the people of Uganda while creating the opportunity for a permanent peace agreement between the government and the LRA. And this is without the consideration that there seems to be a very strong desire on behalf of the Ugandan population to see the LRA leaders tried at home, rather than at the ICC; a fact which would seem to defeat Article 17.2(a)'s holding of "unwillingness."<br /><br />The creation of the Ugandan High Court's war crimes division offers a chance for everyone involved in a very complicated issue to find a successful resolution. The Ugandan people have the chance to obtain a peace in their country for the first time in over twenty years and to see the perpetrators of horrible acts of violence and barbarism punished by their own judicial system. The Ugandan government gets to pursue a permanent peace agreement with the LRA and prosecute the perpetrators of two decades' worth of war crimes against its people. The LRA officials avoid ICC prosecution and have the chance to plea their case before the only judges and juries that would even consider their arguments of lawful rebellion against the government. And the ICC has been the key player in using the threat of international criminal responsibility to create a judicial body that can address the same issues of war crimes and crimes against humanity at the domestic rather than international level. Not only is this new court division a win for the ICC, it's a win for the very concept of international criminal law that the Rome Statute seeks to promote.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/students/faculty/BDavis/BDavis.htm">Benjamin Davis</a> of the University of Toledo College of Law says that instead of excusing the Bush administration lawyers who enabled torture as a tool of American policy, we should press for their prosecution and celebrate the efforts of those legal advisors in the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense, the FBI and elsewhere who put their jobs on the line to stand up for true American values...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/benjamindavisnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>&#39;ve just been to the Toledo Memorial Day parade. I saw old men and women in old uniforms, some riding and some walking stiffly. Ordinary Americans who in various times at least back to the Korean War had put on the uniform. I saw young men and women brimming with energy that feels like a vague memory to me. I saluted the colors as they went by. I looked at young children dressed as young Marines. I was reminded again of the sacrifice of so many decent Americans who trust their leaders when sent into battle to protect the American idea. I look at these loyal American hearts, those at the bottom of the pile who are willing to give their all for our nation&#39;s cause. <br /><br />I ask myself what part of that American idea says that torture is OK? Not one bit of it. It is not our nature, it is not our best nature. We are not that craven. <br /><br />Over this past week we have been provided the U.S. Department of Justice Inspector General&#39;s Report on the FBI&#39;s role in detainee interrogations, we&#39;ve heard Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice during a speech at Google admitting that &quot;enhanced&quot; interrogation techniques were authorized out of necessity, and Attorney General Michael Mukasey exhorting Boston College Law School graduates - law school graduates!! - to be more forgiving to the lawyers like Jack Goldsmith who enabled torture. <br /><br />Mukasey is particularly instructive as he describes us as being in another cycle of timidity and aggression as we have done in earlier periods. He warns us against going down that path and asks us to recognize what was being called for from the lawyers in the years just after 9/11 - aggression, aggression, aggression. He questions those who call for civil penalties against the lawyers, as well as those, like myself, who call for criminal prosecution of the lawyers who enabled the torture. Along the same lines, Secretary Rice defends the United States use of torture on the grounds we were in a different legal atmosphere after 9/11 - a thinly veiled effort to assert necessity as a defense for the torture.<br /><br />What the U.S. Department of Justice Inspector General&#39;s report tells us is that there were cool heads at the time telling the ones who wanted to torture not to do that. There were all of these voices - in that same post 9/11 environment - who were objecting up and down the line to the actions of their co-workers. These were people who were willing to &quot;not go along to get along&quot; because they questioned the wisdom of the work of those who enabled torture.<br /><br />May I ask Secretary Rice and Attorney General Mukasey, where is your concern for those lawyers? Where is your concern for Alberto Mora standing up and objecting in the Pentagon? Where is your concern for Bruce C. Swartz , Marion &quot;Spike&quot; Bowman, and Pasquale D&#39;Amuro, lawyers in the FBI? Where is your concern for the FBI agents who went up their chain of command to object to treatment that was patently illegal? Where is your concern for a William Taft IV at the State Department who argued for the applicability of the Geneva Conventions?<br /><br />Rice and Mukasey ask us to take pity on the legal advisors who enabled torture. That is like taking pity on the sheriff who hands over the prison and the prisoners to the lynch mob. Why not take pity on the deputy who stands in the door and refuses the rule of the jungle?<br /><br />These legal advisors deserve no more pity than any garden variety crack dealer. Specialist Darby showed us the pictures of just what these legal advisors put in place. Murat Kurnaz and Khalid El-Masry have explained to us what they were put through. Good decent members of the military and CIA were perverted into torture machines at Bagram, Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo, black sites and other places on the basis of that legal advice that came down to them in the form of orders to do various atrocious acts.<br /><br />When the pictures came out, we were all shocked and heads were made to roll. The thing is that the heads that rolled were just the heads of the very low level persons who had betrayed their oath and their obligations under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Anyone with a vague sense of the military knew full well that these kinds of concerted actions in several places were not just the product of low-level improvisation.<br /><br />If we want to change from a cycle of timidity and aggression, then let us do that this time by trying something new that we do not do in this country: criminally prosecute the high-level civilians - the OLC lawyers and White House lawyers, the principals of the National Security Principals meetings, the General Counsels and Intelligence types at the Defense Department and CIA. Criminally prosecute them for conspiring to torture and a whole list of other crimes. Do the same for the generals like General Miller who made sure the bidding of these high-level criminals was done.<br /><br />Why speak so clearly of this? Because, it is in the hearing room, in the court before a jury that we can see of what stuff these persons are made. We as ordinary citizens can judge the high and mighty and determine, as a matter of law, what part of what they did was legitimate and what part of it was panic and improvisation.<br /><br />It is important for those who so willingly put forth these arguments for torture to be called to account - just like those soldiers at Abu Ghraib. Otherwise, we have not put a bulwark up against this most heinous of human crimes - torture. We have let this cycle go around again without the principals being prosecuted - again.<br /><br />Now Secretary of State Rice and Attorney General Mukasey want us to acquiesce in what has happened: forget about it and go on. Their very efforts are part of an effort we are seeing over and over to have us just let it go. We should not let it go because there is a need for institutional memory - institutional memory that reminds all who work in this area that torture is not some utilitarian calculus - it is a crime.<br /><br />In order to bring this home to Secretary of State Rice and Attorney General Mukasey, what we who think the line should be crystal clear should do is not just write pieces like this one. We should inundate the offices of Secretary of State Rice and Attorney General Mukasey and our representatives, calling on them to criminally prosecute these high-level perpetrators of torture. Borrowing from the Amnesty International approach with regard to prisoners of conscience in which cells are created that send letters to a designated prisoner of conscience, as citizens of conscience we should exercise pressure on the leaders of our country to force them to be criminally prosecuted for their deeds against the United States.<br /><br />Let Secretary of State Rice and Attorney General Mukasey come into their offices every day until they leave Washington and find letters from average citizens from around the United States, calling on them to use their power to redress the torture bar. Let them have to find appropriate storage for the thousands of letters. Let them contemplate the wrath of millions of Americans at their acquiescence in besmirching what America stands for.<br /><br />Think back to the weasly words of Secr
etary of State Rice, Attorney General Mukasey, the torture memos and the surreptitious perversions of Addington, Haynes, Yoo, Goldsmith, Bellinger, Bradbury and other lawyers. Let us not weep for these poor souls who pervert law in the service of power. Let them be prosecuted, let them face a jury of their peers, and let them be convicted. Let us through our actions call the hounds of hell upon the enablers of torture. <br /><br />Let us vindicate those in our government who were willing to stand for law and resist the panic and improvisation that led to torture. Through these prosecutions of their weak colleagues, let us tell Alberto Mora, Bruce C Swartz, Marion &quot;Spike&quot; Bowman, Pasquale D&#39;Amuro and Willam Taft IV and the other lawyers who stood up for what is right that their keeping the faith with what is fundamental in America is important to us and that we honor and cherish them for their struggle in the darkest of times.<br /><br /><br /><em>Benjamin Davis is a professor at the University of Toledo College of Law</em><br />

		<title>Pakistan&#039;s Proposed Constitutional Amendment: An Exercise in Futility</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php">Ali Khan</a> of Washburn University School of Law says that the proposed 18th Amendment to Pakistan&#39;s constitution limiting presidential power and punishing judges who might support military coups and constitutional subversions may offer some short-term benefit, but it will not solve Pakistan&#39;s constitutional woes....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/alikhan.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he Pakistan People&#39;s Party (PPP) will soon propose to Pakistan&#39;s Parliament an amendment to the 1973 Constitution. The proposed 18th Amendment would reportedly abolish Article 58 (2)(b) of the Constitution, which empowers the President, in his sole discretion, to dissolve the National Assembly. The amendment would also strengthen Article 6 of the Constitution to punish judges who would in future support military coups and constitutional subversions. <br /><br />This essay argues that the proposed 18th Amendment is an exercise in futility. Unfortunately, no constitutional amendment will prevent future military adventurism unless the political and military leadership is committed to honor the Constitution. As discussed below, however, the culture of the ruling elites has no respect for the rule of law. <br /><br /><strong>Historical See-sawing of Article 58(2)(b)</strong><br /><br />The proposal of abolishing Article 58(2)(b) is neither new, nor effective. The Article has been abolished once before, only to be reinstated in the Constitution. Furthermore, military coups respect no provision of the Constitution. In fact, the disrespect for the Constitution runs deep among ruling elites. Even the judiciary and the National Parliament are quick to reform the Constitution for short-term interests. <br /><br />Historically, Article 58(2)(b) is the invention of a military general. Exercising the non-existent powers of the Army Chief, General Zia ul Haq, who toppled a democratically elected government in 1977, ordered the addition of Article 58(2)(b) to the Constitution. In 1985, a pro-military Parliament, using the constitutional procedure of two-thirds majority, ratified Zia&#39;s Article 58(2)(b) as a constitutional amendment, called the 8th Amendment.<br /><br />Note, however, that the highly discretionary power built into Article 58(b)(2) is vested in a duly elected President. It is not vested in the Army Chief. Abolishing Article 58(2)(b) disables the President - not the Army Chief - from deposing an elected government. <br /><br />In 1996, a civilian President invoked Article 58(2)(b), dissolved the National Assembly, and dismissed Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto&#39;s democratically elected government. The President justified dissolution on several grounds, including the Bhutto government's corruption, incompetence, and disrespect for the Supreme Court. In his book, constitutional attorney Hamid Khan accuses Nawaz Sharif, the then opposition leader, for encouraging the President to dissolve the National Assembly and hold new elections.<br /><br />Nawaz Sharif benefited from the Article 58(2)(b) dissolution of the Bhutto government. In the 1997 general elections, Sharif won a two-thirds majority in the Parliament. Soon after assuming the office of the Prime Minister, Sharif turned on the President, and hurriedly processed a constitutional amendment to abolish Article 58(2)(b). The sole purpose of abolition was to weaken the office of the President and bestow all powers on Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. <br /><br />The abolition of 58(2)(b), however, did not safeguard parliamentary democracy. Nor did it restore any respect for political governments. In a short time, the Sharif government lost its popularity. The nation did not know what to do with the autocratic Sharif family, which showed little respect for the rule of law. The Sharif government even sent ruffians to assault the Supreme Court. The civilian President was unable to dissolve the National Assembly, since Article 58(2)(b) had been abolished. <br /><br />Hotheaded political forces and restive media were openly inviting the armed forces to remove the Sharif government. Hearing the clarion call, Army Chief Pervez Musharraf overthrew the Sharif government. This deposition had nothing to do with Article 58(2)(b). Nor could the crime of high treason embodied in Article 6 deter the Army Chief from subverting the Constitution. Following the habit of subservience, the Supreme Court upheld the coup and took a new oath to obey the laws of the Army Chief. <br /><br />Exercising the non-existent powers of the Army Chief, Musharraf issued an order to reintroduce Article 58(2)(b) back into the Constitution. In 2003, a pro-military Parliament elected by the people passed the 17th Amendment to rehabilitate Article 58(2)(b). <br /><br />Now, the proposed 18th Amendment aims at abolishing Article 58(2)(b) again. This time, the proposal stems from the fear that "President" Musharraf will dissolve the National Assembly if the judges are reinstated without his consent or in the presence of Article 58(2)(b). The proposed amendment may offer some short term benefit. However, it will not solve Pakistan's constitutional woes.<br /><br /><strong>The Underlying Problem</strong> <br /><br />Article 58(2)(b) is not Pakistan's underlying problem. The problem lies deep in the Pakistani culture of power. Granted, most political and military rulers are patriotic men and women who want to do good for the nation. However, the power culture sees the rule of law as an inefficient barrier to make and execute policies. The rule of law has always been the slogan of the opposition and rarely that of the government.<br /><br />Right now, for example, the power has gravitated toward Asif Zardari, the PPP Chief, who is not even an elected member of the Parliament. Exercising dynastic powers that he inherited from his wife Benazir Bhutto, who was assassinated before the general elections, Zardari is calling the shots from the Zardari House. The Prime Minister, supposedly the head of the government, is serving as a loyalist subordinate. The Law Minister, responsible for the drafting of the 18th amendment, is not even an elected member of the National Assembly. Most important, the National Assembly, where Zardari and Sharif's parties have a solid majority, is waiting for party bosses to issue orders, from outside the Parliament, on what needs to be done in the Parliament.<br /><br />This subservience to party bosses explains why in the past the Parliament has mindlessly ratified both the constitutional inclusion and exclusion of Article 58(2)(b). Rarely do members of the Parliament think independently. And those who think rebel against the party and form another group. Each course of action is contrary to the democratic process.<br /><br />In a respectable parliamentary democracy, party discipline is a cherished value. However, each elected member of the Parliament represents the constituency and the nation, in addition to towing the party line. Likewise, party bosses are democratic both within the party and the Parliament. They do not establish personal fiefdoms to rule their "tribes" in the party or the Parliament and demand mindless subservience. <br /><br />Between mindless subservience and open rebellion lies the precious space for democracy where ideas are openly exchanged with respect and dignity and where the rule of law is not traded for narrow interests. To preempt future constitutional disruptions, Pakistan needs to develop this precious space. <br /><br /><br /><em>Ali Khan is professor of law at Washburn University School of Law in Topeka, Kansas, and the author of the book, <em>A Theory of Universal Democracy</em> (2003).

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.ucla.edu/home/index.asp?page=2497">Douglas NeJaime</a> of UCLA School of Law says that the California same-sex marriage ruling is not merely about the right to marry the person one loves, but it is also about accommodating the demographic reality of lesbians and gay men who commit to one another, raise children, and form families...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forumy/dougnejaime.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><strong>T</strong></strong></font>he California Supreme Court recently became the second state high court to extend marriage to same-sex couples. Although the court reached the same result as the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, it did so based on radically different reasoning. While the Massachusetts court conceptualized marriage in terms of self-fulfillment, the California court focused on the relationships formed through marriage, positioning marriage as about others.<br /><br />In its 2003 landmark decision, the Massachusetts court focused on the individuals in the relationship, making marriage about the self. As the court put it, "[b]ecause it fulfills yearnings for security, safe haven, and connection that express our common humanity, civil marriage is an esteemed institution, and the decision whether and whom to marry is among life's momentous acts of self-definition."<br /><br />The California court, on the other hand, concentrated on the familial relationships embodied by marriage and society's interest in those relationships. The court carefully identified the "substantive right of two adults who share a loving relationship to join together to establish an officially recognized family of their own &#8212; and, if the couple chooses, to raise children within that family." To the court, the issue before it was not merely one about marriage &#8212; the relationship between two adults seeking self-fulfillment &#8212; but was also, and more centrally, one about family &#8212; the supportive kinship networks among adults and children. Indeed, Chief Justice George's majority opinion used the word "family" almost 150 times. The claim to marriage by lesbians and gay men had transformed from the individualistic, self-defining right that carried the day in Massachusetts in 2003 to the more far-reaching, communitarian, family-based right that prevailed in California in 2008.<br /><br />What had changed? Rhetoric and reality.<br /><br />The Massachusetts court rejected social conservative arguments based on notions of the optimal husband-wife, father-mother household. The California court went further, actually reconfiguring those arguments to support same-sex couples. While social conservative groups in the California litigation argued in favor of restrictions on marriage based on the significance of families and children, this exact rationale served as the basis for the court's decision against the marriage restriction. "Family values," it seems, have been neutered, and the rhetoric of "family values" has switched sides. <br /><br />The court's new focus on the family was underscored by a novel argument made by the state of California. The state, including the Attorney General and the Governor, attempted to divest the name "marriage" of its symbolic qualities, arguing that no difference exists between marriage and domestic partnership. In fact, the state argued that California could do away with the term "marriage" altogether, stripping it from the relationships of different-sex couples. The court, however, rejected the state's arguments, agreeing instead with both the gay rights groups and the social conservative groups as to the importance of the status of marriage and its significance for family relationships. The state, it seems, was missing the point &#8212; family.<br /><br />The court comprehensively reconfigured the notion of family so as not merely to accommodate but actually celebrate the relationships formed between same-sex couples and between those couples and their children. First, the court established that when two people commit to one another and rely on each other for mutual support, they form a family that is socially vital and worthy of official recognition. The court explained that a core element of the fundamental right to marry "is the right of same-sex couples to have their official family relationship accorded the same dignity, respect, and stature as that accorded to all other officially recognized family relationships." By forming relationships characterized by mutual commitment and support, same-sex couples are serving as productive members of society and furthering the societal interest in family stability.<br /><br />Next, the court situated parenting and children &#8212; significant components of "family values" discourse &#8212; as gay-positive. As the court declared, society "has an overriding interest in the welfare of children, and the role marriage plays in facilitating a stable family setting in which children may be raised by two loving parents unquestionably furthers the welfare of children and society." The mother-father family had become the two-parent family, and children had become central players in the families of same-sex couples.<br /><br />At the same time that gay rights advocates and the court itself appropriated "family values" discourse to the benefit of same-sex couples, the rhetorical move reflects a more grounded factual recognition of the lives of many lesbians and gay men. They form families, they raise children, and they will continue to do so regardless of the outcome of marriage litigation. As Chief Justice George pointed out in his opinion, the Williams Institute has documented that at the time of the 2000 census, same-sex couples in California were raising more than 70,000 children. Indeed, the Chief Justice noted that, according to the Williams Institute, almost 30% of same-sex couples in California were raising children. <br /><br />The picture of the gay and lesbian population documented by the Williams Institute, and recognized by the court, is a far cry from caricatured images of single, swinging gays living in urban enclaves, far from children and respectable families. The court's decision is not merely about the right to marry the person whom one loves, but it is also about a realistic, practical accommodation of the demographic reality of the lives of lesbians and gay men, who are committing to one another, raising children, and forming families.<br /><br /><br /><em>Douglas NeJaime is the Williams Institute Law Teaching Fellow at UCLA School of Law</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elisa Mari, Pitt Law &#39;10, files from <strong>Athens</strong>:<br /><br />Lately it has been more of a hassle and more crowded than usual at the Land Registry Office (<span style="font-style:italic;">Ypothikofilakeio</span>). A title search in Greece consists of going through the old hand written volumes of the registries to check for title, mortgages, liens, etc. all listed under the owner&#39;s last name.  All that is going to change though, as a whole new land registry system (<span style="font-style:italic;">Ktimatologeio</span>) is being implemented. The property will now be registered under lot number and address, rather than by the owner&#39;s name. Everyone who owns property must register it under the new system. That is why the Land Registry Office has suddenly become packed daily with lines out the door. <br /><br />Property owners have until September 30th to declare their property to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ktimatologeio</span>, while Greeks living abroad or foreign residents who own property in Greece have until December 30th to register their property.  It is calculated that 3.1 million <span style="font-style:italic;">stremma</span> (one <span style="font-style:italic;">stremma</span> is 1,000 square meters) will be recorded and this will include the property of 2/3 of the population. <br /><br />While a land registry system where the information is organized under lot number and address rather than owner&#39;s name is beneficial everywhere, it is especially crucial in Greece. Much of the property here is jointly owned by multiple family members. In fact when it comes to inheritance rights and the division of property, the Greek Civil Code stipulates that all children (with only some extreme exceptions) have a forced share of an estate. Therefore, regardless of what a parent decides in his/her will, a child cannot be disinherited and a portion of the property or money is theirs by law. <br /><br />Even if it were not the law, the Greek mentality is to keep everything in the family and have everyone own everything together. It is not uncommon therefore to find a small house in a village or a plot of land that is owned by five siblings, some of whom might not even live in Greece anymore. It rarely seems to cross anyone&#39;s mind that this is a recipe for disaster. Houses are left abandoned and fall into disrepair because none of the siblings can agree with the others on how to manage the property, and the loving family that wanted to own everything together ends up in bitter feuds over property ownership.  In fact, the majority of the property cases that the office I&#39;m working at deals with concern cleaning up title between relatives who each claim a percentage of the total ownership of a property. It is a refreshing, but rare, occurrence when one of our clients actually has full title in fee simple absolute.  In addition, ownership by adverse possession is common. The typical case arises when the actual title holder is living abroad and has left the property in the hands of relatives who assure him that they are &quot;taking care&quot; of the property until the owner&#39;s return. <br /><br />While the new land registry system won&#39;t solve these problems, it will certainly make tracking down title easier and clarify who owns what. As for the rest, that&#39;s a social issue and from the way it seems it is not likely to change anytime soon.<br />

		<title>UKRAINE: A Legal System in Development</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Carrie Cecil, Pitt Law &#39;10, files from <strong>Kiev</strong>:<br /><br />Ukraine is a democracy still in its infancy. Independence from the former Soviet Union was declared in 1991, and the Constitution was adopted in 1996. After declaring independence, Ukraine struggled to decide whether legally the country would adopt policies bringing it closer to the rest of Europe or policies tying it to Russia. This struggle to find a unified approach led - and continues to lead - to the adoption of often inadequate and continually changing legislation. Today, many laws adopted prior to independence are still at work, albeit in amended versions. The Verkhovna Rada (the Ukrainian Parliament) is still working to pass foundational laws, such as the new labor code, which is currently under debate (the current code was passed in 1971).<br /> <br />The lingering Soviet influence on Ukraine&#39;s legal system manifests itself in several ways. Most prominent are the laws in use that were passed prior to independence.  These laws in large part have been amended to &quot;patch holes,&quot; but there remain differing philosophies between the laws passed prior to 1991 and those since passed. As time passes and the Verkhovna Rada adopts new laws, the influence will decrease, resulting in increasing effectiveness of the legal system. <br /><br />The effects of Soviet influence are just as apparent in the practice of law in Ukraine as it is in the formation of law. At independence, a bar association and law firms did not exist because they were not necessary under the Soviet system. Although it is somewhat amusing that one Ukrainian law firm posts &quot;One of the Oldest Law Firms in Ukraine since 1991&quot; on its website, it is certainly true. At this point, attorneys in Ukraine are concerned with discovering the law currently on the books and predicting the likelihood that the law will remain unchanged as opposed to providing an analysis of what the law actually means.<br /> <br />As Ukrainian legislation develops and moves further away from laws passed before independence, the practice of law will develop as well. Until then, attorneys will be evaluating which laws are enforced, which laws are not, and which laws are likely to remain unchanged. They will also make sure to include repeated cautions to clients that their analysis is merely a prediction and other possibilities can occur due to how quickly the law can change.<br />

		<title>ETHIOPIA: Economic Growth from a Lawyer&#039;s Perspective</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Staffer Eric Linge, Pitt Law &#39;10, from Addis Ababa...<br /><br />The Economics of Ethiopian Growth &#8212; from a legal professional&#39;s perspective<br /><br />Do you have an addiction? Do you even know you have an addiction? As American lawyers, we&#39;re addicted to easy and fast Internet, and our relied-upon webpages are our enablers: Westlaw, <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>New York Times</em>, and every PDF document you want to read. These pages pop up quickly when clicked in the U.S., but in Ethiopia &#8212; even at a government ministry with some of the fastest Internet in the country &#8212; a lawyer might as well be back to the days of 28.8 Kbps. With all their graphics and frames, these relied-upon webpages are not designed for such slow connections.<br /><br />With an IMF projected growth rate of 8.4% for 2008, Ethiopia is supposedly the fastest-growing non-oil economy in Africa. But when I&#39;m sitting at my desk, waiting for pages to load and documents to download, I am unable to produce as much in a day as I could in the U.S. And it&#39;s not just me, it&#39;s law students, lawyers, judges, and the entire legal profession, who cannot fully utilize the wealth of legal information held online. And because the government censors webpages that could portray it in a negative light, many local news sites and blogs are unavailable.<br />Also hampering a day&#39;s work are blackouts. The capital, Addis Ababa, is on a schedule of rolling blackouts where each building has power only four days a week &#8212; though government buildings always have power.<br /><br />The government adamantly maintains a monopoly on the telecommunications sector, which includes all Internet services. Ethiopia&#39;s accession to the WTO could potentially stall as the government refuses to liberalize telecoms. Of course the WTO would argue that liberalizing the sector would improve its service; webpages would load faster. Liberalizing telecoms, however, could see the government forfeiting its ability to censor the Web.<br /><br />With these impediments to workers&#39; productivity, can Ethiopia maintain its fast rate of growth? Robert Solow won the 1987 Nobel Prize in economics for his work toward developing the Solow Growth Model, which broadly (and arguably, too simplistically) explains countries&#39; economic growth by three independent variables: size of labor force, amount of capital invested (into the means of production), and productivity (technology or other factors that aid each worker to produce more output with his or her time).<br /><br />Eventually a country mobilizes its entire labor force &#8212; all able-bodied men and women are working. And eventually so much capital has been invested that to invest more would no longer increase output. In other words, a state of diminishing returns has been reached. So the only variable left to drive economic growth in the long run is productivity.<br /><br />Witness in the 1990s the United States, a mature economy with a fully mobilized labor force and thoroughly developed means of production. The economy grew at remarkably high rates for a remarkably sustained period of time. Amazing and repeated breakthroughs in information technology allowed each U.S. worker to produce more in his day than he could before he had the technology.<br /><br />Ethiopia is not a mature economy. It is a least-developed country. It has a large number of able-bodied men and women who are available and anxious to work. It has few factories, and there is capacity and desire for more capital investment. Yet its ineffective Internet connections and rolling blackouts hamper its productivity growth. Ethiopia will continue to grow economically, but as productivity is hampered, so will be its rate of growth.<br /><br />Productivity could also be improved through the strengthening of contract law. Enforcement and completion of contracts is uneven for Ethiopians and foreign investors alike. But perhaps this is the topic for another <em>Dateline</em> entry.<br />

		<title>CREW ruling incorrectly limits FOIA reach</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Anne Weismann</strong> [Chief Counsel, <a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/">Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington</a>] &quot;In <u>CREW v. Office of Administration</u>, U.S. District Court Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly issued an opinion on June 16, 2008, <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/federal-judge-dismisses-suit-seeking.php">dismissing CREW&#39;s complaint</a> on the ground that the Office of Administration (OA), a component of the Executive Office of the President (EOP), is not an agency and therefore not subject to the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oip/index.html">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA).  Although Judge Kollar-Kotelly found the agency question to be a close one, with no D.C. Circuit precedent directly on point, she concluded nevertheless that the OA is not an agency because it has no substantial independent authority separate from that which the president has given it through executive orders.<br /><br />This decision is significant and deeply troubling on a number of levels.  First, as a direct consequence of the ruling, CREW and the public are denied access to a wealth of documentation the OA prepared regarding the millions of e-mails mysteriously missing from White House servers during a two and one-half year period.  The OA first discovered that a huge volume of e-mails were missing in October 2005, and prepared hundreds of pages of materials documenting the scope and dimensions of the problem as well as a proposed plan for recovering the missing e-mail.  The White House never implemented that plan or implemented an effective electronic record keeping system that would guard against this kind of massive data loss.  The court&#39;s order sanctions continued secrecy at the White House, at a huge cost to the public.<br /><br />The decision is also troubling as a matter of law, given the actual functions that the OA performs.  The OA provides administrative support to the EOP, including all those EOP components that are agencies and are subject to the FOIA, such as the Office of Management and Budget and the Council on Environmental Quality.  In this regard, the OA is no different than agencies like the General Services Administration or agency components that provide technical support, such as those that virtually every federal agency has.  Yet simply because the OA is housed within the EOP, one district court judge has now concluded that its records are off-limits to the public.<br /><br />Congress enacted the FOIA to give the public a means of finding out what its government was up to.  Recognizing the constitutional concerns of subjecting a president to the FOIA, Congress exempted the president from the FOIA&#39;s reach.  But Congress amended the FOIA in 1974 expressly to include the EOP.  Since that time, the courts have recognized that some EOP components are the functional equivalent of the president, such that subjecting them to the FOIA would raise the same constitutional concerns as would subjecting the president to the FOIA.  Missing from the court&#39;s decision here, however, is any explanation of how subjecting the OA &#8212; an EOP component that serves all but the president &#8212; to the FOIA would raise any constitutional concerns whatsoever.  The short answer is that it would not and that, in a nutshell, is the fatal flaw in the court&#39;s decision.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.arentfox.com/people/index.cfm?fa=profile&id=214"><strong>Joseph Price</strong></a> [co-council, <u>Miller-Jenkins v. Miller-Jenkins</u>]: &quot;The four-year long <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/virginia-upholds-vermont-grant-of-same.php">Miller-Jenkins custody case</a> is the first case to test whether a state like Virginia that has passed laws (and amended its constitution) to make clear that it will not recognize same-sex legal unions from other jurisdictions, will nevertheless enforce court orders, judgments and decrees from other jurisdictions, like Vermont, Massachusetts and California, that arise out of same-sex legal unions.<br /><br />Happily for gay and lesbian couples, the Virginia Supreme Court&#39;s <a href="http://www.courts.state.va.us/opinions/opnscvwp/1070933.pdf">decision</a> makes clear that Virginia will enforce the Vermont court&#39;s orders despite the fact that the Vermont orders may have been premised in some part on a Vermont civil union. While critics of legal recognition of same-sex unions lament the decision and proclaim that Virginia is being forced to accept liberal Vermont values, in fact the unanimous Virginia Supreme Court decision simply maintains the careful balance created by the U.S. Constitution that allows states to makes their own laws but requires them to also honor the legal decisions of their sister states.<br /><br />If Virginia&#39;s Supreme Court had disregarded the Vermont court&#39;s order as inconsistent with Virginia values, it would have been a clear invitation to any person unhappy with a legal decision based on their civil union or same-sex marriage to run to Virginia to escape the decision, just as Lisa Miller tried to do in the Miller-Jenkins case. For example, a gay couple with children divorcing in Massachusetts might get a decision deciding custody and division of marital property. If either of the divorcing partners didn&#39;t like the Massachusetts&#39;s court&#39;s decision, he could simply flee to Virginia where the order would be null and void if the Virginia Supreme Court had ruled differently.<br /><br />Instead, the Virginia Supreme Court&#39;s decision precludes this by properly holding that Vermont&#39;s orders, whatever their basis, are and will be enforced in Virginia. By reaching this decision Virginia&#39;s Supreme Court has also ensured that gay and lesbian parents - and their children - will be treated just like heterosexual parents and their children, ensuring equal justice under the law.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Katherine Southwick</span> [Bernstein Fellow, <a href="http://www.refugeesinternational.org/">Refugees International</a>]: &quot;Refugees International (RI) is gravely concerned about actions taken by the Government of Egypt to <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/egypt-deporting-eritrean-refugees-in.php">deport as many as 1,200 asylum-seekers to Eritrea</a>.  Since last week, the Egyptian Government has reportedly scheduled several flights to Eritrea, taking the refugees back to the country they fled and where they face almost certain persecution or death upon their return.  During the past several months, Egypt has held these asylum-seekers in several prisons around the country.  Britain-based <a href="http://www.csw.org.uk/portal.htm">Christian Solidarity Worldwide</a> reported that they were detained without access to fresh air, sunlight, and that they were subject to beatings and sexual harassment.  They have also been denied access to the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home">United Nations High Commission for Refugees</a> (UNHCR). <br /><br />Such acts not only run against UNHCR&#39;s non-return advisory for Eritrean refugees, they also constitute brazen violations of Egypt&#39;s obligations under international law.  In 1981, Egypt ratified the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/o_c_ref.htm">United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees</a> (Refugee Convention) and the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/o_p_ref.htm">United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees</a>.  Article 33 of the Refugee Convention prohibits the expulsion or return (refoulement) of a refugee &quot;in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.&quot;  While the provision does not apply to a refugee who is reasonably believed to threaten national security or to have committed an extremely serious crime, the principle of non-refoulement is a central tenet of customary refugee law.  Moreover, the protections of the Refugee Convention apply to all refugees without discrimination.   <br /><br /><a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> reports that Egyptian authorities charged hundreds of Eritrean refugees with illegal entry and sentenced them to a &quot;suspended one-month prison term.&quot;  Under the Refugee Convention, Egypt cannot impose penalties on refugees illegally present in the country &quot;provided [the refugees] present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence&quot; (Article 31(1)).  Egypt cannot restrict the movements of such refugees &quot;other than those which are necessary . . . until their status in the country is regularized or they obtain admission into another country&quot; (Article 31(2)).  Egypt must also &quot;allow such refugees a reasonable period and all the necessary facilities to obtain admission into another country&quot; (Article 31(2)).   <br /> <br />Having recently met with Eritrean refugees living in Ethiopia and Kenya, RI found that most were escaping forced military conscription or religious persecution.  We heard reports of indefinite detention, as well as torture and death for military desertion or political opposition.  RI therefore urges the Egyptian Government to cease all returns of Eritrean refugees and affirms Amnesty International&#39;s request that Eritrean asylum-seekers be given immediate access to the UN High Commissioner for Refugeees (UNHCR) in Egypt to assess their asylum claims.&quot;<br />

		<title>EPA decision on California vehicle emission standards seems arbitrary</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.elpc.org/about/staff.php">Howard Learner</a></strong> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.elpc.org/index.php">Environmental Law &amp; Policy Center</a>]: &quot;On the transportation front, the <a href="http://epw.senate.gov/envlaws/cleanair.pdf">Clean Air Act</a> balances federal and state interests by making clear a binary approach:  states are empowered to adopt California&#39;s emission standards, if a waiver is approved by the U.S. EPA following reasonable consideration, or default to the federal standards.  Federal District Courts in California and Vermont have rejected federal preemption claims against the states taking action in light of this explicit two-pronged framework.  All of this turns, however, on the U.S. EPA giving fair consideration in granting the California waiver in appropriate cases.  Historically, the U.S. EPA has approved the California waivers.<br /><br />When the U.S. EPA appears to have engaged in scientific and policy gamesmanship in considering a waiver for California, that is not only a political issue, but a legal issue as well.  The balanced approach to preemption under this part of the Clean Air Act should not be distorted by arbitrary or unreasonable U.S. EPA review and consideration.  The <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/white-house-claims-executive-privilege.php">Bush Administration&#39;s refusal </a>to provide the U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee with access to documents that discuss and explain why the U.S. EPA refused to allow California to adopt its own emission standards adds weight to the claim that there was arbitrary and unreasonable agency action here.&quot;<br />

		<title>Habeas corpus rights for Guantanamo detainees forces executive accountability</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Shayana Kadidal</strong> [Attorney, <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a>]: &quot;It was in February of 2002 that the Center for Constitutional Rights and our co-counsel brought the first habeas case in federal court on behalf of detainees held at Guant&aacute;namo. Yesterday, June 12, 2008, the <a href="/paperchase/2008_06_12_indexarch.php#8248266403842813089">United States Supreme Court ruled</a> that the part of the Military Commissions Act that attempted to block the federal courts from hearing the claims of our clients at Guant&aacute;namo was unconstitutional. <br /><br />The Court first determined that the individuals at Guant&aacute;namo have a right under the Suspension Clause to challenge their detention, basing its decision on fundamental separation of powers principles that informed the Framers understanding of habeas, rather than on the incomplete records of historical habeas cases. The pragmatic approach it took in deciding that the writ reaches Guant&aacute;namo still leaves space for similar challenges to U.S. detention facilities elsewhere in the world. The Court then found that the DTA statute failed to provide an adequate substitute for this constitutionally-required habeas review, because it did not make release from custody available as a remedy, offered no procedures for petitioners to present new, exculpatory evidence, and denied them the ability to bring the full range of legal challenges available in a habeas proceeding.  As a result, the Court struck down the jurisdiction-stripping section of the MCA that deprived the petitioners of their constitutional right to habeas.<br /><br />We are hopeful that the lower courts will move quickly to hold hearings in the 200-odd pending individual habeas corpus cases where detainees are challenging their indefinite detention without charges.  We anticipate that many of these cases will be decided swiftly because the government lacks any factual or legal basis for imprisoning the men.  Without the Court&#39;s decision these men might have remained in detention forever without ever having a real chance to argue for their release before an impartial court. With habeas these men &#8212; so many of whom have been officially cleared for release by the military &#8212; would never have been locked up and abused because no court was watching. We believe the majority of them will be released once the executive is forced to show up in front of a federal judge and justify their detention with hard evidence.<br /><br />The government&#39;s reliance upon information obtained through torture or unlawful coercion to justify the detentions may end up being joined in many such hearings. Before the question of release is reached, other significant issues may be litigated as well: most detainees are being held in solitary confinement, including dozens who are cleared for release; most are losing their minds as a result. In habeas proceedings, petitioners should be able to argue for more humane conditions of confinement.  Many detainees are also cleared for release to countries where they may face torture; these men are basically in the position of refugees and countries that can offer them asylum will have to be found before they can be released.  Surely some will seek to block their transfer to torture in the courts. <br /><br />The decision&#39;s impact upon the pending military commission cases is indirect. It is likely those trials will continue to progress at their current halting pace. Yesterday&#39;s opinion only means that the defendants in those commissions proceedings &#8212; less than 20 men are currently charged &#8212; may commence parallel proceedings arguing that they should not have ever been detained in the first place.<br /><br />Major General Jay Hood, former commander at Guant&aacute;namo, admitted to the Wall Street Journal that &quot;[s]ometimes we just didn&#39;t get the right folks,&quot; but innocents remain at the base because &quot;[n]obody wants to be the one to sign the release papers. ... there&#39;s no muscle in the system.&quot; Historically, the federal courts have been that muscle. The Supreme Court&#39;s decision ensures that they will be. Ultimately, the administration&#39;s strategy with Guant&aacute;namo was to run out the clock and leave its mess &#8212; much like the war in Iraq &#8212; for the next president to clean up. Yesterday&#39;s decision &#8212; a historic victory for Executive accountability to the courts &#8212; will, we hope, prevent this administration from doing so.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Judith Sunderland</strong> [Researcher, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/doc/?t=europe">Europe and Central Asia Division</a>, <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a>]: &quot;On June 11, 2008, the UK House of Commons narrowly <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/uk-commons-approves-42-day-terrorism.php">approved a measure</a> giving the government the power to detain terrorism suspects for up to six weeks (42 days) without charge. Such lengthy pre-charge detention is manifestly incompatible with the UK&#39;s obligations to guarantee the fundamental right to liberty and security of the person under the European Convention for Human Rights (article 5) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (article 9). Human Rights Watch believes that the current 28-day pre-charge detention already violates this right, and the British government has not shown that extending such detention further is necessary and proportionate. <br /><br />The additional safeguards built into the new power are insufficient to meet the requirements of international law. What constitutes a &quot;grave exceptional terrorist threat&quot; - the trigger for the power - is far too open to interpretation and would not be subject to any meaningful examination. The power would lapse after 30 days, but there is no limit on how many times the power can be renewed. Parliament would be asked to approve the power within 7 days, but the legislature is not the body that should make decisions about whether to detain individuals, especially when members would not be given full information so as to avoid prejudicing future prosecutions. None of these add up to much in the way of genuine safeguards.<br /><br />Ultimately, the only meaningful oversight of pre-charge detention has to be judicial. Yet the 42-day detention scheme does not add anything to the current limited judicial supervision. A judge reviewing the detention will still not be allowed to consider whether there exist reasonable grounds to believe the individual committed a terrorist offense - the question required by international standards to determine the need for pre-trial detention. Instead, the judge is restricted to considering only whether the police are showing due diligence and the investigation requires an individual&#39;s continued detention. <br /><br />A broad spectrum of opinion opposes the measure, including the Director of Public Prosecution, a former justice minister, a former attorney general, senior police officers, civil rights groups and Muslim organizations. Shadow Home Secretary David Davis resigned as an MP after the vote, protesting that such measures eroded British civil liberties. Both the Muslim Council of Britain and former Prime Minister John Major have warned that a further extension of pre-charge detention - already the longest by far in the European Union and significantly longer than the permissible period in the United States and Canada - is likely to be counterproductive. <br /><br />It is now up to the House of Lords, the upper chamber of Parliament, to vote this dangerous measure down.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.scu.edu/law/faculty/profile/van-schaack-beth.cfm">Beth Van Schaack</a></strong> [member, <a href="http://www.asil.org/">The American Society of International Law</a>; Associate Professor of Law, <a href="http://www.scu.edu/law/">Santa Clara University School of Law</a>]: &quot;The central question facing the Supreme Court in <u><a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-guantanamo.php">Boumediene</a></u> was: to what extent does the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus extend to foreign nationals detained within the unique jurisdictional circumstances of Guant&aacute;namo? One key factor underlying the Court&#39;s ruling in  <u>Boumediene</u> that petitioners are entitled to enjoy the privilege of habeas corpus was the degree of control exercised by the United States over Guant&aacute;namo. The Court determined that although &quot;ultimate sovereignty&quot; over Guant&aacute;namo continues to reside in Cuba, the United States exercises &quot;complete jurisdiction and control&quot; (Slip Op. 23 &amp; 25). This control is &quot;absolute&quot; and &quot;indefinite&quot; (Slip Op. 38), such that Guant&aacute;namo is within the &quot;constant jurisdiction&quot; of the Untied States (Slip Op. 39). It was also dispositive that no other law applies on Guant&aacute;namo: &quot;[n]o Cuban court has jurisdiction to hear these petitioners&#39; claims, and no law other than the laws of the United States applies at the naval station (Slip Op. 21). Indeed, the Court was confident that an order from a federal court would be obeyed at Guant&aacute;namo. In so holding, the Court rejected the Government&#39;s contention that &quot;de jure sovereignty is the touchstone of habeas corpus jurisdiction&quot; (Slip Op. 25). <br /><br />In focusing not on &quot;the formal legal status&quot; of Guant&aacute;namo, but rather on &quot;the objective degree of control the United States asserted over it&quot; (Slip Op. 24), the Court&#39;s reasoning mirrored the functional approach adopted by many human rights tribunals that have addressed similar questions of the extraterritorial application of their constitutive treaties. In particular, two cases against Turkey before the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) (Loizidou v. Turkey (Preliminary Objections, Application 15318/89, Mar. 23, 1995) and Issa v. Turkey (Application 31821/96, Nov. 16, 2004)), presented the question of whether petitioners who were injured outside of Turkish territory had standing to invoke the protections of the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm">European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms</a> (Convention). Article 1 of this treaty mandates that state parties are to &quot;secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms&quot; set forth within the Convention (emphasis mine). <br /><br />In both cases, the ECHR ruled that state responsibility could be incurred in situations in which Turkey exercised &quot;effective control&quot; over areas outside its national territory (in Northern Cyprus and Northern Iraq). The ECHR emphasized that the obligation to secure the Convention&#39;s rights and freedoms is not restricted to the respondent state&#39;s national territory (Loizidou &Acirc;&para;62) but rather extends to territory in which Turkish forces directly, or through a local administration, exercised effective control over the area as a result of military action (lawful or unlawful) (Id. &Acirc;&para;62). In Issa, the ECHR extended the reach of the Convention even farther when it ruled that &quot;detailed control over the policies and the authorities in the area&quot; was not necessary to engage state responsibility; rather, it may be enough that the state exercised &quot;even overall control&quot; over the area (Issa &Acirc;&para;70), albeit temporarily (&Acirc;&para;74), or that the victims were &quot;under the State&#39;s authority and control through its agents operating - whether lawfully or unlawfully - in&quot; the other state (&Acirc;&para;71). (As we know from the Tadi&Auml;&#8225; case, the overall control test is a less exacting one than the effective control test articulated in Nicaragua v. United States.) The ECHR asserted that Article 1 must be interpreted to prohibit a state from perpetrating violations in another state that it could not perpetrate on its own territory (&Acirc;&para;71). In Loizidou, the ECHR hinted that part of its rationale stemmed from the fact that Cyprus, although a Contracting State, was incapable of securing the Convention rights and freedoms in the particular territory because of the exclusive control exercised by Turkey, which would have left a vacuum in regional human rights protection within Europe - the espace juridique of the Convention (&Acirc;&para;80). This consideration - that the Convention would have otherwise applied in Cyprus - was not present in the N. Iraq case.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/a_ccpr.htm">The International Covenant on Civil &amp; Political Rights</a>, a universal human rights treaty to which the United States is a party, states at Article 2(1) that the Covenant applies to &quot;all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction.&quot; The Human Rights Committee (HRC), charged with the interpretation and enforcement of the Covenant, has taken a progressive and teleological approach to the interpretation of this provision. In Burgos/Delia Saldias de Lopez v. Uruguay (Communication No. 52/1979 (July 29, 1981), U.N. Doc. CCPR/C/OP/1 (1984)), the HRC found Uruguay responsible for the abduction and mistreatment of a Uruguayan citizen who had sought refuge in Argentina. The Committee reasoned that Article 2(1) encompasses actions that state agents commit upon the territory of another state (&Acirc;&para;12.3) and that the concept of &quot;jurisdiction&quot; relates not to the place where the violation occurred, &quot;but rather to the relationship between the individual and the State&quot; with respect to the alleged violation, wherever it occurred (&Acirc;&para;12.2). Lest this opinion be interpreted to turn on the fact of the Uruguayan nationality of the petitioner, the HRC subsequently clarified in a General Comment (No. 31) that the duties to respect and ensure the rights set forth in the Covenant extend to all persons &quot;within the power or effective control&quot; of state parties and their agents, even if the individuals are not situated within the territory of the state party (&Acirc;&para;10). By this interpretation, Article 2(1) is addressed to two different classes of individual: those within the territory of the state party and those within the jurisdiction of the state party. Notwithstanding these authoritative interpretations of this provision, the U.S. government has consistently argued that Article 2(1) cannot be applied in the disjunctive (territory or jurisdiction), because it is formulated in the conjunctive (territory and jurisdiction). This reading, however, renders the jurisdiction clause superfluous, because anyone in the territory of the state would be automatically within its jurisdiction. <br /><br />With the exception of a short foray into the multifaceted nature of state sovereignty, the <u>Boumediene,</u> opinion is entirely devoid of any reference to international law as the questions presented were fully able to be resolved through a determination of the constitutional reach of the privilege of habeas corpus. Nonetheless, there are openings in the Court&#39;s opinion where the universal human right to judicial review might have entered the Court&#39;s consideration. In particular, the Court eschewed a purely originalist or historical approach to understanding the contemporary reach of habeas rights by noting the potential for the protections of the Suspension Clause to expand along with post-1789 developments (Slip Op. 15-16). The codification of rights to habeas corpus and its equivalents (e.g., amparo) in the omnibus human rights treaties represents one important modern development that provides international law fortification to the Court&#39;s ruling. <br /><br />Although unacknowledged, the <u>Boumediene</u> opinion reveals a striking degree of doctrinal convergence between human rights and U.S. Constitutional jurisprudence. As every first year law student knows, jurisdiction means power. When a state&#39;s power extends beyond its territorial borders, as is inevitable in our globalizing world, it brings certain rights and obligations in its wake. In <u>Boumediene</u>, the Court joined the human rights tribunals in concluding that states cannot escape these rights and obligations simply by acting extraterritorially.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Kim Soo A </strong>[Nepal desk, <a href="http://www.ahrchk.net/index.php">Asian Human Rights Commission</a>]: &quot;First of all, I congratulate the people of Nepal on its transition into a Secular, Federal Democratic Republic. The declaration made on 28 May 2008 by the Constituent Assembly of Nepal is a remarkable milestone in Nepal&#39;s history and is the success of democracy and democratic values.<br /><br />Transformation of a state from monarchy to a democratic republic is <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/nepal-bans-protests-around-royal.php">not an easy task in theory as well as in practice</a>. The process is more difficult especially when the pre-transition period was marked by violence. To make matters complicated Nepal was a Hindu kingdom where inequality was the norm, with feudalism and caste based discrimination literally segregating the people into non-combinable socio-political veins. These practices coupled with centuries of maladministration have also considerably exhausted Nepal&#39;s financial reserves. Yet Nepal and its people have emerged as a successful nation with a resolve to get away from the past and to create a new future.<br /><br />The Constituent Assembly of Nepal is embarked upon a highly responsible task of drafting a basic law for the new republic. This process need to be an all-inclusive process in letter and spirit since the future of the republic and its people depends on it.<br /><br />With a considerably large number of ethnic communities living and interacting within a limited geographical expanse, it is a difficult yet achievable task, to bring these communities together under a unified code ensuring equality and fairness. Therefore, the discussions and decisions of the Constituent Assembly of Nepal should reflect the political acumen, legislative draftsmanship and the statesmanship of its members, exercised with a view for the betterment of Nepal and its people.<br /><br />Countries like Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Myanmar are examples that showcase how fast a state can plunge into utter lawlessness due to the short-sightedness of its administrators. Whereas India is an example to a country that underperforms even if a country has a good constitutional framework. The statesmen in Nepal must keep their eyes open to save Nepal from following the destiny of Nepal&#39;s neighbours.<br /><br />The monarchy that existed in Nepal has literally wiped off the institutional framework within which a democracy can function. The civil war like situation that existed in Nepal burdened with corruption and neglect by the former administrations has literally paralysed the functioning of the law enforcement mechanisms in Nepal. For example the functionality of the police department, correctional institutions and the courts in Nepal is hampered due to the absence of even the basic infrastructure to function. This has also brought down the morale of the officers posted in these government services to a considerable extent. Without a proper law enforcement mechanism no democracy can function or evolve.<br /><br />The Constituent Assembly of Nepal while discussing and debating on drafting a basic law for Nepal must also ensure that these justice institutions also are rejuvenated without any further delay with a new life so that it meets the expectations of the ordinary people. Such rejuvenation is a prerequisite to facilitate a smooth process of transitional justice in Nepal.<br /><br />While Nepal is embarked upon its new destiny as a republic and its people expecting a new life within Nepal, it is also the responsibility of Nepal&#39;s neighbours, particularly India, to be of good assistance to Nepal in the process of establishing a fully functional democracy in the country. The international community like the United Nations should get more involved in providing all necessary assistance to Nepal, by thoroughly understanding what Nepal is and what it requires, than from forcing anything that is foreign to Nepal. It is also equally the responsibility of the people of Nepal and its civil society to cooperate with the Constituent Assembly and also to guide it to lay the strong foundations for a true Secular, Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal.&quot;<br />

		<title>Texas death penalty out of step with public attitudes in post-Baze America</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Bryan McCann</span> [member, <a href="http://nodeathpenalty.org/content/index.php">Campaign to End the Death Penalty</a>,<a href="http://www.myspace.com/cedpaustin"> Austin, TX Chapter</a>]: &quot;When the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the <u><a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-5439.pdf">Baze v. Rees</a></u> [opinion, PDF; JURIST news <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/supreme-court-upholds-kentucky-lethal.php">archive</a>] case that Kentucky&#39;s lethal injection protocol did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, death penalty opponents everywhere braced for the resumption of state-sanctioned killing.  Those of us who organize against the death penalty in Texas were particularly expecting our state government to resume executions in earnest, given the Lone Star State&#39;s reputation for the <a href="http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/stat/executedoffenders.htm">busiest death row in the nation</a> [Texas Department of Criminal Justice, &quot;Executed Offenders&quot;].  Following an eight-month de-facto national moratorium on executions as states awaited the <u>Baze</u> decision, Texas planned to resume its macabre style of frontier justice on June 3 with the execution of Derrick Sonnier.<br /><br />Yet, as June 3 came and death penalty opponents gathered before the State Capitol to protest, <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/texassouthwest/stories/DN-execution_04tex.ART.State.Edition1.460e0f9.html">we learned that Mr. Sonnier would not die</a> [Dallas News report].  His lawyers successfully argued before the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals that that state&#39;s own changes in its lethal injection procedures had not undergone sufficient judicial scrutiny.  This fleeting moment of relief, however, would change to an all-to-familiar sadness and outrage as <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/texas-holds-first-execution-since.php">Karl Chamberlain entered the execution room</a> in Huntsville, Texas as <a href="http://www.itemonline.com/archivesearch/local_story_163235347.html">his mother stood outside the infamous &quot;Walls Unit&quot; to protest her son&#39;s death</a>.<br /><br />Karl Chamberlain was sentenced to death for the 1991 rape and murder of his neighbor.  A white male, <a href="http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/stat/chamberlainkarllast.html">Chamberlain expressed remorse</a> for his crime as he lay on the gurney.  The presence of protesters in Huntsville, Austin, and other locations in Texas notwithstanding, his was not a high profile execution.  Yet, as Texas&#39; machinery of death appears once again to be fully functional with <a href="http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/stat/scheduledexecutions.htm">fourteen scheduled executions</a> [Texas Department of Criminal Justice, &quot;Scheduled Executions&quot;] through October, the occasion of Mr. Chamberlain&#39;s death requires analysis.  Now that Texas has ended its 406th life since 1982, how might we speculate on the future of capital punishment in Texas and elsewhere?<br /><br />As I stood at the rally for the scheduled execution of Derrick Sonnier, having already heard the news of his stay, I spoke with Akwesi Evans of the African American community newspaper <span style="font-style:italic;"><a href="http://www.nokoatheobserver.com/joomla2/">Nokoa</a></span>.  He commented that he doubted Texas would have treaded so carefully if Sonnier had faced the needle several years earlier.  While there is no telling whether Sonnier&#39;s lawyers&#39; arguments would have been more or less successful in, say, 2005 than 2008, I believe there is an underlying truth to Evans&#39; remarks.  Things are changing in Texas, as they are throughout the nation.  <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?did=209">Public opinion continues to turn against the death penalty</a>.  While a majority of Americans continue to support the sanction, they represent a far smaller percentage than in previous decades.  Since former Governor George Ryan cleared Illinois&#39; death row in 2003, the public is acutely concerned about the possibility of sending an innocent person to their death.  Though the Supreme Court appears to have affirmed the use of capital punishment across the nation, other states have begun to question their use of the sanction.  Most notably, the <a href="http://64.41.216.61/paperchase/2007/12/new-jersey-assembly-passes-death.php">New Jersey legislature</a> [JURIST news archive] passed and the <a href="http://64.41.216.61/paperchase/2007/12/new-jersey-governor-signs-bill.php">governor signed</a> [JURIST news archive] a bill abolishing the death penalty.<br /><br />Even the Texas death penalty has shown signs of weakness.  Last summer, a small group of family members and anti-death penalty organizers waged an unlikely battle against the impending <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/31/us/31execute.html?_r=3&hp=&adxnnl=1&oref=slogin&adxnnlx=1213765589-c/wOjC/wf/U1qd6It4adTw">execution of Kenneth Foster, Jr</a> &#39;[NYT article].  We captured international attention and won.  Kenneth is now serving a life term and may one day be paroled.  The same Court of Criminal Appeals that granted Derrick Sonnier a stay has been under intense national scrutiny, especially after <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/25/us/25execute.html">Presiding Judge Sharon Keller</a> [NYT article] refused on September 25 to keep the court open 20 minutes late to allow Michael Richard&#39;s attorneys to recover from computer problems and file his last appeal.  This appeal, of course, was based on the pending <u>Baze</u> case that would temporarily halt executions across the country.  Richard would die at precisely the moment when the rest of the nation was halting executions and awaiting the High Court&#39;s decision on lethal injection.  Individual high profile cases like those of <a href="http://www.freerodneyreed.org/who.html">Rodney Reed</a> [advocacy website] - a black man <a href="http://www.kxan.com/Global/story.asp?S=8355591">sentenced to death</a> [news report] for murdering the white fianc&eacute; of a notoriously violent white police officer, and the so-called &quot;<a href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid:613673">Yogurt Shop Murders</a>&quot; - two men convicted for a quadruple homicide after a reckless and politically-charged eight-year investigation, as well as the disgraceful resignation of Houston&#39;s <a href="http://www.click2houston.com/news/15313713/detail.html">District Attorney Chuck Rosenthal</a> [news report], continue to highlight deep flaws in the structures of criminal justice in Texas.<br /><br />Since receiving his stay, Derrick Sonnier learned his new execution date is July 23.  This chilling fact, the haunting image of Karl Chamberlain&#39;s mother grieving her son just feet away from his ritualistic death, and the unwavering pace at which Texas plans to reclaim its status as the &quot;Belly of the Beast&quot; all seem causes for pessimism and defeat. Yet, embedded within the obvious tragedies that take place as a matter of public policy on Texas&#39; death row and others are reasons to be hopeful. As I type this, an email appeared in my inbox announcing that a State District Judge has withdrawn the execution order for <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/06/17/america/NA-GEN-US-Texas-Execution.php">Charles Dean Hood</a>, who was scheduled to receive a lethal injection in about half an hour.  The death penalty is on the defensive in a way it has not been since it was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court amid the movements and struggles of the early 1970s.  Slowly but surely, ordinary people are recognizing the death penalty for what it is: a barbaric, <a href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid:632205">racist</a> practice that <a href="http://deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?did=896&scid=68">almost always punishes the poor</a>, sentences the innocent to die, and <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?&did=2374">fails to prevent crime</a>.  Though we are right to mourn the loss of Karl Chamberlain and others that Texas will poison in the name of justice, we should remain encouraged and motivated by the fact that even the state that executes more than the rest of the states combined is doing so with more caution and more fear of an increasingly disapproving citizenry.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Richard C. Dieter</strong> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org">Death Penalty Information Center</a>]: &quot;The Supreme Court&#39;s decision in <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-5439.pdf">Baze v. Rees</a> on April 16, 2008, <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/supreme-court-upholds-kentucky-lethal.php">approving Kentucky&#39;s lethal injection process</a> [Hotline <a href="/hotline/2008/04/death-penalty-debate-still-alive-after.php">archive</a>] opened the door to a resumption of executions.  Since the decision, six executions have taken place, all in the south and all by lethal injection.  Many of these cases raised questions that have continuously accompanied the death penalty: charges of racism, inadequate representation and mental illness. Two commutations were granted, one in Georgia and one in Virginia, but over 20 other executions are scheduled between now and October.  <br /><br />The next execution is likely to be in Texas where Charles Hood is scheduled to die on June 17.  His attorneys have filed an appeal with new information that the judge and the prosecutor at the original trial were having an affair, creating a serious conflict of interest.  The appeal was filed with the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, which recently established a Criminal Justice Integrity Unit, and a request for a reprieve has been sent to the governor.&quot;<br />

Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (KSM), Walid Muhammad Salih Mubarek bin Attash, Ramzi bin al Shibh, Ali Abdul Aziz Ali (aka Ammar al Baluchi), and Mustafa Ahmed Adam al Hawsawi [Human Rights First <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.info/pdf/080528-USLS-sept11-defendants.pdf">profiles</a>, pdf] were arraigned in a proceeding marked by intimidation, secrecy, and an undermining of the American justice system. <br /><br />The arraignment took place 6 years after the <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">September 11 attacks </a>[JURIST news archive] which resulted in the deaths of 2,973 people in the United States. Most of the defendants were captured either in 2002 and 2003 and held for years in secret CIA custody and not transferred to Guantanamo till September 2006. CIA Director Michael Hayden in February 2008 admitted that <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/cia-chief-confirms-use-of-waterboarding.php">Mohammed had been waterboarded </a>[JURIST news archive], a form of mock drowning. Others have reportedly been subjected to prolonged stress positions, sleep deprivation, and forced nudity.<br /><br />I, along with other human rights observers, watched politics at play both by the government and the lead defendant, whose interests appeared to be eerily aligned. The government is bent on expeditiously executing the defendants and some of the defendants wish to be martyred. We sat behind a soundproof viewing gallery so that the audio sound could be cut off to protect &quot;classified&quot; information. We had a 20 second delay in the audio transmission and four times the audio feed was terminated. On each of those occasions, defendants were discussing issues about their treatment in custody. KSM was aware of the limitations of what could be said and he told the court that there was a &quot;red line&quot; and that he could not talk about &quot;torture&quot; and mention the &quot;country names&quot; of places where he was detained. <br /><br />The censor, however, went off when Ramzi bin al Shibh began talking about taking psychotropic medication at Guantanamo. The audio was cut off again when Baluchi told the court that the hearing was &quot;unfair and unjust&quot; and that if the court was serious about a lawyer he should have been given one 5 years ago when he was arrested. As he started to describe the day of his arrest the &quot;red line&quot; was indeed crossed and we heard static for nearly 2 minutes. Baluchi also managed to raise the issue of abuse without being censored when he expressed skepticism at the government&#39;s desire to provide him military lawyers &quot;free of charge&quot; since the &quot;the government tortured [him] free of charge all these years.&quot;<br /><br />Everything that the September 11, and other former CIA prisoners, say is presumptively classified. Thus, any information about their treatment, including abuse, in custody is classified. Understandably, classified information needs to be protected from the public for national security reasons. But torture and cruel treatment and other acts of illegality by or at the behest of the U.S. government should not be classified. But the government has chosen the cloak of national security to shield abusive conduct.<br /><br />Aside from the issues of torture, most of the hearing was about the defendants&#39; competency in choosing legal representation. Counsel for the defendants filed two motions for a continuance of the arraignment in order to have adequate time to meet their clients and build rapport with the defendants. After 5 years of detention without any contact with the outside world, the defendants&#39; first contact with lawyers was with men and women in military uniform. The uniform understandably creates hurdles in building rapport and gaining trust to facilitate attorney-client relationships. Detailed military counsel, however, were appointed for many of the defendants only in the last month and they spent very few hours with their clients due to delays in getting security clearances. A military counsel for Hawsawi was only granted a security clearance the night before the hearing. Civilian defense counsel have spent even less time with the defendants; most met their clients just two days prior to their arraignment. Yet Marine Judge Col. Ralph Kohlmann refused to grant a basic request for an extension. <br /><br />Defense filed two motions for continuances prior to June 5, and both were denied. During the court proceedings, military and civilian defense counsel repeatedly argued that more time was needed to talk with their clients to explain the gravity of the decision regarding representation in capital cases. Each request was denied. In fact, the judge was not interested in hearing defense counsel and repeatedly told them to &quot;sit down.&quot;<br /><br />The American Bar Association (ABA) <a href="http://www.nacdl.org/sl_docs.nsf/issues/ABADPGuidelines/$FILE/ABA_DPGuidelines2003.pdf">guidelines for capital cases </a>[pdf] recommend two lawyers with death penalty experience and a mitigation expert. This point was raised by both military and civilian defense counsel, but the judge was not persuaded. At one point, one of the defendants - Ammar al Baluchi - when being questioned about choice of counsel asked the court, &quot;If my case is a capital case shouldn&#39;t I have a capital defense team before my arraignment?&quot; Judge Kohlmann responded, &quot;This is not a MCA (military commission act) rule.&quot; [Human Rights First MCA <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/detainees/militarytribunals.htm">backgrounder</a>]<br /><br />Prior to our arrival at the courtroom, we learned that the defendants who had not communicated with each other in the same room for over 5 years were allowed to &quot;meet and greet&quot; in the courtroom before the proceedings began. The co-defendants sitting in rows behind each other were in fact allowed to talk to each other throughout the day. KSM appeared to be the self-appointed &quot;General Counsel&quot; of the defendants and shouted instructions at the co-defendants. At one point when Ramzi bin Al Shibh was confused when the judge asked whether he wished to have charges read in court, KSM turned around to Shibh sitting two desks behind him and instructed &quot;No.&quot; Shibh then said, &quot;No&quot; and the judge accepted the decision. <br /><br />The impact of co-defendants being allowed to talk with each other was evident at the end of the day when Major John Jackson, who represents Ahmed Hawsawi, stood up and told the court that his client was intimidated by the co-defendants into opting for self-representation and that Hawsawi &quot;was shaking&quot; during the hearing. This was contrary to the indication that Hawsawi had given Major Jackson who had tried to gain his client&#39;s trust prior to the proceeding and was told that he would accept counsel representation. Major Jackson told the court that during the day KSM told Hawsawi, &quot;Are you in the American army now?&quot; It was clear that the intent was to intimidate Hawsawi into rejecting counsel.<br /><br />Lt. Cmdr. Brian Mizer similarly told the court that his client Baluchi had wanted counsel to represent him, but after observing how other co-defendants were following KSM&#39;s lead he too opted for self-representation. At 5:00 pm Judge Kohlmann ordered the defendants to stop communicating with each other. But the damage was done. All five chose to represent themselves. Judge Kohlmann held off on determining whether Hawsawi and Shibh&#39;s decisions were voluntary. Shibh&#39;s lawyers told the court that they had learned at 9:00 pm on June 4 that Shibh was taking psychotropic drugs, which could affect his cognitive ability to make his decision on election of counsel.<br /><br />It is a right of a defendant to knowingly and voluntarily accept legal counsel, but voluntariness must be based on knowing the full consequences of what one is doing. On June 5 this did not happen.<br /><br />It is unprecedented for co-conspirators in a criminal trial to be allowed to mingle and talk to each other. It is unprecedented for a defendant to shout instructions to other co-defendants and for the judge to accept this behavior in the courtroom. It is unprecedented that evidence obtained through torture and ill-treatment prior to 2006 is admissible provided there is probative value. It is unprecedented that even defense counsel can be denied access to view some evidence deemed by the government as classified in the pre-trial stage. It is unprecedented that an American court will be subject to political influence as has been alleged by former military commissions prosecutors. But this is the military commissions proceedings at Guantanamo. <br /><br />Rather than treat the September 11 defendants as criminals and prosecute them either in a federal court or court-martial where the focus will be on the crimes and not the legitimacy of the proceedings, the government has created a flawed system that does not do justice to the victims of September 11. KSM and some of the co-defendants on June 5th expressed that they wished to be martyrs. The United States is hell bent in making them martyrs by shuttling them to their execution date without due process.<br /><br />It is true that prosecution of terrorism cases in federal courts, which has a proven track record in prosecuting terrorism cases while protecting national security, has had its challenges as defendants in some terrorism cases have railed against the U.S. and tried to disrupt the proceedings. But in Guantanamo, the mockery of the American justice system, by denying defendants fundamental elements of due process, is being done by the United States government itself.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><em>&quot;Report from Guantanamo&quot; features regular contributions to JURIST Hotline from <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org">Human Rights First</a></em><br />

		<title>The Last Extension of Emergency Law in Egypt?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/internationalstudies/moustafa.html">Tamir Moustafa</a> of Simon Fraser University in Canada says that although the Egyptian government&#39;s recent extension of the emergency law may be the last in a string of renewals over the past half-century, this does not have pro-democracy activists dancing in the streets... <br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/tamirmoustafa.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>L</strong></font>ate last month, the Egyptian government extended its emergency law for another two-year period, this time through May of 2010.  The emergency law, which has been in force almost continuously for the past half century, is one of the principal ways that the Egyptian government maintains its control over opposition.  Among other measures, the emergency law prohibits public gatherings, enables the police to detain citizens without charge, and provides for trial before emergency state security courts.   <br /><br />Like clockwork, this state of emergency has been continuously extended in order to maintain the regime's grip on power.  However, the periodic renewal of emergency powers may finally be in its last cycle for the first time in a half-century.  You might think that pro-democracy advocates are celebrating in the streets of Cairo, but they are not. <br /><br />Here's why:  Beginning in 2005, President Hosni Mubarak and his ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) began pushing through dozens of political reforms.  All were packaged as progressive openings in the political system.  In reality, they have done quite the opposite. <br /><br />Take the first multiparty Presidential elections in 2005.  Framed as a historic step, the actual nomination procedures as they now stand require a threshold so high that it is unlikely any parties will qualify to run candidates in 2011.  And the leading candidate from the 2005 Presidential election?  He's still in jail.  <br /><br />Similarly, President Mubarak promised that he will abolish the emergency powers that have been in force for the entire 27 years of his presidency.  He may hold true to this commitment before the current emergency law expires, but if this comes to pass it is only because the regime will have completed a fundamental reengineering of a more foolproof legal system. <br /><br />For at least two decades, the ruling NDP has progressively moved aspects of the emergency law into other areas of the legal code.  Opposition parties, human rights groups, and civil society activists used the Egyptian court system throughout this process to fight the web of illiberal legislation spun out by the ruling National Democratic Party. They often achieved surprising legal victories. <br /><br />But in the past seven years the legal battle became progressively more difficult.  The Egyptian Supreme Constitutional Court lost much of its mettle when it was packed in 2001, and the ability of rights groups to effectively challenge government legislation was lost in the process.  More worrisome for the long term has been the government's initiative to embed the most draconian aspects of the emergency law right into the Constitution itself.  The most egregious example of this is Article 174 of the Constitution, amended in 2007, which now provides the President with the power to transfer all terrorism-related cases from the regular judiciary to military courts.  What was once a procedure governed by a legal statute is now melded into the fabric of the Constitution.  A new terrorism law, due out sometime this year or next, will also most likely be drafted with loose and ambiguous language, allowing for the effective transfer of all political opponents into parallel legal tracks with fewer due process rights. <br /><br />All of this has made opposition activists nervous indeed.  Already, activists of all stripes have felt the sting of the emergency state security courts.  And despite the fact that the Muslim Brotherhood renounces violence and has worked for change within the political system (they hold nearly all of the opposition seats in the People's Assembly), they are periodically detained without trial and taken before military tribunals.  <br /><br />In many regards, the Egyptian story is similar to that of other states in the current wave of authoritarian consolidation.  Like Russia, Venezuela, and others, the Egyptian regime has not cast aside law and legal institutions.  Instead, the regime has actually made "rule by law" a central instrument of political control, going so far as to entrench these changes in the Constitution. <br /><br />If and when the Egyptian government stops renewing its state of emergency, it should not be viewed as a mark of progress.  Rather, it will indicate that a fundamental illiberal reengineering is complete. <br /><br /> <br /><em>Tamir Moustafa is Associate Professor of International Studies at Simon Fraser University, British Columbia, Canada.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.tjsl.edu/faculty_m_cohn">Marjorie Cohn</a> of Thomas Jefferson School of Law says that by upholding habeas corpus rights for Guantanamo detainees in <em>Boumediene</em>, the US Supreme Court has fulfilled its constitutional duty to check and balance the other two branches of government, discharging its mandate to interpret the Constitution and say &quot;what the law is&quot;...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/cohncolor.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>fter the Supreme Court handed down its long-awaited opinion upholding habeas corpus rights for the Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo detainees, I was invited to appear on <em>The O&#39;Reilly Factor</em> with guest host Laura Ingraham. Although she is a lawyer and former law clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas, Ingraham has no use for our judicial branch of government, noting that the justices are &quot;unelected.&quot;  Indeed, she advocated that Bush break the law and disregard the Court&#39;s decision in <em>Boumediene v. Bush</em>:<blockquote>Marjorie, I was trying to think to myself, look, if I were President Bush, and I had heard that this case had come down, and I&#39;m out of office in a few months. My ratings, my popularity ratings are pretty low, I would have said at this point, that&#39;s very interesting that the court decided this, but I&#39;m not going to respect the decision of the court because my job is to keep this country safe.</blockquote>What did the Court decide that so incensed Ingraham (who has just been rewarded for her &quot;fair and balanced&quot; views with her own show on Fox News)? Will this decision really imperil our safety? And will <em>Boumediene</em> become an issue in the presidential election?<br /><br />The Supreme Court held in a 5-4 ruling that the Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo detainees have a constitutional right to habeas corpus, and that the scheme for reviewing &#39;enemy combatant&#39; designations under the Combatant Status Review Tribunals is an inadequate substitute for habeas corpus, a result I predicted in a <a href="http://marjoriecohn.com/2007/12/guantnamo-detainees-fate-at-stake-in.html">December 3, 2007 article</a>.  <br /><br /><strong>A constitutional right to habeas corpus for Guantanamo detainees</strong><br /><br />Article 1, Section 9, Clause 2 of the Constitution is known as the Suspension Clause. It reads, &quot;The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.&quot; In section 7(a) of the Military Commissions Act of 2006, Congress purported to strip habeas rights from the Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo detainees by amending the habeas corpus statute (28 U.S.C.A. &Acirc;&#167; 2241(e)). In <em>Boumediene</em>, the Court held that section of the Act to be unconstitutional, declaring that the detainees still retained the constitutional right to habeas corpus. <br /><br />Justice Kennedy, writing for the majority, reiterated the Court&#39;s finding in <em>Rasul v. Bush</em> that although Cuba retains technical sovereignty over Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo, the United States exercises complete jurisdiction and control over its naval base and thus the Constitution protects the detainees there. Kennedy rejected &quot;the necessary implication&quot; of Bush&#39;s position that the political branches could &quot;govern without legal restraint&quot; by locating a U.S. military base in a country that retained formal sovereignty over the area. In his dissent, Chief Justice Roberts flippantly characterized Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo as a &quot;jurisdictionally quirky outpost.&quot; <br /><br />Kennedy worried that the political branches could &quot;have the power to switch the Constitution on or off at will&quot; which &quot;would lead to a regime in which they, not this Court, say &#39;what the law is.&#39;&quot; &quot;Even when the United States acts outside its borders,&quot; Kennedy wrote, &quot;its powers are not &#39;absolute and unlimited&#39; but are subject &#39;to such restrictions as are expressed in the Constitution.&#39;&quot;<br /><br />Thus, Kennedy observed, &quot;the writ of habeas corpus is itself an indispensable mechanism for monitoring the separation of powers.&quot; Indeed, habeas corpus was one of the few individual rights the Founding Fathers wrote it into the original Constitution, years before they enacted the Bill of Rights.<br /><br />&quot;The test for determining the scope of [the habeas corpus] provision,&quot; Kennedy wrote, &quot;must not be subject to manipulation by those whose power it is designed to restrain.&quot; It is such manipulation that Laura Ingraham would perpetuate. It was a Republican-controlled Congress, working hand-in-glove with Bush, that tried to strip habeas corpus rights from the Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo detainees in the Military Commissions Act. The Supreme Court has determined that effort to be unconstitutional. Fulfilling its constitutional duty to check and balance the other two branches, the Court has carried out its mandate to interpret the Constitution and say &quot;what the law is.&quot;<br /><br /><strong>No adequate substitute for habeas corpus</strong><br /><br />Finding that the Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo detainees retained the constitutional right to habeas corpus, the Court turned to the issue of whether there was an adequate substitute for habeas review. Bush established Combatant Status Review Tribunals (&quot;CSRTs&quot;) to determine whether a detainee is an &quot;enemy combatant.&quot; These kangaroo courts provide no right to counsel, only a &quot;personal representative,&quot; who owes no duty of confidentiality to his client and often doesn&#39;t even advocate on behalf of the detainee; one even argued the government&#39;s case. The detainee doesn&#39;t have the right to see much of the evidence against him and is very limited in the evidence he can present. <br /><br />The CSRTs have been criticized by military participants in the process. Lt. Col. Stephen Abraham, a veteran of U.S. intelligence, said they often relied on &quot;generic&quot; evidence and were set up to rubber-stamp the &quot;enemy combatant&quot; designation. When he sat as a judge in one of the tribunals, Abraham and the other two judges - a colonel and a major in the Air Force - &quot;found the information presented to lack substance&quot; and noted that statements presented as factual &quot;lacked even the most fundamental earmarks of objectively credible evidence.&quot; After they determined there was &quot;no factual basis&quot; to conclude the detainee was an enemy combatant, the government pressured them to change their conclusion but they refused. Abraham was never assigned to another CSRT panel. It is widely believed that Abraham&#39;s affidavit about the shortcomings of the CSRT&#39;s in <em>Boumediene</em>&#39;s companion case caused the Supreme Court to reverse its denial of certiorari and agree to review <em>Boumediene</em>. This was the first time in 60 years the Court had so reversed itself.<br /><br />While the Court declined to decide whether the CSRTs satisfied due process standards, it concluded that &quot;even when all the parties involved in this process act with diligence and in good faith, there is considerable risk of error in the tribunal&#39;s findings of fact.&quot; The Court then had to determine whether the procedure for judicial review of the CSRTs&#39; &quot;enemy combatant&quot; designations constituted an adequate substitute for habeas corpus review.<br /><br />&quot;For the writ of habeas corpus, or its substitute, to function as an effective and proper remedy in this context,&quot; Kennedy wrote, &quot;the court that conducts the habeas proceeding must have the means to correct errors that occurred during the CSRT proceedings. This includes some authority to assess the sufficiency of
 the Government&#39;s evidence against the detainee. It also must have the authority to admit and consider relevant exculpatory evidence that was not introduced during the earlier proceeding.&quot; <br /><br />But in the Detainee Treatment Act (&quot;DTA&quot;), Congress limited district court review of the CSRT determinations to whether the CSRT complied with its own procedures. The district court had no authority to hear newly discovered evidence or make a finding that the detainee was improperly designated as an enemy combatant.<br /><br />The Supreme Court noted that &quot;when the judicial power to issue habeas corpus properly is invoked the judicial officer must have adequate authority to make a determination in light of the relevant law and facts and to formulate and issue appropriate orders for relief, including, if necessary, an order directing the prisoner&#39;s release.&quot; Since the DTA&#39;s scheme for reviewing determinations of the CSRTs did not afford this authority, the Court held it was not an adequate substitute for habeas corpus and thus section 7 of the Military Commissions Act acted as &quot;an unconstitutional suspension of the writ.&quot;<br /><br /><strong><em>Boumediene</em> will not imperil the United States</strong><br /><br />In his dissent, Justice Scalia sounded the alarm that the <em>Boumediene</em> decision &quot;will almost certainly cause more Americans to be killed.&quot; Likewise, the <em>Wall St. Journal</em> editorialized, &quot;We can say with confident horror that more Americans are likely to die as a result.&quot; Their predictions, however, are not based in fact.<br /><br />Lakhdar Boumediene and five other Algerian detainees from Bosnia were accused of threatening to blow up an embassy in Bosnia. The Supreme Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina concluded there was no evidence to continue to detain them and ordered them released. The Bosnian officials turned them over to the United States and they were transported to Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo, where they have languished since 2002.<br /><br />Many of the men and boys at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo were sold as bounty to the U.S. military by the Northern Alliance or warlords for $5,000 a head. Indeed, Maj. Gen. Jay Hood, the former commander at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo, admitted to the <em>Wall St. Journal</em>, &quot;Sometimes we just didn&#39;t get the right folks,&quot; but innocent men remain detained there because &quot;[n]obody wants to be the one to sign the release papers . . . there&#39;s no muscle in the system.&quot;<br /><br />The <em>Boumediene</em> decision will not directly impact the criminal cases against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and the few others who will be tried in the military commissions. It is the 211 men who have filed habeas corpus petitions challenging their &quot;enemy combatant&quot; designations who will benefit from this ruling. No one will be automatically released. They will simply be afforded a fair hearing. Most Americans would not object to a requirement that our government fairly prove someone guilty before we imprison him indefinitely.<br /><br />Even Justice Jackson, the chief prosecutor at Nuremberg, advocated due process for the Nazi leaders. &quot;The ultimate principle,&quot; he said, &quot;is that you must put no man on trial under the forms of judicial proceedings if you are not willing to see him freed if not proven guilty.&quot; Jackson understood the importance of the presumption of innocence in our system of law.<br /><br />Kennedy quoted Alexander Hamilton, who wrote in <em>Federalist 84</em> that &quot;arbitrary imprisonments have been, in all ages, the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny.&quot; Justice Souter cut to the chase in his separate opinion, citing &quot;the length of the disputed imprisonments, some of the prisoners represented here today having been locked up for six years.&quot; None of them has been charged with a crime and none has been brought before a fair and impartial judge.<br /><br />&quot;The laws and Constitution are designed to survive, and remain in force, in extraordinary times.&quot; Kennedy wrote. &quot;Liberty and security can be reconciled; and in our system they are reconciled within the framework of the law. The Framers decided that habeas corpus, a right of first importance, must be a part of that framework, a part of that law.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Security subsists, too, in fidelity to freedom&#39;s first principles,&quot; according to Kennedy. &quot;Chief among these are freedom from arbitrary and unlawful restraint and the personal liberty that is secured by adherence to the separation of powers ... Within the Constitution&#39;s separation-of-powers structure, few exercises of judicial power are as legitimate or as necessary as the responsibility to hear challenges to the authority of the Executive to imprison a person.&quot;<br /><br />In responding to Laura Ingraham&#39;s false dichotomy between keeping us safe and protecting habeas corpus, I cited Benjamin Franklin&#39;s admonition: &quot;They who would give up an essential liberty for temporary security, deserve neither liberty or security.&quot; <br /><br /><strong>Attacking judges under guise of national security</strong><br /><br />The <em>Boumediene</em> decision split along political lines with the four so-called liberal justices - Ginsburg, Stevens, Souter and Breyer - in the majority, and the four conservative justices - Scalia, Thomas, Roberts and Alito - in the dissent. Kennedy, the swing vote, broke the tie. Curt Levy from the Committee for Justice, which seeks to pack the courts with right-wing judges, blogged that <em>Boumediene</em> has &quot;teed up the Supreme Court issue nicely for the G.O.P.&quot;<br /><br />Indeed, John McCain has already seized upon it as a campaign issue. The day the opinion came out, McCain said, &quot;It obviously concerns me . . . but it is a decision the Supreme Court has made. Now we need to move forward. As you know, I always favored closing of Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo Bay and I still think that we ought to do that.&quot; By the next day, McCain had changed his tune. &quot;The Supreme Court yesterday rendered a decision which I think is one of the worst decisions in the history of this country,&quot; he declared. McCain, who hopes to overcome the unpopularity of his positions on the war and the economy, will make national security the centerpiece of his campaign. <br /><br />Barack Obama, who links our national security with how other nations view us, characterized the <em>Boumediene</em> decision as &quot;an important step toward re-establishing our credibility as a nation committed to the rule of law, and rejecting a false choice between fighting terrorism and respecting habeas corpus.&quot;<br /><br />It is very likely that the next president will make at least one nomination, and probably two, to the Supreme Court. <em>Boumediene</em> is the poster child for how delicately the Court is now balanced, and the disastrous consequences to the doctrine of separation-of-powers that await us if a President McCain makes good on his promise to appoint judges in the mold of Roberts and Alito. <br /><br /><br /><em>Marjorie Cohn is a professor at Thomas Jefferson School of Law and president of the National Lawyers Guild (organizations shown for identification purposes only; the views expressed in this article are solely those of the writer; she is not acting on behalf of these organizations).

		<title>US Duties to Detainees During  a Withdrawal from Iraq</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/main.asp?PID=34">Jordan Paust</a> of the University of Houston Law Center says that so long as the United States is an occupying power or exercises effective control in any part of Iraq it must ensure that it is meeting its obligations to detainees under international law and the laws of war.<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/paustbig.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>B</strong></font>oth presumptive presidential nominees are likely to attempt to downsize US military forces operating within Iraq if elected to the presidency. Obama would do so in a responsible manner, perhaps over a period of months, whereas McCain would leave US troops in-country for decades and downsize over a period of years. In either case, it is worth contemplating what might happen to persons who are detained by US military or other personnel in Iraq, or who are otherwise within effective US control. Is there a need for agreement concerning the detainees?<br /><br />As a former and apparently present occupying power over any portion of Iraqi territory under its effective control, the US has responsibilities under the laws of war with respect to detained persons, and will have until any form of effective occupation ends. Such responsibilities continue to involve the absolute prohibitions of torture and cruel, inhuman, degrading, or humiliating treatment at US hands or in complicity with others. These prohibitions are also part of customary international law reflected in common Article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions and are applicable to detained persons of any status. Also of interest is the absolute obligation under Articles 49 and 147 of the 1949 Geneva Civilian Convention to not transfer non-prisoners of war out of occupied territory or out of the theater of war within a country of detention such as Iraq. Under Article 4 of the Convention, it is clear that the protections under Articles 49 and 147 even reach nationals of a neutral state or a co-belligerent state while they are outside the actual territory of the detaining state (e.g., while outside U.S. territory). Persons who are security threats can continue to be detained under Articles 5 and 78 of the Geneva Civilian Convention if such is necessary for reasons of security and if there is periodic review of their status and release when detention is no longer necessary, but non-prisoners of war cannot be transferred out of Iraq. It is possible, therefore, that the US will attempt to continue to detain certain individuals within Iraq even after a significant withdrawal of US military forces, but US competence to do so would hinge on continuation of the applicability of Geneva law to an area, however small, where the US continues to exercise effective control.<br /><br />Treaty-based and customary human rights law along with the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), contrary to the Bush Administration, clearly apply wherever the US exercises effective control or jurisdiction over detainees, and such laws require that the US not transfer persons under its control to any country, including Iraq, if there is a "real risk" that the persons transferred will suffer human rights violations. Article 3 of the CAT also mandates that no party to the treaty "shall expel, return ("refouler") or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture." More generally, complicit behavior by a state or its officials and its other nationals can create "state responsibility" under international law (which can lead to political, diplomatic, economic, and juridic sanctions against the state) and individual criminal and civil liability. <br /><br />In view of the probable continuation of U.S. control of certain persons within Iraq (persons who, under Geneva law, cannot lawfully be transferred out of Iraq) and in view of continued US responsibilities under treaty-based and customary international law, it would seem to be in the interest of the US to offer the following clause with respect to any future agreement with the government of Iraq concerning US downsizing of troops and future relations and responsibilities between the US and Iraqi governments and their military forces:<br /><br />"All persons in the hands of the US or in any other manner under effective US control who are protected in any manner under the 1949 Geneva Conventions shall remain under the complete jurisdiction and control of the US and shall not be transferred to any state where there is a real risk of deprivation of their human rights." <br /><br /><em>Jordan J.

		<title>After Ireland&#039;s &#039;No&#039;: Long Live the EU Lisbon Treaty?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Dr. <a href="http://www.nuigalway.ie/law/Staff/laurent_pech.html">Laurent Pech</a>, Jean Monnet Lecturer in European Union Law at the National University of Ireland, Galway, says that Ireland&#39;s recent &quot;No&quot; vote in its referendum on the European Union&#39;s Lisbon Treaty means that Ireland could find itself marginalised, although certainly still an EU member, if the other EU&#39;s 26 other Member States continue to move ahead with ratification....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/laurentpechnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he most significant change to the European Union (EU) in the last fifteen years is how much it has grown. From the six original founder members, the EU now has twenty-seven Member States. The <a href="/forumy/2008/04/eu-lisbon-treaty-old-wine-new-bottle.php">Lisbon Treaty</a>, signed last December, represents the latest updating of the EU's basic legal documents and seeks to provide the best institutional framework for the enlarged Union of 27. Unlike the defunct 2004 <em>Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe</em> which was voted down in <a href="/forumy/2005/05/eu-constitution-and-french-referendum.php">France</a> and the Netherlands in 2005, the Lisbon Treaty "merely" amends the current rules rather than replacing them with a new set. To enter into force, like any previous EU treaty, it must be ratified by <em>all</em> the Member States in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements. This is why, unlike the US practice with respect to constitutional amendment where a super-majority (three-fourths) of the legislatures of the US States suffices, any EU Member State, regardless of its size, can theoretically inflict a fatal blow to any new treaty by refusing to ratify it. <br /><br />This is precisely what happened in Ireland, where a referendum is constitutionally required - following a 1987 judgment of the Irish Supreme Court - for any new EU Treaty deemed to contain reforms altering the "essential scope or objectives" of the EU. On Friday the 13th of June, the Irish electorate rejected the Lisbon Treaty by 53.4% to 46.6%. This is not the first time Ireland has refused to ratify an EU amending Treaty. In 2001, Irish citizens voted against ratification of the Nice Treaty before approving it in 2002 in a second referendum organized after a new declaration was annexed to it and according to which the EU shall not prejudice Irish neutrality. <br /><br />Before exploring the uncertain future of the Lisbon Treaty and the options available to the EU, it may be useful to briefly review and assess the three most influential reasons for rejection put forward by Irish critics of the Treaty:<ol><li><strong>The Treaty is unreadable and its added-value is unclear</strong>: This would appear to have been the main reason cited for voting No in the Irish referendum. The Treaty, however, is no more complex than a typical constitutional amendment bill. Furthermore, this complexity merely reflects Member States' insistence on maintaining the strictest control over the evolution of law-making at EU level. In other words, it is precisely because the EU is <em>not</em> a "superstate" that it needs a more complicated rule-book. With respect to its added-value, it was indeed difficult for advocates of the Treaty to come up with an inspiring narrative in order to "sell" it as it mostly contains institutional reforms which, to be fully understood, require a great deal of knowledge about the current functioning of the EU. This is not to say, however, that these reforms are not required to make Europe function "better". The trouble for the Yes camp is that it pursued too many goals simultaneously within an extremely short length of time: it had to explain what the EU currently does, deconstruct the deliberately misleading claims put forward by most anti-Treaty people and finally, clarify the impact of a rather dull, multi-dimensional and technical amending text. And with no obvious price to be paid in case of a "No" vote &#8212; at least according to the No-camp during the campaign &#8212; Irish voters have been tempted to use the Lisbon referendum to express their frustration about many different things while some hoped to secure an undefined "better deal". <br /><br /><li><strong>The Treaty undermines Ireland's power and identity</strong>: Due to rather limited public knowledge of how the EU presently works, critics were able to present the reduction in the Commission's size and the new double-majority voting system in the Council of Ministers (the EU institution representing the national governments) as direct threats to Irish influence. They simply fail to mention that a new system of <em>equal</em> rotation among Member States for future appointments to the Commission will be implemented. In effect, <em>each</em> country would have one of its nationals serving as Commissioner for 10 years out of every 15. As regards the new double-majority voting system, where it applies &#8212; unanimity will continue to apply in some important areas including defence and taxation &#8212; EU legislation, to be adopted, will require the approval of at least 55% of the Member States, i.e. 15 Member States out of 27 <em>with each Member State getting one vote</em>, representing 65 per cent of the EU's population. This voting system perfectly reflects the double nature of the EU as a Union of States and of European peoples. It is furthermore more democratic than the current voting system by guaranteeing that a coalition of "small" countries will not pass legislation against the will of the most populated states. Generally speaking, the most important point may be that while Irish membership of the EU membership has had an impact on its <em>de jure</em> sovereignty, it has dramatically increased its <em>de facto</em> sovereignty. Outside the EU, Ireland's power to shape the norms governing its trade and promote its culture and values, would have certainly been almost nonexistent. <br /><br /><li><strong>The Treaty is a threat to Irish neutrality</strong>: It has now become routine for some groups to condemn any new EU treaty as a threat to Irish neutrality. Yet unanimity is still required for a European common defence policy to occur or any decision having military or defence implications. Furthermore, the Lisbon Treaty requires the EU to act in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter and with respect for the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States such as Ireland. To argue about the "militarization" of the EU, following the inclusion of the mutual defence and solidarity clauses, is also ludicrous. The codification of a duty to act in a spirit of solidarity in the event of a natural or man-made disaster or of a terrorist attack should be positively viewed as it demonstrates that European solidarity is not an empty slogan. As for the mutual defence clause, i.e. the duty of assistance to a fellow EU State victim of armed aggression, it only offers a diluted version of the NATO clause which today binds 21 Member States out of 27 and importantly, will not deprive Ireland of its right to determine the nature of its assistance in accordance with its constitutional framework. Finally, the EU is, and will remain under the Lisbon Treaty, a "soft" power with very limited military capacities. The civilian aspect of its goals and means of action is overwhelming. In addition, the emphasis on the United Nations Charter and respect for international law is a feature one would like to see enshrined in the US Constitution.</ol>Regardless of the doubtful accuracy of the points raised by anti-Treaty critics, the rules governing the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty are from a legal perspective clear-cut: unanimous ratification is required. No matter how practically absurd in a Union o
f 27 Member States, such unanimity has regularly led to ratification crises in some Member States following negative referenda. A referendum, by the way, is not inherently more democratic than parliamentary ratification. One may mention the example of the US where only legislatures (and eventually state conventions) can adopt constitutional amendments to the federal constitution. Regardless of whether national referenda are suitable instruments when it comes to voting on unintelligible amending EU treaties, to escape this latest "<a href="/forumy/2006/07/future-of-eu-constitution-escaping.php">ratification maze</a>", several options are now being debated. <br /><br />The least problematic option would be that the EU continues to work on the basis of the Nice Treaty and for Member States to seek to implement the most consensual provisions of the Lisbon Treaty on an <em>ad hoc</em> basis. Furthermore, if some countries are willing to deepen European integration in certain areas, they may rely upon the provisions governing "enhanced cooperation". Yet, "small" Member States, including Ireland, have constantly stressed their opposition to the formation of a "core" or "two-speed Europe" and "big" Member States recently emphasized that they would not accept any further enlargement of the EU on the basis of the Nice Treaty. <br /><br />Another option would be to start from scratch once again and negotiate a new treaty. Key political actors, however, have little appetite left for renegotiating a text which was itself presented as the "Plan B" following the abandonment of the "EU Constitution". Furthermore, the political environment is now different. Eighteen Member States, including France and Germany, have already ratified the Lisbon Treaty and seem in no mood to let it die after all the efforts spent on institutional reform these past few years. <br /><br />In a joint statement following the Irish referendum, the French and German governments clearly stated their preference for the continuation of the ratification process. This is the worst scenario for Ireland. Indeed, it means that unless the Irish government decides to organise a second referendum following, for instance, the negotiation of a new protocol/declaration which clearly states that Lisbon does not pose any threat to its neutrality, taxation regime, etc. or grants Ireland the explicit right not to participate to some EU policies, new special "arrangements" will have to be found. This is likely to mean in practice that Ireland will find itself marginalised, although still formally an EU member, if the other 26 countries move ahead. Irish anti-Treaty apprentice-sorcerers may come to realise too late that Ireland needs Europe more than Europe needs Ireland and that by provoking another ratification crisis in the hope of negotiating a "better deal", they obliged other EU countries to come to the conclusion that unanimity to ratify any new treaty is an unrealistic condition in an enlarged Union. <br /><br />The willingness of most Member States to proceed further with the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty has been criticized as "anti-democratic". While one may reasonably object to a change in the rules of the game while the game is still being played, the rules governing the ratification of EU treaties have nothing to do with democracy. They reflect, on the contrary, a traditional feature of international public law according to which treaties, to enter into force, must be ratified by all the contracting parties regardless of their respective population size. There is nothing intrinsically "democratic" in giving Ireland, less than 1% of the EU's population, the right to block the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty when all the other Member States want to adopt it. <br /><br />Were critics genuinely interested in democracy, they would favour the adoption of any new EU Treaty by means of an EU-wide referendum on the same day in all the Member States. The required majority for ratification could then be defined as at least two-thirds of the Member States, comprising at least two thirds of the EU population. Such a radical reform could lead to a genuine pan-European public debate and increase the chance of having a discussion focusing on the merits of the proposed text rather than issues of domestic politics. This change, however, is likely to lead to a situation where the EU gains in democratic legitimacy and authority to the detriment of the sovereignty of its constituent members and the influence of "small" countries. In other words, one cannot plead simultaneously for the preservation of as much authority as possible for the Member States and for an EU functioning in the manner of a national parliamentary democracy. <br /><br /><br /><em>Laurent Pech is Jean Monnet Lecturer in European Union Law at the National University of Ireland, Galway and the author of <a href="http://www.claruspress.ie/laurent%20pech.html">The European Union and its Constitution.

Bush</em>, the United States Supreme Court finally put to rest the odious notion that a president, like a monarch or dictator, has the unchecked power to lock people up and throw away the key on his or her say-so alone. The affirmation of the right to habeas corpus &#8212; or the right to challenge one's detention before an independent judge &#8212; is a resounding victory for all who will ever seek the firm and fair justice that is the hallmark of America's courts.<br /><br />Delivering the opinion of the Court, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote that "security subsists...in fidelity to freedom's first principles. Chief among these are freedom from arbitrary and unlawful restraint and the personal liberty that is secured by adherence to the separation of powers." We could not agree more. As individuals who have served at the highest levels of law and government, we cannot help but believe that the restoration of one of the great principles on which our country was founded marks the beginning of the end of a dark period in American history.<br /><br />The foundation of checks and balances upon which our nation was built was dangerously undermined with the passage of the Military Commissions Act of 2006. By stripping federal courts of the authority to hear challenges to the detention of so-called "enemy combatants," Congress simultaneously neglected its own role as a check on the power of the President and weakened the ability of American courts to intervene when constitutional rights are threatened.<br /><br />The government's claim that the prison at Guantanamo Bay was, in essence, a legal vacuum where only the President's word has power would have been easily disregarded as outrageous had the consequences not been so perilous. The Supreme Court's recognition that the Constitution applies, even in the depths of the world's most notorious prison, is a monumental triumph for the world's greatest democracy <br /><br />But the action by the Supreme Court did more than restore the delicate balance of power between the three branches of government: meaningful judicial review of detention is fundamental to the process of separating those detainees who are dangerous and rightly being held from those detainees who were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. Our national security strategy is dangerously misguided when we apply our financial and military resources to the task of guarding both the criminally dangerous terrorists and the innocents. Some have argued that habeas corpus actually undercuts the authority of the Commander in Chief. Quite to the contrary, as Justice Kennedy noted, "the exercise of those powers is vindicated, not eroded, when confirmed by the Judicial Branch."<br /><br />In the wars of the last century between uniformed armies, identifying who was the enemy was simply a matter of identifying a flag. Today, identifying those prisoners who are actual threats whom we need to detain and are entitled to detain, is significantly more difficult. Those into whose hands more than 750 detainees have been delivered have failed, even after six years, to perform this task in a constitutionally permissible manner. As a result, we must assume independent judicial review of the detentions to be the only way of ensuring that we have captured those responsible for terrorist attacks and, just as importantly, that the innocent are detained not one day longer.<br /><br />Many of the detainees have now been held in Guantanamo for more than six years, without any meaningful review of the basis of their detention. The continued detention of hundreds of men without charge has only fed our enemies' propaganda machines and hampered our long-term efforts to defeat terrorism and promote the rule of law around the world. The Court's affirmation of the right of these individuals to challenge the factual basis for their detention will allow for full and fair hearings before an independent Federal judge and will begin the long process of restoring America's reputation as the defenders of freedom wherever it continues to exist in the world.<br /><br />We have both repeatedly called on Congress to restore the habeas corpus rights they eliminated in the Military Commissions Act. But the time for congressional penitence has long passed, and our elected officials must now resist the temptation to undo the Court's work through another round of capricious intervention in the review of these cases. Our nation's judges should be allowed to do their jobs without partisan politics interrupting their efforts at every turn.<br /><br />Writing for the majority of the Court, Justice Kennedy rejected the argument that "the political branches have the power to switch the Constitution on or off at will." Congress should pay heed to such an important point, no matter how disconcerting it was that the point had to be made at all.<br /><br /><br /><em>Lt. Col. Stephen Abraham served with the Office for the Administrative Review of the Detention of Enemy Combatants in 2004 and 2005. He has served in the United States Army Reserve as a military intelligence officer for more than 22 years.<br /><br />Judge William S. Sessions served as the Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas and as Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He is a member of the Constitution Project's Liberty and Security Committee.<br /><br />Both authors are writing in their personal capacities.</em><br />

Bush</em>, Congress and President might better have engaged in a good faith legislative process to sketch out an appropriate and legally supportable detention system balancing the protections necessary for counter-terrorism purposes with well-established rights afforded combatants and civilians in armed conflict...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/davidkaye.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>s is now widely known, the Supreme Court's June 12 decision in <em>Boumediene v. Bush</em> held that detainees at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Naval Facility (GTMO) have the right to challenge the basis of their detentions in federal district court via habeas corpus. Extraordinarily thoughtful and quick commentary has now clotted the internet arteries, so much so that several leading legal blogs and websites, especially <a href="http://www.opiniojuris.org/posts/chain_1213336401.shtml">Opinio Juris</a>, <a href="http://balkin.blogspot.com">Balkinization</a>, <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp">SCOTUSblog</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=boumediene">JURIST</a>, are essential resources to get an overview of the decision itself and the key debates triggered by the Court's dueling opinions and dissents. The reflections here merely touch upon in an informal way a few of <em>Boumediene</em>&#39;s implications.<br /><br />In the period following the attacks of September 11, 2001, I served as a principal staff attorney at the State Department handling the law of armed conflict, also known as international humanitarian law (IHL). On September 12, lawyers in our office began to consider what was, for us, a basic question: under IHL, how should we characterize any individuals associated with those attacks who may fall into U.S. hands? Remarkably, the Government is still struggling with this question, having failed to answer it appropriately several months after 9/11. Nearly seven years after 9/11, and over six years since GTMO was established as a detention site for individuals picked up in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the "war on terror," the Boumediene decision brings the issue once again to the fore, where it belongs. Still, as for the key questions raised by the decision &#8212; what next for the detainees and the future of the U.S. system of detention at Guantanamo Bay? &#8212; at this point we can only speculate on the answers. <br /><br />Justice Anthony Kennedy's majority opinion pointedly emphasized "that our opinion does not address the content of the law that governs petitioners' detention. That," he said, "is a matter yet to be determined." (Slip. Op. at 69) Yet determining the content of the law, and making a "definitive judicial determination as to the legality of their detention," (id.) will necessarily be at the heart of the habeas litigation that virtually all of the detainees held at Guantanamo are certain to launch in coming days and weeks. <br /><br />The habeas process will provide ample sustenance for both federal court and public international law junkies. Law review ink will be sacrificed to the many problems and opportunities that <em>Boumediene</em> presents, but here are a few among the great many international law-oriented questions that one should expect to animate the coming litigation and legal debate:<ul><li><strong>Who may be lawfully held at Guantanamo?</strong><br /><br />This question has both domestic and international law elements. Domestically, the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA) defined an "unlawful enemy combatant," a person subject to trial by military commission, as "a person who has engaged in hostilities or who has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the United States or its co-belligerents who is not a lawful enemy combatant (including a person who is part of the Taliban, al Qaeda, or associated forces)." Section 948a, MCA. The MCA does not seek to define this term for detention purposes, nor does it purport to authorize detentions at GTMO. Indeed, Congress' 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) defined slightly differently the group against whom the President was authorized to use force, so two immediate questions are whether the category of persons listed in the MCA is coextensive with those who may be detained at Guantanamo and whether each detainee held at Guantanamo fits that category.<br /><br /><li><strong>What rule applies to determine who is lawfully detained?</strong> <br /><br />International law can shape the answers to the questions posed to policymakers, but to what extent will the courts refer to that body of law? The most obvious place to look for rules determining the category of combatants subject to detention by the United States in war would be the Geneva Conventions of 1949, in particular the Third Convention on Prisoners of War and the Fourth Convention on the Protection of Civilians. Together, these treaties, to which the United States is a party, provide a framework for determining who may be subject to detention by military authorities in international armed conflicts. In 2002, the President made a blanket determination that, in effect, led to the conclusion that everyone held at Guantanamo fell outside the Geneva protections but could nonetheless be held for the duration of the "war on terror." In rejecting Bush Administration arguments in 2006, the Court in <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em> held that, at a minimum, Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions &#8212; a provision that applies minimum humanitarian standards for conflicts "not of an international character" &#8212; applies to the conflict with al Qaeda However, Common Article 3 provides little if any guidance to courts (or the military) as to the key questions of the bases and permissible length of detention. The habeas process may re-open these decisions to scrutiny. <br /><br /><li><strong>Are the Geneva Conventions an available source of law in federal habeas actions?</strong> <br /><br />It may very well be that the Geneva Conventions, or at least Common Article 3, provide the appropriate rule of decision, allowing a court to read into them rights detainees may have related to the fact and length of their confinement. However, Section 5 of the Military Commissions Act provides, "No person may invoke the Geneva Conventions or any protocols thereto in any habeas corpus or other civil action or proceeding . . . as a source of rights in any court of the United States . . ." Does Section 5 preclude the federal courts from applying the Geneva Conventions, including Common Article 3, to these cases? Did the Congress unconstitutionally attempt to constrain the federal courts from applying existing treaty law to which the United States is bound? (A superb argument on this issue may be found at the <em>Boumediene</em> amicus filing, Brief of Federal Courts and International Law Professors as Amici Curiae in Support of Petitioners (Geneva Enforceability), at <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/pdfs/07-08/06-1195_PetitionerAmCuFedCtILawPr.pdf">http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/pdfs/07-08/06-1195_PetitionerAmCuFedCtILawPr.pdf</a>). <br /><br /><li><strong>If the Geneva Conventions are unavailable in U.S. courts, may judges look to the customary international law of war, which largely tracks the Geneva Conventions, or international human rights law to determine the rights a detainee may have (for instance, to be free from arbitrary detention)?</strong> <br /><br />The Bush Administration and the conservative wing of the Court have pushed hard against the use of customary international law by federal courts. But if treaty law is taken out of the equation, the basis for d
etaining combatants may be found in customary international humanitarian law, which may not differ substantially from the Geneva Conventions. Indeed, the Reagan Administration had acknowledged that several key provisions of the 1977 Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions, a treaty updating the 1949 Conventions which the United States has not joined, reflect customary IHL to which the U.S. Government is bound. One could thus imagine the habeas litigation becoming a fulcrum for the general debate over whether customary law may provide a rule of decision in federal courts. Moreover, customary IHL has been reviewed considerably by international criminal tribunals since the middle 1990s, such as the ones for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, and the results have tended to analyze IHL from a strongly human rights-oriented basis. In short, the effort to remove the treaties from federal court purview may undermine, rather than strengthen, Bush Administration arguments.<br /><br /><li><strong>Will the courts challenge the Administration's conclusion that the "war on terror" is an armed conflict for legal purposes, such that IHL applies?</strong> <br /><br />Will courts distinguish the armed conflict in Afghanistan from the Bush Administration's worldwide conflict with al Qaeda (the one it relied on to justify detaining Algerians picked up in Bosnia, such as the <em>Boumediene</em> petitioners)? It would be surprising if federal courts were now to challenge the basic determination that the United States is in an armed conflict with al Qaeda, a construct unquestioned in Hamdan and widely (though not universally) supported in Washington (but opposed in Europe). At the same time, however, the Supreme Court has become involved in detention policies in this conflict to such an extent that it is impossible to exclude the possibility that even this fundamental issue may come under renewed scrutiny. If the courts head in this direction, one could imagine different rules for those captured in Afghanistan (a battlefield context) from those captured in, for example, Bosnia (a law enforcement context).</ul>These questions merely skim the surface of the difficult legal issues federal courts will face in the upcoming habeas litigation. A better response than habeas would be for the Congress and President to engage in a good faith legislative process to sketch out an appropriate and legally supportable detention system, one that balances the protections necessary for counter-terrorism purposes and well-established rights afforded combatants and civilians in armed conflict. Unless the Administration and Congress can rise above election year politics, that kind of process, unseen since the terrible attacks of 9/11, will likely have to wait until next January. <br /><br /><em>David Kaye is executive director of the international human rights law program at UCLA School of Law and a longtime member of the <a href="http://www.asil.org">American Society of International Law</a>.</em><br />

		<title>UKRAINE: Visiting the &#039;Unofficial Market&#039;</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aleksandra (Sasha) Williams, Pitt Law &#39;10, files from <strong>Kiev</strong>:<br /><br />The whole is often greater than the sum of its parts, especially if some of those parts do not make it into a suitcase during a 20 minute frantic packing effort with the airport taxi already waiting outside.  Thus, a digital camera missing a battery charger is far less useful than one might imagine.  I hate to admit it, but once my battery finally died, I fondly thought of Wal-Mart.  Unfortunately, Kiev does not have one.  Neither does it have the kind of battery or the charger I need anywhere outside of the few and far away official Sony distributor stores.  But Kiev has Petrivka - one of several &quot;unofficial markets&quot; located in the heart of Kiev.  Quite a few people suggested I look there for anything I may need.  So I did.  <br /><br />Although Petrivka has some legitimate vendors, it can aptly be described as a massive intellectual property rights violation with occasional counterfeit and stolen property booths.  Despite the official legislative and executive efforts to crack down on production and distribution of pirated and unlicensed goods, this particular &quot;black market&quot; continues to thrive.  To be fair, it used to do a lot better a decade ago, when no enforceable laws hindered any of its operations.  Then in 2000, the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine&#39;s parliament) made the first substantial step towards protecting intellectual property rights by revising its Criminal Code to introduce criminal liability for manufacture, distribution, sale and purchase of pirated goods.  However, enforcement of this law against large-scale manufacturers and distributors proved to be difficult, and by 2002 the United States imposed trade sanctions on Ukraine.  The sanctions were eventually lifted in 2005 after the Verkhovna Rada, closely advised and supervised by the US, passed legislation that gave more teeth to law enforcement and lowered the threshold for criminal and civil liability.  In turn, the US government managed to convince Microsoft and several other companies to use &quot;dynamic pricing&quot; which allowed Ukrainian consumers to buy licensed products for a fraction of their &quot;western&quot; cost.  Together with frequent inspections, seizures and legal actions against offenders this significantly slowed down the black market bustle.<br /><br />However, Petrivka stoically endured these difficulties and emerged relatively unscathed.  It had to scale down and start camouflaging its illegal operations.  Most vendors also now offer a choice between a much more expensive &quot;licensed&quot; item and its &quot;unlicensed&quot; version.  Nonetheless, Petrivka is far from going under.  For example, <em>Sex in the City</em> DVDs were available here well before the movie came out in the Kiev theaters on June 19. Also, after seeing most of Kievans dressed head to toe in Gucci and Dior, it becomes abundantly clear that most of their designer threads did not come from the obscenely overpriced boutiques, especially considering that Petrivka offers knockoffs for $5-$50. Finally, according to several polls, about 90% of all computers within Kiev ran pirated software as recently as a year ago.  <br /><br />Little separates these seemingly benign scams from others with grave consequences. The same &quot;black markets&quot; that, like Petrivka, offer bootleg books and fake Chanel bags also sell contaminated or expired medications and substandard equipment that can cause industrial accidents.  Besides, &quot;unofficial trade&quot; violates numerous laws, tax codes, licenses, embargos and other regulations used by nations to organize and enforce rules.  As for my battery charger, I sincerely hope that I at least gathered some good professional ethics karma by not buying it at Petrivka, because the one I ended up purchasing cost twice as much.<br />

		<title>ETHIOPIA: Joining the WTO? The Challenge of Customs Valuation</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Staffer Eric Linge, Pitt Law &#39;10, from <strong>Addis Ababa</strong>...<br /><br />Joining the World Trade Organization (WTO) is not easy. Especially for a country like Ethiopia that has a history of communism to unwind, reams of technical laws have to be rewritten to be WTO compliant. But before legislators even sit down to rewrite laws, there is much apprehension. The WTO promises change to a nation&#39;s import export balance sheet, and this promise scares politicians and business owners alike. An Ethiopian hotel owner told me that if the tourism sector were further liberalized, surely foreign hotel chains like Holiday Inn would enter the market and crush locals like him.<br /><br />In Ethiopia there is a general lack of knowledge about the nuts and bolts of WTO membership among business owners and politicians alike. The WTO is most famous for its organizational goal &#8212; to facilitate international trade by reducing barriers to trade: tariffs, subsidies, import quotas, et cetera. To many Ethiopian business owners and politicians, any change is scary. But an often-cited reason for the fear &#8212; and it may be just a convenient reason &#8212; is that WTO membership will force Ethiopians to compete with foreign businesses.<br /><br />What these politicians and business owners miss are the benefits that membership would bring to anyone already doing business in Ethiopia. WTO member countries are required to implement and maintain an international standard of transparency, predictability, and consistency in their commercial legal regime. Even if an LDC (least developed country) like Ethiopia did not immediately benefit from increased trade revenue as a WTO member, implementing international commercial law standards could make business owners more likely to reinvest profits in their businesses and could inspire foreigners to invest. For example, if Ethiopia joins the WTO, tariff rates must be bound at an upper limit. This means that an importer would not discover one day that his normal tariff rate had recently been raised 100 percent.<br /><br />Another major benefit that WTO membership would bring is reform of customs valuations. The current state of customs valuation in Ethiopia demonstrates the frustrating lack of predictability to many laws in Ethiopia. With a small manufacturing base, Ethiopia is a country heavily reliant on imports, and customs duties must be paid on these imports. Generally, the customs duty is a percentage of the total value of the good being imported, and this is what the WTO requires, save for some fallback valuation methods. However, the WTO requires the duty to be paid on a good&#39;s &quot;actual value,&quot; which is rarely reflected in Ethiopian valuation methods.<br /><br />Ethiopia&#39;s valuation method on used vehicles (used vehicles are imported much more than new) is unique and would not be compliant with any of the WTO valuation methods. The customs value is based on what a database says the value was when the vehicle was new. A depreciation allowance of 10 percent per year with a maximum allowance of 30 percent is then deducted to arrive at the customs value. This means that for all vehicles more than three years old, the customs value will never fall below 70 percent. Never mind that vehicles by their nature depreciate rapidly. This practice leads to the overpricing of used vehicles in Ethiopian markets, and the valuation method appears to have no purpose other than to earn extra revenue for the government.<br /><br />Most other goods are valued at their listing in a published valuation database separate from the vehicle database, and often these values do not reflect a good&#39;s actual value. This published valuation database sometimes contains multiple listings for the same good with different prices for each listing, and customs officers have been known to use versions of the database that have been outdated for years. In other words, an importer does not always know for sure what he will pay.<br /><br />If customs valuation is reformed and stabilized, importers will become more interested in conducting business within Ethiopia, and foreign investors would be more inspired to invest in the nation&#39;s economy. This investment is just one example of a benefit that membership in the WTO would bring to Ethiopia&#39;s business owners. If they and politicians recognized the economic benefits of reform driven by the WTO&#39;s mandated international standards, they would be more likely to support WTO membership.<br />

Think about all the government contractors contributing to our national security who are fearful that doing their duties could lead to massive civil liabilities. <br /><br />The point was driven home to me earlier this summer, when I sat down for lunch with a senior executive for a major technology firm. He is retired military and has extensive experience fighting this new enemy. We discussed, amongst other things, FISA modernization. The Protect America Act had expired, and there was uncertainty about whether the 40-plus lawsuits against telecommunications providers would go forward or whether the Administration and Congress would pull the plug on them, fix FISA, and put foreign intelligence-gathering on clearer legal footing. <br /><br />He told me that his firm had invested hundreds of millions of dollars into counter-terrorism research and development, but if Congress allowed those lawsuits to go forward, his company and many others in the industry would have to cut back on their investments in homeland and national security - the liability risk would just be too great to put their investors&#39; money on the line. The whole issue of retroactive liability, he told me, protection boiled down to one simple question: Do we want American companies, with all their ingenuity, to help the government and military defeat this enemy, or not?  <br /><br />For most Americans, the answer to that question is easy - yes. <br /><br />That may explain why, in the face of massive emailing, faxing, and phone-call campaigns coordinated by privacy rights groups, fully 87 percent of the members of the Senate Intelligence Committee and 69 percent of the entire Senate voted in favor of final passage of the FISA bill. They know that it&#39;ll take all of America&#39;s capabilities to defeat this enemy and that we need private industry investing billions in the technologies and systems that will keep us a step ahead of threats for decades to come.&quot;<br /><br /><em>Charles Stimson wrote for Hotline in <a href="/hotline/2008/01/telecommunication-companies-deserve.php">January</a></span> about granting immunity for telecommunications companies</em>.<br />

		<title>Denial of citizenship for Muslim woman violates neutrality of French secularism</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.becketfund.org/index.php/person/27.html">Angela Wu</a></strong> [Acting Executive Director, International Law Director, <a href="http://www.becketfund.org/index.php">The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty</a>]: &quot;On June 27, the highest French administrative tribunal <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/france-denies-citizenship-to-muslim.php">rejected a Muslim woman&#39;s application for citizenship</a>. Reason: her religious practices and beliefs are not French enough. Faiza Mabchour has been living in France since 2000, she is married to a French citizen, and has three French-born children. What&#39;s more, she speaks French fluently, a skill in many countries, including France previously, that would have been a critical and sufficient evidence of assimilation for citizenship applications. The <a href="http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/home/index.shtml">Conseil d&#39;Etat</a> (Council of State) disagreed, ruling instead that Ms. Mabchour should not receive citizenship because her religious practices are &quot;not compatible with the essential values of the French community, notably the principle of gender equality.&quot;<br /><br />The Council&#39;s decision disturbingly and ironically runs counter to France&#39;s long-cherished value of neutrality in the public sphere, one of the three main tenets of la&iuml;cit&eacute;, the French embodiment of secularism. Besides neutrality in the public square, la&iuml;cit&eacute; embraces the equality of religions (and non-religions). Yet conventionally, la&iuml;cit&eacute; has been employed to justify policies aimed at dereligionising the public sphere rather than protecting the free peaceful expression of all religions. In that spirit, France banned the Muslim headscarf and other ostentatious religious symbols in state schools in 2004, forcing some students to choose between public education (in which, presumably, they would have been inculcated in French values) and their religious faith. One such case involving Sikhs who ended up in private Catholic schools as a result of the ban is now being heard by the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/">European Court of Human Rights</a>. Former French President Chirac defended the ban as &quot;obviously necessary&quot; to preserve neutrality in the public arena, which would permit various religions to coexist harmoniously.<br /><br />The Council&#39;s June 2008 decision throws more starkly into question whether religious discrimination, and not merely neutrality, is really the reason for France&#39;s aggressive attempts to dereligionise the public square. In rejecting Ms. Mabchour&#39;s application, the Council adopts a substantive view of which peaceful religious practices are acceptable to French society. This necessarily would involve the state privileging some religious practices over others. Not only does this defeat any avowed claim to neutrality, the state intrudes upon the &quot;forum internum&quot; &#8212; interior realm of conscience &#8212; by deciding which theologies are acceptable for public expression and forcing religious believers to choose between a full public life and being true to their religious consciences. The decision&#39;s declaration that the citizenship decision has no effect on Ms. Mabchour&#39;s freedom of religion declares that freedom of religion in France is effective only behind closed doors.<br /><br />This is the irony of a secularist state making theological choices. France is going to tell Muslims what to believe and to practice in order to be accepted as French. This coercion is reminiscent of religious persecution in the Middle Ages that stemmed from the desire for religious uniformity. The difference here is that now the demand is for commitment to the ideology of a state-sanctioned theology &#8212; one that in no way threatens the accepted script of muted religious expression.<br /><br />The ruling plainly goes against conventional French commitment to absolute equality. France views religion as a private matter, and refuses to recognise, much less celebrate, religious (and ethnic) differences publicly. Thus, it has insisted on the international plane that there are no minorities in France, whether ethnic, religious or linguistic. Article 2 of the <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/english/8ab.asp">1958 French Constitution</a> declares France as &quot;an indivisible, secular, democratic, and social Republic.&quot; This indivisibility clause was the basis for France&#39;s reservation to Article 27 of the <a href="http://huachen.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 1966</a>, which guarantees protection to persons belonging to &quot;ethnic, religious or linguistic minoritiea...to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practise their own religion, or to use their own language.&quot; France&#39;s clear inability to assimilate an increasingly disenchanted Muslim minority brings into question whether this approach of denial is working to neutralise conflict in its public square.<br /><br />Furthermore, in denying Ms. Mabchour citizenship, the Council reinforces whatever state of submission it imputes on her wearing of the burqa by depriving her political status in her country of residence of the past 8 years, thus ensuring that she continues to remain dependent on her husband and other male relatives. The Council criticised Ms. Mabchour because she apparently &quot;has no idea about the secular state or the right to vote&quot; and does not &quot;challenge&quot; her &quot;submission to her male relatives.&quot; It does not mention any evidence of what factors influenced Ms. Mabchour&#39;s wearing of the burqa.<br /><br />French politicians have generally supported the Council&#39;s decision. None, as far as this commentator has seen, have come out to disclaim the underlying discrimination and duplicity in the reasoning. If anything, this is unlikely to be the last time France has to confront its commitment to secularism and equality, and what that means when confronted with the realities of an increasingly diverse Europe. As France continues to struggle to deal with the growing ethnic and religious plurality in its own country, it has to decide if its aspirations of liberty, equality, and fraternity, mean that the state should be determining affairs of the church.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Christina Hill</span> [Acting Extractive Industries Advocacy Coordinator, <a href="http://www.oxfam.org.au/">Oxfam Australia</a>]: &quot;The news that the Human Rights Commission of the Philippines will <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/australian-mining-company-to-be.php">investigate human rights abuses</a> by Australian mining company OceanaGold, who is developing a gold and copper mine in Didipio is welcome.  Didipio, which is located in the northern Philippines, is home to about 2,000 people including many Indigenous Peoples.  Since 2002, Oxfam has been working with the Didipio community and its support groups to document complaints by the community of human rights abuses and bringing these complaints to the company&#39;s attention, and to a wider audience. As was reported by JURIST on 10 July, key community complaints include the destruction of people&#39;s homes and physical intimidation and assault.  OceanaGold has also shown little regard for the principle of free, prior and informed consent.  <br /><br />OceanaGold has never substantially responded to the community&#39;s grievances. It is for this reason that Oxfam Australia released the Didipio <a href="http://www.oxfam.org.au/campaigns/mining/ombudsman/cases/didipio/docs/2007-Didipio-Case-Report.pdf">report</a> [pdf] and more recently wrote to the Philippines Human Rights Commission asking them to investigate the situation.  <br /><br />Meanwhile in June this year, Prof. John Ruggie, Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, presented his &quot;Protect, Respect and Remedy&quot; <a href="http://www.reports-and-materials.org/Ruggie-report-7-Apr-2008.pdf">framework</a> [pdf] to the Human Rights Council. In his Framework, Prof. Ruggie emphasises that States, both host and home, have the duty to protect against human rights abuses by third parties, including business. <br /><br />Oxfam Australia has long argued the need for an independent complaints mechanism for the Australian mining industry because industry self-regulation and host country regulatory systems are often an ineffective guarantee to community members at risk of harm, as the Didipio case shows.  Oxfam believes that the Australian Government must take action and consider the development of measures &#8212; including an independent complaints mechanism for the mining industry - to prevent human rights abuses by Australian companies operating overseas.  Other governments should do likewise.  <br /><br />Prof. Ruggie notes that there is increasing encouragement at the international level for home States to take regulatory action to prevent abuse by their companies overseas. The Australian Government would be keeping in step with current thinking if it were to respond appropriately.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php"><strong>Ali Khan</strong></a> [Professor, <a href="http://washburnlaw.edu">Washburn University School of Law</a>]: &quot;The International Criminal Court (ICC) joins the crusade to defame Islam, demonize internal conflicts in Muslim nations, and prosecute Muslim leaders for crimes against humanity, rape, genocide, and other international crimes. The Prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, holds evidence &quot;on crimes committed in the whole of Darfur over the last five years.&quot; Ocampo will be seeking the arrest of Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir for war crimes committed in Darfur.<br /><br />The ICC is a good idea. We need a world court to hold international criminals accountable. No leader should be able to get away with heinous international crimes. The weakening of personal sovereign immunity is also a welcome legal development in that no leader, army general, senator, representative, or even judge is immune from criminal liability if he or she commits crimes or provides material assistance in the commission of crimes. <br /><br />In practice, however, the ICC is a Western instrumentality that ignores the grave crimes of Western leaders and generals. The ICC has so far shown no interest in prosecuting President Bush, Vice President Cheney, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, and State Secretary Colin Powell for the crimes they planned, organized, incited, and committed with the help of lethal weapons in Afghanistan and Iraq. These leaders have destroyed Iraq, a Muslim country, and killed its leader, Saddam Hussein, without a fair trial. The NATO genocide in Afghanistan continues as world leaders sit in high galleries to watch the ghoulish killings of the &quot;Taliban and terrorists.&quot;<br /><br />Ocampo is an incompetent, unethical, and perhaps a racist prosecutor who does not deserve to lead the Prosecutorial office of the ICC. He has already botched up the prosecution of a Congolese warlord, Thomas Lubanga, by wrongly withholding evidence that could have helped the defense. <br /><br />The prosecution of President Omar for the Darfur conflict comes after years of distortions and misreporting in the Western media. The Western media singles out Muslim leaders and Muslim nations for explaining the ills of the world. Syria is listed as a terrorist state, Pakistan is blamed for trouble in Afghanistan, the Iranian President has been turned into an imminent murderer, and President Omar is soon to be prosecuted as a war criminal. Militias that resist Western occupation in their own countries are labeled as terrorists and jihadis.<br /><br />While hardened criminals sit out in shameless liberty, the politically-inspired prosecution of President Omar is, at its best, selective enforcement of international criminal law; and, at its worst, it is one more crusade against the Muslim world.&quot;<br />

		<title>Ontario Court of Appeal ruling signals need for mining law reform</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.wildlandsleague.org/attachments/Anna.bio.html">Anna Baggio</a> [Director,  Conservation Land Use Planning, <a href="http://www.wildlandsleague.org/default.aspx">CPAWS Wildlands League</a>]: &quot;The fact that Ontario&#39;s antiquated mining legislation was cited as part of problem at the heart of <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/ontario-appeals-court-rules-aboriginal.php">Ardoch Algonquins</a> case is significant. It reinforces, for me, the need for a massive overhaul of Ontario&#39;s <span style="font-style:italic;">Mining Act</span> including the &quot;free entry system.&quot;  It also reinforces for me the need to bring mining legislation in line with modern society&#39;s values and expectations before more conflicts erupt. As many of you are aware, mining trumps all other land uses in Ontario and Aboriginal communities and landowners do not have the right to say NO to mineral exploration and mining projects, nor do they even have a say in the imposition of conditions on mining on their lands or rights of participation in an environmental assessment process which is currently non-existent for mining in Ontario. Together with the Aroch Algonquins, people of Kitchenuhmaykoosib Inninuwug, social justice, union, faith and other environmental groups, we fought and will continue to fight for these rights.  <br /><br />I am relieved that the Court of Appeal referenced the unique systemic or background factors at play in the case. In addition to the ongoing Algonquin land claim negotiations and antiquated <span style="font-style:italic;">Mining Act</span>, the length of the sentences were deemed &quot;too harsh&quot; and &quot;more severe&quot; than sentences imposed in other protest cases for first time offenders. MacPherson J. A. also noted that the sentencing pitted the community against the justice system.  &quot;That the court found it necessary to imprison the leaders of the AAFN simply serves to emphasize the gulf between the dominant culture&#39;s sense of justice and this First Nations&#39;s sense of justice,&quot; he wrote.  The message between the lines of the Court of Appeal&#39;s decision is that the Mining Act and Ontario&#39;s actions are unconstitutional for a failure to address First Nations&#39; rights.  <br /><br />Since  Ontario regulation treats mining as the best and highest end use of public land in Ontario, ecological values and concerns, human health concerns, and Aboriginal rights are often downplayed and ignored. It is absolutely vital that Ontario replaces its &quot;free entry system&quot; with a permitting system that protects ecosystems and communities, and  meets its constitutional obligations to Aboriginal Peoples before mineral tenure is handed out. It is in the public interest and I hope the government does this quickly. <br /><br />The Ontario government has promised to &quot;review&quot; the Mining Act but has not yet released the terms of reference or scope for the review. We cannot be sure they&#39;ve heeded the guidance from the Ontario Court of Appeal until we see the terms of reference and scope of the review. <br /><br />I sat in court and listened to Ontario argue for the antiquated Mining Act to be upheld. This indicates to me the size of the task ahead of us. Now that we all have the judicial guidance of the Ontario Court of Appeal in addition to the over 20 years of jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Canada, it&#39;s time for Ontario to get on with dusting off and reforming its 135 year old mining legislation.&quot;<br />

		<title>Ninth Circuit ruling on public display of abortion photos is a win for social reform</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Gregg Cunningham</strong> [Director, <a href="http://www.abortionno.org/">Center For Bio-Ethical Reform</a>]: &quot;Why does it matter that hecklers be denied a veto over offensive speech? Social injustice will always flourish where it is ignored and trivialized. Oppressors are most ruthless when their abuses can be concealed. It is, therefore, the responsibility of social reformers to drag these travesties out of the darkness and into the light. They must relentlessly confront the culture with evidence of society&#39;s complicity and complacency in the commission of great civil wrongs. Awareness of injustice must be forced and it must be made unavoidable. Ignorance and denial are always most effectively overcome when <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/ninth-circuit-upholds-right-to-display.php">activists compel the public to view</a> shocking photos which emphasize the humanity of the victims and the inhumanity of the injustices by which they are being victimized.<br /><br />Nobody ever wants to see these pictures and the activists who display them in the public square invite terrible retribution. Photos of children being abused by cruelly exploitative employers sickened parents (and consumers) who profited from child labor and didn&#39;t want to know how badly their children were being treated. Photos of black people being beaten to their knees for trying to register to vote shamed America before the world. Photos of animal rights abuses and battlefield atrocities and death camp horror evoke feelings of guilt in those who perpetrated as well as those who permitted these terrible acts.<br /><br />Society&#39;s reflexive response to these pictures is to silence the messenger (easy) instead of halting the injustice (hard). Child labor activists reported that the public was angrier at them for showing the photos than they were at those who abused the children in the pictures. The Ku Klux Klan routinely attacked press; photographers and destroyed their cameras before attacking the black civil rights demonstrators who were their real targets. Pro-abortion activists often and attack or threaten pro-life activists with physical violence (see threats at <a href="http://www.abortionno.org/">http://www.abortionno.org</a>) and attempt to cover-up or destroy aborted baby photos we display in public.<br /><br />Our Center for Bio-Ethical Reform&#39;s 9th Circuit Appellate Court <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/2A67C56587DE89748825747A004D9E87/$file/0555294.pdf?openelement">victory</a> against the Los Angeles County public schools and Sheriff&#39;s Department may have angered pro-abortion activists and even the public, but if bureaucrats can ban our aborted baby photos from public streets, no picture is safe from censorship and social injustice of all sorts will eventually abound with impunity. Without rigorously protected speech, social reform is simply impossible. Society will shout down the reformers every time.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://epic.org/epic/staff/rotenberg/"><strong>Marc Rotenberg</strong></a> [President, <a href="http://epic.org/">Electronic Privacy Information Center</a>]: &quot;The Senate&#39;s vote reflected a fundamental misunderstanding of the purpose of <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/ch36.html">FISA</a>. The law was enacted to make clear the circumstances under which<br />telephone companies could be required by the government to turn over customer records in foreign intelligence investigations. The law anticipated not only routine exigencies but also the circumstances under which the US went to war and it established appropriate procedures.<br /><br />In <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/senate-rejects-bid-to-deny-immunity-for.php">granting retroactive immunity</a> before there is a meaningful opportunity to determine whether the telephone companies complied with their legal obligations, the Senate has disregarded this law and the force of law. It has established a dangerous precedent that could, at a future time, justify greater lawlessness.<br /><br />We will see the day when Senators who supported the President&#39;s warrantless wiretapping program will regret their votes, much as John Adams later regretted his support for the Alien and Sedition Acts.&quot;<br />

In a silly attempt at &quot;spin&quot; control after the decision, Duke declared that it did not seek to destroy the whole rule.  That is a flat-out lie. If you check the <a href="/pdf/dukebriefvscair.pdf">legal brief</a> filed by Duke with the court, you will see (on page 34): &quot;EPA&#39;s CAIR SO2 rules exceed EPA&#39;s authority and are arbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discretion. <span style="font-style:italic;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">This Court should vacate them</span></span>.&quot;&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.coe.int/t/commissioner/About/biohammarberg_en.asp"><strong>Thomas Hammarberg</strong></a> [Commissioner for Human Rights, <a href="http://www.coe.int/">Council of Europe</a>]: &quot;I have been in close contact with the Italian authorities ever since I was informed of violent anti-Roma manifestations in Italy and of the Italian government&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/italy-begins-mass-fingerprinting-of.php">decision to adopt new legislative measures</a> concerning, among others, stricter immigration control, Roma and Sinti.<br /><br />On 19 and 20 June, I paid a visit to Italy during which I held discussions with the Minister of Interior, Mr Roberto Maroni, as well as with representatives of non-governmental and international organizations. On the basis of this visit, I transmitted a memorandum to the Italian authorities with recommendations in order to fully align their policies with the Council of Europe human rights standards.<br /><br />Censuses of Roma, including their fingerprinting, in three Italian regions have been based on recent emergency legislation adopted by the Italian government. Consistent reports received so far provide grounds for serious concerns as to the lawfulness and non-discriminatory character of these operations.<br /><br />Being an independent and impartial institution promoting respect of human rights, as embodied in the human rights instruments of the Council of Europe, I should like to recall that Council of Europe, as well as European Union, legislation provides a precise and strict framework concerning the collection and processing of personal data, especially the ones relating to one&#39;s ethnic origin (&quot;special&quot; or &quot;sensitive&quot; data). The relevant guidelines are found notably in the case law of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/">European Court of Human Rights</a>, the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/108.htm">1981 Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data</a> and the later <a href="http://www.cdt.org/privacy/eudirective/EU_Directive_.html">European Community Directive 95/46/EC</a> on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. <br /><br />On the basis of these legal sources, the following principles may be usefully recalled:<br /><br />1. All processing of personal data must be based on a domestic law that satisfies the quality criteria provided for by the European Convention on Human Rights, that is, it should be accessible and foreseeable and afford a degree of effective legal protection against arbitrary interference by the authorities (See <u>Segerstedt-Wiberg and others v. Sweden</u>, judgment of 06 June 2006, paragraphs 74-80.<br /><br />2. The collection of sensitive data on individuals, such as those relating to their ethnic origin, should be prohibited, as a matter of principle. Exceptions may be provided for by law that conforms to the aforementioned quality criteria and strictly in the cases provided for by Article 8, paragraph 2, of Directive 95/46/EC.<br /><br />3. There must be limits to the length of time for which once collected information can be retained.<br /><br />4. All personal data processing operations should be subject to close and effective supervision by independent and impartial data protection authorities.<br /><br />5. National authorities have an obligation to ensure that these standards are fully respected by the recipients before any personal data are shared with another country.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bradycampaign.org/about/paul-helmke-bio.php">Paul Helmke</a> [President, <a href="http://www.bradycampaign.org/home.php">The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence</a>]: &quot;Over the years, I have seen the gun lobby effectively thwart efforts to pass many sensible gun laws by arguing that even modest gun control would lead down the path to a complete ban on gun ownership. It is the classic &quot;slippery slope&quot; argument, and it has served the gun lobby well politically.<br /><br />The &quot;slippery slope,&quot; however, is now gone. The U.S. Supreme Court took it off the table in their <u><a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-dc-gun-ban.php">D.C. v. Heller</a></u> opinion. Government is now barred from &quot;taking away&quot; the guns of law-abiding Americans. While the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the District&#39;s ban on handguns, they also made it clear that the Constitution allows for reasonable restrictions on access to firearms.<br /><br />As Justice Scalia said, &quot;the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited.&quot; When the dust settles, most Americans &#8212; and I believe even most in the gun violence prevention movement &#8212; will come to see that there are some positives in this decision.  Elected officials will no longer be able to use a mistaken, absolutist misreading of the Second Amendment as an excuse to do nothing about gun violence in our country. Politicians can&#39;t hide behind the Second Amendment anymore.&quot;<br />

		<title>UN Human Rights Commission wise to keep up pressure on Myanmar government</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Maureen Aung-Thwin</strong> [director, Burma Project/Southeast Asia Initiative of the <a href="http://www.soros.org/">Open Society Institute</a>]: &quot;The UNHRC is wise to keep up <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/unhrc-condemns-myanmar-human-rights.php">public pressure</a> on the Burmese military regime for its continued abuse of human rights. The generals probably thought they could take a breather when the outgoing Special Rapporteur <a href="http://www.watsoninstitute.org/contacts_detail.cfm?id=435">Paulo Sergio Pinheiro</a> completed his mandate as rights envoy last month. Pinheiro&#39;s hard-hitting final report to the HR Council in mid-March was met with wild cheers from the usually staid assembly. A clearly exasperated Pinheiro later told the press assembled in Geneva: &quot;If you believe in gnomes, trolls and elves, you can believe in this democratic process in Myanmar.&quot;  <br /><br />The new rapporteur, Tom&aacute;s Ojea Quintana, a human rights lawyer from Argentina, assumed his duties as the new Special Rapporteur on May 1, the day before Cyclone Nargis devastated Burma. Mr. Quintana didn&#39;t mince words either, in his first report earlier this month, reiterating the obligation of  &quot;every government...to guarantee that its citizens enjoy all rights, particularly economic and social rights.&quot; For this, he said, &quot;all available resources within the country must be utilized and if they are insufficient, international aid must be accepted. If refused, the country is in flagrant violation of human rights and that is my legal assessment of the situation. But it is for the Council to decide.&quot;  <br /><br />The UNHRC once again is calling for an independent investigation into human rights abuses in Myanmar, a call that will no doubt fall on deaf ears. But perhaps the UNHRC soon will get some help from, of all places, Southeast Asia. Last year the Association of Southeast Asian Nations or <a href="http://www.aseansec.org/">ASEAN</a>, known for its anathema to &quot;interference&quot; in member states internal affairs, has a new Charter enshrining human rights as a principle, with the aim of soon creating a human rights body. Even the Burmese generals agreed to sign on to the Charter.&quot;<br />

		<title>Indicting Sudan&#039;s President for War Crimes: Could George Bush be Next?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://culaw2.creighton.edu/index.aspx?p=1201&sp=26">Michael Kelly</a> of Creighton University School of Law says that even though the recent indictment of sitting Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir by the prosecutor for the International Criminal Court (ICC) for war crimes in Darfur might appear to provide a precedent for indicting US President George W. Bush for alleged war crimes in his conduct of the Iraq War, major legal and political obstacles stand in the way of that ever happening...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/kellyupdated.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>N</strong></font> ow that Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir has been indicted for war crimes, could George W. Bush be next?<br /><br />Maybe. But not likely. American exceptionalism, ironically, is more the rule than the exception in modern international law. Al-Bashir was indicted by the prosecutor for the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague for his role in war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity that continue to unfold in the Darfur region of Sudan. Over the past five years, hundreds of thousands of black Sudanese have been forcibly displaced by Arab militias and government forces and at least 35,000 have been killed outright. The face of western Sudan is scarred with the rubble of burned out villages, decimated fields and eradicated settlements.<br /><br />President al-Bashir is only the third sitting president to be so indicted, and the first by the ICC. Yugoslavia&#39;s Slobodan Milosevic was indicted in 1999 by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, and Liberia&#39;s Charles Taylor was indicted in 2003 by the Special Court for Sierra Leone. Neither man was physically arrested and brought to trial, however, until after they had been deposed - a prospect that does not appear on the horizon for Sudan&#39;s Mr. Bashir.<br /><br />Nevertheless, a formal request for the arrest of a sitting president always raises questions of sovereign immunity that a leader enjoys while in office. Many in the international community consider President George W. Bush to be manifestly guilty of war crimes in his conduct of the Iraq War and openly wonder whether he or any in his administration could be held to account for that conduct. Like Sudan, the United States is not a member of the Rome Statute that created the ICC. And, as in the Sudan case, President Bush is a sitting head of state. Yet, the leader of Sudan now finds himself in the ICC&#39;s crosshairs. So what about President Bush?<br /><br />The International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled in 2002 that the sitting Congolese Foreign Minister enjoyed head of state immunity from an assertion of universal criminal jurisdiction over him by Belgium. The <em>Arrest Warrant Case</em>, as it was known, provided some comfort to political leaders in similar situations, but more recent conflicting rulings in the other direction by different judicial bodies throws that determination into question.<br /><br />The war inaugurated by the Bush administration against Iraq in 2003 was clearly a violation of international law under the United Nations Charter - even the Bush administration admits that. However, the U.N. has no criminal jurisdiction over its members. That the invasion of Iraq was unprovoked made it &quot;aggressive&quot; in nature, which is also violative of both customary and conventional international law, and which the tribunal at Nuremberg used to hang former Nazi leaders in 1947. But the ICC is a creature of its own statute, and the crime of aggression was left undefined in the treaty, so no prosecution can be brought against anyone on that score.<br /><br />Which leaves war crimes. The American-led occupation of Iraq after the 2003 invasion was negligent at best and criminal at worst, directly causing the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians. Violations of the Geneva Conventions abounded. Thus, charges based on war crimes could possibly underlie a viable indictment against President Bush and even Vice President Cheney as a key architect of the war. But the political reality of the ICC&#39;s superstructure mitigates against this possibility.<br /><br />The U.N. Security Council can quash any indictment issued by the ICC. This collective veto power over the tribunal and its prosecutor was a crucial compromise designed to reassure nervous states that the court would not be used for political prosecutions. In the end, that compromise failed to convince the U.S. to sign the treaty. And the U.S. would certainly use its position as a permanent veto-wielding member of the Security Council to muster the votes necessary to quash any indictment against President Bush.<br /><br />This very apparatus will likely save President Bashir. Now that the legal heat has been turned up on him over the atrocities committed against Sudanese under his watch, political pressure is mounting for Mr. Bashir to return to peace talks. A likely trade for Bashir&#39;s sticking to a brokered peace in Sudan, and ensuring an end to the bloodshed, would be quashing the ICC indictment against him. It is unsettling to watch politics interfere in legal process, and especially so in the nascent realm of international criminal law.<br /><br />Yet, the mixture of law and politics is sometimes a necessary evil in order to accomplish a greater good. For example, the U.S. and Britain famously agreed to Stalin&#39;s demand that political groups be left unprotected by the legal definition of genocide in exchange for the Soviet bloc signing on to the Genocide Convention - &quot;better to have them in than out&quot; ran the logic.<br /><br />Although it is great fun to speculate and draw up indictments for war crimes, as the irrepressible Christoper Hitchens has done against Henry Kissinger, President Bush will not be indicted by the ICC anytime soon. As for Sudan&#39;s President Bashir, despite his indictment by the tribunal, this new and bold venture in The Hague, admirable as it is, has no police force of its own to effectuate any arrest anywhere - even in the streets of Amsterdam. Thus, Mr. Bashir won&#39;t be arrested in Khartoum, as he controls his own security forces, and the outgunned U.N. peacekeepers would not attempt an arrest anyway. <br /><br />Nevertheless, Article 59 of the Rome Statute mandates that all of the 105 nations party to the treaty &quot;shall immediately take steps to arrest the person in question in accordance with [their] laws....&quot; So, at least while this indictment looms over him, Mr. Bashir would be well advised to steer clear of Paris, Johannesburg, Rio or any states amenable to the ICC&#39;s jurisdiction. Otherwise, like Chile&#39;s Augusto Pinochet, who was arrested in Britain on a crimes against humanity indictment from Spain in 1998, Mr. Bashir could find himself taking a much longer vacation than he anticipated.<br /><br />Consequently, the indictment at least has the effect of placing Mr. Bashir under house arrest in Sudan. Yet somehow, war crimes and genocide should draw more than a stern &quot;time-out.&quot; Shouldn&#39;t they?<br /><br /><br /><em>Michael J.

		<title>The Iraqi Oil Contracts and the Importance of Independent Counsel</title>

One legal aspect of this story, however, has gone largely unreported in the larger media and deserves greater consideration, particularly among us lawyers who take the notion of legal representation and legal ethics fairly seriously.<br /><br />To review, Iraq's Oil Ministry announced last week that Iraq was in final negotiations with a number of larger oil companies, among them Chevron, Total, BP, Exxon Mobil and Shell, on contracts to develop some of the larger oil fields in Iraq's south. This attracted media and Congressional attention mainly because the contracts were no-bid, meaning that there was no open bidding process to obtain them, unusual in the industry and particularly unusual given the global demand for oil presently. Suggestions soon arose that perhaps the United States had something to do with the manner in which the contracts were awarded, given that the largest beneficiaries were American oil companies. Calls arose in Congress to cancel or delay the contracts, and the Bush administration vehemently denied any involvement.<br /><br />In this atmosphere, an article appeared in the <em>New York Times</em> indicating that U.S. government officials had advised the Iraqi government as to the contracts. Some advice was given through a program entitled <em>Tatweer</em> (Arabic for development) funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and organized by a consulting firm. In addition, it was reported that advisers from the Departments of State, Commerce, Energy and Interior regularly advise the Oil Ministry in Iraq.<br /><br />Defending their activities as having nothing to do with the awarding of the contracts, <em>Tatweer</em> officials insisted that their advice was purely legal &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; offering contract templates, suggesting clauses to include, providing formatting changes. The State Department claimed to offer similar advice. In the words of one State Department official, what was told to the Ministry was along the lines of "these are the clauses you may want. You will need a clause on arbitration. You will need this clause to make this work.&#39;&#39; The reason for all of this advice, someone from <em>Tatweer</em> indicated, was that there was an exodus of qualified employees and lawyers able to draft contracts of these sorts.<br /><br />This was supposedly meant in defense of this program, as a demonstration that the advice was not the surreptitious exertion of undue influence on the Iraqis to issue the no-bid contracts. Yet the defense is in many ways considerably worse than the initial accusation. As an attorney, it seems to me that if all of this is true, then the Tatweer officials and the government lawyers have been advising the government extremely poorly and the Iraqi Oil Ministry is doing a deep and fundamental disservice to its own people. <br /><br />I realize these words are strong, but I do not think they are overstated. It seems inconceivable to me that a competent lawyer (in the government, on a USAID contract or otherwise) if handed an oil contract and told that it is a contract between Iraq and an unnamed oil company and then asked to comment thereon on behalf of the Iraqi government would provide any comment further than "hire a lawyer." There are plenty such lawyers, who have spent decades drafting precisely contracts of this sort and who are more than capable of providing excellent, first rate representation who could handle such matters. Certainly they are more capable of serving the needs of their clients than these U.S. government advisers, with other obligations and interests, would be. (In full disclosure, I have on occasion advised the Iraqi government on any number of topics, and repeatedly urge them to hire lawyers on anything of significance, arranging in some cases meetings with potential law firms and suggesting which one appeared to be the most qualified). <br /><br />Moreover, Model Rule of Professional Responsibility 4.3 indicates that a lawyer cannot offer legal advice to an unrepresented person whose interests conflict with those of her client, other than to seek counsel. The lawyer should also not state or imply that the lawyer is disinterested. The U.S. government as a voracious oil consumer clearly has interests in oil that conflict with those of Iraq, an oil producer, though perhaps technically speaking the Iraqi government is being advised by its own domestic legal department and so is not "unrepresented." While perhaps sufficient to evade sanction, this hardly seems like a principled position for the U.S. government to take given that the severe shortcomings of that Iraqi legal department are precisely what led to the institution of the program to offer legal advice in the first place. <br /><br />As for the Iraqis, giving the Ministry the benefit of every possible doubt, one must assume that their lawyers are simply not experienced enough to understand the importance of retaining independent counsel. As someone who has been intimately involved in Iraqi legal education and practice, I have great respect for Iraq's legal culture and the dedication of its legal professionals. However, thirty five years of isolation has taken its toll, particularly as regards matters of international commerce. Still, it is difficult to justify or explain the Iraqi decision to rely on their in-house legal department, and to ask U.S. government lawyers for assistance on occasion despite the obvious potential conflict. The large oil companies, with a far more experienced and deeper in-house staff, would never hesitate to hire top notch counsel when in need of assistance. Surely on a matter of this importance involving this much money, Iraq must do the same, and the U.S. government should be telling them as much.<br /><br /><br /><em>Haider Ala Hamoudi is a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.

As head of the United States delegation to the talks creating the International Criminal Court, I rejected the final text of the treaty for the court. Since then, 106 countries, including almost all of our allies, have joined the court while Washington remains outside it.<br /><br />President Bill Clinton believed the court should be built by the end of the 20th century and as his Ambassador at Large for War Crimes Issues it was my job to make that happen. The United States spearheaded the Yugoslav and Rwanda war crimes tribunals and helped lead the talks culminating in the Rome conference. At Rome we achieved most of our goals: defining the atrocity crimes to be prosecuted (genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes), affirming the court's structure, general principles of criminal law and due process rights, and deferring cases to national courts unless they are unwilling or unable to prosecute suspects. <br /><br />The United States wanted only the United Nations Security Council to initiate or approve referrals of atrocity crimes to the court. We opposed independent powers for the prosecutor. But we lost that battle early at Rome and moved on.<br /><br />The Joint Chiefs of Staff and the late Senator Jesse Helms, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee then, were breathing down my neck, insisting I do nothing to expose United States soldiers and citizens to the court's jurisdiction. With Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's support, I had proposed going to Rome with a saleable deal that would ensure no liability for Americans during the years of our non-party status, which were certain to be many, in exchange for the kind of court most governments insisted upon and met most of our demands. The Pentagon rejected my proposal and sought full immunity forever. (One year later they asked me to resurrect my proposal but by then it was too late.) <br /><br />In the Rome conference's final week I obtained Pentagon approval to negotiate one last proposal: Any new party to the treaty could opt out of the court's prosecution of its nationals for committing any crimes against humanity or war crimes, but not genocide, during the first ten years only. This would give the United States and others a transitional period during which to adjust to the court's jurisdiction, observe its performance and then withdraw if desired. The other Security Council permanent members (Britain, France, Russia, China) agreed to advance this proposal which, if adopted, would have enabled our delegation to join consensus on the final draft of the treaty. <br /><br />But most governments rejected our tardy initiative. The Pentagon told me to forget about seeking any other approval from Washington, which then instructed me to call for a vote just to register American opposition to the final text. I objected because we would go down in flames and only reassert American exceptionalism. We could have recorded dissent with a strong floor statement. But diplomats follow instructions. I voted "no" with Israel and several dictatorships.<br /><br />Hundreds of delegates and civil society advocates leaped up and cheered our defeat. Sir Frank Berman, the British negotiator, remained seated next to me in a remarkable act of respect. From that moment forward, the United States no longer led the pursuit of international justice.<br /><br />However, we achieved enough in subsequent negotiations for me to sign the Rome treaty at Mr. Clinton's request on December 31, 2000. (Israel also signed that day.) We recognized there was more work to be done to enable the United States to ratify the treaty. But we handed the incoming Bush administration negotiated proposals and the stature of being a signatory nation to the treaty to advance our concerns in further talks. <br /><br />True to its anti-treaty philosophy, the new administration abandoned any credible effort and took the unprecedented step of de-activating my signature and launching an assault on the court that realists in Washington only recently have begun to roll back. The neo-cons stoked such paranoia about the court and international justice that the administration's self-destructive plunge into criminal conduct against detainees in the so-called war on terror demonstrated a hideously consistent attitude. <br /><br />In Washington many lost sight of the court's aim to bring to justice political and military leaders who orchestrate massive atrocity crimes against thousands in lawless regions where national justice fails. The court, entering its seventh year of work, struggles to meet that challenge in Darfur (with Sudan's President Bashir now facing a possible arrest warrant for genocide), Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Central African Republic. <br /><br />As the American negotiator I argued that the court would need the United States to function effectively on the global stage. But following years of misconduct under the Bush administration, one might ponder whether it is the United States that needs the International Criminal Court to help restore its credibility and reassert fundamental principles of humanity. <br /><br /><br /><em>David Scheffer is the Mayer Brown/Robert A.

JURIST readers may well conclude that <em>de jure</em> and <em>de facto</em> leaders will abhor a vacuum regarding the legal status of coalition forces currently present in Iraq. <br /><br />On 16 October 2003, UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1511 officially recognized the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) as Iraq&#39;s transitional government. That resolution also granted authority for a multinational, coalitional stabilization force in Iraq under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. Seven months later, on 27 June 2004, the CPA issued <a href="http://www.cpa-iraq.org/regulations/20040627_CPAORD_17 _Status_of_Coalition__ Rev__ with _Annex _ A.pdf">Order 17</a>, granting all foreign personnel under the U.S.-led CPA, both uniformed and civilian, immunity from &quot;local [Iraqi] criminal, civil and administrative jurisdiction and from any form of arrest or acting on behalf of their parent states." When the CPA transferred power to a sovereign Iraqi interim government, and the CPA officially dissolved, a legal "vacuum" of authority existed regarding Iraqi legal jurisdiction over coalitional forces. <br /><br />In an earlier era, the US approach to such an absence of local jurisdiction as well as authority for operations on foreign soil would have involved the so-called "law of the flag" approach: "a foreign army permitted to march through a friendly country, or to be stationed in it, by permission of its government or sovereign, is exempt from the civil and criminal jurisdiction of that place" (See <a href="http://supreme.justia. com/us/97/509/">Coleman v. Tennessee</a>, 97 U.S. 509, 515 (1878)). <br /><br />In March 2008, the US Department of State's official position was that coalition operations could continue &quot;beyond the end of [2008] under the laws passed by Congress and the president&#39;s authority as commander in chief.&quot; (See <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-32323920080306">U.S.: No need for more Iraq war permit from Congress</a>, Reuters, 6 March 2008).<br /><br />Such "laws passed by Congress" might well include the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act (MEJA) (18 U.S.C. &Acirc;&#167; 3261), which allows for the prosecution of persons "employed by or accompanying the armed forces" overseas for crimes punishable by imprisonment of more than one year. They might also include the 2001 <a href="http://news.findlaw.com/wp/ docs/terrorism/sjres23.es.html ">Joint Resolution on Authorization for Use of Military Force</a> (Public Law 107-40) and the 2002 <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/ news/releases/2002/10/20021002-2.html">Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution</a> (Public Law 107-243). Finally, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (NDAA) (Pub. L. 110-18) brought all civilian contractors in Iraq under the military&#39;s jurisdiction. The first conviction under that new authority came on 22 June 2008 when a US military court in Iraq convicted Alaa &quot;Alex&quot; Mohammad Ali, an Iraqi-Canadian translator, of aggravated assault for the February 2008 stabbing death of a fellow military contractor in Iraq (See JURIST - <em>Paper Chase</em>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/us-military-court-convicts-first.php">US military court convicts first civilian since Vietnam</a>, 23 June 2008). <br /><br />In journalist Anne Flaherty's opinion, the State Department's position on coalition operations "reaffirm[ed] the administration&#39;s position that it does not need international or congressional approval to conduct military operations anywhere in the world, particularly when going after terrorists." (See Flaherty, Anne, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2008-03-05-3418976217_x.htm">UN Mandate In Iraq Not Needed</a>, <em>USA Today</em>, 8 Mar. 2008).<br /><br />Nevertheless, such an approach to international law and overseas operations, in the absence of some type of immunity or arrangement, seemingly contradicts the principle that "forces that find themselves in another nation's territory must comply with that nation's laws." (See Gerhard Von Glahn, <em>Law Among Nations</em> 238 (1992), at 225-6, cited with authority in JA 422, <a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/ doddir/army/law2007.pdf">Operational Law Handbook</a>, The Judge Advocate General's Center &amp; School (2007), at 67).<br /><br />In a few months there will arguably be a legal "vacuum" created when the UN mandate for runs out for coalition forces in Iraq. That mandate, established under UNSCR 1511 (2003) mentioned earlier, has been renewed annually by UNSCRs 1546 (2004), 1637 (2005), and 1723 (2006). As I noted in a JURIST <em>Forum</em> article on <a href="/forumy/2007/02/rethinking-rule-of-law-efforts-in-iraq.php">Rethinking Rule of Law Efforts in Iraq</a>, Iraq is endeavoring to establish and sustain a constitutional and democratic rule of law capacity &#8212; via its law enforcement, justice, and corrections systems, along with Iraqi Security Force (ISF) capability. Increasingly, Iraq has sought to assert its sovereign authority as a nation and delineate the limitations of coalitional forces remaining in Iraq. <br /><br />At Iraq's request to extend the mandate "for the last time," the UN Security Council decided unanimously via Resolution 1790 (2007) that actions under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter would be reviewed at the request of the Government of Iraq or no later than 15 June 2008. The UN mandate would expire on 31 December 2008 or be terminated earlier if the Iraqi government requested the Council to do so (See UN Press Release, <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2007/sc9207.doc.htm">Security Council, Acting On Iraq's Request, Extends 'For Last Time&#39; Mandate of Multinational Force</a>, 18 December 2007). <br /><br />One possible way to fill the legal "vacuum" after expiration would be a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), sometimes also referred to as a Status of Mission Agreement (SOMA) under UN Chapter VII auspices (e.g., the African Union <a href="http://www.unmis.org/english/au.htm">SOMA for the UN Mission In Somalia</a> &#8212; UNMIS). The Council on Foreign Relations has noted that historically SOFAs have served as a "legal framework that defines how foreign militaries operate in a host country." Typically SOFAs are established by executive agreement, rather than treaty, but are "without uniform or standard format for the document, which can vary in length and specificity" (See Bruno, Greg, <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/16448/us_security_agreements_and_iraq.html">Backgrounder - U.S. Security Agreements and Iraq</a>, Council on Foreign Relations, 6 June 2008). <br /><br />SOFAs may delineate, amongst other things, who is subject to criminal and/or civil jurisdiction of the host country to which they are deploying, as well as civil liabilities such as taxation (See, e.g., Army Regulation (AR) 715-9, Contractors Accompanying the Force, 29 October 1999, at para. 3-1(g)). Neither the US nor Iraq have SOFAs with every nation with which they operate, and indeed, there are missions for which other forms of bilateral agreements (like an exchange of diplomatic notes) or multilateral instruments (like
treaties) or even no formal instrument may be more suitable. Nonetheless, by at least one account, the U.S. had permanent SOFAs with more than 90 nations, or 46 percent of the world's 190 nation-states (such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] nations, Bosnia, Japan, and Korea) (See Pike, John, GlobalSecurity.org <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/sofa.htm">Status-of-Forces Agreement [SOFA] Webpage</a>, 26 April 2005). <br /><br />The draft US-Iraqi SOFA proposal has been a point of negotiation since 2004, but pursued in earnest since March 2008, tentatively addressing immunity of American troops from Iraqi prosecution, the operations of over 60 military bases in Iraq, continued power to detain Iraqi prisoners, and protections for civilian contractors, (even though American contractors do not enjoy such immunity from local laws elsewhere). (See Shanker, Thom and Myers, Steven Lee, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/ 01/25/world/middleeast/25military.html">Contractors Working With The American Military Granted Protection From Local Laws</a>, <em>New York Times</em>, 25 January 2008); JURIST readers will find superb expositions examining contractor liability in Professor Byron L. Warnken's 12 November 2007 <em>Forum</em> contribution entitled <a href="/forumy/2007/11/blackwater-garrity-and-immunity-what.php">Blackwater, Garrity, and Immunity: What Does It All Mean?</a> and Attorney Tara Lee's 24 April 2008 <em>Forum</em> piece entitled <a href="/forumy/2008/04/dont-kick-contractors-off-battlefield.php">Don&#39;t Kick Contractors Off the Battlefield: Just Hold Them Accountable</a>.)<br /><br />If a SOFA is in fact concluded with Iraq, the signatories may well look to the NATO SOFA as a model for emulation; that SOFA sets forth three general classes of sending state personnel: 1) Members of the "force," i.e., members of the armed forces of the sending state; 2) Members of the "civilian component" (i.e., civilian employees of the sending state); 3) "Dependents" (i.e., the family members of the force or civilian components dependent upon them for support (JA 422, <em>supra</em>, at 130). Customarily excluded from the second category, contractor employees may well require special technical arrangements or international agreements so they enjoy rights and privileges associated with SOFA status (JA 422, <em>supra</em>, at 130). <br /><br />Also under negotiation is a so-called "strategic framework," details of which still remain sketchy, but purportedly include political and economic initiatives to "increase investment into Iraq; foster debt reduction; and encourage cultural, education, and scientific exchanges between the countries." (See Bruno, <em>supra</em>).<br /><br />In an extraordinary confluence of current events and legal developments, federal courts in the May and June 2008 timeframe have rendered significant opinions involving international law, SOFAs, and both civil and criminal jurisdiction in Iraq.<br /><br />The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled in <em>Lane v. Halliburton, et. al.</em>, (No. 06-20874, filed 28 May 2008) to reverse and remand to the District Court a case brought against military contractors in Iraq, holding that the case "needed further factual development before it can be known" that the "political question doctrine" is "actually an impediment" to reviewing tort claims against those contractors. In so doing, the three-judge panel from the Fifth Circuit court said it "may be possible to resolve the claims without needing to make a constitutionally impermissible review of wartime decision-making.&quot;<br /><br />More recently, the US Supreme Court handed down a unanimous decision on 12 June 2008 in the case of <a href="http://www.supreme courtus.gov/ opinions/07pdf/06-1666.pdf">Munaf et Al. v. Geren, Secretary Of The Army, et al.</a>, 553 U.S.___ (2008). That case upheld basic legal rights for Americans held abroad by the U.S. military, but did not find such safeguards extended to dual Iraqi-US citizens tried and convicted by Iraqi authorities for crimes committed in Iraq. The case upheld Iraqi criminal jurisdiction over Shawqi Omar for assisting a terrorist network, and Mohammad Munaf for kidnapping Romanian journalists. <br /><br />Petitioners argued that under <em>Valentine v. US ex rel. Neidecker</em>, 299 U.S. 5 (1936), the Executive [the President] lacks discretion to transfer a citizen to Iraqi custody unless "legal authority" to do so "is given by act of Congress or by the terms of a treaty." The Court distinguished <em>Valentine</em>, an extradition case from the US. Petitioners also argued precedent from <em>Wilson v. Girard</em>, 354 U. S. 524, 529 (1957) applied to Munaf, where that case stated a "sovereign nation has exclusive jurisdiction to punish offenses against its laws committed within its borders" and a SOFA between Japan and the US seemed to give the habeas petitioner a right to trial by an American military tribunal, rather than a Japanese court." <br /><br />The Court distinguished <em>Wilson</em> from <em>Munaf</em>, as in no small part because there was a SOFA extant between the US and Japan, unlike the present state of relations with Iraq, and in the present case of <em>Munaf</em> there was a transfer to a sovereign's authority of an individual captured and already detained in that sovereign's territory. In his majority opinion, Chief Justice Roberts wrote that "To allow United States courts to intervene in an ongoing foreign criminal proceeding and pass judgment on its legitimacy seems at least as great an intrusion as the plainly barred collateral review of foreign convictions." (See Yost, Pete, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/12/AR2008061201744.html ">Court rules against 2 US citizens in Iraq</a>, <em>Washington Post</em>, 12 June 2008). <br /><br />Perhaps of even greater significance to ongoing US-Iraqi SOFA negotiations, the <i>Washington Post</em> reported on 13 June 2008 that the US administration "suffered two major setbacks &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; when Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki publicly rejected key U.S. terms for an ongoing military presence and anti-American Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr called for a new militia offensive against U.S. forces." (See Paley, Amit R. and DeYoung, Karen, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/13/AR2008061302019.html">Key Iraqi Leaders Deliver Setbacks to U.S.</a>, <em>Washington Post</em>, 14 June 2008).<br /><br />Prime Minister al-Maliki was quoted as saying the SOFA drafts proposed "left us at a dead end and deadlock, so we left these and the negotiations will continue with new ideas until the sides reach a formula that preserves Iraq&#39;s sovereignty" (See Negus, Steve and Morris, Harvey, <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a20b4600-396c-11dd-90d7-0000779fd2ac,dwp_uuid=17aab8bc-6e47-11da-9544-0000779e2340.html?nclick_check=1)">Iraq forces talks reach 'dead end,'</a> Financial Times, 13 June 2008). Further delineating the prerequisites for progress, al-Maliki said &quot;Any agreement that infringes on Iraq&#39;s sovereignty and its components will be dismissed and will not be acceptable," noting that any agreement would require the Iraqi Parliament's final approval (See <a href="http://www6.lexisnexis.com/publisher/EndUser?Action=UserDisplayFullDocument&orgId=574&topicId=100039279&docId=l:807689936&start=14">Maliki rejects draft US &#39;security&#39; pact</a>, <em>Morning Star</em>, 14 June 2008).<br /><br />In contrast, injecting an element of optimism and forward progress, Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said of the SOFA and Security Agreement efforts on 15 June 2008 that &quot;These talks are ongoing. They&#39;re not dead &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; Definitely, there hasn&#39;t been an impasse &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; I&#39;m confident that we will be able to secure the strategic framework agreement by the end of July." (See <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hO-IbHiSg9Be0gyb8IoJn8cu02gA">US-Iraq security pact &#39;not dead,&#39; deal ready in July: Iraqi FM</a>, AFP, 15 June 2008). <br /><br />In efforts to prope
l negotiations forward, the US has purportedly agreed that foreign contractors in Iraq will no longer have immunity from Iraqi law, according to Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari, as reported on 18 June 2008 (See Cockburn, Patrick, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/iraq-deal-with-us-to-end-immunity-for-foreign-contractors-849225.html">Iraq deal with US to end immunity for foreign contractors</a>, <em>The Independent</em>, 18 June 2008).<br /><br />In a tip as to possible further SOFA concessions, news sources reported Iraq&#39;s oil minister Hussain al-Shahristani as saying on 18 June 2008 that Iraq is insisting on the right to veto any US military operations throughout its territory, and that the agreement would last for a maximum of two years and could be terminated by either side with six months&#39; notice. (See Steele, Jonathan, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jun/18/iraq.usforeignpolicy">Baghdad insists on right to veto US operations</a>, <em>The Guardian</em>, 18 June 2008).<br /><br />Despite this progress, a strong voice of opposition has emanated from the Iraqi Parliament. Husayn al-Falluji, Leader of Iraqi Accordance Front (the largest Sunni bloc in Iraqi Parliament) said on 11 June 2008 of the possible SOFA that "We have found a formulation marked by arrogance, dictates, and coercion toward the Iraqi side &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; If we have to choose between this agreement and Iraq remaining internationalized under Chapter 7 [of the UN Charter], we are for keeping Iraq at the mercy of Chapter 7 rather than the mercy of a U.S. presence entailing a more uncertain future than at present&quot; (See Recknagel, Charles, <a href="http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2008/06/5E848C5B-E8D5-4067-97BB-D61BBFAB87BB.html">Iraq: Debate Flares Over U.S. Security Pact</a>, RFE/RL, 12 June 2008). <br /><br />Another significant voice raised on this SOFA has been that of Grand Ayatollah Ali al Sistani. While not a <em>de jure</em> elected leader, he is the <em>de facto</em> spiritual leader of Iraq's Shi'ite population (some three times larger than the Iraqi Sunni population). Al Sistani has pledged he would not allow Iraq to sign such a deal with &quot;the US occupiers," noting his strong objection to Prime Minister al-Maliki in May of 2008 (See <a href="http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=57198&sectionid=351020201">Ayatollah will not allow US-Iraq deal</a>, PressTV Website, 24 May 2008). <br /><br /><center>* * *</center><br />The following complimentary yet inconclusive comments, made after an exceptionally brief 30-minute US-Iraqi Presidential meeting at the White House, express the ambitions as well as limitations on advancing stability, security, and the legal authority for coalition forces to remain in &#8212; or withdraw from &#8212; Iraq: <br /><br />"We talked about a strategic framework agreement that suits the Iraq government. We talked about elections and different laws that have been passed &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; We talked about the fact that the economy is improving, and that the attitude of the people there has improved immeasurably over the years &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; I&#39;m proud of what [President Talabani has] done, and I thank [him] for the tough decisions, so that the people of a free Iraq can realize hopes and dreams."<br /><br />- President George Bush, 25 June 2008 (See Transcript, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/06/20080625-1.html">President Bush Meets with President Talabani of Iraq</a>, White House, 25 June 2008)<br /><br />and<br /><br />"I&#39;m grateful for what he said about me, but I agree with him that we are going to work together for having this agreement &#8212; security agreement between the United States and Iraq, and also to continue our cooperation in our struggle against terrorism, for promotion of democracy in Iraq and Middle East &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; I think we have &#8212; we were able to go the steps towards reaching to finalize this agreement. And we continue our struggle to -- our efforts to reach &#8212; Inshallah &#8212; very soon this agreement."<br /><br />- President Jalal Talabani, 25 June 2008 (<em>Id</em>.)<br /><br /><br /><em>Kevin Govern is a professor at Ave Maria School of Law.

		<title>Bombs Away? The Dublin Cluster Bomb Ban</title>

Though the news was only lightly reported in the United States, it received major coverage in Europe, widely described as a major diplomatic defeat for the United States. Coming just a bit over a decade since the Ottawa Convention that banned anti-personnel landmines, the Dublin Ban raises the question: How big a defeat is this for the United States? <br /><br />Actually, Dublin is a mixed bag, doling out portions of both victory and defeat for the United States and the ban's advocates. It is certainly not the Bush Administration's Ottawa, Kyoto (for the climate change protocol of the same year) or Rome (for the international criminal court of 1998), negotiations where the Clinton Administration lost hard-fought and high-profile battles. <br /><br />Ban proponents hail the treaty as a milestone with good reason, for cluster munitions &#8212; which typically involve a device that can disperse from a few to hundreds of submunitions, or bomblets &#8212; can impose severe humanitarian costs. They may accidentally disperse to hit civilian objects; some may fail to explode, remaining long after conflict has ended like a landmine, until a civilian stumbles upon one. And since each munition may contain hundreds of bomblets, even a tiny failure rate can cause substantial civilian harm. <br /><br />Perhaps most importantly, the treaty begins a long-term process of stigmatization, making cluster bombs harder politically for the United States and other militaries to use even if available legally. Further, the treaty&#39;s provisions on victim assistance, stockpile destruction and clearance will reinforce global efforts to reduce the toll taken by explosive remnants of war of all sorts. Together these constitute a victory ban proponents should be happy to celebrate. <br /><br />The ban was opposed by U.S. military planners because they see cluster munitions as integral to U.S. operations, and feel the technical safeguards incorporated into US cluster weapons address the humanitarian risks. Bush Administration officials so opposed a ban that they did not send representatives to Dublin. <br /><br />Yet U.S. allies won for the United States a loophole that it could not win for itself. They preserved American flexibility to use cluster munitions in joint operations with allies that might join the treaty, including key NATO partners like Britain. <br /><br />A variety of pressures compelled the NATO powers in Dublin to support a ban in principle, but the biggest difficulty the ban presented to them was how their armed forces could continue to work together if they were bound not to use, transfer or stockpile cluster bombs, nor to "assist anyone" outside the treaty in doing so. NATO states called this assistance ban the "interoperability problem," and for them it was a showstopper, committed as they are to joint operations with the United States. <br /><br />The stage in Dublin was thus set for discord between, on the one side, ban proponents looking to replicate the Ottawa landmine ban convention's blanket prohibition of a problematic weapon, and, on the other, a NATO-led group of countries committed to ensuring that the interoperability migraine they had after Ottawa would not be followed by a cluster headache after Dublin. <br /><br />NATO won this particular battle. Drafters tucked into the Dublin treaty a provision that permits countries that sign it to "engage in military cooperation and operations&quot; with countries that don&#39;t join even when those countries might use cluster bombs. For the United States, this addresses concerns about whether members of its coalitions are party to the cluster ban; they can cooperate militarily even if the United States uses cluster munitions. <br /><br />This is a clear break from the Ottawa mine ban treaty, which doesn&#39;t include such a provision. <br /><br />Cluster ban proponents opposed this loophole but evidently determined that a good treaty with NATO states in was better than a great one with them out. A failure to reach agreement in Dublin would have reanimated an alternative negotiating process under a competing treaty, the Convention on Conventional Weapons, where major military powers such as Russia, China and the United States &#8212; all of which oppose a ban &#8212; would have called the shots. <br /><br />Dublin, then, while a major advance in the law of war, is neither clear victory nor clear defeat for anyone. It gives something for everyone to cheer and jeer. <br /><br />But for Americans, there remains a more general shortfall. The Bush Administration opted out of engaging with others who sought objectives seemingly at odds with our own, and, as a result, weakened another kind of interoperability &#8212; the political and diplomatic interoperability that is an essential element of American leadership in the international community. <br /><br />The Dublin Ban is unlikely to be the last of its kind. One hopes that, next time, a confident American foreign and military policy can engage allies and adversaries to ensure the greatest protection to the widest numbers of civilians. <br /><br /><br /><em>Steven Solomon is Principal Legal Officer at the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland; David Kaye is the Executive Director of the UCLA School of Law International Human Rights Program.

		<title>The Yoo and Addington Hearings: A Citizen&#039;s Right to Know NOW</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/students/faculty/BDavis/BDavis.htm">Benjamin Davis</a> of the University of Toledo College of Law says that in the face of disconcertedly-vague and incomplete recollections by Cheney chief of staff David Addington and former DOJ lawyer John Yoo, other officials who witnessed the development of the Bush administration&#39;s torture policies should stand up for justice and tell their stories to the people so that criminal actions by administration lawyers and other high officials do not go unpunished - or under-punished....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/benjamindavisnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>W</strong></font>atching the US House Judiciary Committee hearings yesterday I was struck by the careful similarity of litany between William Haynes, John Yoo and David Addington about their vague and imprecise recollection of all the events related to putting the Bush Administration&#39;s torture policy in place. It made me think that one of the qualities that must be sought in persons that are in these positions is the uncanny ability to fail to remember things &#8212; a sort of specialized &quot;Torture Alzheimers&quot;. And the assertions of privileges that have been invoked by the current US Office of Legal Counsel head Stephen Bradbury (who has written his own torture memos) to ostensibly keep the former Office of Legal Counsel person, John Yoo, from speaking plainly about what went on is one extraordinary case of <em>chutzpah</em> &#8212; up there with the boy who killed his parents asking the court for mercy as he is an orphan. The left hand washing the right hand...<br /><br />One part that struck me was the questioning about what can be done about the lawyers. The questions went two ways: 1) can a person be insulated from prosecution for having done things that common sense tells them are torture by relying on a legal memo and 2) is there any remedy that can be sought against a lawyer who writes an outrageous opinion? On the first question, there seemed to be a glimmer of recognition that those persons who actually do the torture could be prosecuted notwithstanding the reliance on the outrageous memo. On the second question, I must say I was struck by the comments that the only possibly remedy against the offending lawyer in this setting is bar discipline. Such solicitude! It seemed that no one dared speak of the possibility of high-level civilian lawyers being criminally prosecuted. Maybe that is just considered bad form at this level of government.<br /><br />The concern expressed was with the people who have to do these dirty deeds and making sure that they do not have the rug pulled out from under them at a subsequent point. Of course, that is nonsense &#8212; the concern of Addington and Yoo and the persons with their hands all over the torture is that their own skin be saved. That was proved very clearly in the perfect willingness to allow the prosecutions of those low-level people at Abu Ghraib to go forward and the white-washing with regard to anyone who wore a star or a suit at higher levels. Anybody remember such solicitude expressed for Specialist Graner and the other so-called "bad apples"?<br /><br />What we can glean is that there was a great deal of lawyer-to-lawyer discussion going on through the general counsel's offices of the intelligence agencies, the Department of Defense, the White House, and the Department of Justice about what could or could not be done. And we also have confirmed again to us that the Speaker of the House and ranking members of the relevant Senate and House committees were most definitely in the loop to some extent about the policy, the legal analysis, and what went on. Nary a word of objection during all those years.<br /><br />I am in Toledo, Ohio. I am not privy to all the inner sanctums where all these discussions went on. I am a mere citizen. I would just like to say that, notwithstanding all the artful dodging that went on in this hearing and in previous ones, I, as one citizen, am not duped. I know from the contours that torture was ordered from the President on down, that the lawyers wrote the convenient memos to make it possible, and that people have been tortured, murdered, and driven insane in several places in the world by this illegal policy of my government.<br /><br />And as a citizen, with my little spark of the sovereign in our democratic system, I will not stand for it. I insist that the members of Congress open the windows, the Executive branch open the windows, and the Courts use their powers to order the windows open so that we can get to the bottom of this. <br /><br />Not in some future administration, not in some future report. Now. Today.<br /><br />I want to see this Attorney General stop "playing footsie" (legal term) and open an investigation and prosecution. There are plenty of people who saw what was going on who can come forward and speak about the roles of high-level civilians in putting torture in place. These policies did not drop from the sky but were concocted. I am certain that there are plenty of mid-level people in the government who know exactly where the dogs are buried in this setting and they are keeping quiet out of fear of retribution.<br /><br />For all those people keeping quiet, I have a quote for you from a Martin Luther King, Jr. sermon "But, If Not" that one of my students brought to my attention, to wit:<blockquote>You may be 38 years old, as I happen to be.<br />And one day, some great opportunity stands before you<br />and calls upon you to stand up for some great principle,<br />some great issue, some great cause.<br />And you refuse to do it because you are afraid.<br />You refuse to do it because you want to live longer.<br />You're afraid that you will lose your job,<br />or you're afraid that you will be criticized<br />or that you will lose your popularity,<br />or you're afraid that somebody will stab you,<br />or shoot at you or bomb your house;<br />so you refuse to take the stand.<br /><br />Well you may go on and live until you are 90,<br />but you're just as dead at 38 as you would be at 90.<br /><br />And the cessation of breathing in your life is but the belated announcement of an earlier death of the spirit. You died when you refused to stand up for right. You died when you refused to stand up for truth. You refused to stand up for justice. <br /><br />-Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.<br />From the sermon "But, If Not"<br />delivered at Ebenezer Baptist Church November 5, 1967</blockquote><br />Where are the people in the Executive, Legislative and Judiciary who will stand up for right, for truth, and for justice on torture? Is that too much for a citizen to ask?<br /><br /><br /><em>Benjamin Davis is a professor at the University of Toledo College of Law</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Lt. Col. Stephen Abraham (US Army, ret.), formerly assigned to the Office for the Administrative Review of the Detention of Enemy Combatants, says that the US Supreme Court&#39;s opinion in <em>Boumediene v. Bush</em> is the consequence of mistaken policy decisions made over the past six years and is a clear instruction to turn back from that path...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/stephenabraham.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>O</strong></font>n April 13, 1945, Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson, speaking on the matter of war crimes trials, observed that "Farcical judicial trials conducted by us will destroy confidence in the judicial process as quickly as those conducted by any other people." He would later serve as chief prosecutor at the Nuremburg War Crimes Trials.<br /><br />On June 12, 2008, the United States Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>Boumediene v. Bush</em>, holding that provisions of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 relating to hearings for detainees at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo did not provide an adequate substitute for habeas corpus and therefore were unconstitutional. <br /><br />The response was immediate - many rushed to evaluate what was to become of the "terrorist suspects at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo" while others mistakenly decried the decision as hastening the release of terrorists without further hearing. But in our haste to determine the effect of this opinion on the fate of 250 detainees at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo, we risk overlooking a far more reaching meaning of the opinion, one that, if disregarded, would ultimately relegate this latest decision to the position of a legal and historical footnote with little practical relevance.<br /><br />In June of 2007, my <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/movabletype/archives/Al%20Odah%20reply%206-22-07.pdf">declaration</a> was submitted to the United States Supreme Court. In it, I spoke of my experiences while assigned to the military organization responsible for conducting the detainee tribunals and of my participation on such a panel. I concluded in my remarks, as I concluded while assigned to the organization, that the process put in place by the Executive Branch to review its detention of the prisoners at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo was designed not to ascertain the truth, but to legitimize the detentions while appearing to satisfy the Supreme Court's mandate in <em>Rasul</em> that the government be required to justify the detentions. That process was intended to, or at least had the consequence of, lending a veneer of legitimacy to the detentions, to launder decisions already made.<br /><br />It has been suggested by some that this declaration had the effect of causing the Court to change its earlier decision to deny review in the <em>Boumediene</em> case, a decision that effectively would have delayed, if not foreclosed, the possibility of Wednesday's decision. I would not presume such an effect. But no matter what the reasons, the Court did reverse its decision, did hear the case in December, and did issue an opinion a year after the declaration was submitted.<br /><br />Under the Court's ruling, the provisions of the Military Commissions Act (MCA) denying federal courts jurisdiction to hear habeas actions relating to the detention of individuals at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo could not be constitutionally valid in light of the detainees' constitutional privilege of habeas corpus. Specifically, the Court held that the inability of the detainees to challenge their detention proceedings and the prohibition in the MCA of a federal court's review of alleged errors in those proceedings resulted, on their face, in an inadequate substitute for habeas corpus. <br /><br />Just as was the case with the declaration and subsequent decision of the Court to hear the case, opinions regarding the Court's decision were narrowly focused and immediate. Most reports seized upon the fact that terrorism suspects imprisoned at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo would now have their day in court. That, to my mind, focused on the consequences but not the meaning of the decision.<br /><br />Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo and the condition of the detainees evidence how speedily we tired of our constitutional rights, and how greatly we clamored for the illusion of security that we should so willingly, so quickly, and so easily surrendered one for the other.<br /><br />The Supreme Court's decision was not about Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo; it was about here. It was not about the application of one particular act of Congress, but the application of all of our laws, whether they stem from any act of Congress, understandings of our Courts, or deeper, immutable principles of man and the rights attending our existence. It was not about our security but about our willingness to live under such conditions as we would impose on others. Ultimately, it was not about detainees by whatever names we may give them, but about every one of us and the inevitability of the consequences of our embracing of two standards of justice.<br /><br />Justice Scalia warned in dissenting that the Court&#39;s decision "will almost certainly cause more Americans to be killed." To him I submit that the failure of the Court to act would have affirmed the course taken these many years that have led to the deprivation of human liberties in specific instances and, more broadly, a factual precedent for the denial of the existence of those fundamental rights in the first instance. The Supreme Court&#39;s decision in <em>Boumediene</em> was compelled by threats of those that would end the great experiment that is not merely this nation&#39;s history but its destiny. Moreover, I would respond that more brave Americans than can be imagined by Justice Scalia have paid the ultimate sacrifice to preserve inalienable rights, the very essence and immutability of which have been denied by exercise of Executive prerogative.<br /><br />At the opening session to the Nuremberg Trials, Robert Jackson, exclaimed, "We must never forget that the record on which we judge these defendants today is the record on which history will judge us tomorrow." Wednesday, we were reminded of the record that we, as a nation, have allowed to be written for the more than six years that Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo has remained open.<br /><br />The Supreme Court's opinion in <em>Boumediene v. Bush</em> was the consequence of our decisions over the past six years and is a clear instruction to turn back from that path.<br /><br /><br /><em>Lt. Col. Stephen Abraham served with the Office for the Administrative Review of the Detention of Enemy Combatants in 2004 and 2005. He has served in the United States Army Reserve as a military intelligence officer for more than 22 years.</em><br />

		<title>CROATIA: Joining the European Union</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bill Fisher, Pitt Law &#39;10, files from <strong>Croatia</strong>:<br /><br />In a place of such amazing beauty, culture, and history, it is heartbreaking to see the remnants of the war and witness just how fresh the wounds still are.  Croatia is in a state of change and conflict, both politically and culturally.  I came here to learn about Croatia&#39;s accession to the European Union, but I&#39;ve learned much more already, and mostly outside of the classroom.<br /><br />I don&#39;t speak Croatian, so I can&#39;t understand the news or read the papers.  While Croatians are generally very friendly, politics is a particularly touchy subject here, so it&#39;s not often brought up in any form.  However, all of my professors here are Croatian, we&#39;ve had Croatian speakers come to the class, and there are a few Croatian students in the class, so there is an opportunity to get somewhat of a feel for the state of things.  From the standpoint of the academics, it seems only a formality that Croatia is not yet a member of the EU.  To them, the process has gone a bit slower than expected but is still marching along nicely towards accession.  The academics, like government officials, see the benefits of membership &#8212; free trade; a single market for the free movement of people, goods, and capital; common representation at the WTO, G8, and United Nations; and a common currency.  The people, however, have a slightly different opinion.<br /><br />Membership in the EU means membership in an open European community and adopting a policy of more open borders.  However, the memories of the war are still vivid in the minds of many here, and the idea that the nations of the former Yugoslavia may eventually also join the EU - thereby allowing for free movement of their citizens across Croatian borders - is a hard pill to swallow for some.  An example I can give comes from a day trip we made recently.  Only a few hours from Dubrovnik is a town in Bosnia called Mostar.  While Dubrovnik mostly represents a Roman influence, Mostar is where the Turkish influence comes into play.  We Americans, like many other tourists, see this as an interesting experience and so we planned a trip to visit the Old Bridge and Medugorje.  One student that came along, however, was born in Bosnia and lived there until he was about 13 or 14.  At his age, that puts his emigration around 1997 or 1998&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;meaning he was there for the fighting and the bombing and all the horrors that came with the war.  All throughout the region, there still stand buildings, here and there, with blast and bullet holes as a reminder of what happened.  As we approached Mostar, they became much more prevalent.  And my friend became a bit quieter.  There was graffiti in many places, but one symbol in particular stood out &#8212; my friend explains to us that it means &quot;insurgent.&quot;  Generally all is fine though, as we find a caf&eacute; near the Old Bridge to get a beer and watch the divers.  Then we decide to explore the Muslim side of town.  We oblivious Americans are captivated by the Turkish-esque experience, the cheap shopping, and the call to prayer playing from the speakers of the minaret.  My friend however, is tacit and nervous.  He has lived in America for about 10 years, and the fighting, for the most part, has been over for many years as well.  But he is afraid of what may happen if someone hears his name or catches what bit of an accent he still has when speaking English.  It&#39;s just a small example of the fear, distrust and animosity that still lingers in the area and poses a real threat to the successful integration of the Croatia people into the EU.  Though Slovenia is already a member, Croatia seems to be the gateway, the bridge between the EU and the former Yugoslavia.  It has the strongest economy among the Yugoslav nations and its legal system is most in line with the requirements of the EU.  But should they become a member state, the door will be open for the remaining nations to join as well, and the tensions between the peoples of the area may very well heighten to dangerous levels again.<br /><br />There is optimism, though.  A speaker came to our class who had not only been a prominent member of the Croatian government, but a very successful businessman as well.  In talking about his position in the government, he mentioned that a particular problem in Croatia involved trade law and his reason for getting out of government was that nothing was being done to &quot;clean up the mess.&quot;  He said that since Croatia liberated itself from Yugoslavia, the government has not really exercised any form of self-restraint.  For many years, there have been problems with things like kickbacks, &quot;squeeze-outs,&quot; and insider trading.  This was part of the reason why initial negotiations with the EU were stalled and why the process is still ongoing.  I asked him if he thought about getting back into politics to try to clean up the mess that he had once attempted to take on and what he thought the possible accession into the EU might do to aid that process.  He said frankly that he would not be going back into politics, because in all his time there he felt like he was unable to accomplish a single thing.  He also said, however, that the EU was like a carrot to Croatia, and that Croatia needed a carrot much more than the stick.  The possibility of membership should light a fire under the government to fix many of the problems in Croatian law, many of which were inherited from Yugoslavia or created in sort of a rush to establish the independent nation.<br /><br />It seems there is a perpetual conflict in this stunningly beautiful county in one form or another.  While the bombings have ceased, there is still the internal conflict between the desires of some &#8212; particularly the government and the academics &#8212; to join the EU, and the reluctance of the people to open themselves up not only potentially to the peoples of Serbia and Bosnia in time, but also to the possibility of what some see as another Yugoslavia&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;only on a much grander scale.  As a tourist who spends much of his time on the beach among Germans, Italians, and Australians, it&#39;s hard to see beyond the tourist bureau&#39;s idea of Croatia.  But as a law student, it&#39;s easier (and somewhat more painful) to see the other side &#8212; the side of fear and doubt and even a degree of jingoism among some.  But that seems to be the nature of this place, a constant balancing act.  One can only hope that as time goes on and the wounds start to heal, those wounds will not be aggravated by policies of a supranational government.  A place of such natural splendor, filled with such wonderful people, deserves peace.  Peace as opposed to war.  Peace as opposed to internal conflicts and problems.  Peace of mind for its citizens.<br /><br />As a final note, it appears that the opposition to the European Union does not only lie in potential member states, but in some long-time member states as well.  I was at dinner a few nights ago and happened to overhear bits and pieces of a conversation at a table near mine.  In that I&#39;m here to learn about the EU, it caught my attention to hear the words &quot;European Union&quot; being spoken in English.  It turns out it was an older British couple on vacation speaking with a Croatian couple sitting at the next table.  In the lulls in my own conversation, and while trying NOT to eavesdrop, I only heard a few words and phrases, but I caught a very specific &quot;do not join&quot; and a recurring utterance of the phrase &quot;bleed you dry.&quot;  So it seems that for all of the supporters the EU has, there appears to be dissatisfaction in even some of the more well-off countries.  The potential developments of passing comments like those certainly make my current studies a bit more interesting.<br />

		<title>Third Circuit delivers a victory for free speech on campus with DeJohn ruling</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.thefire.org/index.php/person/3437.html"><strong>Will Creeley</strong></a> [Director of Legal and Public Advocacy, <a href="http://www.thefire.org">Foundation for Individual Rights in Education</a>]: &quot;Yesterday&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/third-circuit-rules-university-sexual.php">Third Circuit ruling</a> [<a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/072220p.pdf">opinion</a>, PDF] in <u>DeJohn v. Temple University</u> is a important victory for free speech on campus. <br /><br />In declaring Temple&#39;s former sexual harassment policy unconstitutionally broad, the Third Circuit delivered a reaffirmation of existing Supreme Court jurisprudence regarding the robust First Amendment rights enjoyed by students at our nation&#39;s public universities. It also dealt another serious blow to the widespread and surprisingly durable practice of restricting student speech at public universities via unconstitutional speech codes masquerading as harassment policies. What&#39;s more - and perhaps most importantly - the Third Circuit&#39;s ruling also sent a much-needed signal that there exists a crucial distinction between the rights of high school students and the rights of college students. Simply put, <u>DeJohn</u> is a powerful opinion for the expressive rights of students, the influence of which will be felt for years to come. <br /><br />First, it&#39;s useful to remember the special niche public universities have long occupied in the Supreme Court&#39;s First Amendment jurisprudence. That the First Amendment&#39;s protections fully extend to the public university campus is settled law, as the Third Circuit&#39;s ruling acknowledges by citing <u>Keyishian v. Bd. of Regents, State Univ. of N.Y.</u>, 385 U.S. 589, 605&#8212;06 (1967) (&quot;[W]e have recognized that the university is a traditional sphere of free expression so fundamental to the functioning of our society that the Government&#39;s ability to control speech within that sphere by means of conditions attached to the expenditure of Government funds is restricted by the vagueness and overbreadth doctrines of the First Amendment.&quot;); <u>Healy v. James</u>, 408 U.S. 169, 180 (1972) (citation omitted) (&quot;the precedents of this Court leave no room for the view that, because of the acknowledged need for order, First Amendment protections should apply with less force on college campuses than in the community at large. Quite to the contrary, &#39;the vigilant protection of constitutional freedoms is nowhere more vital than in the community of American schools.&#39;&quot;); and <u>Widmar v. Vincent</u>, 454 U.S. 263, 268&#8212;69 (1981) (&quot;With respect to persons entitled to be there, our cases leave no doubt that the First Amendment rights of speech and association extend to the campuses of state universities.&quot;) <br /><br />But even with the Supreme Court&#39;s seemingly unambiguous pronouncements on the applicability of First Amendment rights for public university students - and a string of legal defeats in courts across the country during the 1990s - unconstitutional speech codes have flourished at campuses around the nation. <br /><br />As Director of Legal and Public Advocacy for the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), I know all too well the shocking extent of the problem. Despite a legal and moral obligation to guarantee their students&#39; constitutional rights, a recent FIRE report (<em><a href="http://www.thefire.org/speechcodereport.php">Spotlight on Speech Codes 2007: The State of Free Speech on Our Nation&#39;s Campuses</a></em>) found that 79% of the 244 public universities surveyed maintained at least one policy that both clearly and substantially restricts freedom of speech (as gauged by established legal precedent). <br /><br />Many of these unconstitutional speech codes are far worse than Temple&#39;s former sexual harassment policy, at issue in <u>DeJohn</u>. For example, in Mississippi, Delta State University&#39;s <a href="http://www.thefire.org/index.php/article/9473.html">harassment policy</a> provides that harassment occurs when the work or learning environment &quot;is one that a reasonable person would objectively find hostile or abusive or one that the particular person who is the object of the harassment perceives to be hostile or abusive.&quot; Like the Temple policy in <u>DeJohn</u>, Delta State&#39;s policy contains absolutely no requirement that the objectionable behavior be &quot;severe&quot; and &quot;pervasive,&quot; as required by the standard established by <u>Davis v. Monroe County Bd. of Educ.</u>, 526 U.S. 629, 652 (1999). As the <u>DeJohn</u> court correctly noted, policies lacking these crucial prongs &quot;provide...no shelter for core protected speech.&quot; Equally bad is Saginaw Valley State University&#39;s <a href="http://www.svsu.edu/emplibrary/07-08%20_Student_Handbook_B.pdf">Policy on Discrimination, Sexual Harassment and Racial Harassment</a> [PDF], which defines sexual harassment, in part, as &quot;degrading comments or jokes.&quot; Obviously, this is a world away from the exacting standard announced in <u>Davis</u>. <br /><br />Unfortunately, university harassment policies are the polices most likely to be drawn in such an overbroad way as to curtail substantial amounts of protected speech. Indeed, nearly every case involving a university speech code since 1989 has involved a university harassment policy - and in every case that has produced an opinion, university speech codes have failed to pass constitutional muster. <u>Doe v. Univ. of Mich.</u>, 721 F. Supp. 852 (E.D. Mich. 1989) (enjoining enforcement of university discriminatory harassment policy due to unconstitutionality); <u>Dambrot v. Cent. Mich. Univ.</u>, 839 F. Supp. 477 (E.D. Mich. 1993) (declaring university discriminatory harassment policy facially unconstitutional); <u>The UWM Post, Inc. v. Bd. of Regents of the Univ. of Wis. Sys.</u>, 774 F. Supp. 1163 (E.D. Wis. 1991) (declaring university racial and discriminatory harassment policy facially unconstitutional); <u>Booher v. Board of Regents</u>, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11404 (E.D. Ky. Jul. 21, 1998) (finding university sexual harassment policy void for vagueness and overbreadth); <u>Bair v. Shippensburg University</u>, 280 F. Supp. 2d 357 (M.D. Pa. 2003) (enjoining enforcement of university harassment policy due to overbreadth). <br /><br />And far too often, FIRE has witnessed absurdly overbroad redefinitions of harassment being used to punish unpopular, impolite or unwanted - but protected - speech. In one remarkable recent example, a student-employee at Indiana University - Purdue University Indianapolis was <a href="http://www.thefire.org/index.php/case/760.html">found guilty of &quot;racial harassment&quot;</a> for reading a book at work that celebrated the defeat of the Ku Klux Klan in a 1924 street brawl. Or there&#39;s the case at New Jersey&#39;s William Paterson University, where a Muslim student-employee was <a href="http://www.thefire.org/index.php/article/6552.html">found guilty of sexual harassment</a> for describing homosexuality as a &quot;perversion&quot; in a private e-mail to a professor. Private schools - though not explicitly bound by the First Amendment, but obligated nevertheless by their own extensive promises of freedom of speech in student handbooks and other materials - are just as bad, as evidenced by recent cases at Brandeis (where a professor was <a href="http://www.thefire.org/index.php/case/755.html">found guilty of racial harassment</a> for criticizing the use of the word &quot;wetback&quot; in class) and Tufts (where a student newspaper was <a href="http://www.thefire.org/index.php/case/742.html">found guilty of harassment</a> for publishing an article containing unflattering but true facts about Islam). Unfortunately, FIRE&#39;s <a href="http://www.thefire.org/index.php/case/760.html">case archives</a> are full of cases of equally brazen abuses of university harassment codes, with overzealous college administrators invoking harassment policies to silence protected speech. <br /><br />Temple&#39;s former sexual harassment policy has become the latest in a long line of speech codes to fail in court. Hopefully, with the weight of the Third Circuit behind the ruling, public universities will finally get the message: Harassment policies must be carefully tailored so as to target only that speech which constitutes &quot;true harassment&quot; under binding Supreme Court precedent. <br /><br />Lastly, but perhaps most importantly, yesterday&#39;s opinion reaffirmed the difference between the First Amendment rights of high school and college students. This is a welcome rebuke to Temple&#39;s argument that under the Supreme Court&#39;s ruling in <u>Morse v. Frederick</u>, 127 S. Ct. 2618 (2007) (holding that &quot;schools may take steps to safeguard those entrusted to their care from speech that can reasonably be regarded as encouraging illegal drug use&quot;) the university&#39;s sexual harassment policy was a legitimate restriction on the rights of college students. While Temple contended in their brief that Morse gave the university the power to restrict any &quot;student&#39;s speech that is inconsistent with its &#39;basic educational mission,&#39;&quot; the Third Circuit explicitly acknowledged that &quot;there is a difference between the extent that a school may regulate student speech in a public university setting as opposed to that of a public elementary or high school.&quot; Indeed, the Third Circuit concluded that &quot;[d]iscussion by adult students in a college classroom should not be restricted.&quot; <br /><br />This is a crucial distinction. As FIRE argued in the <em><a href="http://www.thefire.org/pdfs/3cba9b5d84e4fd5c96cd402873f8a6f7.pdf">amici brief</a></em> [PDF] we filed jointly with the <a href="http://www.aclupa.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania</a> and the <a href="http://www.splc.org/">Student Press Law Center</a>, among others, conflating the rights of college students with high school students fundamentally confuses the unique pedagogical necessities of education at the high school and college levels. The Supreme Court has recognized the different missions of each level of schooling. High school students must learn &quot;the habits and manners of civility&quot; to prepare for citizenship. <u>Bethel Sch. Dist. v. Fraser</u>, 487 U.S. 675, 681 (1986). But college students and teachers &quot;must always remain free to inquire, to study and to evaluate, to gain new maturity and understanding; otherwise our civilization will stagnate and die.&quot; <u>Sweezy v. New Hampshire</u>, 354 U.S. 234, 250 (1957). Further, the vast majority of college students are adults, almost uniformly old enough to vote for our nation&#39;s leaders and serve our country in war. As such, they are entitled to the full protection of the First Amendment. Thankfully, the Third Circuit&#39;s clarity on this point should go a long way towards ending the <a href="http://www.thefire.org/index.php/article/8201.html?PHPSESSID=">disturbing trend</a>, seen most notably in the Seventh and Ninth Circuits (<u>Hosty v. Carter</u>, 412 F.3d 731, 740 (7th Cir. 2005); <u>Flint v. Dennison</u>, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 12628 (9th Cir. 2007)), to blur the rights of college students with those of high schoolers.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.usip.org/specialists/bios/archives/martin.html"><strong>G. Eugene Martin</strong></a> [former Executive Director, <a href="http://www.usip.org/philippines/index.html">Philippine Facilitation Project</a>, <a href="http://www.usip.org/index.html">United States Institute of Peace</a>]: &quot;I am encouraged by recent news of an <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/philippines-resolves-regional-autonomy.php">agreement</a> between the government of the Philippines and Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) negotiators but am somewhat skeptical that the underlying causes of the conflict have been fully addressed.  The gap between the Philippine government and the Moro minority is extensive as each approaches the issue of sovereignty and self-determination from opposite perspectives.  The Moros believe their historically independent and sovereign sultanates have been forceably and illegally incorporated into the Philippine nation (during the US colonial period) without their consent.  The government takes the position that inclusion of Moro lands in the territories Spain sold to the US in the Treaty of Paris in 1898, despite a lack of Spanish control, and the US disregard of Moro appeals to be excluded from the Philippine Commonwealth and independent nation gives the government sovereignty over the entire archipelago.  Ergo, the Moros believe their right to self-determination if not independence predates Philippine national sovereignty and cannot be limited by the national constitution.  The government holds that any grant of self-determination or autonomy has to be determined according to the constitution and national legislation.  The legislature is dominated by the 95% non-Moro population of the country and is not sympathetic to Moro demands.<br /><br />The MILF has agreed to compromise earlier Moro demands for independence (a la Timor Leste) and settle for self-determination under which they can govern themselves through their traditional and culturally formulated institutions and processes.  Previous agreements to grant Moros greater local autonomy have failed during implementation as the central government - executive,  legislative and judicial - have enervated the political substance of the agreements.  The small Moro minority has little political clout nationally and the elites maintain political and economic dominance over affairs in the majority Moro areas of Mindanao.  A century of internal migration from northern islands into Mindanao has demographically minoritized and politically and economically marginalized the Moros in their ancestral lands.  Government insistence that any grant of regional self-determination has to be approved by a majority of the local population consistently results in the Moro minority losing to the non-Moro majority.<br /><br />My optimism regarding news of a new agreement is constrained by the lack of public information on the details of the agreement.  Interested parties, both Moro and non-Moro, have little if any knowledge of how the so-called break through was reached and what compromises were made.  Opponents of any Moro autonomy or self-rule have already broadcast exaggerated reports of land confiscations, political upheavals, and cultural and religious discrimination against non-Moro residents in Mindanao.  Lacking reliable public information on the agreement, Moros and supporters of a peace process have little to use to counter rumors and unsubstantiated charges.  If the agreement is signed in August it will be publicized and can be studied, discussed and debated nationally.  Regrettably, experience suggests the majority population little understands or cares about the Moro situation and is easily swayed by biased, Manila-based media which represents elite interests and and promotes sensational rather than informative and educational stories.<br /><br />President Macapagal Arroyo&#39;s term of office ends in June 2010, leaving little time to change public perceptions and begin implementing an agreement in the face of political opposition which is likely to be fierce.  Numerous interest groups -- non-Moro land owners of traditional Moro lands, commercial and transport interests, non-Moro and co-opted Moro politicians in fear of losing their offices and privileges, and military groups used to policy influence based upon security considerations --  will seek to preserve their perquisites by subverting implementation.  Any hope of implementation will require a detailed roadmap with milestones, awards for compliance, penalties for obstructions, and strong, long term central government and Moro commitment to its successful conclusion.  The immediate legal challenge to the prospective agreement and the <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/philippines-high-court-blocks-signing.php">Supreme Court&#39;s hold</a> on its August 5th signing is indicative of the likely strong reaction by opponents of a settlement with the Moros.  Such a reaction is not unexpected given the unwillingness of the government and the MILF to include all stakeholders in the peace process.  Since details of the announced agreement are unknown, people&#39;s worst fears prompt legal recourse.  The parties should initiate prompt and extensive consultations throughout the nation. International engagement - to monitor and supervise the process, provide economic, political, legal and developmental assistance, and use diplomatic and political leverage - will be needed to help both parties keep on track.<br /><br />One further issue.  While the term &quot;Moro&quot; is used to denote the Islamic minority in the southern Philippines, it covers 12 ethno-linguistic groups which do not necessarily have the same agendas or perspectives.  Intra-Moro factions, disagreements, conflicts and rivalries have had nearly as much to do with continued conflict as government or majority population policies.  Unless the disparate Moro groupings can be united or agree upon a common agenda and policy, political stability and economic progress is unlikely.  The majority population&#39;s continuing ability to divide and co-opt Moro communities and leaders has enhanced its ability to weaken Moro resistance and successes.<br /><br />It is difficult to succinctly summarize an extremely complex historical situation.  One can hope the recent news of an agreement will begin the process of resolving the conflict, but it is too soon to say if this is but another in a long list of false rumors and starts.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Paul Graham</strong> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.idasa.org.za/index.asp">IDASA</a>]: &quot;In September 2006, the <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/south-africa-court-delays-ruling-on.php">case against Mr. Zuma</a> was struck from the court roll for technical reasons related to delays required by the <a href="http://www.npa.gov.za/">National Prosecuting Authority</a> (NPA). The NPA intimated that they would indeed be continuing with the case and the charges that Mr. Zuma faces are more extensive than the original two corruption charges. In summary these are one count of money-laundering, twelve of fraud and the overall charge of racketeering.<br /><br />Mr. Zuma is at present making use of all possible legal avenues to have the case against him dismissed. There is presently a judgement pending on his claim that the NPA should have provided him with a hearing at the point of re-establishing the charge sheet. Judgement is reserved until September 12, 2008. A further application for dismissal is pending.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.anc.org.za/">African National Congress</a>, with its substantial majority in the national government is not facing an electoral challenge in 2009 at the general election. It has determined that its President will be its candidate for the position of State President, and Mr. Zuma is therefore the all but assured successor to Mr. Thabo Mbeki whose term of office expires.<br /><br />Even if the case against Mr. Zuma goes ahead, it will not be concluded before the forthcoming election. In the meantime, the imminent election of Mr. Zuma has resulted in discussions inside South Africa about amnesties from prosecutions related to the &quot;arms deal&quot; from which his charges emerge and which are now quite widely believed to have made others equally assailable to charges of corruption. Alternatively, plea bargains are being suggested, but as such a procedure would require Mr. Zuma to enter a guilty plea, such short circuit approaches with negotiated sentencing seem unlikely.<br /><br />The political volatility which results from the slow moving judicial process and the accusations against the judiciary from the more intemperate of the Zuma supporters are a very severe test of South Africa&#39;s democratic constitution, institutions and citizens. Most commentators believe that the country will pass this test, but, given that South Africa does not use them, one might say the jury is still out.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Kevin Scott</strong> [Founder and Director, <a href="http://www.civilliberty.org.uk/">Civil Liberty</a>]: &quot;The balance that needs to be struck on the <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/uk-legislation-allowing-anonymous.php">use of testimony from anonymous witnesses</a> at criminal trials is between the protection of witnesses and the need for a fair trial. In the UK, over half of all murder trials, particularly those involving organised crime or ethnic minority gang killings, have seen anonymous witnesses used to secure convictions.<br /><br />Ultimately, there is a tension involved in allowing a defendant to know the identity of their accusers and protecting witnesses from dangerous criminals who would otherwise escape justice without the use of anonymous testimony. Anonymous testimony is an imperfect way of ensuring justice is done.<br /><br />If done correctly, it will result in the conviction of some of Britain&#39;s most serious criminals. If done incorrectly, it could result in unsafe convictions to the detriment of an already flawed justice system. The process of background checks into anonymous witnesses, currently carried out by the police and prosecuting authorities, needs to be tightened up as a first step.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/about_us/staff/zisser_a.htm"><strong>Aaron Zisser</strong></a> [Human Rights Fellow, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/">Human Rights First</a>]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/us-justice-department-calls-for-hamdan.php">first week of the first trial</a> at Guant&aacute;namo Bay did not seem, at first glance, particularly extraordinary. True, there were some obvious differences between civilian courts and the military commission [Human Rights First <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/detainees/militarytribunals.htm">backgrounder</a>] courtroom hosting the trial of <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/inthecourts/supreme_court_hamdan.htm">Salim Hamdan</a>, accused of serving as a driver, bodyguard and weapons runner for Osama Bin Laden. Military guards stood at the doors, and some of the lawyers and all of the &quot;jury&quot; members wore military uniforms. But these features do not automatically diminish a court&#39;s legitimacy. Human Rights First and other organizations have long recognized these cases could legitimately be tried &#8212; and should be tried &#8212; either in civilian federal courts or in the well-established, and well-respected, regular military court-martial system that operates under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/stApIIch47.html">Uniform Code of Military Justice</a> (UCMJ). <br /><br />It was the familiar features, rather, that somehow stood out more and risked lulling a public far removed from the courtroom into a false sense of vindicating justice. A friendly, sometimes jocular judge wearing a black robe over his military uniform &#8212; U.S. Navy Captain Keith Allred &#8212; deliberated over legal questions, issued written opinions that cite to legal standards, and at times reprimanded government prosecutors for delays. Fancy wooden tables and wood paneling on the walls gave the place a tone of importance and authority. A gallery for observers and media was as sparsely populated as many courtroom galleries in the United States &#8212; for different reasons, of course; in Guant&aacute;namo the sparse attendance is due to the intentional isolation and inaccessibility of the courtroom &#8212; and a sketch artist&#39;s strokes scratched amid a respectful silence. The lawyers even sometimes said, &quot;Objection!&quot;<br /><br />The Chief Defense Counsel for the military commissions, U.S. Army Colonel Steven David (in civilian life a veteran state court trial judge in Indiana), remarked outside the courtroom during this first week of trial that it is true that things appear normal at Guant&aacute;namo &quot;from 20,000 feet.&quot; Once you get closer, he meant to say, the problematic differences between &quot;Guant&aacute;namo justice&quot; and the justice he and other veteran American jurists and lawyers know come into sharper focus. <br /><br />While I appreciated the metaphor and was impressed with Colonel David&#39;s passionate arguments against the military commission system, it is clear that more than swooping down from 20,000 feet is needed to see all the problems in the courtroom overlooking &quot;Camp Justice&quot; &#8212; it takes both a magnifying glass and a time machine. And both reveal a system that lacks legitimacy, transparency, and fairness. Our commitment to these values and to due process and the rule of law, and our need for real justice, are in profound conflict with the artifice I witnessed last week. <br /><br />Ironically &#8212; in light of the fact that Hamdan&#39;s is the first military commission trial the government actually has managed to get underway, after six years of effort &#8212; the regular civilian legal system we have developed over the course of hundreds of years, while imperfect, has nonetheless ably handled well over a hundred international terrorism cases, most within the last fifteen years. This familiar system has worked without compromising either national security or the values that gained their earliest and central expression in core provisions of the Bill of Rights. These values deliver justice to victims while also protecting accused against whim, caprice, and abuse throughout the criminal process. The system in Guant&aacute;namo pays lip service to these concerns, but has nonetheless surreptitiously infected every step of the process with layers of abuse that have resulted in a one-sided contest lacking both legitimacy and credibility.<br /><br />The stage thus was set long before Hamdan ever entered the courtroom. While some key issues languished and bled into the trial itself, most of the questions related to Hamdan&#39;s fundamental rights had already been resolved &#8212; as a matter of policy when the military commissions were devised, or as legal questions addressed by Judge Allred in pretrial proceedings. The <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.info/pdf/080515-USLS-military-commissions-act.pdf">Military Commissions Act (MCA)</a> [pdf] and the <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.info/pdf/080515-USLS-manual-military-commissions.pdf">Rules for Military Commissions</a> [pdf] that followed establish rules of evidence and procedure for these proceedings that deny important protections for the accused and grant the judge extraordinary discretion. The evidence mustered by the government was gathered in a way that denied fundamental rights long considered a given. And the government held close mountains of relevant information sought by the defense months ago, even until the very last minute. The first week of trial betrayed the complex deception underlying the bells and whistles that give the process a superficial gloss of legitimacy. It both manifested the sometimes near-invisible culmination of abuses that took place over the last years and presented the opportunity for fresh human rights violations.<br /><br />First, under the MCA &#8212; which at various turns conflates, distorts and contravenes traditional American criminal law and the laws of war &#8212; coerced testimony is admissible, so long as it is deemed reliable, sufficiently probative and not the result of treatment amounting to torture (or, if elicited after December 30, 2005, treatment amounting to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment). In contrast, coerced statements are never admissible in ordinary U.S. courts &#8212; including regular courts-martial &#8212; not only because they are understood to be inherently unreliable, but also because coercion is so fundamentally contrary to the values of a civilized society. The MCA attempts to dress up coerced evidence by providing a standard ostensibly based on concepts &#8212; &quot;reliable&quot; and &quot;probative&quot; &#8212; that sound positive enough. In Hamdan&#39;s trial, Judge Allred even excluded statements resulting from coercion that occurred during some interrogations in Afghanistan, but admitted videos made of Hamdan&#39;s initial interrogations shortly after his capture. Those videos show him taken into a dark and dank room with a bag on his head, seated on a dirt floor, and surrounded by armed soldiers, having to ask permission even just to adjust his sitting position. The deception here is that the judge admitted these statements without any probing assessment of the nature and effect of the coercion.<br /><br />Second, I watched hours of testimony by a parade of FBI agents saying almost nothing more than characterizations of statements Hamdan made to them without knowledge that his statements would be used against him in a criminal prosecution and without any access to counsel. The FBI agents who investigated Hamdan&#39;s alleged crimes and testified last week had been affirmatively directed by their superiors not to advise him or other Guant&aacute;namo prisoners of any right against self-incrimination &#8212; they were told that their investigation was an &quot;intelligence operation&quot; rather than a criminal investigation &#8212; notwithstanding that they have routinely issued rights warnings in every place (including the locales of some of the most serious terrorist attacks on U.S. targets ever, such as the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen) they have ever investigated international terrorism, except Guant&aacute;namo.<br /><br />While Judge Allred expressed doubts about this argument &#8212; the interrogations at Guant&aacute;namo took place months if not years and thousands of miles from any battlefield where tactical intelligence would be useful and eliciting such information urgent &#8212; he nonetheless admitted evidence elicited during Guant&aacute;namo interrogations that were not preceded by any advisement of rights against self-incrimination. The judge said this was because Hamdan and the other Guant&aacute;namo prisoners have no rights &#8212; not just on a battlefield, but even after they were moved to Guant&aacute;namo &#8212; against self-incrimination: Notwithstanding the recent Supreme Court decision in <u>Boumediene</u> &#8212; which held that Guant&aacute;namo prisoners have the constitutional right to challenge their detention through habeas corpus petitions &#8212; Judge Allred held the Fifth Amendment simply does not apply to these prisoners.<br /><br />Third, the government gave itself the power to choose whether and when to disclose important discovery materials to the defense. Disclosures of hundreds of pages of long-sought documents literally on the eve of trial forced the defense to spend precious time trying to conduct discovery even as they conducted the trial. Defense counsel could have conducted investigations as to Hamdan&#39;s confinement that might have justified the exclusion of evidence tarnished by particularly coercive conditions. But the defense had the time neither to conduct such investigations nor to assemble adequate legal arguments on the basis of a thorough review. Similarly, until the weekend before trial began, the government had kept even Hamdan&#39;s military defense attorney (who has the requisite security clearance) away from Guant&aacute;namo&#39;s high-value detainees (HVDs), such as alleged 9/11 mastermind <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/detainees/cases/sept11_def.htm">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a>. The defense hopes these HVDs will testify that Hamdan was not involved in planning, organizing or executing terrorist activities with which several of the al Qaeda HVDs are charged. The judge&#39;s mild reprimands disguised the severe disadvantage that these delays caused for the defense.<br /><br />Even the last moments before the formal trial began witnessed further conflicts inherent in this invented system. Commission &quot;members&quot; &#8212; the jurors in the military commission trials &#8212; were selected from a pool of thirteen officers handpicked by the government, and only four of the six impaneled members must find guilt in order to convict. In these respects the commissions are no different from a regular court-martial. But the nature of the 9/11 attack &#8212; an attack on the Pentagon &#8212; makes this different. Several members of the officer pool had direct, personal connections to colleagues working in the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, or serving on the Cole in October 2000 &#8212; that is, personal connections to victims of these attacks. The Hamdan defense was forced to use a peremptory challenge to exclude a potential juror who knew both a victim of the attack on the Pentagon and the commander of the Cole at the time it was attacked. Yet it is other officers with such personal connections to these events who will be sitting in judgment of a man accused of supporting the masterminds of these very attacks. <br /><br />Some observers have suggested that Salim Hamdan is a &quot;guinea pig,&quot; allowing the government to try out its military commissions before running the more important defendants through it. But it appears Hamdan is a guinea pig in an experiment in deception, not an experiment in justice. In either case, this experiment &#8212; which we never needed &#8212; is failing.&quot;<br /><br /><em>&quot;Report from Guantanamo&quot; features regular contributions to JURIST Hotline from <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/">Human Rights First</a></em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ombwatch.org/">OMB Watch</a> &quot;Last week, the U.S. Department of Justice asserted in federal court that the <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/fema-seeks-immunity-from-hurricane.php">Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) should be immune from lawsuits </a>filed in response to the massive formaldehyde contamination that has plagued hurricane recovery housing.  FEMA provided this housing to many survivors of Hurricane Katrina.  The U.S. Attorney representing FEMA claimed that the lawsuits amounted to &quot;judicial second-guessing&quot; of the agency&#39;s actions in the wake of the Katrina disaster and that only Congress has the authority to examine FEMA&#39;s record.<br /><br />We believe that legal questions of immunity are best left to the courts.  However, we also believe there is another issue lurking in the background.  Time and time again, the Bush administration has used national emergencies and tragedies to evade the rule of law and avoid responsibility for its actions.  The administration did this after the 9/11 terrorist attacks when it misinformed Americans on air quality near Ground Zero and on the dangers posed by asbestos contamination following the collapse of the World Trade Center.  It did it again when it suspended the <a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/construction/cqit/dbacon.cfm">Davis-Bacon</a> prevailing wage law in the wake of hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma.  Its actions were repeated with respect to the National Security Agency&#39;s illegal warrantless wiretapping program.  Now, the administration is trying to get away with providing shoddy emergency housing to victims of one of the most devastating natural disasters in our nation&#39;s history.  The one common thread connecting these actions is that the agencies that the Bush White House oversees continually scoff at any attempt to hold them accountable for their missteps, their blunders, and their outright malfeasance.<br /><br />When Congress starts investigating any executive branch debacle, the administration often claims it doesn&#39;t have to comply with subpoenas or send the responsible officials to testify at committee hearings.  When agency representatives do appear before Congress, they repeatedly claim that they don&#39;t recall important details, that they had no idea that a problem was as severe as it actually is, or that they were acting within the bounds of their authority when, in reality, they were clearly violating the law or the Constitution.  When American citizens attempt to achieve justice in court, the reaction is equally as predictable &#8212; you can&#39;t sue us, we&#39;re not accountable to you!  <br /><br />It is clear that FEMA must be held accountable for exposing hurricane survivors to high levels of a cancer-causing toxin.  The question is, if Congress can&#39;t hold the executive branch to account, and if the American people can&#39;t pursue justice in court, just who can ensure that federal agencies will take responsibility for their actions?&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Frank Kendall</span> [volunteer consultant, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/index.html">Human Rights First</a>]: &quot;From July 14 to July 18, I attended several <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/federal-judge-refuses-to-delay-hamdan.php">pre-trial motions hearings in Guant&aacute;namo Bay</a>, Cuba, for <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/inthecourts/supreme_court_hamdan.htm">Salim Hamdan</a> [HRF backgrounder], who is now in his second week of trial before a Military Commission there. I feel fortunate to have had this opportunity because these hearings were, in my mind, of at least as much significance as the trial itself.  Although Hamdan wasn&#39;t yet on trial during the motions hearings I saw, our Constitution was, and it didn&#39;t fare very well.<br /><br />The recent <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/07pdf/06-1195.pdf">Boumediene</a> [pdf] decision by the Supreme Court determined that Hamdan and other Guant&aacute;namo prisoners do have the right under the Constitution to bring a habeas corpus petition in federal court challenging the legality of their detention, but the <u>Boumediene</u> court left open the question of what other rights they might have under the Constitution.  This prompted a flurry of motions by the Hamdan defense that included constitutional claims to: <ul><li> Equal protection of the law &#8212; the Military Commission Act (MCA) applies only to aliens; <br /><li>Speedy trial &#8212; Hamdan has been held without trial since 2001;  <br /><li>Trial by jury &#8212; the Commission members are military officers, and can convict by a mere two-thirds vote; and<br /><li>Protection against:<ul> <ul> <li> Ex post facto prosecution &#8212; conspiracy and material support were never considered &quot;war crimes&quot; before passage the MCA in 2006;<br /><li>The prosecution&#39;s introduction of hearsay evidence that deprives Hamdan of his right to confront his accusers &#8212; most of the government&#39;s evidence is hearsay;<br /><li>Coercion &#8212; Hamdan asserts that he experienced abusive and coercive treatment from the time he was taken into custody in 2001; and<br /><li>Self-incrimination &#8212; in addition to the alleged coercion, Hamdan was never advised of any right to remain silent or that his statements could be used against him at trial.</ul> </ul> </ul> If these motions had been substantially successful Hamdan&#39;s trial would either not be occurring, or much of the government&#39;s evidence would have been suppressed.  The trial, of course, is proceeding.<br /><br />Some friends have asked me if Hamdan is &quot;guilty,&quot; or &quot;a bad guy.&quot;  Their assumption seems to be that if he is either of these things that no real injustice will be done, even if the process by which he is being tried is flawed.  This is a dangerous perspective.  I believe that there are much larger issues at stake here, issues that ultimately, when all appeals are exhausted, can create legal precedents that could haunt us for many years to come.  In any event, Hamdan&#39;s military judge found his way around almost all the constitution claims so that Hamdan&#39;s trial could proceed.  Let us consider how that was accomplished.<br /><br />Navy Captain Keith Allred, Hamdan&#39;s judge, concluded that two of the claims &#8212; <span style="font-style:italic;">ex post facto</span> and speedy trial &#8212; simply lack validity, even if the relevant protections of the Constitution apply to Guant&aacute;namo detainees.  In regard to <span style="font-style:italic;">ex post facto</span>, the military judge deferred to Congress&#39; conclusion that conspiracy and material support to terrorism were already criminal acts before the MCA, either as war crimes under international &quot;common law&quot; or under domestic law in some form, so that the conduct with which Mr. Hamdan was being charged was merely codified anew under the MCA, and therefore not an Ex Post Facto Clause violation.  As to speedy trial, the judge found it unnecessary to reach the constitutional question, as Hamdan&#39;s right to a speedy trial had not been denied:  Hamdan was being held as an enemy combatant along with other enemy combatants and not solely in contemplation of criminal trial, so none of those years of detention count in a speedy trial calculation.<br /><br />On two other motions, equal protection and trial by jury, the military judge crafted a set of &quot;factors&quot; to evaluate and weigh, based on his interpretation of <u>Boumediene</u>.  Those factors were:  (1) the citizenship and status of the detainee and the adequacy of the process by which that status was determined (alien unlawful combatant finding by a Combatant Status Review Tribunal [HRF <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/detainees/status_review_080204.htm">backgrounder</a>] or military judge); (2) the site of apprehension and detention (Afghanistan); (3) practical considerations and exigent circumstances (the desire to deter people from becoming unlawful combatants); (4) the adequacy of any alternative right provided (trial by Military Commission); (5) the necessity of applying the constitutional protection at issue to prevent injustice (the Military Commission process is adequate); and (6) whether application of the constitutional protection would be impractical or anomalous (extending more rights to alien unlawful enemy combatants would be anomalous because they don&#39;t merit protection).<br /><br />Judge Allred&#39;s rulings on these issues will certainly not be the final word.  Appeals to the Military Commission Court of Review (a special military appellate court established under the MCA) and to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals &#8212; and perhaps to the Supreme Court &#8212; will surely follow.   But let us assume that the military judge&#39;s rulings endure.  I find this prospect very troubling, particularly the decisions invoking a multiple-factor, subjective test of the applicability of constitutional rights.<br /><br />What Judge Allred has ruled is that an individual&#39;s legal protections are determined subjectively, based on the circumstances.  The single most important factor in the judge&#39;s set of factors seems to be the first one &#8212; the citizenship and status of the detainee.  Here, the judge found that the detainee was an alien and an unlawful enemy combatant and that this weighed against providing him with constitutional protections.   (The other factors were all found to weigh against the application of the Constitution, but this one dominated.)  Factor six even returns to the status finding and concludes it would be &quot;anomalous&quot; to extend more protections to people who have already been found to be unlawful enemy combatants.  <br /><br />What we have then, is a system whereby the executive determines that some people fall into a class of &quot;bad actors.&quot;   In this case the military judge &#8212; a judge also belonging to the executive branch &#8212; subsequently concurred in that determination.  Once this is done, the &quot;bad actors&quot; may then be denied constitutional protections, particularly if they are detained in a remote place like Guant&aacute;namo (also under the control of the executive).  This is circular reasoning at best.  One has to ask whether such a system would be regarded as fair and acceptable if applied to American citizens detained by a foreign power, or perhaps someone who speaks out against Chinese oppression in Tibet, or someone who advocates more freedom for women in Saudi Arabia.  I think not.<br /><br />I believe we need to step back from the question of what these defendants have done and how they should properly be tried (and, where appropriate, punished), and consider how the fundamental protections of the Constitution should or should not be extended to persons detained under U.S. government control.  Should we be applying largely subjective, multi-factor tests based on a variety of circumstances to each defendant or class of defendants?  Or, should we apply a well-thought-out, proven legal basis for dealing with detainees suspected of criminal acts related to terrorism that is consistent with our values and the Constitution? <br /> <br />To me the answer is obvious.  Our constitutional protections are not uniquely American, they reflect human rights norms that should be applied everywhere and, as it says in the Fifth Amendment, to all &quot;people.&quot;  They should not be denied to some people because they have been found to be members of a class of &quot;bad&quot; people who don&#39;t merit protection.  This is a very dangerous road for us to walk down.&quot;<br /><br /><em>&quot;Report from Guantanamo&quot; features regular contributions to JURIST Hotline from <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org">Human Rights First</a></em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/Bio-PicRCD2.pdf"><strong>Richard C. Dieter</strong></a> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org">Death Penalty Information Center</a>]: &quot;There is no question that treaties that have been signed and ratifed by the U.S. government are the &quot;law of the land&quot; and can be binding on states with the same force as federal law.  The U.S. is bound by the <a href="http://fletcher.tufts.edu/multi/texts/BH444.txt">Vienna Convention on Consular Relations</a> and by the decision of the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/">International Court of Justice</a> regarding our failure to abide by that treaty.  The U.S. Supreme Court in <u>Medellin</u> held that the protocol to the Vienna Convention empowering the ICJ was not a &quot;self-executing&quot; treaty and hence required an act of Congress and the President&#39;s signature to hold Texas to this ruling.  It is not true, as some in <a href=" http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2008/07/texas-governor-state-not-bound-by-icj.php">Texas have maintained</a>, that the state does not have to abide by international treaties or ICJ rulings.  If Congress had taken the necessary steps and spelled out the implications of this treaty, which Congress still could do, then the treaty would compel Texas to take action.<br /><br />In the absence of Congressional action, the decision for Texas is whether to assist our country in honoring its treaty obligations or to pass up this opportunity for the sake of having a swifter execution.  U.S. citizens constantly take advantage of the Vienna Convention when they are traveling abroad.  We trust other countries to let our citizens know that they can contact the U.S. consulate should they get accused of a crime.  If that trust is not reciprocated here, it could put our citizens in a dangerous position.<br /><br />A terrible crime was committed in Texas and the state has the right to seek justice and to impose punishment.  The burden on Texas, if it should choose to help the U.S. meet its international obligations, is relatively slight: a review of the relevant cases in light of the fact that the defendants were not afforded their rights under the Vienna Convention.  This need not take excessive time or resources, and it would go a long way to strengthening our standing in the international community.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://commstudies.utexas.edu/clubs/UTNIF-IE/staff/index.htm"><strong>Bryan McCann</strong></a> [<a href="http://www.nodeathpenalty.org/">Campaign to End the Death Penalty</a>, Austin, TX Chapter]: &quot;Two years ago, a fellow anti-death penalty activist and I participated in a <a href="http://video.yahoo.com/watch/270991/1911341">public debate on the University of Texas campus</a> with the Young Conservatives of Texas (YCT).  No one was surprised when the YCT&#39;s first plan of attack was to read - verbatim - a detailed account of the particularly gruesome <a href="http://www.murdervictims.com/Voices/jeneliz.html">gang rape and murder of Jennifer Ertman and Elizabeth Pena</a>.  Their strategy represents an all too familiar method of arguing in favor of the death penalty.  Who would have the audacity to argue race, class, or international law when confronted with the ghastly killings of two beautiful teenage girls?  Where there is mourning and outrage, there is often little room for analysis.<br /><br />The death of those two girls in 1993 was no doubt a traumatic affair for their families and Houston community.  But much like the YCT used the tragedy that befell Jennifer Ertman and Elizabeth Pena at our public debate to ignore fundamental structural problems with the death penalty, Texas Governor Rick Perry is using it, coupled with his usual brand of Lone Star ethos, to ignore international law.  As courageous groups like <a href="http://www.willsworld.com/~mvfhr/">Murder Victims&#39; Families for Human Rights</a> have long attested, such manipulation does little to ease the pain of devastated families.<br /><br />If <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/texas-governor-state-not-bound-by-icj.php">Texas gets its way</a>, <a href="http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/statistics/deathrow/drowlist/medellin.jpg">Joe Medellin</a> will be the second of the five men sentenced to death for the Ertman and Pena murders to be executed.  However, his pending execution date of August 5 has become a topic of considerable international controversy.  Though <a href="http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/statistics/deathrow/drowlist/o'brien.jpg">Derrick O&#39;Brien</a>, who was executed in 2006 for the crimes, was a native of Texas, Joe Medellin is a Mexican national.  He was denied access to a Mexican consulate for legal assistance during his original trial.  This flagrant affront to international law enshrined in the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations prompted the International Court of Justice to issue a 2004 order to stay Medellin&#39;s execution.  This prompted none other than President Bush to issue a memorandum ordering Texas to halt the executions and review the convictions of the Mexican nationals, including Medellin, mentioned in the ICJ order.  When George W. Bush, former Governor of Texas, is issuing orders to <em>honor international law and halt executions</em>, the stakes are clearly very high.<br /><br />Yet, in March, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Bush had overstepped his boundaries and Texas may proceed with the execution of Medellin and other inmates forced to navigate Texas criminal law without consular advice.  In response to a more recent order by the ICJ, Perry&#39;s office responded with its typical frontier zeal:<br /><br /><blockquote>The world court [ICJ] has no standing in Texas and Texas is not bound by a ruling or edict from a foreign court. It is easy to get caught up in discussions of international law and justice and treaties. It&#39;s very important to remember that these individuals are on death row for killing our citizens.</blockquote><br />This is familiar language from Perry&#39;s office.  When the <a href="http://www.nieuwsbank.nl/en/2007/08/21/f041.htm">European Union issued a declaration</a> on the eve of Texas&#39; 400th execution since 1982, encouraging the state to place a moratorium on executions, the <a href="http://www.governor.state.tx.us/divisions/press/pressreleases/PressRelease.2007-08-21.0521">Office of the Governor replied</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote>230 years ago, our forefathers fought a war to throw off the yoke of a European monarch and gain the freedom of self-determination. Texans long ago decided that the death penalty is a just and appropriate punishment for the most horrible crimes committed against our citizens. While we respect our friends in Europe, welcome their investment in our state and appreciate their interest in our laws, Texans are doing just fine governing Texas.</blockquote><br />&quot;<em>These</em> individuals are on death row for killing <em>our</em> citizens.&quot;  &quot;<em>Texans</em> are doing just fine governing <em>Texas</em>.&quot;  It seems the Lone Star State&#39;s busy death row is nothing less than an homage to the spirit of American and Texas independence, international law be damned.  Such populist appeals resonate all too well with what I believe to be one of the finest articulations of how capital punishment operates in American society.  Legal scholar <a href="http://www.amherst.edu/~adsarat/">Austin Sarat</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/When-State-Kills-Punishment-Condition/dp/0691102619/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1216925719&sr=1-1">writes</a>, &quot;State killing is part of a strategy of governance that makes us fearful and dependent on the illusion of state protection, that divides rather than unites, that promises simple solutions to complex problems.&quot;  <br /><br />The death penalty in Texas and elsewhere requires simplicity.  There is no need to get &quot;caught up in discussions of international law and justice and treaties&quot; when we can view the poisoning of convicted criminals as a testament to our rugged collective identity.  As we quickly learned at our public debate two years ago, the death penalty cannot withstand the slightest amount of complexity.  The closer one looks, the more unsightly this depraved institution becomes.  Whether it be <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/editorial/outlook/5900000.html">the risk of making Americans abroad more vulnerable to prosecution</a> because of their government&#39;s disdain for international law or the <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/getcat.php?cid=3">well documented socio-economic disparities</a> that permeate the nation&#39;s death rows, the complexities of capital punishment are ultimately its undoing.  Thus, Rick Perry&#39;s usual brand of gunslinger politics &#8212; all too similar to that of his predecessor &#8212; is about much more than his own Texan roots.  It is the lifeblood of a cruel and ineffective state sanction that allows him to convince ordinary Texans that he is on our side.  <a href="http://www.investintexasschools.org/progress/statistics.php">When Texas ranks 37th in spending on public education</a>, it is little surprise that Perry and his colleagues cling so dearly to this irreparably broken strategy of governance.&quot;<br />

		<title>DC Circuit finds fatal flaws in EPA unfair emissions regulations</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Jeff McNelly</strong> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.arippa.org/">ARIPPA</a>]: &quot;For several years ARIPPA has been involved in an effort to educate EPA and Congressional leaders that the proposed CAIR regulations were flawed and unfair to our industry. This effort has involved hundreds of thousands of volunteer hours as well as professional staff and counsel guidance. Our positions were supported by the PA Department of Environmental Protection and the Governor of Pennsylvania. Unfortunately our efforts to cure this unfair situation with the regulatory source (EPA) and the legislative body that drafted the original law/language were unsuccessful and our only recourse to find help and fairness was through the time consuming and legal/judicial system. We are gratified that an unbiased body finally recognized the &quot;fatal flaws&quot; involved in both the drafting of this proposed regulation and the intent behind such activity.<br /> <br />Indeed the DC Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/federal-appeals-court-rejects-clean-air.php">issued its opinion</a> in the CAIR litigation at the end of last week. Among other arguments raised by petitioners challenging the regulation, the Court agreed with us (and other petitioners challenging the SO2 portion of the rule) that EPA had no legal authority to use the Title IV acid rain program to implement CAIR. Because the Court agreed with the first argument that we raised in our briefing papers (i.e., that EPA had no legal authority to rely on Title IV at all), it did not need to get to our secondary argument, which we also addressed in oral argument (i.e., if EPA did have authority to use the Acid Rain program to implement CAIR, it must preserve the exemptions inherent in the acid rain program).<br /> <br />Interestingly, the Court did not agree with all of the challenges raised by the different petitioners. Nonetheless, because EPA had consistently characterized the CAIR regulation as a complex, integrated program, the Court concluded that the entire regulation must be vacated because some petitioners (including us) had correctly raised &quot;fatal flaws&quot; in portions of the regulation. EPA now must effectively start over in developing a CAIR-equivalent regulation. It is possible that Congress will act before EPA does, since several bills are under consideration that would address the vacated CAMR requirements, the vacated CAIR requirements and greenhouse gases from electric generating units.<br /> <br />Procedurally, EPA has the right to seek reconsideration by the Court, seek reconsideration by the entire panel of judges within the DC Circuit Court, or appeal to the United States Supreme Court. Given the implications of the rule, it is certainly possible that EPA may seek reconsideration of the ruling. If so, we will file responsive pleadings and need to participate in the process.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Nadav Greenberg</strong> [<a href="http://www.yesh-din.org/site/index.php?page=index&lang=en">Yesh Din</a>]: &quot;<a href="/paperchase/2008/07/israel-police-unresponsive-to-violence.php">Yesh Din&#39;s latest fact sheet </a> [<a href="http://www.yesh-din.org/sys/images/File/LESVDataSheetJuly2008Eng%5B1%5D.pdf">pdf</a>] indicates a disturbing trend. Our findings show that a mere one out of ten cases of settler crimes against Palestinians results in an indictment. This is a troubling reminder of the continuing lack of attention Israel&#39;s law enforcement agencies devote to bringing settlers to justice. Because these numbers are very similar to our previous report on law enforcement from 2006, this publication shows that over the past two years very little has been done to strengthen the arm of the law in the Occupied Territories (OT). <br /><br />The ongoing laxity in bringing settlers to justice is not only a violation of Israel&#39;s legal and moral obligations towards the residents of areas under its control, but also a substantial threat to the rule of law in the OT. Lately there has been an alarming trend of settlers committing violent crimes not only against Palestinians, but also against Israeli police and military forces in the West Bank. There is no question that this is a natural product of an environment where legal authority is either weak or absent altogether. The current situation is one in which settlers are protected by the military and police forces in the West Bank, and as a result they are confident that they can do as they please without suffering any legal consequences. A state that is willing to forgo the supremacy of its rule of law and allow its citizens to blatantly disregard the authority of its law enforcement agencies, for whatever reason, is playing with fire. <br /><br />If this deterioration in the standing of law enforcement in the OT is to be reversed, a complete change of approach is needed throughout Israel&#39;s law enforcement apparatus. An institutional reordering of priorities in the police and State Prosecutor&#39;s Office, increased manpower (especially Arabic-speaking investigators), more timely responses, and a sustained effort to investigate cases thoroughly and exhaustively are all necessary steps on the way to restoring the rule of law in the OT. If Israel fails to take substantial action in this regard, not only will it be allowing criminals to go unpunished, but it will also be encouraging the development of a state of lawlessness under its watch.&quot;<br />

		<title>FISA amendments hamstring ICDAA&#039;s efforts to represent overseas clients</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.lawahl.com/DanielArshack.html"><strong>Daniel N. Arshack</strong></a> [Vice President, <a href="http://www.aiad-icdaa.org/">International Criminal Defense Attorney&#39;s Association</a>]: &quot;The FISA Amendments Act <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/aclu-files-lawsuit-challenging-new.php">passed by the House</a> (H.R. 6304) allows the <span style="font-style:italic;">mass acquisition</span> of U.S. citizens&#39; and residents&#39; international communications. Although the Act prohibits the government from intentionally &quot;targeting&quot; people inside the U.S., it places virtually <span style="font-style:italic;">no restrictions</span> on the government&#39;s targeting of people outside the U.S., even if those targets are communicating with U.S. citizens and residents. The law&#39;s effect - and indeed, the law&#39;s <span style="font-style:italic;">main purpose</span> - is to give the government nearly unfettered access to Americans&#39; international communications:<br /><br />1.  The law gives the government sweeping surveillance power without requiring it to identify the targets of its surveillance.<br /><br />2. The law allows the government to intercept U.S. citizens&#39; and residents&#39; international telephone and email communications without having to identify the facilities, phone lines, email addresses, or locations to be monitored. The law allows the government to conduct intrusive surveillance without meaningful judicial oversight.<br /><br />3. The law places no meaningful limits on the government&#39;s retention and dissemination of information relating to U.S. citizens and residents.<br />   <br />4. The law does not limit government surveillance to communications relating to terrorism.<br />   <br />5. The law gives the government access to some communications that are purely domestic. The law immunizes the telecoms that participated in the Bush administration&#39;s warrantless wiretapping program.<br /><br />The law suit, in which the International Criminal Defense Attorney&#39;s Association is one of several plaintiffs, is a challenge to the constitutionality of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, 50 U.S.C. &Acirc;&sect; 1801 et seq. (&quot;FISA&quot;), as amended by the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&docid=f:h6304enr.txt.pdf">FISA Amendments Act of 2008</a>.  As amended, FISA allows the executive branch sweeping and virtually unregulated authority to monitor the international communications -  and in some cases the purely domestic communications - of law-abiding U.S. citizens and residents.  The amended law (the &quot;challenged law&quot;) eviscerates the &quot;[c]lear legal standards and effective oversight and controls&quot; that the Senate Church Committee concluded in 1978 were necessary to ensure that government surveillance did &quot;not itself undermine the democratic system it [was] intended to protect.&quot;<br /><br />The International Criminal Defence Attorneys Association (&quot;ICDAA&quot;) is a non-profit organization incorporated in the United States and Canada that seeks to create the foundations for a full, fair, and well-organized defense in proceedings before international tribunals such as the <a href="http://69.94.11.53/">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda </a>based in Arusha, Tanzania, the <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> and the recently established <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/home.html&l=en">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC), both based in The Hague, the Netherlands.  The ICDAA works to organize a full, thorough and structured defense with the aim of bolstering the legitimacy of the judicial process established by the international community to prosecute war crimes and crimes against humanity; bring together in a professional association the defense attorneys who are responsible for preparing and pleading cases to be tried by various international tribunals; share with the international community experience and knowledge derived from the adversarial system of justice; encourage communication among lawyers specializing in criminal law from countries around the world; and assist in the development of international criminal law and in particular of international institutions such as the ICC. ICDAA membership is comprised of organizations and criminal defense lawyers from around the world, including from the United States. <br /><br />ICDAA&#39;s members, including its members inside the United States, routinely engage in sensitive and privileged international communications relating to their representation of criminal defendants. For example, members of the ICDAA who represent individuals before the ICC communicate with clients and witnesses located in the Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. ICDAA&#39;s members&#39; communications with clients, clients&#39; families, witnesses, journalists, human rights organizations, experts, investigators, and foreign government officials, are vital to their effective representation of their clients. <br /><br />Because of the content of its members&#39; communications, the identity of those with whom they communicate, and the geographic location of individuals with whom they communicate, ICDAA reasonably believes that its members&#39; communications have been and will continue to be monitored under the challenged law.<br /><br />ICDAA&#39;s members have an ethical obligation to protect the confidentiality of their clients&#39; information, including information covered by the attorney-client privilege.  However, the challenged law makes it nearly impossible to ensure that their international email and telephone communications are secure.  The law requires the attorneys to take burdensome and costly steps to gather information necessary for the effective representation of their clients in a manner that ensures those communications remain confidential.  In some cases, attorneys will have to gather information in person that they would otherwise have been able to gather by telephone or email.  In email and telephone communications, attorneys will be forced to weigh the utility of asking for additional information against the risk that the communication will be acquired by the U.S. government.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Farzana Hassan</span> [President, <a href="http://www.muslimcanadiancongress.org/">Muslim Canadian Congress</a>]: &quot;The statistics are alarming. Eight women and one man have been sentenced to death over an adultery conviction in none other than, Ayatollah, mullah-ridden Iran.  As if criminalizing adultery in the absence of a similar ruling on rape isn&#39;t enough of a mockery of justice. Iranian activists and lawyers are rightly outraged that the convictions and sentencing came after the defendants failed to provide adequate defense due to lack of financial resources.  But this is hardly the only flaw in the legal system.<br /> <br />The injustice is painfully obvious to lawyers and human rights activists all across the world: When a man fancies other women, he enjoys the religious stamp of contracting polygamous unions, sometimes even temporary ones to satisfy his lustful urges.  Women, however, are barred from such practices and immediately tried for adultery if caught in the act; or if their husbands as much as suspect them of &quot;lewd&quot; behavior.<br /> <br />As Iran follows a strict and literalistic interpretation of the Islamic sharia, stoning to death after proof of adultery is usually the stipulated prescription to be implemented soon after sentencing.<br /> <br />And while such policies continue to draw the ire of international human rights agencies [Amnesty International <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/MDE14/014/2007">report</a>], Iranian officials insist on enforcing such sentences, be it by stoning, hanging or lashing, as  punitive measures to check the incidence of adultery in an Islamic society. On Sunday past, <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/iran-executions-increasing-in-number.php">they hanged 29 other people</a> for alleged moral infractions in the capital city of Tehran<br /> <br />Despite inherent injustices in the system towards women in particular, the provincial governments in Iran refuse to relent in such cases due to their archaic and incorrect understanding of religious precept for which no basis exists  in the Quran.  The punishment is based solely on the compendium of prophetic traditions known as Hadith, which modernist and reformist Muslims regard as a spurious source of Islamic law.  Orthodox circles on the other hand, continue to tout these as authentic and indispensable to understanding Quranic inunctions.<br /> <br />The injustice of stoning in Iran is rampant, undeniable and unacceptable.  It is about time the Iranian government, both federal and provincial, recognized it as such.  And while it is crucial for Muslim men and women to openly denounce such draconian laws, it is equally important for Western feminist and liberal organizations to step up their efforts in fighting such systemic legal, cultural and social inequalities.  Such laws affect not only women, but underprivileged men lack the wealth of their rich peers who often dodge the law through bribes and cash endowments.<br /> <br />The prophet Mohammad exhorted Muslims towards an equal dispensation of the law, whether it applied to the rich or poor.  He further stated that no community could thrive and prosper unless this principle was upheld to the letter.<br /> <br />The Ayatollahs of Iran have forgotten the inspiration and moral decency of these words.  Not only have they failed to address the question of poverty and social inequality in their communities, they have led a reign of terror against the poorest and most marginalized segments of Iranian society by enacting and savagely implementing these &quot;laws.&quot;<br /> <br />The nine Iranians convicted and sentenced for adultery must be released immediately. Adultery must be de-criminalized in Iran and any other country for that matter deeming it to be a criminal offense.  A civilized society, which delivers justice equally and dispassionately to the weak and downtrodden of society, would not dispense such punishment.&quot;<br />

Circuit Court of Appeals decision to vacate the EPA's implementation of the Clean Air Interstate Rule reminds us that the statutory mandates of our environmental laws are important, and that an individual administration cannot simply change or alter them at whim...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/victorflatt.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>M</strong></font>any environmental organizations were stunned recently when the D.C. Circuit vacated the EPA's implementation of the Clean Air Interstate Rule ("CAIR") in <em>North Carolina v. EPA</em>. According to the Court, the CAIR failed to follow Clean Air Act ("CAA") statutory mandates.  This rule, which for the first time seemed to put teeth into the CAA's requirement that states not contribute to other states' unhealthful levels of pollutants, was judged inconsistent with specific requirements of that section of the statute, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(1).  <br /><br />Since the CAIR seemed poised to produce actual reductions in harmful pollutants, which could save 17,000 lives annually, the dismay is understandable.  After all, prior EPA enforcement of section 7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(1) was woefully inadequate, leaving many states in situations where it was almost technically impossible for them to meet the CAA's requirements within their state. And this was the only Bush EPA action that had received broad support from environmental and public health organizations.  Nevertheless, as the D.C. Circuit reminds us, "all the policy reasons in the world cannot justify reading a substantive portion out of a statute." <br /><br />The DC Circuit correctly noted that under Sec. 7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(1), the EPA could only approve states' State Implementation Plans, or SIPs, if the plans insured that pollutant sources within that state did not cause significant pollution loads in other states.   This reflects one of the prime reasons for a federal air pollution control law in the first place &#8212; the abatement and control of interstate pollution.  Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, both technical and political, this requirement lay dormant for most of the history of the Act.  The evolving understanding of this problem finally led individual states to petition the EPA to make findings of "out of state contributions" as early as 1997, leading to the first real attempt of the EPA to address this important issue. <br /><br />Over the evolving attempts to do so under both the Clinton and Bush administrations, the DC Circuit has been consistent in its requirement that the EPA hew to specific statutory language in the Act, while also exhibiting a high degree of deference to specific agency scientific and technical findings of contribution.  Thus, in <em>Michigan v. EPA</em> and in <em>Appalachian Power Company v. EPA</em>, the DC Circuit broadly upheld the EPA's findings that specific sources were causing downwind non-compliance, and even upheld a somewhat novel use of cost reduction analysis to allow the EPA to make this determination on a wider and broader scale. <br /><br />These prior decisions and current vogue of pollutant trading systems led many to believe that the DC Circuit would approve a broad trading system as a solution to the interstate problem.  A broad trading system, like CAIR, however, fails to meet the requirements of the section at issue because it doesn't pinpoint which sources cause downwind state non-compliance, nor does it require those sources to make the reductions necessary to return downwind state compliance.  Though CAIR clearly would make improvements in overall air quality in the Eastern United States, thus meeting several of the overall goals of the CAA, it fails to do so in the way that takes account of all values at issue in the CAA.  As <em>North Carolina</em> correctly noted, the CAA not only requires overall air quality to be improved, but mandates improvements in specific areas that are being harmed by out of state sources.  It is not enough to improve the air quality in the Washington D.C. metro area, if Charlotte, North Carolina is still being inundated with pollutants from upwind states.  Moreover, the competitive economic advantages and disadvantages of states struggling to meet their CAA requirements while protecting the health of their citizens (in other words, the federalism and sovereignty issues) are mostly ignored by a rule like CAIR. <br /><br />Not having a shortcut like CAIR makes for a harder administration of this CAA provision to be sure, since it requires the EPA to focus on and reduce sources on an individual basis.  But the DC Circuit in <em>Michigan</em> and <em>Appalachian Power</em> has shown a great degree of deference as to how this can be accomplished, and what evidence can be used to make this finding.  While this means that some reductions will surely take longer without CAIR, it needn't delay real health improvements if the agency acts quickly to make requested findings on upwind sources and is willing to impose a Federal Implementation Plan (or "FIP") on non-compliant states. <br /><br />While environmentalists were understandably thankful that CAIR seemed to represent some significant pollution reductions, the method of avoiding legislative specificities in this case are simply part and parcel of the Bush Administration's attempts to accomplish its policy goals without following the legalities of the CAA.  Just because the result would have been "better" in this case than in the Administration's Mercury rule or New Source Review Routine Maintenance and Repair Rule, doesn't make its use less dangerous.  This case reminds us again that the statutory mandates of our environmental laws are important, and that an individual administration cannot simply change or alter them on its whim.  The complexities of pollution reduction and accompanying issues of health and economic development require that policy choices be made in the appropriate arena, the legislature.  If our policy provisions in the current CAA are unworkable, let us explore changing them there. <br /><br />This case should also remind us, as we focus on the big issue of climate change, that we still have work to do on more traditional pollution control.  Perhaps this will lead to a truly integrated and thoughtful debate on these intertwined issues in the next administration.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Victor B. Flatt is the A.L.

In the rush to pull out, security issues are forefronted while other issues, which may be more important may be bypassed so long as they appear to be under control. <br /><br />The main casualty of the rapid withdrawal could be Kurdistan. It would indeed be hard for Bush Administration to justify staying in Iraq a little while longer for the reason that the security of the Kurds needs to be reinforced. The public doesn't know much or care much about the Kurds. When foreign policy is run by the public, we can expect major blunders ahead.<br /><br />Kurdistan &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; "the land of the Kurds" &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; straddles four countries: Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Turkey. It has a population of thirty million. After the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in World War I, the Allies intended Kurdistan to be one of the emerging countries. For various reasons&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;military, political, indifference &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; Kurdistan did not happen. It remains a virtual state.<br /><br />Today the Kurds in the Iraqi part of Kurdistan have good reason to be worried. Although they approve of the new Iraqi Constitution, they are afraid that after the Americans withdraw, the Shiite majority will start to construe and reconstrue the Constitutional constraints until they are transformed into grants. It is hard for American readers to appreciate how this can happen on a wholesale basis since we are imbued with the resilience of our own Constitution. <br /><br />But there is a world of difference between the contexts of the two Constitutions. The founders of the American Constitution were fearful of governmental power; they did not want the President to morph into King George. Not only did the framers provide for separation of powers, checks and balances, federalism, and individual rights, but they and their fellow citizens firmly believed in the propriety and necessity of structural constraints upon governmental power. <br /><br />By contrast, the new Iraqi government will want and need all the power it can get. They will face threats from religious factions at home and terrorists infiltrating from abroad. The Shiite majority will sooner or later start enacting emergency legislation to "save the Constitution by temporarily disregarding it.".<br /><br />If the Kurds do not quickly become proactive, their autonomy may be at risk. One easy step would be to request observer status as "Kurdistan" at the UN General Assembly. More important would be to start taking steps toward statehood. This is the most auspicious time to do it because of the rush and confusion accompanying the American military withdrawal. A Kurdistan statehood plan might be drafted and filed with the UN General Assembly. The UN could also be asked to set up a consultative committee to monitor the Kurdistan question for the duration of the plan, which could be for five years. The Iraqi constitution would have supremacy throughout the five years; Iraq's authority would only be expected to be relinquished as the final step at the end of the plan. A draft Constitution for Kurdistan would be attached, with the proviso that it is a draft-in-progress.<br /><br />More important for Kurdistan's security, in my opinion, would be to set aside a tract of land near Mosul and lease it to the United States for 200 years. An airforce base could be constructed, with the latest bomb-proof underground facilities. It could be the most important American base in the Middle East. The proximity to Mosul would ensue that Kurdish entrepreneurs could establish stores and services at the perimeter of the base. Interaction between Kurds and Americans should be encouraged at all levels.<br /><br />This is of course a fairly radical suggestion. The Iraqis want to get rid of the American bases in Iraq. However, the Kurds should make decisions in their own self-interest without assuming that it is congruent with Iraqi self-interest. A major US airbase in the heart of Kurdistan might be the best long-term investment in security that the Kurds could ever make.<br /><br />On the Turkish side of Kurdistan, the problem is what to do with the PKK. The Kurdistan Workers Party, founded in the 1970s, is a revolutionary separatist movement responsible for thousands of deaths. The PKK has moderated its goal from separatism to autonomy. Nevertheless Turkey, the United States, and the European Union, brand the PKK as a terrorist organization. Of course, labels are manipulated for political purposes. If the PKK under international law is a terrorist organization, then under the Bush no-safe-haven doctrine, the Kurds themselves would have an obligation to seek out and destroy the PKK guerrillas who are hiding in the Kurdish mountains. But the case for legally describing the PKK as terrorists is weak. The PKK is a self-proclaimed, identifiable political organization with a clear goal of separatism and independence. Such organizations in international law have always been accorded a presumptive legality so long as they attain a reasonable critical mass that differentiates them from bands of criminals. Under general rules of international law pertaining to civil war, other states may legitimately contribute arms and money to such organizations. <br /><br />If Kurdistan-within-Turkey were eventually to secede, it should pay indemnity to Turkey for having protected its people and lands for many decades. This indemnity could take the form of a substantial royalty payable to Turkey against all future oil production in the region. This guarantee, made enforceable by the United Nations, might go a long way to moderating Turkey's loss of its Kurdish lands.<br /><br />Experts in Kurdistan, of which I am not one, may find my proposals na&Atilde;&macr;ve or unattainable. No matter; I have no expert reputation to lose! What I am hoping for, however, is that a set of radical proposals may stimulate thoughtful consideration. <br /><br /><br /><em>Anthony D.Amato is Leighton Professor of Law at Northwestern University, where he teaches international law and human rights.</em><br /><br /><iframe src="/related/damato.php" frameborder='0' width='100%' height='120' scrolling='no' valign='top' marginheight='3'></iframe><br />

		<title>Arresting Radovan Karadzic: Euphoria and Reality</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.state.gov/outofdate/bios/m/6833.htm">William Montgomery</a>, US Ambassador to Yugoslavia (later Serbia and Montenegro) from 2001-2004, says that as the euphoria over the arrest of Radovan Karadzic fades and reality sets in, it&#39;s clear that his case poses continuing challenges for the Serbian government, the European Union, and of course the prosecutors and judges at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia who wish to avoid the damage done to the local credibility of that court by the trials of Slobodan Milosevic and Vojslav Seselj...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/williammontgomery.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>n 1996 and early 1997, as Special Advisor to the President and Secretary of State for Bosnian Peace Implementation, my biggest confrontations and challenges were not with the various Bosnian parties, but in the relationship between our offices in the State Department and our counterparts in the Pentagon. The uniformed military and their civilian leaders were terrified that our troops would become targeted in a form of guerrilla warfare in Bosnia (pity that similar concerns weren&#39;t a factor several years later in the case of Iraq) and determined that there would be no &quot;Mission Creep&quot; which would keep them in Bosnia. This meant that the military narrowly defined its mission as only providing the overall security for Bosnia. They viewed virtually everything else, from refugee return to elections to reconstruction efforts as not their concern or responsibility. Convincing them otherwise was a constant battle. <br /><br />This attitude was strongest with regard to the apprehension of indicted war criminals. The U.S. military at that time fiercely refused to participate in any way in their capture for all the reasons stated above. So during this critical post-Dayton period, Ratko Mladic was giving TV interviews on the ski slopes of Jahorina (outside Sarajevo) and Radovan Karadzic was attending political rallies openly and going through military checkpoints with impunity. <br /><br />This changed in mid-1997, when the United States, along with key allies, finally agreed to utilize their military and intelligence forces to apprehend war criminals. The pendulum then continued to swing decisively to the other end of the spectrum, as the U.S. government made it official policy that the apprehension of both Mladic and Karadzic was essential for the stabilization of the Balkan region and a necessary step for our forces to fully withdraw and turn responsibility for the region over to the EU. Since that decision was made, many years ago now, the capture of Mladic and Karadzic (and all other indicted war criminals) has been a major U.S. government - and EU - priority. Through the use of various &quot;carrots and sticks&quot; we insisted that all the governments in the region consider it a priority as well. Despite these efforts and despite the fact that over one hundred and thirty other indictees have been arrested or persuaded to surrender, the top political and military leaders of the Bosnian Serbs - Karadzic and Mladic - eluded capture.<br /><br />The immediate impact of the dramatic announcement last month that Radovan Karadzic had finally been arrested was an outpouring of international support for Serbia and its new government. It was seen as a major victory for those in the European Union who had successfully argued for concrete steps to support pro-European parties in the recent Serbian elections. The EU &quot;Soft Power&quot; had once again shown its effectiveness: first in helping to bring about a pro-European government and then the arrest of one of the most wanted fugitives in the world. <br /><br />Notwithstanding a few small-scale protests, the public reaction in Serbia has been muted. Much of the media attention has focused on uncovering details of the alternative persona he created for the past several years as an active, passionate practitioner of alternative medicine in Belgrade not shy about lecturing to the public and appearing openly. It is almost impossible to equate this bearded, bespectacled man with the charismatic wartime leader presumed to be hiding in a cave or monastery for years. <br /><br />Cynics would say that the government deliberately chose to arrest Karadzic first, as he never enjoyed the same degree of popular support as Mladic. In this view, Karadzic&#39;s arrest was a &quot;trial balloon.&quot; If this is the case, the government must be reassured by the lack of reaction. One of the amusing/pathetic/predictable events was the speed with which the Socialist Party and the Ministry of Interior (the Minister is Socialist Party leader Dacic) disavowed any knowledge or responsibility for the arrest. At the same time, they gave no signs of a willingness or desire to endanger the new governing coalition as a result.<br /><br />It is unknown at this point if Karadzic will say anything about his years as a fugitive. It will be interesting if he tells the truth and probably even more interesting and controversial if he mixes some lies and allegations in as well. There is an insatiable demand and a readiness to believe any sort of statement he may give, no matter how implausible, about relationships with foreign governments, Serbian officials, and the Republika Srpska. In the meantime, investigators will be going over every document; every phone call; and every other item of evidence they can find to uncover traces of his life as a fugitive and to learn more details of his support network. It is possible, for example, that the same sources could have provided false documentation both to him and Mladic. Discovering that link could help lead to Mladic himself. At the same time, there are many unanswered questions for the Serbian government as well: when and how did they first learn of Karadzic&#39;s false identity and location? Who in the government was informed and when?<br /><br />As the euphoria over the arrest fades and reality sets in, challenges abound. While getting credit for arresting Karadzic, ironically the Serbian government has put itself under even more pressure than ever before to arrest Mladic and the other remaining fugitive, Goran Hadzic. The arrest of Karadzic &quot;proved&quot; that if the government really wished to do so, it could find these fugitives. Certainly, neither of them can be sleeping easily these days. <br /><br />The EU faces its own challenges. Serbian politicians will be pressing them hard to implement the Transitional Trade Agreement, which is the first step towards receiving official Candidate status for EU membership. They hope to receive this status early next year. The EU may find it hard to comply, as it has its own issues with the uncertain future of the Lisbon Treaty and corresponding statements by some that no enlargement can take place until this question is resolved. Moreover, many will continue to insist on the apprehension of all indicted war criminals before taking further steps. <br /><br />The ICTY prosecutors also face challenges. It is interesting to compare the indictment of Milosevic for actions in Bosnia with the corresponding indictment of Karadzic. The Milosevic indictment is a comprehensive overview of the Bosnian conflict with all the main actors (including Karadzic) listed in it. One of its central themes, bolstered by the minutes of meetings of the Yugoslav Supreme Defense Council, was the extent of the Serbian government&#39;s decision-making role in events in Bosnia - including particularly Milosevic, but also the Yugoslav Army and paramilitary units. In striking contrast, the Karadzic indictment in its entirety never once mentions the name &quot;Milosevic&quot; and limits mention of outside involvement only to some actions of the Yugoslav Army. It focuses on the Bosnian Serb political lea
dership, principally Karadzic, as those responsible for war crimes committed by the Serbian side. Confusing the issue even more is that it is widely known that Mladic and Karadzic loathed each other and that oftentimes Mladic refused to follow Karadzic&#39;s directives. Moreover, documents show that Mladic until at least 2002 remained an active duty officer of the Yugoslav National Army. So to whom did Mladic owe his real loyalties? Who did he consider his Commander in Chief? How much real command authority did Karadzic or the rest of the civilian leadership have over the various Serbian military and paramilitary forces present in Bosnia? <br /><br />This is not to say that Karadzic has much hope of ever living outside prison walls again. But given the high bar for conviction, which the Tribunal has recently demonstrated, the prosecutors will be hard pressed to prove all of the charges in the indictment &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot; Both the Prosecutor&#39;s Office and the Tribunal itself are keenly aware that both the Milosevic and Seselj trials did great damage to the credibility of the ICTY. Their challenge is to see that the Karadzic Trial helps to restore it, not damage it even further. It will be interesting in that regard to see how the court deals with Karadzic&#39;s efforts to represent himself in the Milosevic/Seselj manner. <br /><br /><br /><em>William Montgomery was US Ambassador to Yugoslavia (later Serbia and Montenegro) from 2001-2004&lt;/i<br />

This has ignited a firestorm as to whether various radio stations should drop Savage. Especially with large numbers of veterans with service-connected disabilities returning home, the public has shown decreased patience for this type of hate-mongering, making it likely Savage will go the way of Don Imus in a lot of markets.<br /><br />But Savage&#39;s comments demonstrate a point that is more important than the issue of whether he should be fired or not. As the 18th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act approaches, Savage&#39;s prejudiced comments show why the statute was originally enacted and why recent Congressional action to amend the statute to make it stronger is needed.<br /><br />Savage's fairly unimaginative comments represent one snapshot of how people with disabilities have been viewed in this country: as fakers. Other stereotypes include being labeled objects of pity, unproductive drags on society, and even being cursed by some divine power. Congress recognized the collective power of these views when it passed the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act. Explicitly finding that people with disabilities had been marginalized and discriminated against, Congress forcefully stated that people with disabilities should have civil rights commensurate with other citizens. Employers were no longer allowed to refuse to hire people with disabilities because they didn't like or feel comfortable with them. Both public programs and privately owned places that are open to the public had to take steps to become more accessible. <br /><br />Over time, this law has changed hearts and minds. People are becoming more accustomed to seeing people with disabilities in public spaces or in the employment arena. As always happens, stereotypes and prejudice recede and awareness is raised. We have become a more inclusive society, and our laws have become a model for the world.<br /><br />But not everything has changed. Although not always expressed in as blatant terms as Michael Savage, whether as a function of outright dislike or more subtle animus, people with disabilities are still too often judged on the basis of their disability instead of their true abilities. Without asking, employers feel that an employee who is blind "simply won't be able to do the job," or a restaurant owner does not feel the need to put down a ramp because "no one with a wheelchair has ever dined here." Judges, too often viewing people with disabilities through a pitying or paternalistic lens, have interpreted the statute in extremely limited ways. Based on unstated fears of letting the law get out of control (perhaps, in Savage's parlance, letting fakers get extra benefits), recent cases have held that people with mental retardation and cancer are not really disabled. Lawmakers and judges have even speculated that under current interpretations, someone with a prosthetic limb might not be considered disabled. This belies Congressional intent and common sense.<br /><br />This is why Congress is poised to pass a new law clarifying that the Americans with Disabilities Act should be interpreted broadly to provide more individuals with greater protections. Representatives of both the business and disability rights communities have worked hard to find common ground, and this law's prospects for passage are good. Comments like Michael Savage's remind us that prejudice against people with physical and mental disabilities still exists, and, like with race and sex discrimination, we still need the government's help in creating a more just society. <br /><br /><br /><em>Michael Waterstone is a professor of law at Loyola Law School Los Angeles, where he teaches Disability Rights Law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="mailto:dwrist@pitt.edu">Wes Rist</a> of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law says that while the International Criminal Court and its founding Rome Statute are far from perfect, the operation of Court since the Statute entered into force in July 2002 provides ample evidence that many fears of American conservatives relating to the Court&#39;s operation were and are unfounded.....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/wesrist.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he United States has always had an &quot;on again&quot;/&quot;off again&quot; relationship with the International Criminal Court. <br /><br />Shortly after his inauguration, President George W. Bush "unsigned" the Rome Statute agreed to by the Clinton Administration [a process graphically described by Clinton war crimes ambassador David Scheffer in a recent JURIST <em>Forum</em> <a href="/forumy/2008/07/us-and-international-criminal-court.php">op-ed</a>] and undertook an active opposition to not only US participation in the ICC, but also to the Court's actual existence. Since then, the US has undertaken significant steps to promote its negative view of the ICC. Using what can at best be termed political manipulation, and at worst strong-arm tactics, the Bush White House began collecting an alphabetical list of Article 98 immunity agreements that would prevent ICC prosecutions against US military personnel in various countries. Congress also passed the American Servicemember's Protection Act 2002, which legislated restrictions on US support for countries actively supporting the Court, including the withdraw of military support and possible economic aid to ICC states party under the "Nethercutt Amendment." <br /><br />US opposition to the ICC has been strongly supported by the conservative elements of the American political spectrum on many grounds, though the most notable objections usually center around concerns of infringement on national sovereignty, &quot;unfair&quot; (read &quot;political&quot;) targeting of US military personnel, and due process and US Constitutional issues. <br /><br />A careful review of these concerns demonstrates, however, that traditional American conservatives should actually be among the strongest supporters of the Court. And while the ICC and the Rome Statute are far from perfect, the six years of the Court&#39;s operation since the July 2002 entering into force of the Statute gives provides material evidence that these fears lack foundation in the reality of the Court's actions.<br /><br />The issue of the political motivation of possible ICC prosecutions against US military and political leaders is one that will never be put to rest. Unless America reverts to early 20th century isolationism, she will always have detractors and opponents who either simply disagree with American responses to international problems or actively seek to oppose American interests. But the fact that US leaders might be targeted for their actions is nothing new, and conservatives are actually one of the strongest supporters of the principle that drives the personal responsibility at the heart of ICC jurisdiction: that no one, not even the political and military leaders of a country, is above the law.<br /><br />Going back to the foundation of the United States, the cry against the British t3<br />reatment of the colonies was not one seeking special treatment. It was simply a demand that the King and Parliament must act in accordance with their own laws and did not have the right to ignore them. The ICC represents the first real attempt to turn that principle into an international norm that says that no one, not even the leader of a sovereign nation, can escape the rule of the law. <br /><br />The possibility that American servicemen and women and political and military leaders could be held up to scrutiny for their actions is not a new one. It has been enshrined in American law from the foundation of the country under the Articles of War and later the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The ICC merely adds the opportunity for the prosecution of individuals who might have escaped the domestic system of justice. If there is enough evidence that the prosecutor for the ICC could even consider an investigation of a US political or military official for the crimes set out in the Rome Statute, then American conservatives should already have been at the forefront of the call for a domestic investigation. Since the principle of complementarity in Article 17 of the Rome Statute prohibits the ICC from initiating an investigation when a domestic judicial system has already addressed the issue, an American investigation into our own "dirty laundry" would prevent any ICC jurisdiction.<br /><br />Reassuringly, the Office of the Prosecutor for the ICC has already demonstrated a strong "backbone" when it comes to resisting international pressure for a politically expedient investigation or trial. In February of 2006, the ICC Prosecutor announced that after reviewing hundreds of complaints concerning US and Coalition actions in Iraq, none of the cases rose to the level of the crimes detailed in the Rome Statute. While I obviously do not have access to the original complaints, I do know what the elements of the crimes detailed in the Rome Statute are and the refusal of Luis Moreno-Ocampo to initiate even an investigation against Coalition forces indicates that the ICC will take very seriously its statutory obligation to take on only the most serious of international crimes rising to the levels set out in the Rome Statute. There is simply nothing to suggest that the ICC, after six years in existence, is the politically motivated tool of the enemies of the United States.<br /><br />Traditional conservative opposition to the Court on the grounds of national sovereignty usually centers around Article 17 of the Rome Statute, which provides that the ICC may not proceed with an investigation when a state party has already conducted an investigation or prosecution "unless the State is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution." 17 (2) provides the specific instances of what would constitute the "genuineness" of a state party's investigation or prosecution and how the Court should make that determination. Former US Ambassador to the UN John Bolton charged that the ICC opposed "fundamental American notions of sovereignty, checks and balances, and national independence," an apparent reference to the ICC's power to review the legitimacy of a domestic investigation or trial of a possible target of the ICC prosecutor. The alleged challenge to "sovereignty, checks and balances, and national independence" apparently comes from having someone who can review US judicial proceedings and declare on their "genuineness."<br /><br />While this issue may very well be of concern in many nations around the world, the United States is not a country that should have to worry about the "genuineness" of its judicial proceedings. One of the many foundational concepts of American conservatism is that power should never be absolute in the hands of the government. The War for Independence came about in large part because of the unchecked use of power by the British Parliament in the name of King George III. This concern gave rise to the separation of powers and the system of checks and balances that we enjoy under the American Constitution. The Rome Statute's review of "genuineness" of judicial proceedings is not an abridgment of checks and balances, but rather another, albeit international, check on domestic governments. Given the strong heritage of an independent judiciary in this country and the inability of the executive branch to exercise any permanent control over federal judges, the only instance where the ICC could step in and take up a case where an American investigation or trial ha
d already occurred would be if the executive branch exercised undue influence over the investigation or trial and prejudiced the result. Should that event occur, not only should American conservatives be supportive of the ICC's ruling, but they should also be at the head of the crowd protesting the abuse of power by the executive branch. That kind of unchecked authority is exactly what the American experiment was designed to eliminate.<br /><br />Finally, there are some valid due process concerns relating to the operation of the Rome Statute. While the process provisions of the Rome Statute (Article 67, among others) are not exact copies of US constitutional protections, they hardly create the possibility of an unfair or impartial trial. In fact, the rights spelled out for defendants throughout the entirety of the Rome Statute are some of the strongest criminal defendant protections put in place for any international tribunal and they certainly rise to the level of meeting the judicial guarantees provided for by the Geneva Conventions and international human rights laws such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.<br /><br />Ultimately, should the US government or conservatives in general have any specific concerns about the due process or Constitutional protections (or lack thereof) afforded by the Rome Statute, the solution is simple: conduct an investigation or trial domestically so that there is no reason for the ICC to become involved. In fact, as mentioned previously, a proactive investigation by the US creates a statutory bar to involvement by the ICC Office of the Prosecutor. <br /><br />For conservatives, this should be the preferred response anyway. First, when our own military or political leaders undertake an action that could even remotely be construed as rising to a criminal violation of the ICC, they reflect poorly upon us, the citizens of the United States. As conservatives, we hold that identification dear and when any leader, regardless of how much we approve of their other actions, ideas, or political views, exposes Americans to that kind of criticism, they have forfeited the trust of the people and must be held accountable. Second, as conservatives, we have an unabashed tendency to view the US Constitution as the best example of the balance between effective government and the protection of personal liberties in existence. If we really believe that, then the only proper response for a conservative when faced with the possibility of actions by our own leaders that might rise to the level of Rome Statute crimes is to insist upon an investigation or trial under domestic law; especially if we believe that leader to be innocent of the charges. The concept of the Rule of Law is deeply ingrained into the conservative ideology and if we as conservatives wish to continue to hold the US Constitution up as an example of how this concept can be effectively implemented, then we must be willing to apply it to our own.<br /><br />While the political wind in conservative circles seems to be blowing against international cooperation these days, the principles and goals of the ICC are ones that we as conservative Americans are not only familiar with, but have espoused strongly as our own in the past. From the first experiment in international criminal law at Nuremberg, American conservatives have been able to point at the core concepts held within those proceedings as the very essence of the principles we feel most strongly about. We who regard ourselves as politically conservative should take a step back, look at the Rome Statute and the ICC objectively, and then ask seriously why we should not be the loudest voices in America calling for our government to not only join, but spearhead the charge for worldwide ratification of the Rome Statute and a push for justice on an international level.<br /><br /><br /><em>Wes Rist is an Adjunct Professor and Assistant Director of the Center for International Legal Education at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.syr.edu/faculty/facultymember.asp?fac=152">David Crane</a> of Syracuse University College of Law, former Chief Prosecutor for the UN Special Court for Sierra Leone, says that the declaration by recently-arrested Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic that he will defend himself before the ICTY at The Hague is an historically-predictable bid to control, play up and even disrupt the proceedings under the guise of exercising his legal right to defend himself....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/davidcranenew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font> few days after his arrest in Serbia, Radovan Karadzic declared that he would defend himself before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia against his indictment related to the horrors he allegedly helped perpetrate in the Balkans. Thus begins an all too familiar pattern in the trial of yet another faction leader for war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity.<br /><br />I recall Hinga Norman, leader of the Sierra Leone's Civil Defense Forces, in June of 2004, loudly declaring he was firing his defense counsel and defending himself just after I gave my opening statement in the joint criminal trial of Norman and his two henchmen. Also, in June of 2007, Charles Taylor refused to come out of his cell on the day his trial opened wanting to represent himself. Saddam Hussein railed at the Iraqi High Tribunal as he defended himself against various international and domestic crimes. And of course there is Slobodan Milosevic, who defended himself in a years-long and drawn out spectacle that eventually ended in Milosevic's death before a judgment could be rendered on his indictment. <br /><br />One finds such histrionics going all the way back to the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg as Hermann Goering sought to take control of the proceedings for his own political advantage. Why do these warlords, dictators, and thugs want to represent themselves? The easy answer is that they can. A review of the various rules of procedure and evidence allows an indictee to defend himself if he so chooses. But there is more to all this than the legal right of defending yourself before a tribunal or court.<br /><br />First, there is the control issue. Having been removed from positions of great and even absolute power, these indictees have controlled nations and even regions in a way that is hard to imagine. In many instances they were the law. To remain in power absolute control was essential. This need to control all matters around them extends into the court room. Their disdain for the judicial proceedings is all part of this. They rant and rave at their situation and howl at the judges refusing to be a part of their case or the jurisdiction of the court to even try them, among other real or imagined incongruities. <br /><br />A second reason is politics. A trial on international crimes before the world is an incredible "bully pulpit" for these masters of politics and manipulation. To these heads of state and leaders of various factions the trial is in some ways the ultimate grandstand from which they can play out whatever politics they choose to present and in a way that explains their actions and crimes they are being for which they are being prosecuted. It has only been recently that the judges have begun to get their procedural arms around this to avoid the events that took place in the Milosevic trial. <br /><br />Thirdly, disruption and injecting error into the record of proceedings may be a subtle yet compelling reason. Somewhat similar to control, disruption of the proceedings can show not only control and disdain for the authority of the court, but it is also good theater and many, if not all, of these defendants are great actors. The martyr facing an inevitable fate and before great odds plays well back at home. Yet another more serious issue is the hope of injecting enough error into the proceedings to build an appellate record that may cause a reversal of a judgment or a retrial. Neither of these results is acceptable. <br /><br />As a former Chief Prosecutor reversible error was one of my biggest fears. Though the proceeding must be open, fair, and just, you can't release these individuals on a technicality caused by an error at the trial level by judges who have generally little to no trial experience. Disruptions of any kind only enhance that chance and the defendants know this.<br /><br />Of course none of these tactics have actually proven to be of benefit to the accused. Over time each settles down into an almost predictable pattern of anger and rage, denial, and finally acceptance of their situation. These former heads of state are going through a psychological process that moves them from arrogance to humility and it is usually not pretty to watch. <br /><br />The various tribunals and courts have begun to work out legally supportable methods to ensure the rights of the accused are carefully protected. In places where there is little respect for the law or a great fear of the law, these proceedings must be perceived by the victims and the citizenry of the region as fair and that the law can bring a type of justice that can account for these atrocities in a way that is acceptable to them. <br /><br />And so it begins again, Radovan Karadzic will represent himself, howling, ranting, and raving at the tribunal that will decide his fate. I wonder if Presidents Omar al-Bashir and Robert Mugabe* will do the same.<br /><br /><br /><font SIZE=2>*For more information on the crimes against humanity perpetrated by President Mugabe see the recently published white paper &quot;Justice for Zimbabwe&quot; by the !ENOUGH Project and Impunity watch at <a href="http://www.enoughproject.org">http://www.enoughproject.org</a> or <a href="http;//www.impunitywatch.net">http;//www.impunitywatch.net</a></font>  <br /><br /><br /><em>David M.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elisa Mari, Pitt Law &#39;10, files from <strong>Athens</strong>:<br /><br />The term <em>lesbian</em> comes from the Greek name of the Aegean Island of Lesvos.  The island, known for its beautiful beaches and unspoiled landscapes, is also famous for being the island of the Ancient Greek female poet Sappho. Many scholars believe that Sappho&#39;s work was about the sexual love between women, and based on this history, most modern-day homosexual women use the name of Lesvos to describe their orientation.<br /><br />This is all well and good, except for the fact that there are many other &acirc;&#8364;&#732;Lesbians&#39;, i.e. current inhabitants of the Island of Lesvos, who object to the fact that their name is also one used by homosexual women. <br /><br />In June, three islanders brought a case against the Homosexual and Lesbian Community of Greece (OLKE), saying that the use of the word was insulting to their homeland and petitioning the court to ban the use of the term &quot;lesbian&quot; as applied to homosexual women. Islanders appeared on television decrying their fate. One man in particular was very upset saying that it was a disgrace that his sister could no longer call herself a Lesbian due to the current double meaning of the word. In addition to the patriotic claim, many islanders are also upset that the resort of Eresos (the birthplace of Sappho) is an increasingly popular tourist destination for homosexual women. In general, many fear that their island will become known as a resort for homosexuals and are unhappy about that.<br /><br />On July 22nd, an Athens court rejected these islanders&#39; appeal. In so ruling, the court held that the term &quot;lesbian&quot; did not define the identity of the island&#39;s residents, and therefore it could be used by homosexual organizations both in Greece and abroad. One can only wonder what Sappho would think of all this!<br />

		<title>IRAQ: Women&#039;s Rights and the Iraqi Constitution in Practice</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sara Burhan Abdullah, Pitt Law LLM &#39;08, files from <strong>Sulaimaniya</strong>:<br /><br />A recent incident showed me that while the Iraqi Constitution has a great deal of material from which a society based on equality of the sexes can be built, there are significant legal and cultural obstacles to obtaining that goal.  I left Iraq to go to the US three years ago, so when I arrived in Sulaimaniya on July 13, many of my friends and relatives wanted to come and visit me. One day, some of my friends from law school came to welcome me, and we started talking about the legal and political situation in Iraq.  I asked them how difficult it would be to get a passport without going to Baghdad, because my husband and I are helping to organize a project in the United States that we hoped Iraqis could attend.<br /><br />One of my female friends complained that her father has to grant her permission in order for her to get a passport, while this is not the case for males.  Although her father was happy to do it, she understandably found this notion of parental consent offensive and insulting, given that she is not a child but an attorney with a flourishing legal practice who represents dozens of men and travels around the Kurdish region of Iraq to assist them in their cases.  <br /><br />More importantly, this requirement is a clear violation of the Iraqi Constitution.  Article 14 makes clear that all Iraqis are equal under the law without respect to gender.  The process of obtaining a passport under relevant Ministry regulations is precisely the same for both genders, except for this additional burden of parental consent imposed on females.  This situation seems to be a classic case of legal inequality between men and women.<br /><br />Shockingly, however, my friends and other colleagues, all lawyers, insisted that the Iraqi Constitution requires paternal consent for women.  They based their assertion on statements made by a Ministry employee to the female lawyer I mentioned.  They were so certain as to cause me to question my own understanding of the Constitution, but I referred to the text of the Constitution and showed my colleagues the gender equality requirement.  <br /><br />Once they were satisfied, I started encouraging my friends to challenge the law. I raised the possibility of a suit in the federal supreme court of Iraq, but I was surprised when my friends said that in their view, challenging the constitutionality of a law or a regulation is not truly practicable in Iraq.  Though it has been done, examples are few and it is seen as a waste of time to even try, since the chances of success are so remote.  In the end, I could not convince any of them to consider such an opportunity.<br /><br />On the next day, I decided to meet with some women&#39;s organizations and governmental officials to find out whether there are any efforts to challenge the regulation. I visited four different organizations to discuss the matter.  Although I could not meet with all of the people I wished, I did get to meet some lawyers, who turned out to be my former classmates from law school.  They provided me with documents written by the Kurdish regional government asking Baghdad to revise the regulations because they are in violation of the Constitution.  To date, no reply has been received, more than one year after the request was sent. The Kurdish government seems reluctant to pursue the issue, saying it has other priorities.  In addition, more than 42 women&#39;s organizations have tried to lobby Kurdish and central government officials in Baghdad to change the regulations. By and large, they have been entirely ignored.<br /><br />This seemed then the perfect time to raise a test case in the courts.  The government was in violation of the Constitution, after all, and therefore if persuasion would not work, then it was time for judicial compulsion.  This met stiff resistance.  I received a series of rather weak excuses from the women&#39;s organizations that I visited.  Among these were that nobody had time or money to make such a case (even though I promised to work on outside funding), that no test case could be found (impossible to believe) and that the prosecutor&#39;s office would have to be involved (not true as a matter of Iraqi law).   To date, after extensive efforts, I have been unable to convince anyone to even try to make a case to challenge this patently unconstitutional regulation, though I continue to make efforts in this regard.<br /><br />It seems that the influence of the former government is still noticeable.  No one would have ever thought to challenge laws or to question a Ministry employee about the application of those laws, because someone who did so would never have been seen again.  Thus, my friends simply trusted the government official, far less trained in Iraqi law than they as Iraqi lawyers, and assumed he knew something about the Constitution that they did not.  They never even thought to check the text.  When told that this was a violation, even after complaining about it, they did not think there was any point in pushing the matter.<br /><br />This sad incident reflects the gap between Iraq&#39;s laws and its practice.  Much attention has been paid to the the Constitution, and to the fact that regulations can technically be challenged on the basis of it, but this example tends to show that in practice, the culture of the rule of law which is necessary to sustain such challenges is largely absent.  Lobbying the government and asking it for assistance are seen as acceptable, but fighting it in court due to violations of its own Constitution is not.  I can only hope that this will change and a new generation of  Iraqis who have courage to challenge the government will rise from our law schools.<br />

		<title>UKRAINE: The Problem of Creating an Enforceable Contract</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Carrie Cecil, Pitt Law &#39;10, files from <strong>Kiev</strong>:<br /><br />In countries with stable legal systems, it would be nearly unthinkable to choose foreign law for a contract between two parties from the same country, but in Ukraine, this is common practice.  Due to corruption in the court system and the instability of Ukrainian laws, attorneys are forced to seek other methods to make transactions secure for their clients.  The resulting contracts always have provisions for dispute resolution to occur in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, or any other European country, as long as it is outside of Ukraine.  Additionally, if all parties involved have assets located outside of Ukraine, contract will specify that another country&#39;s law will apply to the contract instead of Ukrainian law. <br /><br />Ukrainian attorneys have to be creative in order to assure their clients that agreements will be enforceable.  Using foreign law and including provisions for arbitration to occur in other jurisdictions are two examples of how the Ukrainian legal system is avoided.  Unfortunately, these maneuvers are not always possible depending on the characteristics of individual transactions.  The Ukrainian Parliament has adopted provisions requiring certain types of transactions or transactions between certain parties to be governed by Ukrainian law.  In these transactions, the use of Ukrainian law is then unavoidable, but even in these situations, contracts will include a provision for arbitration in a jurisdiction outside of Ukraine. <br /><br />A third issue for Ukrainian attorneys when drafting contracts is whether an arbitration decision will be enforceable.  If a decision is rendered against a party that only has assets in Ukraine, there may be problems enforcing such a decision in Ukraine.  The Ukrainian courts have refused to enforce some arbitration decisions made abroad, effectively making some contracts unenforceable.  Additionally, some arbitration decisions end up in the Ukrainian court system for long periods of time awaiting a determination on whether they will be enforced in Ukraine.  The best hope for a valid and enforceable contract exists when all parties involved have assets located outside of Ukraine. <br /><br />The question becomes how to enforce a contract when the breaching party&#39;s assets are all located in Ukraine.  This question is not yet resolved.  For example, during a recent seminar, Ukrainian attorneys were explaining the use of confidentiality clauses in contracts, and they acknowledged that although confidentiality clauses are in contracts made here, they are nearly impossible to enforce.  As a result, contracts produced in Ukraine include a plethora of provisions making all parties aware of the potential risks related to limitations on enforceability in Ukraine and limit attorney liability to clients on this issue.<br />

		<title>Daw Aung San Suu Kyi&#039;s detention illustrates Burmese junta&#039;s unjust rule</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Aung Din</strong> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.uscampaignforburma.org/">US Campaign for Burma</a>]: &quot;Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has been under house arrest since May 30, 2003, under Article 10 (B) of the &quot;State Protection Act 1975.&quot; This Act was promulgated by the General Ne Win&#39;s so-called Socialist government in 1975, and designed to arrest anyone who challenge single party rule. Article 10 (A) of this law provided for detention of a person against whom action is taken for a period of up to 180 days. Article 10 (B) allows restriction of rights of a person against whom action is taken for a period of up to one year, which is effectively house arrest. Article (14) allows the authorities to continue the detention or restricting of rights of a person up to three years.<br /> <br />However, in August 1991, current military regime amended the Act and the maximum period of detention of a person went up to five years. Then again in 1994, the military regime announced that, it would be justified to hold anyone arrested under the State Protection Act for a total of six years. This would make it easier for the regime to continue the detention of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi from July 1989 to March 1995.<br /><br />Article 19 and 20 of the Act are provisions of appeal. Article 19 says that &quot;any person against whom action is taken has the right to appeal while actions is being taken.&quot; Article 20 says that &quot;appeal can be made to the (military regime&#39;s) Cabinet regarding orders regulating restrictions, arrest, detention or denial of rights laid down by the Central Board (comprising three ministers from Home Affairs, Defense and Foreign Affairs). The Cabinet can annually alter or approve the order as may be necessary.&quot;<br /><br />Therefore, according to the Act, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/myanmar-activist-suu-kyi-meets-with.php">must be allowed to meet her legal representative</a> since she was unfairly arrested in 2003 and should be allowed to appeal or challenge the legality of her arrest. However, only now has she been allowed to meet with her lawyer for two hours. U Kyi Win, her lawyer, will try his best to submit an appeal to the military regime as soon as possible, as directed by his client. But, a negative outcome will surely be expected as the military regime does not respect any law. The current detention of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi is due to complete six years in May 2009, but who knows whether the regime will again amend the Act and increases the maximum detention to ten years. The Burmese military regime is making the laws, as it wishes, to oppress the people, and sitting above the laws without respecting them. Thousands of political prisoners, including Daw Aung San Su Kyi, and millions of Burmese populations, are the victims of this justice-less society.<br /><br />The strong and effective resolution from the UN Security Council on Burma is urgently required to stop these injustices. China should work along with the United States, United Kingdom, France and other members of the Council and speak with one voice to the regime that this is the time for change.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/about_us/staff/apple_b.htm">Betsy Apple</a> and  <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/about_us/staff/burniat-n.htm">Nicolas Burniat</a> [Director and Pennoyer Fellow, Crimes Against Humanity Program, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/index.html">Human Rights First</a>]: &quot;Efforts by the Prosecutor of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Courts</a> (ICC) to obtain an <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-prosecutor-applies-for-warrant-to.php">arrest warrant</a> against the president of Sudan, Omar el-Bashir, for charges of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide generated unprecedented uproar.  In contrast, the tenth anniversary of the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/index.html">Rome Statute</a> - the treaty that created the ICC - three days later, went unnoticed by the press. <br /><br />While Sudan watchers debated the impact of the Prosecutor&#39;s action on justice versus accountability for Darfur - assuming, by and large, that those two goals were mutually exclusive - they ignored the legal implications of the charges sought by the Prosecutor. That genocide is included among those charges has potentially serious legal consequences for States engaged in relations with Sudan.<br /><br />While the United States has called the situation in Darfur genocide, others, including the U.N. Security Council, have been silent on the question.  In its <a href="http://www.un.org/news/dh/sudan/com_inq_darfur.pdf">report</a> [PDF] of January 2005, the panel authorized by the Security Council to investigate the crimes in Darfur, the Commission of Inquiry, declined to call them genocide. The Commission did not, however, exclude the possibility that single individuals, including members of the Sudanese governments, might have harbored genocidal intent.<br /><br />Today, after three years of additional investigations initiated at the request of the Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, the Prosecutor of the ICC has indicated that he had sufficient evidence to believe that genocide indeed is occurring in Darfur. The Prosecutor&#39;s conclusions are not legally authoritative, and only the judges of the International Criminal Court will be in a position to decide the issue once and for all. Nonetheless, his public statements that he believes genocide is occurring are meaningful because they put to rest the idea that some country - any country - in the world might possibly claim they are unaware of the risk of genocide in Darfur.<br /><br />Genocide, while a high profile cause for activists and the subject of much public discussion, has not been addressed substantially by international legal institutions.  The <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/">International Court of Justice</a>, in February 2007, determined for the first time that the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/p_genoci.htm">1948 Genocide Convention</a> creates an obligation for all States to act to prevent genocide no matter where the genocide is occurring. In its judgment in the case Application of the Convention on the Prevention and the Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro) (hereinafter the Genocide case), the Court specified that <strong>this obligation arises as soon as a State learns or should normally have learned of the existence of a serious risk of genocide</strong>.<br /><br />By publicly seeking genocide charges against Bashir, the ICC Prosecutor clearly has put governments on notice of the existence of a serious risk that genocide is occurring in Darfur. Whatever their previous stance or alleged state of awareness about the situation in Darfur, States can no longer claim that they are unaware that the crimes in Darfur might amount to genocide. This knowledge is sufficient to trigger for every State the legal obligation to act to prevent that genocide. The obligation persists until the risk of genocide in Darfur is averted or stopped.<br /><br />In order to have content, obligations require actions.  What, then, must a State do to comply with its legal obligation to act to prevent genocide in Darfur?<br /><br />According to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), States must employ all means reasonably available to them so as to prevent the genocide to the extent possible. A State would violate the Genocide Convention if it had &quot;manifestly failed to take all measures which were within its power, and which might have contributed to preventing the genocide.&quot;  It explained that any determination as to whether a State had taken all measures in its power had to be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account, among other things, &quot;the capacity to influence effectively the actions of persons likely to commit, or already committing genocide, the geographical distance from the scene of the events, and the strength of the political links, as well as links of all other kinds between the authorities of that State and the main actors in the events.&quot;<br /><br />In the case of Darfur, States engaged in any kind of relationship with the government in Khartoum should examine the &quot;means reasonably available to them&quot; to ascertain if they are complying with their duty to prevent genocide.  Recently, several published reports have indicated that a number of States, most notably China and Russia, are providing significant arms and other military support to Sudan. Those States should immediately stop transferring arms to the government of Sudan.  States selling arms to a government suspected of genocide are failing to take all measures in their power to prevent that genocide from happening.  To the contrary, their actions fuel the capacity of such a State to commit genocide. <br /><br />What else must States do? It is clear that the international community has failed so far to put sufficient and credible pressure on the government of Sudan.  This lack of resolve has enabled the authorities in Khartoum to stall the deployment of <a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/missions/unamid/">UNAMID</a>, to protect war criminals, and to continue its campaign of violence against not only civilians but also aid workers and peacekeepers. Several countries in the U.N. Security Council have been particularly active in their efforts to protect the government of Sudan from censure or negative consequences for its bad acts.  Are these countries undertaking all possible efforts to prevent or forestall the possible genocide in Darfur?     <br /><br />As a legal matter, the ICJ case clearly articulates a duty to prevent genocide, and indicates that this duty is one of conduct rather than of result. This means that the effort is required regardless of the outcome of such effort.  Legally, one can imagine a debate about the scope of such a duty. Politically, it is hard to argue that States are failing the people of Darfur, and that every effort to protect civilians has not been exhausted.  Should not States provide the logistical support to the peacekeeping force that is so badly needed to protect civilians and help end the violence in Darfur? And should not States cease to provide arms to a potential genocidaire? We believe the Genocide Convention would say yes to both questions. But must we wait for a court of law to decide the fate of the Darfuri people?&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Paul Mulindwa</span> [Africa project officer, <a href="http://www.minorityrights.org/?lid=6891">Minority Rights Group International</a> (Africa Office)]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/un-celebrates-adopting-declaration-on.php">coming into force</a> of this <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/DRIPS_en.pdf">declaration</a> [PDF] supports the protection and promotion of human rights of indigenous peoples in the world. It is a landmark declaration that brought to an end nearly 25 years of debatable discussions over the rights of indigenous and minority peoples, to protect their lands and resources, and to maintain their unique cultures and traditions wherever they are located. This not only fulfills article 27 of <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/a_ccpr.htm">ICCPR</a> but also enables its clear implementation. <br /><br />The adoption of this declaration is also taking another major step forward towards the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all.  It is also actively demonstrating the General Assembly&#39;s important role in setting international standards, representing the dynamic development of international legal norms and it reflects the commitment of the UN&#39;s member states to move in certain directions; it can be described as setting &quot;an important standard for the treatment of indigenous peoples, a tool towards eliminating human rights violations against over 370 million indigenous people and assisting them in combating discrimination and marginalization&quot; [UN <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/dec_faq.pdf">FAQ</a>].<br /><br />The Declaration sets out the individual and collective rights of indigenous peoples, as well as their rights to culture, identity, language, employment, health, education and other issues. It also emphasizes the rights of indigenous peoples to maintain and strengthen their own institutions, cultures and traditions, and to pursue their development in keeping with their own needs and aspiration. It prohibits discrimination against indigenous peoples, and it promotes their full and effective participation in all matters that concern them and their right to remain distinct and to pursue their own visions of economic and social development. It calls for the protection and promotion of their cultural identities, and accentuates their right to pursue development in keeping with their own needs and aspirations. In general, it is a declaration that has helped various stakeholders to advocate for the rights of minorities through engagement with governments and political leaders.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Karynn Fish </span>[spokesperson, <a href="http://www.basicrights.org/">Basic Rights Oregon</a>]: &quot;Oregon&#39;s <a href="http://www.leg.state.or.us/07reg/measpdf/hb2000.dir/hb2007.intro.pdf">domestic partnership law</a> [PDF] has been in effect since February 1, when a district court judge lifted a temporary restraining order that had delayed its implementation.  JURIST isn&#39;t clear on this point. <br /><br />Last week&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/ninth-circuit-upholds-denial-of-oregon.php">ruling </a>by the 9th Circuit means that there will be no referendum on the law (a remedy sought by the plaintiffs), and the 2,200+ committed couples who have registered domestic partnerships with the State of Oregon since February no longer have to worry that the legal status of their relationships might be annulled overnight. <br /><br />Basic Rights Oregon attorney  Margaret Olney notes that &quot;The Ninth Circuit found that the state&#39;s process had a &#39;minimal&#39; burden on plaintiffs&#39; rights.&quot; Additionally, Olney finds that the Court, while not directly discussing the issue, &quot;rejects plaintiffs&#39; fundamental premise &#8212; that they have a constitutionally protected right to have a genuine signature count.  The state&#39;s rules barring extrinsic evidence are entirely permissible; any other rule would impose a severe burden on the state.&quot; <br /><br />The harm that would come to these committed couples should the law be suspended or overturned was Basic Rights Oregon&#39;s greatest concern, and the reason that we intervened in the case.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php"><strong>L. Ali Khan</strong></a> [Professor, <a href="http://www.washburnlaw.edu/">Washburn University School of Law</a>]: &quot;Pakistan&#39;s ruling coalition has finally gathered the courage to impeach Pervez Musharraf who assumed and retained power as the Army Chief for over eight years in violation of the constitution. Musharraf&#39;s hold on power collapsed when he took off his military uniform and his political cronies lost the 2008 general elections. Like previous military generals, Musharraf too had a profound messianic complex to single-handedly save Pakistan from real and imagined enemies. Despite its great human and natural resources, Pakistan has remained a Third World country, partly because its civil and military leaders are narcissistic to the extent that they see law as a barrier to their self-assessed greatness to run complex affairs of the state.<br /><br />Musharraf will be fighting impeachment because he fears that his criminality would possibly take him to the gallows. In addition to subverting the constitution more than once, Musharraf has engaged in a series of serious crimes that no decent nation would forget or forgive. As an unaccountable army man, Musharraf imprisoned senior members of the judiciary and denied them salaries and basic necessities of life. This profound disrespect for law also contributed to the disappearance of hundreds of Pakistani citizens. In collusion with foreign intelligence agencies, Musharraf&#39;s men abducted men, women, and children and kept them incommunicado for years. Many were tortured. The &quot;war on terror&quot; mantra was so loud that nobody was willing to hear cries of the innocent and the vulnerable. <br /><br />The so-called war on terror unleashed an era of global criminality, in which many rulers became as lawless as were the terrorists. In this era, Pervez Musharraf stands shoulder to shoulder with other world-class criminals who resorted to blatant lawlessness and used the massive machinery of the state to detain, torture, and kill the innocent along with the guilty. Musharraf&#39;s impeachment and the exposure of his criminality would be the essential first step to begin a process of accountability in nations small and large.&quot;<br />

		<title>Hamdan verdict is not a &#034;victory&#034; for American justice</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/about_us/staff/colson_d.htm">Deborah Colson</a></span> [Senior Associate, Law &amp; Security Program, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/">Human Rights First</a>]: &quot;Last Wednesday, a panel of six military officers returned a <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/hamdan-found-guilty-by-guantanamo.php">split verdict</a> in the military commission trial of <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/inthecourts/supreme_court_hamdan.htm">Salim Hamdan</a>, convicting Mr. Hamdan of material support for terrorism but acquitting him of the more serious offense of conspiracy.  Mr. Hamdan acted as Osama bin Laden&#39;s driver, said the panel, but the government failed to prove his participation in an al-Qaeda conspiracy to attack the United States.  On Thursday, the same panelists sentenced Mr. Hamdan to 66 months in prison.  With credit for time already served, Mr. Hamdan will complete his sentence before the end of the year.<br /><br />The panel&#39;s verdict and sentence came as a surprise to many trial observers, and it was clearly meant to send a message:  the government&#39;s case against Mr. Hamdan was weak, and 5 1/2 years at Guantanamo for driving bin Laden around Afghanistan is quite enough.<br /><br />But Mr. Hamdan was not the only one on trial this month.  His was the first trial held at Guantanamo since the detention facility opened its doors nearly seven years ago, and it was widely viewed as a test case for the military commission system.<br /><br />So how did the system do?<br /><br />Supporters of the Bush administration are touting the trial as a major victory for the military commissions.  The panelists acted independently, supporters say, despite repeated allegations that the system is tainted by undue political influence.  &quot;That&#39;s the way a fair, open system works,&quot; said one prosecutor following the announcement of the sentence.  &quot;The sentence isn&#39;t always what the government asks for.&quot;<br /><br />That one panel of military officers performed its job admirably does not free the system of political influence.  Since 2004, at least four military commission prosecutors, including the former chief prosecutor, have resigned over concerns that the process is politicized.  Hamdan&#39;s defense counsel, Charles Swift, saw his military career falter after presenting a spirited challenge to the military commissions.  And defense motions to disqualify the system&#39;s chief legal advisor - a motion Mr. Hamdan&#39;s attorneys won several months ago - are now pending in multiple military commission cases.  <br /><br />Nor does the panel&#39;s effort to weigh the evidence carefully make the process fair.  In fact, Mr. Hamdan&#39;s trial exposed fundamental flaws in the military commission system long before the panel ever got its hands on the case. <br /><br />Relying on the <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.info/pdf/080515-USLS-military-commissions-act.pdf">Military Commissions Act of 2006</a> (MCA) [PDF], the judge permitted the government to introduce coerced evidence against Mr. Hamdan.  Though the judge excluded some of Mr. Hamdan&#39;s statements obtained following coercive interrogations at <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/etn/det_fac/bagram.htm">Bagram</a>, he admitted other statements extracted from Mr. Hamdan under abusive conditions at Guantanamo, conditions which included solitary confinement, sleep deprivation and sexual humiliation.  The use of coerced evidence is prohibited in ordinary criminal trials, a Constitutional ban which has been in effect for more than 200 years.<br /><br />And then there is the problem of retroactivity.  The military commissions were set up to try war crimes.  Mr. Hamdan was convicted of providing material support for terrorism, an offense that may violate federal criminal law, but has never been recognized as a crime under the laws of war.  Material support was codified as a war crime in the MCA, five years after Mr. Hamdan&#39;s capture.  Both the U.S. Constitution and international law prohibit such retroactive application of newly created crimes.<br /><br />Though it took almost seven years to arrive here, the first military commission trial is far from over.  Mr. Hamdan has the right to appeal, eventually all the way to the Supreme Court.  Given the system&#39;s profound flaws, he may well prevail.  Certainly the number and complexity of appellate issues will greatly exceed those that would have been the focus of appeal in a regular criminal court.<br /><br />By the time the final verdict comes in, Mr. Hamdan may have returned to Yemen, in which case he will probably no longer care.  Then again, he might care very much.  The government maintains it has the right to continue to detain Mr. Hamdan as an &quot;enemy combatant&quot; even after his sentence is complete.  Thus, despite the military panel&#39;s conclusion that Mr. Hamdan was just a small fish, he might still be in prison when his case finally reaches a civilian court. <br /><br />What does Mr. Hamdan&#39;s case mean for the rest of the military commission system?  Spurred on by its &quot;victory&quot; in Hamdan, the government will no doubt push hard to take at least several more cases to trial before the end of the year.<br /><br />Pressing on with more cases now will be a costly mistake.  Creating a system that openly and unapologetically rebukes internationally-recognized fair trial rights has already fueled the resentment of our enemies and friends alike, and it has served as a recruitment tool for al-Qaeda.  Maintaining that system now, despite a trial that reeked of unfairness, is similarly bad counterterrorism strategy.<br /><br />It will be up to the next administration to fix the military commission mess.  Fortunately, there is no need to reinvent the wheel.  The United States already has a criminal justice system that works - one that has brought some of the most serious terrorism cases to trial.  Ramzi Yousef was prosecuted in federal court.  So was Zacarias Moussaoui.  Even Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was indicted in federal court, five years prior to 2001.<br /><br />Transferring the Guantanamo cases to federal court will be challenging.  Prosecutors will need time to carefully review the evidence in each individual case.  Additional investigation might be required in some cases.  And the American public will have to accept the pretrial confinement of Guantanamo detainees on U.S. soil.  <br /><br />But it will be worth it.  The federal criminal justice system is capable of handling complex terrorism cases without compromising national security or sacrificing fair trial rights.  To restore integrity to the American justice system and repair our reputation as a nation committed to the rule of law, we must return to the system that has served us well for more than 200 years.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php"><strong>L. Ali Khan</strong></a> [Professor, <a href="http://www.washburnlaw.edu">Washburn University School of Law</a>]: &quot;It is all but certain that Pervez Musharraf - America&#39;s hireling who ordered disappearances and murdered scores of innocent men, women, and children to appease the Bush Administration&#39;s unquenchable thirst for Muslim blood - will <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/pakistan-assembly-votes-for-musharraf.php">soon step down</a> and relinquish a high seat of power that he had unlawfully occupied for more than eight years. <br /><br />The Bush administration, which itself has adopted utilitarian lawlessness at home and abroad to fight real and imagined terrorists, is working hard to find a safe exit for Musharraf. The U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan has met with the coalition leaders to demand immunity for crimes that Musharraf has committed against the judiciary and the peoples of Pakistan.<br /> <br />The Bush Administration&#39;s demand for Musharraf&#39;s immunity is contrary to the law of human rights, Pakistan&#39;s constitution, and American democratic values of accountability. No leader ought to be exempt from criminal liability. The holding of public office does not grant immunity from committing murder and torture. The peoples of the world would not allow high caste criminals to form a private club to protect each other from accountability and criminality. The people of Pakistan, just like the people of the United States, have every right to demand that their leaders while in office be accountable for high crimes and misdemeanors. Saving Musharraf sets a bad precedent. The people of Pakistan cannot grant safe exit to a well-known criminal.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Danilo Reyes</strong> [Philippines office, <a href="http://www.ahrchk.net/index.php">Asian Human Rights Commission</a>]: &quot;There was no final <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/philippines-resolves-regional-autonomy.php">peace agreement</a> signed yet. What the Government of the Philippines (GRP) and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) have agreed so far was the draft of the Memorandum of Agreement on Ancestral Domain (MOA-AD). The draft agreement, which would be the basis for the resumption of formal peace negotiations, contains stipulation from both parties which affirm the rights of the Bangsamoro People.<br /><br />However, on August 4, the Supreme Court (SC) issued a <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/philippines-high-court-blocks-signing.php">Temporary Restraining Order</a> (TRO), in granting the petition of local officials who challenge the legality of the agreement for reportedly not having been consulted and for the government representatives reportedly deliberately hiding and refusing to disclose the content of the draft agreement, arguing it is protected by the &quot;executive privilege.&quot; The SC&#39;s order prevented the government from signing on August 5. <br /><br />The SC required the government&#39;s lawyers to comment on the petition which would be the subject for deliberation by mid-August.<br /><br />What some local officials and their supporters are opposing is, in addition to a lack of consulation, the content of the agreement itself, which would become a basis for the creation of the Bangsamoro Juridical Entity (BJE). There are certain rights in the proposed BJE - for example, territorial rights and the foreign relations - that the observers argue violates the country&#39;s 1987 Constitution. <br /><br />The agreement itself could not be implemented in absence of a final peace agreement and an enabling law enacted by Congress; however, there were stipulations on matters of power and authority of the proposed BJE in the legal framework of the discussion on the ancestral domain that already implies it consisted of elements of the state.<br /><br />For example, the BJE&#39;s relationship with the Philippine government would become &quot;associative characterized by shared authority and responsibility.&quot; It is also empowered to establish its own institutions - for instance, the executive, legislative, judicial and administrative agencies. It would also be able to &quot;participate in the international meetings and events,&quot; as through ASEAN and UN agencies. It also has the power over foreign relations and entering into agreements though these should not used to &quot;aggress against the Government.&quot; <br /><br />They would also be given authority to build, develop and maintain police and internal security force, a judicial system and correctional institutions. They would have authority over exploration and profiting from natural resources, though accountable for sharing a percentage of proceeds with the government.<br /><br />The proposed BJE has set the existing <a href="http://www.armm.gov.ph/index.php?section=1">Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao</a> (ARMM), which was created following a final peace accord between the Government and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) in 1996, as the core of the Bangsamoro&#39;s homeland. It means, should a final peace agreement be reached and that a transitional government take place, it would become automatically covered by the authority of the proposed entity.<br /><br />In the transition from autonomy into an entity, there would be a Mission and an agency created to ensure its smooth transition in accordance with the provisions of the final peace agreement. The BJE would be governed by a Basic Law that is also yet to be created. All thts though would not happen anytime soon.<br /><br />Apart from that, the MILF proposed the inclusion of hundreds of other villages adjacent to the existing ARMM in a plebiscite to be conducted within 12 months following the signing of the draft agreement.  This plebiscite would determine the territory of the BJE and the affected villagers would vote whether or not they agree to be included in the proposed BJE. <br /><br />Though the principle of expanding the scope of the ARMM is no longer new since it has in fact been part of the Republic Act 9054, the BJE differs from the existing ARMM in the &quot;concept and principles&quot; of its powers and functions which is far greater than that of the already autonomous region. For example, in the Organic Act its authority does not cover matters involving foreign relations and entering into agreements with foreign countries. Their internal security and policing system as well remains part of the Philippine National Police (PNP).<br /><br />Their concern there is more than just an issue of local officials or affected villagers not having been consulted about the draft agreement; it is the right of the Bangsamoro people to be affirmed as &quot;First Nation&quot; there. The Bangsamoro people since time immemorial have fought hard for recognition of these rights, which also deserve reciprocation from the government, but in a way mutually acceptable to all.<br /><br />Thus, the proposed BJE is neither declaring itself, so far, as an independent state nor as the Philippine&#39;s version of China&#39;s &quot;one country two systems policy.&quot; It also differs from the principle of the existing autonomy already in place. Yet to implement governance and institutions that would satisfy the aspirations of the Bangsamoro people is even more contentious given the reality that the legal tradition and norms that have existed in these places had been inherited and heavy influenced historically from colonization.<br /><br />There remain many questions of how to transform this proposed entity to become part of the daily lives of all the people living there, including the non-Muslims, which need to be answered in a more realistic and practical way in our modern times. Thus, instead of speculation and presumptions - which are often born out of deep distrust and biased against one another - all parties should instead ensure an environment where rational discussion can take place.<br /><br />It is needless to inflame hatred and reopen the deep wounds by prematurely concluding what the agreement could bring even before it happens. Also, it is unacceptable to monger war or espouse a military offensive as options because it deepens distrust to both parties and deprives possibilities of rational discussion. No one has ever won in the continuing conflict in Mindanao. All are losers.&quot;<br />

		<title>Iran&#039;s end to stoning is welcome, but adultery should be decriminalized</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Farzana Hassan and Hasan Mahmud [President and Director, <a href="http://www.muslimcanadiancongress.org/">Muslim Canadian Congress</a>]: &quot;The Iranian government&#39;s decision to commute its earlier stoning sentence against four adults convicted of adultery is the right decision and a welcome move. It is also encouraging news that Iran has put a <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/iran-stops-use-of-stoning-as-method-of.php">moratorium</a> on such punishments, however, the nation must review its current laws on adultery with a view to eventually decriminalizing it as a capital offense. <br /><br />According to strict Islamic rules of testimony, the offense is extremely difficult to prove and is often highly prejudicial to women. This is borne out by the disproportionate number of women facing such convictions and executions in countries like Iran and Nigeria.  <br /><br />There is also much disparity in the treatment of men and women with respect to what constitutes adultery: a man may marry up to four wives concurrently. His multiple relationships enjoy religious sanction whereas women are denied similar opportunities under Sharia law. This disparity in opportunity immediately places women at an enormous disadvantage, both in society and under the law. Whereas men have the opportunity to express their adulterous urges under the cover of polygamy, a woman is immediately considered a transgressor when she enters into a sexual relationship with another man. Despite the inequalities in the religious rights of men and women, the punishment for adultery is the same for both. This is a blatant injustice and of itself necessitates a revisiting of laws on adultery and its prescribed punishments.<br /><br />The decriminalization of adultery is warranted for other reasons as well. First, there is no Quranic prescription on adultery that requires the guilty parties to be stoned to death. The recommended punishments for adultery in the Quran are flogging, confinement, &quot;half&quot; punishment for female slaves, as well as the option to repent after the commission of such  acts.  Stoning to death is based more on hadith or the oral traditions and precedents of the prophet, and only upon a full confession by the parties.<br /><br />The only known precedent of a sentence of adultery being carried out during the time of the prophet clearly indicates that the punishment was administered only after the man confessed to the offense thrice.<br /><br />The Quranic option to repent from conduct deemed sinful in Islam must be used as a basis to decriminalize adultery in Iran and wherever else it remains a capital offense. By criminalizing adultery and issuing death sentences after convictions, this option is denied to the &quot;transgressors&quot; - a course of action in clear violation of the Quran.&quot;<br />

		<title>Indicting Sudan&#039;s President Bashir is the practical and just option</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Chad Hazlett and Nina McMurry</strong> [Director of Protection; Advocacy Analyst, <a href="http://www.genocideintervention.net/">Genocide Intervention Network</a>]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/icc-prosecutor-condemns-sudan-war.php">debate continues</a> as to whether Sudan&#39;s President Omar al-Bashir should be offered a way out of a possible ICC indictment via Article 16 of the Rome Statute.  <br /><br />There are good reasons to worry that pursuing an indictment is a mistake. The first is that the situation is too fragile - that peacemaking or peacekeeping efforts will be too damaged by such an indictment. The second is that utilizing the potential for a deferral to force Bashir to do something to advance peace and security in Darfur - or at least to try the two officials already indicted in the Darfur case &#8212; is a better outcome than indicting him, particularly when it is not clear how or when he will be arrested. <br /> <br />Analyses that favor deferring an indictment on the basis of these concerns have generally dismissed arguments to go ahead with an indictment as impractically minded and willing to sacrifice peace for justice. However there are important practical reasons to allow justice to take its course. Also missing from the debate have been the voices of those with the greatest stake &#8212; the people of Darfur. <br /><br />The first practical argument to pursue the indictment is simply that the cost of an indictment may not be as high as feared. There is barely a peace process in place to be &quot;derailed,&quot; and under the status quo no effective protection force is able to deploy. Failing to hold those responsible accountable is not necessarily generating a better outcome than we might expect if we show Bashir and others that they will be held accountable.  The doomsday scenarios imagined prior to the indictment attempt have not occurred.  <br /><br />In fact, we have never seen Bashir more responsive to international demands for peace than he has appeared to be since the indictment was requested. This might suggest that a deferral could be leveraged to achieve a better outcome. But it also requires that such a deferral be offered only in return for meeting very strict and verifiable conditions. Many of the deals currently being discussed would fail to utilize the leverage of a deferral to its fullest possible extent. <br /><br />Even if a contingent deferral creates the leverage needed to achieve a real, effective deal on Darfur, we will still pay a cost for extending impunity for mass atrocities once again. This is not merely a long-term, theoretical concern about deterring future perpetrators &#8212; it applies within Sudan itself in the very near future. Bashir paid no price for atrocities committed during the war with South Sudan. If he pays no price for Darfur, there is no reason to expect he or others in the Sudanese government will refrain from using atrocities as a tool of political coercion or counterinsurgency in northern or eastern Sudan.  One would not be surprised to see violence break out on a massive scale in Merowe or Kajbar, or a resurgence of attacks in Abyei or other strategic areas. <br /><br />Finally, notwithstanding the value of these analyses, they neglect the perspective of the surviving victims of these crimes and potential victims of future atrocities. Darfurian civilians, both in Darfur and those now living in eastern Chad, have been overwhelmingly supportive of indicting Bashir.  While we know of no systematic survey on the topic as yet (several are in the works), those who have recently discussed the issue with displaced Darfurians report that they strongly favor indicting Bashir and argue that there cannot be peace before Bashir has been removed from power.  One recent report quoted a Darfurian refugee in eastern Chad: &quot;to people who say that delaying his arrest would give peace a chance, we say no - it would just give him more chances to kill.&quot; Another asserted that, &quot;Omar al Bashir must be taken to the court immediately. It is our demand.&quot;   <br /><br />The argument of Darfurians expressed here is also a practical one &#8212; they are not demanding justice for justice&#39;s sake, but because they believe peace and security in Sudan depend on it. One may fairly worry that if an indictment is made, we will still fail to make an arrest in the foreseeable future, thus making a contingent deferral a more &quot;practical&quot; option. On the other hand, an indictment is costly to Bashir even if an arrest cannot be executed. But more fundamentally, finding a way to make the arrest is our next challenge, not a reason to forego a move towards an international system of justice that actually works.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Andy Whitmore</span> [Communications and Research Worker, <a href="http://www.piplinks.org/">Philippine Indigenous Peoples Links</a>]: &quot;On the <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/un-celebrates-adopting-declaration-on.php">fourteenth International Day of the World&#39;s Indigenous People</a>, it is right that we celebrate last September&#39;s adoption of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People as an historic event for the worldwide movement of indigenous peoples that has arisen to seek redress for the serious denial of rights, discrimination and abuse that everywhere confronts them.<br /><br />The Declaration is an important step on a long journey by Indigenous Peoples to gain recognition and support from the international community to overcome the many remaining serious problems they face. But the existence of improved standards does not alone solve the fundamental problems. In the Philippines, where we mainly work, there are many provisions to protect Indigenous Peoples&#39; rights contained, to a lesser or greater degree, in the 1987 Constitution and the 1997 Indigenous Peoples Rights Act. Yet despite this legal framework many abuses continue, with widespread abuse and erosion of the provisions of the Philippine Indigenous Peoples Rights Act.<br /><br />The nominal recognition of rights in the UN does not signal an end to the problems. It does however offer new tools and opportunities. Companies and corrupt officials will still look for the wealth contained within indigenous ancestral lands. Yet what will determine the ability of Indigenous Peoples to exercise their rights to protect their lands is the extent to which they can assert their recognized rights.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Bonnie Docherty</strong> [Researcher, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a>]: &quot;Russia has not only caused civilian casualties with <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/russia-dropped-cluster-bombs-on-georgia.php">its use of cluster munitions in Georgia</a>, but it has also blatantly disregarded the international decision to ban the weapons. In the process, Russia has demonstrated that states around the world cannot become complacent about the <a href="http://www.clusterconvention.org/uploads/ccm77_english-final-text.pdf">Convention on Cluster Munitions</a>, which 107 of them adopted in May. They must sign and ratify the treaty as soon as possible so that its obligations enter into force and its stigmatization power grows.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2008/08/14/georgi19625.htm">Russian cluster bombs killed eleven civilians</a> and injured dozens more in two air strikes on August 12, 2008, according to Human Rights Watch. Some survivors suffered massive trauma to their abdomens and limbs. Two foreign journalists were among the casualties. Cluster munitions - large weapons containing dozens or hundreds of smaller submunition - endanger civilians because of both their broad area effect and the large number of explosive duds they leave behind. Photographs show local residents handling duds from these strikes so, without risk education, additional casualties are sure to occur. Furthermore, Russia is believed to have hundreds of millions of stockpiled submunitions, which it could use at any time if left unchecked. Georgia also stockpiles the weapons. The casualties reported in Georgia so far and the potential for so many more are reminders of the need for a treaty that bans cluster munitions. <br /><br />The Convention on Cluster Munitions is the best tool for preventing future harm. It prohibits the use, production, stockpiling, and transfer of the weapons and establishes important remedial obligations such as victim assistance and clearance. Once the treaty enters into force, upon thirty ratifications or accessions, it will prohibit state parties from launching strikes like those launched by Russia. It will also require stockpile destruction within eight years. States committed to ending the humanitarian harm of cluster munitions, like that which occurred in Georgia, should join the Convention on Cluster Munitions as soon as possible. <br /><br />Although cynics argue that military powers, including Russia, will not ratify or accede to the convention, even those states can be influenced by its provisions. The Mine Ban Treaty shows that the stigma of a weapons treaty can be powerful. China and the United States are not party to the Mine Ban Treaty, but they have not used mines since that treaty took effect. The Convention on Cluster Munitions should have a similar impact if states widely join it. It was already adopted by more than 100 states, including large numbers of users, producers, and stockpilers of cluster munitions. By signing and ratifying the treaty, those states can signal to Russia and others that use of these weapons is considered internationally unacceptable as well as unlawful. <br /><br />States should condemn Russia&#39;s attacks on Georgia and call on both sides of that conflict not to make further use of their stocks of cluster munitions. Otherwise they tacitly support Russia&#39;s conduct. States must also, however, take steps of their own to help ensure there are not future casualties. In particular they must publicly pledge to sign the Convention on Cluster Munitions in Oslo in December and to ratify the new instrument as soon as possible after that. Russia&#39;s attacks should provide the international community an impetus for action.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.cdt.org/staff/lharris.php"><strong>Leslie Harris</strong></a> [President and Chief Executive Officer, <a href="http://www.cdt.org/">Center for Democracy and Technology</a>]: &quot;The Department of Justice has properly agreed to a <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/senate-judiciary-committee-calls-for.php">request from Senators Specter and Leahy</a> that it delay release of new Attorney General <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/guidance_on_race.htm">Guidelines</a> that govern FBI criminal and intelligence investigations.  <br /><br />The new Guidelines would reportedly weaken the standards in existing Guidelines for use of some intrusive investigative techniques.  Currently, the FBI has to have &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; of criminality to open a full criminal investigation and it has to have some kind of a lead to start a preliminary inquiry - sort of a mini-investigation to run down the lead and decide whether to open a full criminal investigation.  According to recent reports, the new Guidelines would permit the FBI to conduct an &quot;assessment&quot; of possible criminal activity or a threat to national security without having any lead at all.  While doing that &quot;assessment,&quot; FBI agents would be empowered to use investigative techniques that had previously been reserved for full investigations and preliminary inquiries when there was evidence of crime:  the agents could follow a person around, question friends and business colleagues about the person (and misrepresent themselves as persons other than FBI agents while conducting those interviews), and recruit secret informants to provide information about the person and his or her activities.<br /><br />If these reports are true, the new AG Guidelines permit conduct the original AG Guidelines were supposed to prevent:  investigation of people without an adequate predicate.  They would leave room for all sorts of mischief such as spying on people like civil rights leaders based more on their political beliefs than on evidence of crime.  As a result, they could divert scarce law enforcement resources from following up on leads and dedicate them to following up on Quakers, peace activists and other dissenters.  This kind of guidance is no guidance at all.<br /><br />Moreover, adoption now of such permissive Guidelines would hand the next President yet another problem to straighten out, in addition to ending a war, solving the energy crisis, and getting the economy back on track.  DOJ properly agreed to hold off on issuing new Guidelines until after FBI Director Muller testifies at an oversight hearing on September 17.  September 17 is Constitution Day - the 221st anniversary of the signing of the U.S. Constitution.  Now, it&#39;s up to Congress to use the hearing to send a message to the Attorney General that any change in the Guidelines governing FBI investigations should respect the Constitution by ensuring that investigative resources Congress has provided to the FBI be focused on criminals and terrorists, not on everyone else.&quot;<br />

		<title>Sexual harassment policies can survive free speech challenge after DeJohn ruling</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Angie Perone</strong> [Attorney, <a href="http://www.equalrights.org/">Equal Rights Advocates</a>]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/third-circuit-rules-university-sexual.php">Third Circuit&#39;s recent decision </a>in <u>DeJohn v. Temple University</u> did not crumble important protections for students and workers in a school setting.  The Court&#39;s conclusion that Temple University&#39;s sexual harassment policy was unconstitutional was based on the policy&#39;s failure to include particular language already embedded in federal law. <br /><br />Free speech is not absolute.  For example, the government can regulate speech if it consists of fighting words, threats of violence, or lewd and obscene speech.  Various forms of sexual harassment can fall under these categories.  Moreover, as noted by the Third Circuit itself, sexual harassment consisting of non-expressive, physically harassing conduct receives no free speech protection.  Sexual harassment policies can still survive a free speech challenge after <u>DeJohn</u>.  <br /><br />The Third Circuit found Temple University&#39;s policy facially overbroad because it lacked language that the conduct must be severe or pervasive.  This requirement mirrors current federal law as dictated by the United States Supreme Court.  In <u>Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson</u>, 477 U.S. 57, 67 (1986), the United States Supreme Court concluded that for sexual harassment to be actionable, it must include conduct that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the condition of the victim&#39;s employment and create an abusive work environment.  The Supreme Court required the same showing of &quot;severe or pervasive&quot; conduct to sexual harassment claims in schools in <u>Davis Next Friend LaShonda D. v. Monroe County Board of Education</u>, 526 U.S. 629, 633 (1999).  <br /><br />Temple University&#39;s sexual harassment policy failed to include any language indicating that the policy prohibited conduct that was sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile environment.  In January 2007, Temple University amended its policy to include this language.  Based on the Third Circuit&#39;s own language, Temple&#39;s modification saves its new policy from a similar constitutional challenge as in <u>DeJohn</u>. <br /><br />While Temple&#39;s original policy can be criticized for lacking the magical words of &quot;severe or pervasive,&quot; the original policy&#39;s language echoes language in the <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> (EEOC) Guidelines for Discrimination Because of Sex.  The EEOC Guidelines make no mention of any requirement that the conduct be &quot;severe or pervasive.&quot;  29 C.F.R. &Acirc;&sect; 1604.11.  The Third Circuit put great weight on the fact that Temple&#39;s sexual harassment policy would have restricted speech on adult students at a college campus.  The Court indicated that it must proceed with greater caution in such a university setting for fear that a broad policy would stunt academic freedom.  While the EEOC Guidelines apply to workers in employment situations, courts addressing sexual harassment in school settings regularly rely on Title VII cases, which are within the EEOC&#39;s jurisdiction.  Thus, while the Third Circuit&#39;s ruling in <u>DeJohn</u> did not necessarily create new law, its ruling suggests that the EEOC modify its guidelines to include language that conduct must be &quot;severe or pervasive.&quot; <br /><br />Interestingly enough, the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/index.html">Office for Civil Rights </a>(OCR), which investigates sexual harassment complaints in schools under Title IX, includes the language &quot;severe or pervasive&quot; in its Sexual Harassment Guidance of 1997.  Since the Office for Civil Rights serves as a better guide for schools, Temple University should have lifted language from OCR as opposed to the EEOC.  Nevertheless, its modified sexual harassment policy cures this defect. <br /><br />The Third Circuit&#39;s <u>DeJohn</u> decision did not eliminate any rights for students or employees in academic institutions.  In fact, the Court recognized that a school has a compelling interest in preventing harassment.  Instead, the Court aimed to teach an important lesson of inclusion to academic institutions of higher learning.  At the very least, after <u>DeJohn</u>, universities should include the magical words of &quot;severe or pervasive&quot; in their sexual harassment policy.  For Temple University, this was one expensive and time-consuming lesson, but nonetheless, a lesson learned.&quot;<br />

The Georgian-South Ossetian 'border' was porous, black market trading between Georgia and Russia via South Ossetia took place in the open, and it was not unusual to hear Georgian spoken in the streets of Tskhinvali. Confidence building measures such as joint patrols between Georgians, Ossetians and Russians were in place and there were some tentative, small scale efforts at return for displaced persons forced to flee after the 1991/1992 conflict. However, the issues stemming from the conflict of the early 1990s were only frozen and never resolved during this period. Georgia has strenuously insisted on its territorial integrity (South Ossetia had been part of the Georgian Socialist Republic) since the breakup of the Soviet Union and this has been backed by the international community, including through the vehicle of United Nations Security Council resolutions. President Saakashvili's calls for Georgia's reunification &#8212; by force if necessary &#8212; have grown louder since his 2004 election. <br /><br />Yet, over a decade and a half of de facto independence, South Ossetians have built up the institutions of a microstate &#8212; with a parliament, courts and even at least one fairish presidential election. President Saakashvili has portrayed South Ossetia as simply a stooge for Moscow. This is, as so much of the rhetoric of the last few weeks, a half truth. While it is true that South Ossetians look to Russia for protection, this is the reality of living in an unrecognised and threatened mini-republic. Russian protection &#8212; and ultimately absorption into the Russian Federation &#8212; is seen as simply the best available option by the vast majority of ethnic Ossetians in the Tskhinvali region. Thus there are questions of self-determination which potentially clash with Georgia's claim to territorial integrity. <br /><br />It should quickly be noted, however, that South Ossetians were not a people facing a colonial-like oppression under Georgian suzerainty before 1991/1992; indeed, Georgians and Ossetians lived quite peacefully together before the conflict, albeit with occasional ethno-political tension. Further, the roughly 10,000 ethnic Georgian internally displaced persons from South Ossetia (whose ranks have now been joined by people displaced by this latest fighting), many still residing in collective centres in Georgia proper, are adamant that they be given an effective right to return and that the region remain Georgian. Clearly there are live legal and policy questions on the territorial integrity/self-determination axis, including parallels to Kosovo's experience. <br /><br />Rather than South Ossetia's independence bid, however, what I want to focus on here is the use of force. And, specifically, Russia's use of force in Georgia outside of South Ossetia, since in my view it represents a situation which is not only legally troubling but troubling for its humanitarian and geopolitical dimensions. This is not to deny that Georgia's international legal and political commitments may have been breached through its armed attack on Tskhinvali. Even though it was seeking to restore its own territorial integrity and was therefore not in obvious breach of the basic Charter prohibition on the use of force, Saakashvili's reckless attack on Russian-protected Tskhinvali represents a failure to resolve through peaceful means what has been since 1991/1992 an internationalised dispute. But, quite simply, the Georgian and Russian actions are on altogether different scales. Russia aggressively took this conflict well out of the original conflict zone.<br /><br />Russia's primary legal justification for its actions appears to rest on the defence of its nationals, with the vast majority of South Ossetians holding Russian passports. While a state's citizenship policy is generally not a matter of public international law, the wholesale and in many cases purely extra-territorial granting of passports to the citizens of a disputed breakaway region where Russia seeks influence is self-serving and, in large measure, a sham (though one cannot blame individual South Ossetians for seeking the passports in order to pursue study, work and travel opportunities). Furthermore, the extent to which protection of nationals abroad comes within the ambit of legitimate self-defence is controversial at best. Most uses of force in protection of nationals abroad have been considered unlawful and, as in the case of the US invasion of Grenada, mere pretexts for intervention. <br /><br />Even assuming that Russia has a legitimate self-defence claim on the basis of protection of nationals abroad (and Russia might have had a stronger claim if it simply cited defence of its peacekeepers and fidelity to their 1992 mandate, albeit a mandate in which in its present form Georgian consent had effectively been withdrawn), its actions have exceeded the well-known customary international law requirements of necessity and proportionality. In attacking far beyond the conflict zone, in both Western Georgia and as far south as the capital Tbilisi, at least by air, Russia can have no plausible claim to self-defence. Indeed the Russian President's claim that 'the aggressors have now been punished' is strong evidence that Russia has engaged in punitive reprisals rather than self-defence. This is especially clear in that Russian incursions continued well after Georgia had agreed to ceasefire conditions and started withdrawing troops from the original conflict area. Quite reasonably, it seems to me, Russia's actions have sent a chill through other areas of the former Soviet Union which Russia has long considered its 'near abroad.'<br /><br />Finally, it is worth noting that there have been reports of direct attacks on civilians as well as looting and pillaging of civilian property. Both sides have also accused each other of ethnic cleansing, a claim that will be judicially tested before the European Court of Human Rights as well as through Georgia's claim before the International Court of Justice on the basis of the International Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. And, as Georgia is a party to the International Criminal Court, there is a territorial link to the court's jurisdiction which may ultimately result in indictments against individuals. Like Iraq in 2003, this conflict represents a blow to the rule of law in international affairs. However, with international insistence on state responsibility and individual criminal accountability the issue does not have to end when the violence in Georgia (ongoing apparently despite pledges to the contrary) does.<br /><br /><br /><em>Christopher Waters is a professor at the University of Windsor Faculty of Law.

It also spawns political cronyism, allowing politicians to freely broker power relations, distribute ministries and governmental offices on the basis of connection rather than competence and, for the worse, use state resources to advance personal and family interests. <br /><br />The competing model, which Pakistan&#39;s generals as well as American policymakers prefer, institutes a strong presidency - a praetorian presidency - that listens to the armed forces and kow-tows to American interests. Under the praetorian model, the President exercises formidable powers, appoints heads of the armed forces, and can dissolve dysfunctional or discordant elected assemblies. Even the judiciary is made subservient to the President. The praetorian presidency empowers what Pakistanis call the establishment&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;a congregation of bureaucrats, army generals, advisers, and experts. The praetorian presidency focuses on economy and foreign relations. But it alienates political forces and weakens elected assemblies.  Consequently, corruption permeates the state machinery with little or no accountability.<br /><br />The nomination of Asif Zardari, the widower of assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, to contest the presidential election is a disturbing development. If elected, President Zardari would further muddle the models of presidency. Zardari might not use the iron hand of praetorian presidency, as did General Pervez Musharraf, to please the establishment and foreign masters. Under no circumstance, however, will Zardari be the ceremonial president. <br /><br /><strong>Ceremonial Presidency</strong><br /><br />The ceremonial presidency works best when the president is a non-political, consensus figure enjoying the trust of major political parties. Ideally, the ceremonial president is a person of great stature, unimpeachable character, and favorable reputation. The ceremonial president must not be the head of any political party, nor must the ceremonial president be ideologically inclined toward a certain foreign policy, domestic agenda, or political set up. This apparent neutrality of the ceremonial presidency generates confidence among political forces that the state is open to political diversity and pluralism. <br /><br />Zardari does not qualify to be a ceremonial president. Though many criminal cases filed against Zardari were fabricated, his reputation is sullied with charges of corruption. His recent conduct to make and break political accords regarding the restoration of judges also leaves the impression that Zardari equates the art of politics with amoral cunningness rather than tough bargaining over controversial issues.<br /><br />Furthermore, Zardari is politically too powerful to be a ceremonial president. He is the co-chairman of Pakistan People&#39;s Party (PPP), the party in power. The other chairman is Zardari&#39;s own son. This family hold on the rank and file of the PPP will continue to exist even if Zardari resigns from co-chairmanship. Furthermore, the Prime Minister, a member of the PPP, is unlikely to challenge President Zardari on the theory that the Prime Minster has the constitutional powers to run the country. For all practical purposes, therefore, Zardari will run the country as the top man even if the praetorian presidency is constitutionally dismantled. <br /><br /><strong>Praetorian Presidency</strong><br /><br />In opposing Musharraf, the PPP was planning to introduce a complex constitutional package in the parliament to cut down powers of the praetorian presidency. Almost all political parties favor restoring the constitution to its formulaic format. This political consensus will now fall apart. If Zardari is elected to be the president, the PPP would most likely withdraw the constitutional package. The constitution, as it stands, confers huge powers on the president. Zardari would want to retain these powers in case the political tide turns against him or the PPP. <br /><br />Even the United States would prefer that the constitution remains as is, and that the praetorian presidency is not weakened. It is easier for the U.S. to deal with one strong man at the top than with an elected parliament accountable to the people. The U.S. can fight the war in Afghanistan more effectively if Pakistan furnishes its intelligence and armed resources to defeat the Taliban and foreign fighters. Pakistan&#39;s praetorian presidency can deliver these resources to satisfy U.S. interests in the region, including the pressure on Iran. Zardari, a powerful man who cannot overcome the reputation of being a crook, is a godsend for the U.S. In the past, the U.S. has deftly exploited praetorian characters, such as Manual Noriega, Saddam Hussein, the Shah of Iran, and Pervez Musharraf, for its global interests.<br /><br /><strong>Pakistan under Zardari</strong><br /><br />Regardless of whether the constitution is restored to ceremonial presidency, Pakistan is in for a rough ride under Zardari. Now that the coalition has split, Zardari&#39;s personal character will be politicized, highlighting his past criminal record. A sullied civilian president will diminish the nation&#39;s confidence in political rule. The insurgents in Pakistan&#39;s tribal areas will intensify their battle against the government, increasing suicide bombings.  The war in Afghanistan will spill over the border into Pakistan, as the U.S. daringly strikes the terrorist infrastructure on both sides of the border. Engaged in inter-personal politics, the government will have little time to solve the nation&#39;s basic problems, including shortages of electricity, fuel, and clean water. <br /><br /><br /><em>Ali Khan is professor of law at Washburn University School of Law in Topeka, Kansas, and the author of the book, <em>A Theory of Universal Democracy</em> (2003).

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.northwestern.edu/faculty/profiles/DavidScheffer/">David Scheffer</a>, who formerly led the US delegation in UN talks creating the International Criminal Court (ICC) and is now at Northwestern University School of Law, recalls the original intent behind Article 16 of the Rome Statute of the ICC as the UN Security Council deliberates what to do about the ICC Prosecutor&#39;s application for an arrest warrant against Sudan President Omar Hassan al-Bashir for genocide and other atrocity crimes in Darfur&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; ...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/davidscheffernew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2 alt="photo by Jim Ziv"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he United Nations Security Council is struggling with how to manage the political, military, and judicial complexities of the situation in Darfur. But the debate within the Council appears to be overlooking a central reality that this essay seeks to explain.<br /><br />At the center of the Security Council's deliberations on Darfur since mid-July has been the application by Luis Moreno-Ocampo, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), for an arrest warrant on charges of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes against President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan. ICC judges are reviewing the evidence presented by Mr. Moreno-Ocampo and their decision whether to issue an arrest warrant is pending, with September or October as possible dates for the much-anticipated reckoning. <br /><br />In the meantime, the Security Council has split between those members willing to permit justice to run its course against President Bashir and those members seeking to derail Mr. Moreno-Ocampo's move against the Sudanese leader. The effort to thwart prosecution is for the ostensible purposes of advancing peace objectives in Darfur and protecting the safety of U.N. and African Union peacekeeping forces (UNAMID) and international humanitarian aid workers with a presumably more compliant President Bashir who would be liberated from judicial accountability.<br /><br />The United States sought vainly to exclude from Security Council Resolution 1828, which finally was adopted over a U.S. abstention on July 31, 2008, language suggesting a link between the ICC's investigation of President Bashir and the renewal of the peacekeeping mandate in Darfur for another year. In the end, UNSC Resolution 1828 included preambular language, which the United States objected to, that reads, "Taking note of the African Union (AU) communiqu&Atilde;&copy; of the 142nd Peace and Security Council (PSC) Meeting dated 21 July (S/2008/481, annex), having in mind concerns raised by members of the Council regarding potential developments subsequent to the application by the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court of 14 July 2008, and taking note of their intention to consider these matters further...". This is code language to suggest, rather strongly, that the Security Council will consider acting consistent with Article 16 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court to suspend the ICC's investigation or prosecution of President Bashir (and perhaps other Sudanese government officials and Janjaweed tribal leaders) for at least one year in the belief that such a decision will improve the chances for peace initiatives and full and safe deployment of UNAMID and humanitarian workers in Darfur. That is a fair concern but it is also rolling the dice with an individual whose track record is deplorable.<br /><br />Article 16 of the Rome Statute immediately follows several provisions in that treaty (Articles 13-15) establishing how situations can be referred to the ICC for investigation. Titled, "Deferral of investigation or prosecution," Article 16 reads, "No investigation or prosecution can be commenced or proceeded with under this Statute for a period of 12 months after the Security Council, in a resolution adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, has requested the Court to that effect; that request may be renewed by the Council under the same conditions." The negotiating history of Article 16 should be instructive to how the Council currently examines the Darfur situation.<br /><br />When I led the United States delegation in the U.N. talks during the 1990's which culminated in the Rome Statute and its Rules of Procedure and Evidence and Elements of Crimes, negotiators were acutely aware of how Article 16 originated and why the Republic of Singapore introduced it as a compromise provision during the negotiations. The Singapore delegation acted when it became clear that the U.S. position on referrals to the ICC would not be acceptable to a large number of governments. Our position was that referrals could only be made by the Security Council or by a State Party to the Rome Statute provided, in the latter instance, that if the Security Council already was seized with the referred situation, the Council would have to consent before the Court could commence investigation of it. <br /><br />The U.S. position did not attract sufficient support, as many governments wanted, in addition to the Security Council referral option, an unfettered right of State Party referral and a right for the prosecutor independently to refer situations to the Court (the final text of Article 15 requires the Prosecutor to obtain the approval of the Pre-Trial Chamber before any investigation could commence). Many of the current members of the Security Council advocated this broader referral procedure.<br /><br />Singapore's compromise was grounded in how to address the problem of initial referral of situations to the Court (in other words, the sticky U.S. position), and Article 16 was negotiated and drafted with that issue paramount in the minds of the negotiators. The original intent underpinning Article 16 was to grant the Security Council power to suspend investigation or prosecution of situations <u>before either is launched</u> if priorities of peace and security compelled a delay of international justice. This conformed with the spirit of the compromise, namely that if the Security Council cannot fully control the referral of situations to the ICC, then at least the Council can block the ICC from marching down the investigatory path at the request of a State Party or the Prosecutor provided sufficient votes can be obtained, absent a veto, under a Chapter VII resolution. <br /><br />The negotiators' focus was on situations referred by a <u>State Party</u> or the Prosecutor, not by the <u>Security Council</u>. It would have been very odd to argue we need Article 16 as a check on Security Council referrals. Recognizing, as did other governments, the utility of Article 16's brake on premature State Party or Prosecutor referrals, the U.S. delegation supported incorporation of Article 16 in the Rome Statute.<br /><br />I seriously doubt one would find anywhere in the <em>travaux preparatoires</em> of Article 16 of the Rome Statute, and as a key negotiator of it I do not recall any discussion whatsoever among my colleagues, anticipating the kind of scenario that confronts us today with President Bashir. First, the Security Council, acting consistent with Article 13(b) of the Rome Statute, referred Darfur under Chapter VII authority to the ICC several years ago. That is precisely the referral procedure originally favored by the United States and by Russia and China for all referrals to the Court. It would have astonished my colleagues and me in 1997 and 1998 to be told that Article 16, which was conceived as a compromise procedure to use at the infancy of a situation before the ICC, would be applied some day to short-circuit a Security Council referral lodged more than three years ago and years after the Prosecutor has initiated his investigation pursuant to such referral (March 31, 2005) and obtained arrest warrants 16
 months earlier against high-level alleged perpetrators who remain at large (Ahmed Harun and Ali Kushayb in April 2007), as well as completed a multi-year investigation of perhaps the leading alleged perpetrator and applied for an arrest warrant (against President Bashir in July 2008). If that scenario had been presented to the negotiators more than a decade ago, Article 16 never would have been approved by the vast majority of governments attending the U.N. talks on the Rome Statute for it would have been viewed as creating rights for the Security Council far beyond the original intent of the Singapore compromise.<br /><br />Furthermore, if we had contemplated this novel scenario, there would have been exhaustive discussions over many months to determine how to handle well-developed cases and investigatory matters during the suspension period. What happens to outstanding arrest warrants? How is evidence preserved? How would tracking and protection of witnesses be handled? How does the Court handle the due process rights of individuals already in custody and those standing trial? What funds can the Prosecutor expend on the referred situation during the suspension period? How do the ICC judges handle motions by defense counsel during this period? What happens to on-going trials which, even if not technically suspended by the Council's resolution, could be seriously impaired by suspension of investigatory work in other areas of the atrocity situation? None of these critical questions were even raised, much less considered by the negotiators. The reason is that the original intent behind Article 16 was for the Security Council to act pre-emptively to delay the application of international justice for atrocity crimes in a particular situation in order to focus exclusively on performing the Council's mandated responsibilities for international peace and security objectives.<br /><br />Nonetheless, one plausibly may argue that the language of Article 16 of the Rome Statute technically empowers the Security Council to intervene at this late date and block approval of an arrest warrant against President Bashir or even suspend its execution following any approval of it by the judges. Such technically manipulative reading of Article 16 facilitated the American initiative early in the Bush Administration to insist on operative language in Security Council Resolutions 1422 (2002) and 1487 (2003) immunizing peacekeeping personnel drawn from non-party States to the Rome Statute from investigation or prosecution before the ICC for at least 12 months. At the time, many, including myself, regarded this as a distorted reading of Article 16, which was never intended to serve as a generic impunity carve-out for vast categories of participants in unknown future military operations and atrocity situations. I recall vividly the outrage of many European governments and others at how the United States bulldozed through the Security Council in the summers of 2002 and 2003 an arguably correct but deeply distorted reading of Article 16. One wonders where that outrage is today for Darfur, where atrocity crimes continue to devastate its population and villages while President Bashir uses every trick in the book to intimidate the Security Council into crippling the vital work of the ICC, a mission which the Council itself mandated in 2005.<br /><br />Security Council members should neither reverse their own commitment to international justice in Darfur nor defy the original intent behind the Article 16 power that is available to the Council under the Rome Statute.<br /><br /><br /><br /><em>David Scheffer is the Mayer Brown/Robert A.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Scot Ross</strong> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.onewisconsinnow.org">One Wisconsin Now</a>]: &quot;Wisconsin Republican Attorney General JB Van Hollen, the co-chair of the John McCain for President campaign, <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/wisconsin-elections-agency-says-id.php">filed a lawsuit last week</a> against the state&#39;s Government Accountability Board (GAB) to require crosschecking of all new voters registered by mail against driver&#39;s license and Social Security records all the way back to January 1, 2006. Van Hollen claims he is doing so under the requirements of the federal <a href="http://www.fec.gov/hava/law_ext.txt">Help America Vote Act</a>, but as the law is written - Wisconsin is meeting its requirements.<br /> <br />Van Hollen&#39;s partisan suit would remove those voters from the rolls and could result in them having to file a provisional ballot. HAVA specifically notes that no action to a voter who fails the match is required. Most of the differences come from minor clerical errors and do in no way compromise the integrity of our elections. In addition, municipal clerks from across Wisconsin report that meeting this new &quot;Van Hollen standard&quot; could affect over 1 million records and voters. They told the GAB the time spent reprocessing these minor clerical errors will prevent them from, among other things, processing absentee ballots for Wisconsin soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan.<br /> <br />GAB&#39;s outside counsel, hired at taxpayer expense, has asked that Van Hollen be removed from the case because he is currently GAB&#39;s attorney in an unrelated case. The case will be heard before Dane County Circuit Court Judge Maryann Sumi this Thursday. When Van Hollen announced in August that he would serve as the co-chair of the McCain for President Wisconsin Campaign, he wrote in a newsletter to campaign supporters, &quot;I&#39;m honored to help lead John McCain&#39;s Wisconsin campaign, and I&#39;m looking forward to his victory in November.&quot; This record of political partisanship puts Van Hollen&#39;s motives in filing suit against the GAB into question.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Baseer Naweed</strong> [Senior Researcher, South Asia Desk, <a href="http://www.ahrchk.net/index.php">Asian Human Rights Commission</a>]: &quot;The lawyer&#39;s movement for the <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/pakistan-chief-justice-swears-in-4-more.php">restoration of judges and the independence of the judiciary</a> has continued in spite the Pakistani government&#39;s illegal and unconstitutional handling of the issue of deposed judges. The government first made false promises for the restoration of judiciary as part of their election campaign of November 2, 2007. Trapped by these promises the government then announced a &quot;constitutional package&quot; for the restoration of the deposed judiciary and asked all the parties in the elected houses to support it. However, even after several months none of the parties have taken serious notice of the constitutional package. The law minister, Mr. Farooq Naik, has said that the judiciary cannot be restored unconstitutionally and therefore, the best way forward is to introduce a constitutional package. Restoration through the National Assembly by means of a simple resolution would be unconstitutional. <br /><br />When the government did not receive a favourable response from the political parties and civil society on the &quot;constitutional package&quot; they then tried the stick and carrot method by ignoring all constitutional means, saying that the elected government cannot adopt unconstitutional methods. Thanks to the power delivered from a military dictator, the law minister, with a pat on the back from President Asif Zardari, used the same technique that Musharraf used in handling the judiciary. Keeping the general&#39;s appointed judges at their existing positions, the government re-appointed deposed judges who were at the forefront in the movement against military dictatorship. The civilian rulers were more difficult than the general had been in dealing with judiciary. A new method was introduced to restore the deposed judiciary which was to re-appoint judges on their previous position, according to their seniority and continuation of the job from the real date of appointment. This will create another problem in the judiciary when judges fight for their positions. <br /><br />Almost all the deposed judges have been re-appointed by the government, but still te the &quot;judicial crisis&quot; remains unresolved and will continue to haunt the elected government throughout its whole term of five years. The minus one formula, a bullying attempt by the Zardari government to isolate the deposed chief justice Mr. Iftekhar Choudhry from his comrades, has worked so far, but how to overpower the crisis in the judiciary is something which will hamper all efforts to tame the judiciary according to the wishes of President Zardari who has an open agenda against the judges who had not provided him relief during his 11 years in jail. The chief justice, Mr. Iftekhar Choudhry, is the one who had not provided relief to Mr. Zardari when he was asked in 2005. <br /><br />The country therefore has two chief justices, one appointed by General Musharraf during his state of emergency and the other one who was restored by the decision of the Supreme Court on July 20, 2007, and was deposed by the General. The main question before the government is how to cope with the situation and handle two chief justices of the country at the same time. <br /><br />If Mr. Iftekhar Choudhry was left alone by government&#39;s maneuverings, even then the judicial crisis will not be settled until and unless he resigns or is terminated from his position by the supreme judicial council. It is a disturbing factor for the Zardari government that Mr. Iftekhar Choudhry will never resign and has announced several times that he will not take any fresh oath for his reappointment. If the government terminates him from the post of chief justice then it has to send the case before the supreme judicial council, a constitutional forum for the appointment or termination of judges of the Supreme Court. Then the same situation will come again as it was faced by the Musharraf government when Justice Choudhry was suspended on March 9, 2007, and he was referred to the supreme judicial council. It was from that point that the lawyers&#39; movement started and has continued.<br /><br />The re-appointment of the judges, rather than their restoration, has also created a new judicial crisis. According to the famous &quot;Judges Case of 1996,&quot; no acting chief justice can appoint, re-appoint, or terminate the judges of the supreme court. Since Mr. Abdul Hameed Dogar, Musharraf&#39;s chief justice, was appointed in the absence of Mr. Iftekhar Choudhry and he has not been terminated nor demoted, Justice Iftekhar Choudhry will remain as the chief justice of Pakistan. So, in his absence any decision to re-appoint will be illegal and unconstitutional.<br /><br />On the very first day of the new parliament, premier Mr. Syed Yosuf Raza Gillani stated that those who were judges till November 3, 2007 are all free and have been accepted as judges, which means that deposed judges are neither fired nor retired, but are the sitting judges, and therefore without the consent of chief justice Choudhry, re-appointment of the judges is non-constitutional. Also, according to the Article 209 of the constitution, the Judges of the Superior Judiciary enjoy a constitutional guarantee against arbitrary removal. They can be removed only by following the procedure laid down in Article 209 of the Constitution by filing an appropriate reference before the Supreme Judicial Council and not otherwise.<br /><br />The lawyers are of the opinion that all the deposed judges were still under oath, and there was no justification for a fresh oath, adding that the judges had betrayed the lawyers&#39; community by accepting the fresh oath under the law minister&#39;s formula. They also say that there was no provision in the constitution about the reappointment of judges while the government was trying to validate the unconstitutional steps of Nov 3. A conspiracy is being hatched against the reinstatement of Justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry and the present government had refused to reinstate him as the rulers know that Justice Iftikhar&#39;s restoration would strengthen the judiciary, and the government could not tolerate an independent judiciary in the country.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bgsp.edu/statements/ps_ssoldz.html"><strong>Stephen Soldz</strong></a> [Director, Center for Research, Evaluation, and Program Development, <a href="http://www.bgsp.edu/">Boston Graduate School of Psychoanalysis</a>]: &quot;In results released this week, the members of the <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/us-psychologist-group-bars.php">American Psychological Association overwhelmingly approved a referendum</a> repudiating the APA&#39;s years-long policy encouraging psychologists to aid interrogations in the U.S. detention facilities, including Guantanamo and the CIA&#39;s &quot;black sites.&quot; The referendum states that psychologists may not serve in these sites unless they work directly for detainees or for independent third parties (think ICRC) &quot;working to protect human rights.&quot; This ban goes beyond interrogation support to include all psychologists, including those providing clinical services (with the exception of providing services to U.S. troops stationed in the detention centers, which are still allowed). While differing in details, the referendum now joins the APA to other health provider organizations, such as the American Medical Association and American Psychiatric Association, that have taken strong policy stands against participating in detention abuse.<br /><br />The Defense Department actively opposed the referendum, issuing a <a href="http://psychoanalystsopposewar.org/blog/2008/08/22/defense-department-issues-statement-opposing-apa-referendum-there-are-no-neutrals-there/">press release</a> with talking points regarding the legal, ethical nature of psychologists&#39; work in the detention centers. These claims were in direct conflict with the extensive evidence from leaked and released documents, journalists, the Defense Department (DoD) <a href="http://www.fas.org/blog/secrecy/2007/05/dod_inspector_general_reviews_.html">Inspector General</a>, and the <a href="http://www.capitolhillblue.com/cont/node/8845">Senate Armed Services Committee</a> that showed that psychologists played a central role &#8212; in both the CIA and DoD facilities &#8212; designing, implementing, and disseminating abusive techniques that, by international standards, often constituted torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. Other work had shown that mental health staff at these sites played critical roles in administering abusive &quot;<a href="http://wikileaks.org/wiki/Camp_Delta_Standard_Operating_Procedure">behavior management plans</a>,&quot; in <a href="http://brokenlives.info/?page_id=69">distorting diagnoses</a> (e.g., not diagnosing PTSD) to disguise the harmful psychological effects of the harsh treatment, and, likely <a href="http://brokenlives.info/?page_id=69">providing confidential information</a> to be used by interrogators.<br /><br />Now that the referendum has passed, battles around implantation begin. The APA is interpreting their bylaws as saying the referendum doesn&#39;t take effect until next August; referendum proponents claim this is a serious distortion of the bylaws. Passage of the referendum will put additional pressure on the DoD to remove psychologists from their roles aiding interrogations and behavior management. It will also create additional pressure for the development of a mental health system for detainees that is completely isolated from chain of command pressures. While the DoD is not necessarily bound by APA policy, they generally follow professional ethics policies; to do otherwise could make their efforts to recruit psychologists and other professionals substantially more difficult. The implications for the CIA&#39;s &quot;enhanced interrogation&quot; program are less certain, given the secrecy under which that program is conducted. Yet, even there, the APA referendum will increase pressure for a new administration and Congress to shut down the program.&quot;<strong></strong><br />

		<title>India&#039;s views on women must change to make anti-dowry legal reform meaningful</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.rfkmemorial.org/legacyinaction/2000_Macwan/"><strong>Marin Macwan</strong></a> [Founder, <a href="http://navsarjan.org/">Navsarjun Trust</a>]: &quot;Upon presenting the new Constitution of India to Parliament in 1947, Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, chairperson of the Drafting Committee, stated, &quot;We are entering into an age of contradiction. In law, we are all equal, but in society there is nothing but inequality.&quot; He concluded with the warning that &quot;unless and until the conscience of the society changes, the constitutional guarantees have no meaning.&quot;<br /><br />Women are the largest constituency in India to suffer the indignity of discrimination. They are subjected to gender-based inequality, irrespective of their caste, religious or economic background. For us, the increasingly skewed ratio of men to women is a concern, but an even greater concern is that the increase is occurring at a time when the economic and educational status of people in India is consistently on the rise. <br /><br />Dowry deaths in India are not breaking news. For years, women have been burned alive in dowry related deaths. Years ago, Gandhi, concerned that many women were killed in kitchen fires and that stoves always killed women and not men, suggested that the design of the stove be changed. Today, the question of whether the number of such deaths is rising or falling is irrelevant in light of the fact that an even greater number of dowry deaths are systemically dismissed as &quot;accidents,&quot; even before any investigation takes place. Those few victims that do survive attempted dowry deaths are often shown their young children and threatened: &quot;If you send your husband to prison for cruelty, there will be no one to care for your children.&quot; Such appeals work in most cases and the victim will testify that her injuries were due to an accidental blast of the stove. <br /><br />According to Ambedkar, neither the law nor a changed design for stoves would be adequate means to ensure justice. What is required is a change in society&#39;s conscience. Well, how will that happen?<br /><br />There are two main avenues available to us to effect change in society&#39;s conscience, neither of which is the law. The first avenue is education in all its forms, including through mass education via audio and visual means. The second is through examining spirituality and our perception of religion. Unfortunately both of these sectors in Indian society are largely controlled by fanatics who profess the superiority of caste, color, race, and, of course, gender. Social beliefs transmitted through the education system can be as double-faced as some religious dogma and are equally responsible for propagating the idea of women as an inferior race. This is evident in text books across India. Of particular note, the Manusmriti, Hindu canon taught in graduate universities in parts of India, is an example of how these two avenues intersect and is an important document demonstrating how women are perceived in Indian society. The Manusmriti, often referred to as the Laws of Manu, is an ancient Hindu text and is arguably the most authoritative books of the Hindu code. Together, these beliefs serve as a root cause for multifaceted discrimination towards women, including dowry deaths. <br /><br />To <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/india-government-to-review-anti-dowry.php">talk of strengthening the laws</a> to end discrimination against women without ensuring implementation or trying to change society&#39;s perception merely demonstrates that we, as a society, have accepted populist political measures over true reform.&quot;<br />

In December 2005, the jury acquitted him of 8 of the 17charges brought against him and was hung on the remaining charges. In April 2006, Dr. Al-Arian pleaded guilty to a single non-terrorism related count of conspiracy and agreed to be deported. <br /><br />A central aspect of the plea agreement was an understanding that Dr. Al-Arian would not be subject to further prosecution or called to cooperate with the government on any matter. The plea agreement signed with Florida prosecutors explicitly protected him from cooperating in any additional cases.<br /><br />Despite Dr. Al-Arian&#39;s immunity, federal prosecutors in Virginia sought his testimony for a grand jury investigation and Al-Arian refused to testify. In April 2008, Dr. Al-Arian&#39;s sentence ended and while being held in an ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) jail, immigration authorities were making preparations for his deportation. <br /><br />Unfortunately, the Justice Department has recently brought new charges of criminal contempt against Dr. Al-Arian in order to bring him before a grand jury investigating other Muslim organizations. Earlier this week, Dr. Al-Arian was released on bail and will be restricted to home detention while he awaits trial for contempt of court.<br /><br />With no maximum penalty for criminal contempt, Dr. Al-Arian now hangs in legal purgatory and the Justice Department&#39;s witch-hunt continues.&quot;<br />

		<title>Proposed D.C. gun law amendments still infringe on Second Amendment liberties</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.nraila.org/Media/PDFs/cwc_bio.pdf"><strong>Chris W. Cox</strong></a> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.nraila.org/">National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action</a>]: &quot;While a recent <a href="http://www.dc.gov/mayor/news/release.asp?id=1380&mon=200809">District proposal</a> - passed only under the threat of congressional action - does make a few positive changes to its gun laws, it is still important for Congress to take strong action to restore the Second Amendment rights of District residents. <br /><br />The D.C. Council&#39;s second &quot;emergency&quot; bill makes clear that it still intends to impose new limits on D.C. residents. For example, while the new D.C. bill would allow possession of semi-automatic firearms, it also bans standard-capacity magazines commonly used by law-abiding citizens for self-protection throughout the country.<br /><br />This bill states as a &quot;policy of the District of Columbia&quot; that firearms should be stored unloaded and either disassembled or locked. While some media reports have spun this as merely an advisory provision, under the Council&#39;s bill, a gun owner can be found guilty of &quot;criminally negligent storage of a firearm&quot; if another individual gains access to a gun and injures someone with it.<br /><br />By contrast, the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:H.R.6691:">Second Amendment Enforcement Act</a>, which <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/us-house-passes-second-amendment.php">passed the U.S. House last week</a> with 266 bipartisan votes, would make important changes to D.C. law in areas that the Council&#39;s bill fails to address. Not only does it implement the <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf">Heller</a> decision by allowing law-abiding D.C. residents to own the most common types of handguns, but it would reform D.C.&#39;s firearm registration requirements, which provide a pretext for many of D.C.&#39;s other restrictions on residents&#39; Second Amendment rights. Registration is of dubious crime-prevention benefit, as demonstrated by D.C.&#39;s high crime levels.<br /><br />The Act also authorizes D.C. residents to purchase a handgun from a licensed dealer in Maryland or Virginia, after passing a federally mandated background check. This change is necessary because there is only one federally licensed dealer who will perform handgun transfers in the District, and proposed D.C. zoning regulations would make it even harder for other dealers to start up. <br /><br />In short, because the D.C. Council continues to fail to implement the Supreme Court&#39;s <u>Heller</u> decision, congressional action is necessary to restore the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding D.C. residents.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Corlett Letlojane</strong> [Director, <a href="http://www.hurisa.org.za/">Human Rights Institute of South Africa</a>]: &quot;First and foremost, many people are saddened by the <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/south-africa-president-resigning-after.php">unceremonious departure of the President of South Africa</a>, when his term of office is only ending in April 2008. <br /><br />Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu, who chairs the group known as The Elders, is an elder statesman playing a major role in reconciliation, a leading moral voice, and an icon of hope within and beyond South Africa, who expressed his sadness for the way the African National Congress (ANC) National Executive Committee shamed President Thabo Mbeki and the nation. Mbeki was made to leave his office before using the opportunity to state his side of the story. His resignation comes amid legal action on corrupt allegations brought against the President of the ANC, Jacob Zuma. <br /><br />The Human Rights Institute of South Africa has been following the Arms deal case and many controversial issues troubling the country such as the suspension of the Director of National Prosecution, Mr Vusi Pikoli; the reluctance of the government to press criminal charges against Jackie Selebi, the National Commissioner of the South African Police Service, who is currently suspended and on extended leave as National Police Commissioner; the controversy around whether HIV causes AIDS; the public averments that by the ANC Youth and COSATU leaders that they are prepared to &quot;kill&quot; for Jacob Zuma in their bid to drop prosecution charges against him. These are serious issues that concerned South Africans battle to comprehend and deal with. <br /><br />HURISA shares the same sentiments with the rest of those troubled by these issues and the manner in which the government handled these matters. However, we still believe that in a country premised on the principles of human rights, the rule of law, transparency, good governance, and accountability these issues do not justify the dismissal of Thabo Mbeki from office.<br /><br />South Africa serves as a model of democracy around the region and globe. However what has transpired in the political field of government left animosity and shame to the ANC. For starters, as a political party enjoying majority rule, and secondly, the country as a whole feels this shame as a champion of human rights. <br /><br />Although the issue had come at time when South Africa&#39;s democracy has matured, it has left a dent on the ANC as a majority party and leader of the country. They might disagree with this statement but it is a well known fact that some of these issues have serious ramifications and caused a split in the ANC. <br /><br />Sadly, opposition is so weak in South Africa that the ANC can assume manifested roles including that of opposition within itself as a structure. This has cast doubt on their objectiveness and genuineness in serving as a referee and player. <br /><br />What is left now is to wonder what sort of future does the ANC hold for the ordinary South African? How come they have not been vigorous in upholding their constitutional obligations with the nation under social and economic rights as compared to the way they advocated for Mbeki&#39;s resignation? When are they going to address the inequality of the past as abject poverty is on the surface, the gap between the rich and poor is on the increase, creation of jobs for the unemployed is lacking, provision of sufficient housing to the historically marginalised is poor, and there is lack of a monitoring system for effective delivery of social contingencies?<br /><br />We expected the ANC to live up to the socio-economic contract they have with the nation as they promised to uphold by delivery and not by washing the party&#39;s dirty linen in public. We are not impressed! The demise of Mbeki brought unexpected breaking news adding to more sadness and disappointment: As of today, letters of resignation with immediate effect are received from the following high profile cabinet minsters and deputies: Deputy President, Minister of Defence, Minister of Finance, Minister in Presidency, Dr Essop Pahad, Minister of Intelligence, Minister of Correctional Services, Minister of Public Enterprices, Minister of Science and Technology, Minister Public Works, Minister of Provincial and Local Government, Minister of Public Service and Administration, the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Minister of Finance, Deputy Minister of Correctional Services.&quot;<br />

		<title>Secret CIA prison scandal will affect Polish relations with Europe and America</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://euc.org.pl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=83&Itemid=54">Agnieszka Bienczyk-Missala</a></strong> [Lecturer, <a href="http://www.ism.uw.edu.pl/">Institute of International Relations, University of Warsaw</a>]: &quot;In August 2008 the Public Prosecutor&#39;s Office in Poland started an investigation on the <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/poland-investigating-claims-of-cia.php"> existence of secret CIA detention facilities</a> in Poland. It happened three years after the revealing information published by the Washington Post and Human Rights Watch. So far, all consecutive Polish governments have neglected the issue, denying the CIA operated a secret prison in Poland.<br /><br />Yet it is highly probable that the state investigation will confirm Poland hosted illegal CIA prisons. The crucial step will gathering evidence of practicing torture. According to the Polish Penal Code, legal proceedings should be launched against decision makers and perpetrators. Any person who commits this kind of act shall be subject to imprisonment of from one to ten years. In cases of crimes against prisoners of war the term of imprisonment could be as much as twenty five years. As alleged offenders will likely be CIA officers and other American citizens, it will be extremely difficult to bring the legal proceedings to an end, as the American government will probably not be willing to cooperate. In addition, it is worth mentioning, that all victims of unlawful detention, torture and ill-treatment in Poland can claim compensation before Polish courts and have a right to submit a complaint against Poland to the European Court on Human Rights in Strasbourg. <br /><br />At the beginning of scandal three years ago, representatives of the European Union and the Council of Europe turned attention to serious consequences, which may happen in cases of evidence of torture and detention of terrorism suspects in secret locations in Poland and Romania. According to Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, the member state, which seriously violates principles of democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law can be suspended from certain rights, including voting rights. Similar procedures are envisaged by the statutes of the Council of Europe. Any member of the Coun&Acirc;&shy;cil of Europe which has seriously vio&Acirc;&shy;lated the princi&Acirc;&shy;ples of the rule of law and of the enjoyment by all persons within its jurisdic&Acirc;&shy;tion of human rights may be suspended from its rights of repre&Acirc;&shy;sentation and even re&Acirc;&shy;quested to withdraw. <br /><br />Launching the above procedures seems rather unlikely. It would be necessary to interpret whether administering secret prisons and practicing torture by foreign secret service personnel constitutes a serious breach of the afore mentioned principles. The Council of Europe has never taken the decision of suspending a state that systematically practices torture, like Russia or Turkey. Moreover, the international reports suggested that 14 European countries had cooperated with the CIA program and some European leaders, like Javier Solana, EU High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, were aware of CIA rendition flights. Political reasons will play a decisive role, and Poland and Romania are unlikely to suffer serious consequences on the international level. At the same time the present Polish government will be able to use the issue of secret detention facilities in political fights with opposition parties who can be held responsible for cooperation in the rendition program. <br /><br />The whole issue has a very negative impact on the image of Poland in Europe. It will also influence, to some extent, Polish-American relations. Most Poles are very critical about the existence of CIA prisons in Poland and they become more and more critical of US policy. For years Polish society has been the most pro-American group in the European Union, but this attitude is changing. Now Poles pay greater attention to the behavior of their government toward Washington and the government cannot disregard the state of public opinion.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Sarah Lazare</strong> [Project Director, <a href="http://www.couragetoresist.org/x/">Courage to Resist</a>]: &quot;Robin Long&#39;s refusal to fight in the illegal and immoral war against Iraq was a courageous act, and it is regretful that soldiers in his position do not have avenues for resisting service that do not <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/us-soldier-deported-from-canada.php">land them in jail</a>. The Canadian government&#39;s decision to deport Long into U.S. military custody was a disgrace; it flaunted Canada&#39;s longstanding tradition of providing sanctuary to U.S. soldiers and amounted to complicity in the U.S. war against Iraq, a war that Canada supposedly refused to participate in. The U.S. military&#39;s decision to give Long the maximum sentence negotiated in the pre-trial agreement and the longest sentence given to any Iraq war resister clearly reflects the heavy hand with which G.I. resistance is met in today&#39;s climate. <br /> <br />Long&#39;s sentence has profound implications for the estimated 200 Iraq war resisters living in Canada. Several other war resisters in Canada have received orders for deportation, including Jeremy Hinzman, who received a deportation order for September 23rd. <br /> <br />Despite the high stakes, G.I. resistance is on the rise: as public and G.I. support for the Iraq war plummets, more and more soldiers are refusing to fight, and many Iraq Veterans are joining Iraq Veterans Against the War in calling for an immediate end to the invasion of Iraq.&quot;<br />

		<title>Last minute change in Wisconsin election protocol would disenfranchise voters</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Andrea Kaminski</strong> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.lwvwi.org/cms/index.php">League of Women Voters of Wisconsin</a>]: &quot;In suing the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board (GAB), <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/wisconsin-elections-agency-says-id.php">Attorney General Van Hollen is seeking to overturn</a> a recent GAB decision and change election procedures - just before a presidential election. He wishes to impose an emergency rule dealing with matching the statewide voter registration list with the Department of Transportation database.<br /> <br />The GAB is a nonpartisan board of six retired judges, which was created as the result of a new ethics law which went into effect in 2007. Following the biggest government ethics scandal in state history, which sent a number of former legislators to prison, the GAB was created to replace the bipartisan ethics and election boards, which were often ineffective.   <br /> <br />Federal law (<a href="http://www.fec.gov/hava/hava.htm">HAVA</a>) requires that the database matching be done, and it is being done in Wisconsin on first-time registrations by mail since August 6, 2008. HAVA does not require that people with non-matching data be disqualified from casting a regular ballot on Election Day. <br /> <br />The Attorney General&#39;s proposal would result in persons with non-matched data to clear up the &quot;nonmatch&quot; or re-register at the polls, or use provisional ballots on Election Day. People would have to bring proof of identity and residence on Election Day, something regular voters are unaccustomed to providing at the polls in Wisconsin. <br /> <br />Developing the Statewide Voter Registration System (SVRS) presented a unique challenge in Wisconsin, where our elections are administered largely by local clerks. Of about 9,000 election clerks nationwide, about 2,000 are in Wisconsin. Prior to 2006, voters in the more than 1,400 municipalities with populations less than 5,000 were not required to register to vote.  <br /> <br />The SVRS became fully functional on August 6, 2008. The GAB reports that more than 20percent of the new registrations they have cross-checked since that time are turning up as problems. In a test, four of the six GAB members did not pass the HAVA check.  These are retired judges who likely have been voting regularly since they came of age.<br /> <br />The League of Women Voters is concerned that the proposed last-minute rule change will result in confusion for voters and election officials alike. Municipal clerks have asked what we would have them do between now and the election: should they be recruiting and training poll workers and sending ballots to electors overseas, or should they be working to resolve the data discrepancies of one out of five registered voters?<br /> <br />Wisconsin&#39;s election ecosystem received high marks in a recent comparative <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/electionlaw/joyce/chapter6_111-135.pdf">study</a> [PDF], because it is fair, clean, open and transparent. The study&#39;s authors noted in particular that our system has been set up to not require a lot of costly provisional ballots. <br /> <br />Finally, the rule is unfair. As with other last-minute rules changes and restrictive measures, the burden of this rule would fall disproportionately on the people for whom it would be most difficult to get to the clerk&#39;s office, that is, the elderly, disabled, and low-income &#8212; all of whom are less likely to have the job flexibility, child care or transportation needed to make a second trip to the poll or clerk&#39;s office.  <br /> <br />This last-minute rule change would cause long lines and confusion at the polls on a day when a record number of citizens are expected to turn out. It would cause disarray when it comes to counting votes after the election. Worst of all, it would mean that many, many Wisconsin citizens would not be able to cast a vote and have it counted.&quot;<br />

		<title>Justice Department set to loosen investigation guidelines once again</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Michelle Richardson</strong> [Legislative Counsel, <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">ACLU</a>]: &quot;Just when you thought domestic spying power grabs had been put to rest for the duration of this Administration, the Justice Department has publicly announced its intent to go after one of the last existing hurdles between the government and our private lives: the simple requirement that we be suspected of some illegal activity before we become subject to investigation. <br /><br />Domestic antiterrorism authorities have expanded greatly in the last seven years: the PATRIOT Act lowered the standard for obtaining wiretaps and records and reduced court oversight; the Attorney General Guidelines were amended to allow officers to patrol public places such as mosques; and the FISA Amendments act last month granted the government the authority to collect all international communications without a warrant, even if an American is on one end. <br /><br />But the Justice Department wants more. It is proposing that the Attorney General&#39;s Guidelines governing criminal and intelligence investigations on US soil be amended so that they no longer require some indication of criminal activity before an investigation is commenced. <br /><br />Even worse, the Justice Department is also preparing to amend federal regulations that prevented local and state law enforcement from engaging in this sort of suspicionless investigation. With over 700,000 state and local officers, this change could reach even deeper into the daily lives of Americans. Even those of us who may have very little interaction with federal law enforcement have regular and repeated contact with the local police and sheriff&#39;s office. How many times a day does a cop car pass by your office or your home? <br /><br />How would this work on a practical level? The government, whether state, local or federal, would still have to abide by the laws on the books when it comes to tapping your phone, searching your home or accessing your records. However, they&#39;d have free reign to do whatever they want short of those activities &#8212; which includes a lot. They could talk to your neighbors and coworkers. They could follow you around. They could sit in on the peaceful meetings of community organizations you attend. <br /><br />What are the real consequences? Well, the most obvious is that law enforcement will have a green light to racially profile. Although the Attorney General recently testified that race alone would never be the basis of surveillance or investigation, we know that the Justice Department has sanctioned a list of completely innocent activities that create &quot;suspicion&quot; of being a terrorist, such as taking pictures and drawing sketches. In the end, race + innocent activity = racial profiling. Imagine two tourists taking pictures of the Statue of Liberty. Is the local cop, subject to all the fearmongering in our culture, going to follow the middle aged white woman or the twenty-something male with dark skin? <br /><br />Another consequence is that law enforcement will return to its pre-Watergate activities of surveilling peaceful protests and organizations that threaten mainstream values or institutions, even when there is no indication that the groups or individuals will commit a crime or an act of violence. The ACLU has documented this practice all over the country since September 11. The ACLU has also documented how so-called &quot;fusion centers&quot; not only facilitate the sharing of information, but effectively encourage over-collection. For example, just last month, records confirmed that Maryland law enforcement had infiltrated an anti-death penalty group and monitored their meetings for 14 months, even after the undercover officer reported that there was no indication that the group was dangerous. Such misguided efforts will only increase once the Justice Department lifts the ban on such suspicionless intelligence gathering. <br /><br />FBI Director Mueller will be before the Judiciary Committees next month and Congress should demand to know how both of these new investigative opportunities are intended to work. Why does law enforcement insist on collecting innocent information? What is the use of burying relevant information under irrelevant information? <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/senate-judiciary-committee-calls-for.php">Some Senators have started raising red flags</a> and we can only hope for more.<br /><br />But beware. These changes are likely to sail through in the very near future. We can only hope that the new Congress and the new President will make ending these sorts of civil liberties violations a priority.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Chip Sinton</strong> [President, <a href="http://www.youthrights.org/">National Youth Rights Association</a>]: &quot;The National Youth Rights Association disagrees with the <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/sixth-circuit-upholds-tennessee-school.php">Sixth Circuit&#39;s ruling</a> in <u>Barr et al. v. Lafon</u>, et al. NYRA disagrees not because we are Confederate sympathizers nor because we support any hateful message implicit in the symbol in question, but because we believe that the court did not apply the correct scrutiny and the school hadn&#39;t met its burden in provingthat this was a necessary curtailing of the constitutional rights of the students affected. As an organization devoted to the protection and expansion of youth and student rights in society, we wish to see the decision viewed from the perspective of the party effected - students - and viewed through the prism of whether this egregious violation of student speech is justified. <u>Tinker v. Des Moines</u>, in no unclear terms, established that students do not &quot;shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate,&quot; a precedent this organization wholeheartedly supports.<br /><br />Our first issue with the decision was the application of intermediate scrutiny. While stare decisis may point to using that scrutiny, a true examination of the youth reveals that they merit the application of strict scrutiny, meeting all four criteria set forth in footnote 4 of <u>United States v. Carolene Products Company</u>. Minors are, without a doubt, &quot;discrete, insular minorities&quot; subjected to purposeful and unequal treatment on a daily basis. They are a disenfranchised demographic that is subject to overbroad discrimination based solely on their age - e.g. youth prohibition, government imposed curfews, etc. When the broad history of age discrimination and their political impotence(lack of voting rights) is viewed, the fact that youth warrant suspect classification becomes even more obvious. To meet the final burden of achieving suspect classification, it is the opinion of NYRA that age is an immutable characteristic that cannot be hastened, slowed, transferred or abandoned. It must be endured. It is because we believe that youth are unrecognized discrete and insular minorities, we disagree with the application of mere intermediate scrutiny in this case.<br /><br />Our second disagreement with the ruling stems from the fact that the school didn&#39;t meet its burden of proof in showing that the right of students to display speech related paraphernalia had to be curtailed. The Sixth Circuit held that it was just for the administration of the school to prohibit the flag because they sensed &quot;tension&quot; and had forecast that it could cause problems in the future. This pre-emptive prohibition is almost exactly like the prohibition overturned in <u>Tinker v. Des Moines</u>. In that case, as noted in <u>Frederick v. Morse</u>, the principal of the school acted out of &quot;fear or apprehension of disturbance&quot; and the &quot;mere desire to avoid...discomfort and unpleasantness.&quot; This was held to be insufficient grounds by the courts in the 1960s, and that precedent should have been reaffirmed by <u>Barr et al. v. Lafon, et al</u>, not flouted. In <u>Tinker</u>, it was held that &quot;the wearing of armbands...was entirely divorced from actually or<br />potentially disruptive conduct,&quot; and in this case, the displaying of a flag was divorced entirely from any past racially motivated disruptive conduct.<br /><br />The flag was not a gang sign nor an intimidation tactic, but rather it was pure, undisruptive speech divorced from the conduct of those wearing them. The flag is no different from the armband in the sense that it is simply a symbol of a belief. The case at hand is not dealing with a swastika nor a gang sign that is a direct call to disruptive action. Unless the school can prove the flag itself is a call to racist, violent action - a signal, not a symbol - than it is just as inert as the <u>Tinker</u> armband. Tinker was asked to remove her armband because other students in the school knew people in the war, or agreed with the war. The principal feared it would exacerbate the war v. draft tensions already in the school. The armband was telling some students that their friends were dying for nothing. It represented an insult to beliefs they held very dearly. But the court made the very important distinction of separating the armband itself from inciteful speech and action by war protesters.<br /><br />If the students wearing the flag are yelling racial epitaphs in a crowded hallway, then they ought to be punished; but if they are simply wearing a flag patch to represent either their agreement with the confederate cause or their pride in their rebel heritage, they ought to be allowed to wear it regardless of personal disagreement. Much like in <u>Tinker</u>, the ban was put in place in a fervent wish to &quot;avoid the controversy which might result from the expression.&quot; Thusly, by affirming the school&#39;s decision, the Sixth Circuit court ignored the vital precedent set by <u>Tinker v. Des Moines</u>, in what amounts to little more than a slap in the face to Students&#39; Rights.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/index.php?content=Aboutstaff"><strong>Michele Waslin</strong></a> [Senior Policy Analyst, <a href="http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/index.php?content=home">Immigration Policy Center</a>, <a href="http://www.ailf.org/">American Immigration Law Foundation</a>]: &quot;This week, <a href="http://www.ice.gov/">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) announced that it had <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/us-immigration-authority-abandons.php">suspended its latest immigration enforcement experiment</a>.  Dubbed as ICE&#39;s &quot;compassionately conceived enforcement initiative,&quot; <a href="http://www.ice.gov/pi/news/factsheets/ice-scheduled-departure-program.htm">Operation Scheduled Departure</a> [factsheet] was a five-city pilot program that would allow immigrants with outstanding orders of removal to report to ICE to make arrangements to voluntarily leave the U.S.  ICE would release them with ankle bracelet monitoring systems and give them up to 90 days to make arrangements for their families before leaving.  The program was abandoned after netting a grand total of eight takers.   However immigrant advocates have feared that the effort now allows ICE to unleash its <a href="http://www.ice.gov/pi/dro/nfop.htm">Fugitive Operations Teams</a> for door-to-door operations and conduct additional worksite raids, self-righteously claiming that they gave immigration violators a chance to be deported compassionately.<br /><br />Four days after suspending the program, ICE launched the largest worksite raid to date, arresting over 600 workers in a Mississippi electrical equipment plant, once again tearing apart families, disrupting businesses, causing detriment to entire communities, and costing the federal government millions of dollars.  <br /><br />Anti-immigrant groups, most notably the <a href="http://www.cis.org/">Center for Immigration Studies</a> (CIS), have been confidently reporting that increased enforcement has been successful and that undocumented immigrants are, in fact, leaving the U.S.  The recent CIS report is marred with dubious data and questionable methodology.   It is nearly impossible to accurately measure the undocumented population, and if there has been a decline in the numbers, serious academics agree that hit has much more to do with the downturn in the economy rather than any enforcement measure.  The restrictionists&#39; solution is to encourage the government to continue spending billions of taxpayer dollars on worksite raids and border fencing.  Yet serious researchers concluded long ago that undocumented immigration is driven by economics and that the tens of billions of taxpayer dollars spent on immigration enforcement over the past two decades have done virtually nothing to dissuade undocumented immigrants from coming here when there are jobs to fill.<br /><br />The failure of Operation Scheduled Departure serves to highlight the realities of our broken immigration system.   The U.S. cannot expect to deport its way out of its current problems, and it cannot expect immigrants to simply choose to leave.  There are approximately 12 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S., 4.4 million of whom have been in the country since the year 2000, and an estimated 14.6 million people living in mixed families with U.S. citizen spouses and children.  It is highly improbable that people who are firmly integrated into our communities will voluntary choose to uproot themselves and ask to be torn from their families and livelihood.  Even with the downturn of the economy, it is still unlikely that undocumented workers will return to countries that provide drastically fewer economic opportunities than the worst-hit communities here at home.  The U.S. needs a practical, fair, and reasonable solution to immigration that includes smart enforcement measures.  Neither Operation Scheduled Departure nor the recent raid in Mississippi will significantly reduce the undocumented population and nor will it address a fundamental issue of the mismatch of our outdated immigration laws with enduring laws of supply or demand, in this case for immigrant labor. Instead, they will drive undocumented immigrants further underground, denying the government additional tax dollars and allowing unscrupulous employers to continue exploiting a vulnerable labor force.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnists <a href="http://www.nesl.edu/faculty/hansen.cfm">Victor Hansen</a> and <a href="http://www.nesl.edu/faculty/Friedman.cfm">Lawrence Friedman</a> of New England School of Law say that if Vice President Dick Cheney is permitted to avoid the requirements of the Presidential Records Act, the door is left open for a future administration to create a shadow government within the executive branch, one that operates without the benefit of the deliberative decisionmaking process envisioned by the Constitution....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/hansennew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td><img src="/forumy/friedmannew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>W</strong></font>hat lessons can we learn from history in the absence of a record? The discussions in the executive branch that led the United States to enter into a war in Iraq, to detain enemy combatants, and to engage in questionable interrogation of terrorist suspects, ought to be scrutinized by future leaders, to determine what, exactly, the thinking was behind these and other policies connected with the war on terror. Vice President Dick Cheney was at or near the center of each of these policies; as many commentators have reported, Mr. Cheney elevated the role of his office to a point previously unseen in American history. And now he is proposing to deny those future leaders&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;and historians, and everyone else&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;access to some of the materials he and his staff generated while he occupied the office of Vice President.<br /><br />The dispute concerns the Presidential Records Act, which dictates that the Vice President preserve &quot;documentary materials, or any reasonably segregable portion thereof, created or received by the [Vice] President,&quot; including those materials created or received by his &quot;immediate staff, or a unit or individual of [his office] whose function is to advise the [Vice] President, in the course of conducting activities which relate to or have an effect upon the carrying out of the constitutional, statutory, or other official or ceremonial duties of the [Vice] President.&quot; 44 U.S.C. &Acirc;&#167;&Acirc;&#167; 2201(2), 2207. The statute offers no additional guidance, and the office of the Vice President has taken the position&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;according to an affidavit submitted by Claire M. O&#39;Donnell, Assistant to the Vice President and Deputy Chief of Staff&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;that the law requires only that materials relating to "the functions of the Vice President specially assigned to the Vice President by the President in the discharge of executive duties and responsibilities and the functions of the Vice President as President of the Senate" be provided. <br /><br />That affidavit was submitted in a suit brought by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington against the Vice President, his office, the Executive Office of the President, and the National Archives and the Archivist of the United States. The most recent development in the case was the grant of the plaintiff&#39;s request for a preliminary injunction. See <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/jud/crew092008.pdf">Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. Cheney</a>, No. 08-1548 (U.S.D.D.C. Sept. 20, 2008) (Order and Memorandum Opinion). United States District Court Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly found that the office of the Vice President was only preserving material pursuant to its narrow construction of the Presidential Records Act, and the court issued an order that all defendants preserve all documentary material relating to the Vice President&#39;s constitutional, statutory, or other official or ceremonial duties, without limitation, during the pendency of the litigation.<br /><br />Whence the Vice President&#39;s narrow construction of his obligations under the Presidential Records Act? The basis for his position would seem to lie in the belief&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;expressed by Mr. Cheney's chief of staff, David S. Addington, in statements he made last summer to Congress&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;that the office of the Vice President is not exclusively a part of the executive branch of the federal government. Rather, the Vice President, on this line of reasoning, is also attached to the Congress, because the Constitution provides, in Article I, that the Vice President preside over the Senate as its "President." This in turn means some of the Vice President's records are immune from the preservation requirements of the Presidential Records Act.<br /><br />As a matter of constitutional law, this argument is dubious. While it is true that Article I, Section 3 states that the Vice President is the "President" of the Senate, that provision denies him any responsibility other than a vote when the Senate is deadlocked; Article I gives the Vice President no other legislative responsibilities. Further, a structural analysis suggests that the Office of the Vice President is a part of the executive branch; Article II, Section 1 plainly states that, in the event the President is removed from office, dies, resigns, or is unable to discharge the powers and duties of the Presidency, then the Vice President shall assume the position of President. This is strong textual evidence that the Vice President is an executive actor, first and foremost, and a legislative actor in only one particular and exceptional circumstance.<br /><br />Given that the Vice President is inextricably linked to the President whom he serves as a political and practical matter, it would be odd indeed if some of the records of his time in office were immune from preservation under the Presidential Records Act. The Constitution itself reflects the importance of the communication of information from the executive branch to the people via the legislature: Article II, Section 3 provides that the President must "from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union." Just as responsible lawmaking by Congress depends upon accurate information from the executive about that branch's activities and administration of the law, so too does future policymaking in both branches demand accurate information about what has been tried, the policy options that were explored, and the policy options that were abandoned. <br /><br />This makes sense as a normative matter: both the public and future leaders need to know what happened so we do not repeat the mistakes of the past. The public needs to know because the basis for the exercise of the franchise may depend upon it; the ballot box can be a vital check on government only to the extent information about what the government has done is made available. And the next administration, and administrations thereafter, need to know the basis for the policy decisions whose consequences they will be addressing.<br /><br />The availability of this information is equally critical to the maintenance of the system of checks and balances created by our constitutional structure. The Vice President's position undermines checks and balances: if the executive operates in such a way as to deny the legislative and judicial branches any ability to scrutinize the executive's conduct, it becomes impossible for these branches to serve as a viable check on the executive's power. This necessary includes information about prior conduct, which may be critical to reviewing current executive actions.<br /><br />Ultimately, the Vice President's position serves to make full accountability less likely. During the administration of George W. Bush, Mr. Cheney and his closest advisors have essentially used the Office of the Vice President to quietly and firmly direct government policy regarding national security. A government operating in the shadows is antitheti
cal to our constitutional structure and our most fundamental democratic principles, but we can only deter future such endeavors by shining a light on the past.<br /><br />This is why Congress enacted the Presidential Records Act. Congress and the courts must now be vigilant in ensuring that that law is fairly and correctly applied. If not, future legislatures and policy makers will be at a significant disadvantage when trying to craft legislation and develop policies to curb executive excess, particularly in the area of national security, where the executive already enjoys significant deference from the other branches of government. Worse yet, if the Vice President is permitted to avoid the requirements of this statute, the door is left open for a future administration to take up where Vice President Cheney left off and create a shadow government within the executive branch, one that operates without the benefit of the deliberative decisionmaking process envisioned by the Constitution. As the last eight years have shown, the country can ill afford more of this approach to governance.<br /><br /><br /><em>Victor Hansen was a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army JAG Corps and currently teaches courses in criminal law at New England School of Law, where Lawrence Friedman teaches courses in constitutional law.</em><br />

In the months before the March 2003 invasion, members of the U.S. State Department "Oil and Energy Working Group" met to plan how to open Iraq to international oil companies.  The oil law now proposed by the Iraqi Council of Ministers is a virtual photocopy of a plan first drafted by U.S. oil industry executives and consultants in Houston long before Iraq was &quot;liberated.&quot; <br /><br />   Giving credence to Iraqis' fears, the oil law presented to the Iraqi Parliament, if enacted, would put effective control of most of Iraq's vast oil resources into the hands of foreign companies. Despite great pressure from the U.S. for its adoption, the law remains stalled in the Iraqi Parliament because a majority clearly oppose it.  Prior to the first Gulf war and the sanctions that followed, Iraq's oil, nationalized since 1975, provided the foundation for a relatively good standard of living, producing a high level of literacy, the largest number of engineers per capita in the Arab world and a health care system considered the best in the region. <br /><br />   The proposed oil law creates a Federal Oil and Gas Council on which would sit representatives of Exxon-Mobil, Shell, BP, etc., whose tasks include approving their own contracts.  Instead of Iraqi central government decision-making on oil, the legislation authorizes regional authorities to individually sign contracts with foreign companies, promoting bidding wars between regions that could lead to breaking Iraq into three states.  As Ewa Jasciewicz has noted, "The law would allow regions, represented by sectarian elites originally empowered in 2003, to sign their own contracts, create their own oil laws and develop their own industries, without democratic oversight. This, critics say, could lead to the break-up of the country and create new sectarian, economic and political facts on the ground." One Iraqi oil company manager previously employed by Shell told her, "I see the future of Iraq as the United Arab Emirates... separate states.&quot;<br /><br />   The draft oil law provides for "production sharing agreements," or long-term contracts whereby foreign companies would control production, development and sale of the oil for up to 30 years, and reap as much as 70% of the profits.  Given the severe weakness of Iraqi institutions, with the country devastated, under military occupation and mired in civil strife, Iraq is unlikely to receive a fair deal.  <br /><br />   At about $2 per barrel, Iraq's oil is among the cheapest in the world to extract. Given the current and predictable future price of oil on the world market, this makes Iraq's reserves the most valuable and profitable in the world to whoever controls them.  But for international oil companies, the bonus value of Iraqi oil is in the boost it will give to the book value (stock price) of any company that can lay claim to those untapped reserves. With huge reserves and low production costs, foreign oil companies in Iraq stand to make enormous profits at the expense of the welfare of Iraq&#39;s people and Iraqi sovereignty.<br /><br />   The law sets no minimum requirement on the successful bidder to hire Iraqis, partner with or purchase from Iraqi companies, transfer new technologies to Iraq, or reinvest any of the considerable profits in Iraq. Under the proposed terms, 100% of all profits can be repatriated. The only royalty required under the law is 12.5% payment to the government by the contract holder. Anything above that must be negotiated in the contract as a form of "production-sharing." Given that these negotiations will take place under conditions of foreign occupation and civil strife, oil corporations have a distinct advantage in setting terms for the division of revenues. <br /><br />   As currently written, any disputes arising during the term of the contract would not be subject to review or resolution in the Iraqi courts. Instead they would be submitted to international arbitration tribunals. There is no precedent anywhere among the major oil producers of the Middle East for such production-sharing arrangements. <br /><br />   Taken together, these terms make a mockery of any real Iraqi sovereignty. No wonder the oil law has met such stiff resistance.  The Al Maliki government has not dared bring it to a vote in Parliament because they recognize it would meet with almost certain defeat.<br /><br />   Iraq's people will not take this looting of their national treasure lying down.  Five major Iraqi labor federations, including the Federation of Oil Unions, have condemned the draft law and warn this is a "red-line" issue for Iraq. They recognize the hijack this law, drafted at the behest of international oil interests, represents.  <br /><br />   Hassan Juma'a Awad, President of the Iraq Federation of Oil Unions put it this way:<blockquote>The main issue concerning our union and the Iraqi people at the moment is the proposed oil law. A lot of people are questioning why we take a stand against the law.<br /><br />We are proud to state that our union, as a popular organisation in Iraq, was the first body to voice its opinions concerning the proposed oil law in Iraq&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;. As well as being critical of the production sharing agreement, we are critical of the process, how it was written, and kept behind closed doors and how they kept the Iraqi people in the dark about important details of this proposed law. <br /><br />The US government is behind this law. We think the US and British are exerting maximum pressure on the Iraqi government to pass such a law. Because George Bush failed in the military aspect of the occupation. But if he can force this law through then he could claim some kind of victory and justify the invasion.</blockquote>   Labor opposition to privatization of Iraqi oil and public services has hardly endeared unions to the Maliki government.  But long before the present regime took power, the U.S. had identified organized labor in Iraq as its adversary.  President Bush sent Paul Bremer to Iraq to set up the occupation authority. He threw out much of Saddam Hussein's legal code, disbanded the military and began playing "divide and conquer" with religious sects and ethnic, regional and tribal groups.  But there was at least one law he kept on the books and enforced.  That was Saddam's 1987 Decree No. 150 that made it illegal for employees in the public sector and publicly owned enterprises (80% of all Iraqi workers) to have a union or negotiate over the terms of their labor.  The Maliki government has continued to enforce this anti-labor edict of the dictatorship, despite the fact that the new constitution calls for enactment of a basic labor rights law, and that Decree No. 150 violates the internationally recognized fundamental rights of workers defined by International Labor Organization (UN) Conventions on the rights to organize, bargain and strike.  <br /><br />   In Iraq today, union bank accounts have been frozen, union offices have been raided and ransacked by both U.S. and Iraqi forces, government ministers have ordered managers not to recognize or deal with unions (especially in the oil sector), union le
aders have been beaten, arrested, kidnapped and assassinated.22  No democratic society can develop where workers are not free to organize into the unions of their choice, and where unions are not free from government control or interference.<br /><br />   Iraqis have a vivid collective memory of the colonial occupation of their country by Great Britain.  They fought doggedly to rid their country of foreign domination.  Most are grateful that Saddam is gone, but they are also resolute in their determination never again to be subject to the dictates of a foreign power &#8212; whether the U.S., UK, or Iran.  There is no way to do the occupation right.<br /><br /><br /><em>Nancy Wohlforth and Fred Mason are Co-Convenors of U.S. Labor Against the War</em><br />

		<title>The Anthrax Case: Congress Must Demand an Independent Inquiry</title>

But not everyone agrees, and among the doubters are members of Congress poised to question FBI Director Robert Mueller at hearings this week. While some &#8212; maybe even most -- of the evidence does point to Ivins, the FBI should not publicly pin guilt on him. Instead, the Bureau should send all of its information to a neutral, detached investigator to conduct of a full, unbiased inquiry. In this country, we determine guilt by testing the evidence, not press conferences that pronounce the case solved. <br /><br />With Ivins' death, no trial will ever take place. And this represents a real loss. The trial of every criminal case serves as an opportunity to test the evidence, whether direct or circumstantial. The government prosecutors present their evidence to the jury in the best possible light; the defense then gets to challenge the evidence. This is done through cross-examination, during which defense lawyers question witnesses put forth and already questioned by the prosecutor. If the prosecutor's questions serve to put forth the strongest view of the government's evidence, cross-examination's purpose is to show the jury where the weaknesses are &#8212; the biases of the witness, the failure of the witness to remember, or simply other interpretations of the evidence. The defense may also, if it wishes, put forth its own evidence, and its own witness, to challenge the prosecution's case. This testing of the evidence through cross-examination and the presentation of opposing versions of the facts lies at the heart of the way we evaluate the facts in determining whether to find a person guilty of a crime. <br /><br />As the FBI itself finally conceded after years of denial, its investigation went in the wrong direction for years, blaming another government scientist, Steven Hatfill. The Bureau and the Department of Justice were eventually forced to concede that they'd got it wrong, paying Hatfill millions of dollars in damages for the utter destruction of his professional and personal life. Thus when members of Congress and the public react skeptically to the FBI's pronouncement that it has found the killer, their skepticism is entirely reasonable: resolution of the case without a trial is just a little too convenient for the FBI, which would like to emerge from the case without any more problems. <br /><br />In our country, we do not accept accusations of criminal wrongdoing without examining them critically. Without the crucible of a trial in which the government and the defense put the evidence to the test in front of a jury, we simply cannot be sure that the government could ultimately prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. Statements by Paul Kemp, Dr. Ivins' attorney, give a strong sense that the government's evidence would have faced a strong challenge at a trial. For example, of the flask of anthrax spores that the government presents as the murder weapon under Ivins' sole control, Kemp says that more than a hundred other people also had access to the flask, and the same strain of anthrax was widely used in experiments by many other scientists. And reputable scientists around the country have uniformly reserved judgment about the Bureau's efforts to link the anthrax recovered in the attacks to the type in Ivins' lab, since no researcher unconnected with the FBI has had access to the Bureau's data or methods. In science as in law, no opportunity to test means no way to know. <br /><br />None of this, of course, proves that Dr. Ivins did not send anthrax through the mail in the fall of 2001. But at the very least, it does counsel caution. Sure, the evidence may seem to point to Dr. Ivins more than to anyone else. But we need to remember that any real conclusion requires more. <br /><br />That's why the only real solution &#8212; one that the FBI should support &#8212; is for a neutral party to take a close look at the evidence, and report to the Congress and the country about the strength of the case. Simple announcements of findings by the FBI &#8212; "trust us, we got the right guy this time" &#8212; just are not enough.<br /><br /><br /><em>David A.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/students/faculty/BDavis/BDavis.htm">Benjamin Davis</a> of the University of Toledo College of Law says &quot;the whole world is watching&quot; efforts in the United States - highlighted at a recent conference at Andover - to bring U.S. high-level civilians and/or generals to justice for crimes committed in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/benjamindavisnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>O</strong></font>n September 13-14, 2008, over two hundred people from the United States and abroad gathered in Andover. Massachusetts for the <a href="http://war-crimes.info/index.html">Justice Robert Jackson Conference on the Planning for Prosecution of High Level American War Criminals</a> sponsored by the Massachusetts School of Law. Video of the two day conference and the program are available <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/channel/warcrimesconference">here</a>. As a participant, I&#39;m providing this note to JURIST as an aide-memoire for those concerned about war crimes perpetrated by US officials that have gone unpunished over the past eight years.<br /><br /><strong>Impeachment of Bush-Cheney</strong> <br /><br />Notwithstanding Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi&#39;s statement that impeachment of the most senior member of the Administration is off the table, the impeachment of President George W. Bush and Vice-President Dick Cheney was very much on the table at the conference. In particular, it was noted that the time remaining for the Bush-Cheney administration is about the same time as it took for the impeachment of President Clinton. Moreover, the idea of a post-January 2009 impeachment of Bush and/or Cheney was raised so that they would be barred from any Federal office (such as work on federal commissions etc that prior-Presidents and Vice-Presidents have done) if the impeachment were successful. Beyond Bush and Cheney, a suggestion was made to impeach Judge Jay Bybee of the Ninth Circuit because of his enabling of torture in the now infamous Bybee-Yoo &quot;torture memo.&quot;<br /><br /><strong>Local, state and federal criminal prosecution</b><br /><br />Local efforts such as the Brattleboro, Vermont, ordinance that calls for the arrest on sight of Bush and/or Cheney if they enter the city limits were discussed. One particular scenario examined by participants was to charge Bush and Cheney with murder of U.S. soldiers who have died in the Iraq and Afghanistan war under state law. Vincent Bugliolsi and others examined the possibilities for such criminal prosecution in state court. A candidate for Attorney General in Vermont, Charlotte Dennett, advised that if she were elected she would consider opening state murder prosecutions against Bush and Cheney. One strategy that was discussed was the possibility of having hundreds of local DA&#39;s of the 2700 in the United States start those prosecutions in municipal courts. These state criminal prosecutions would put pressure or make it easier for a federal district attorney to find the fortitude to open federal criminal complaints against United States high-level civilians and/or generals for murder and torture and/or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment. Evaluation of a broad range of potential crimes including such crimes as obstruction of justice, criminal use of classified documents, etc and the other crimes that typically catch high-level civilians was encouraged in an effort to find ways to vindicate international law rules through the domestic courts. The use of common law courts in places, such as Florida, was examined as a means to turn revisionist international law theory to the advantage of those seeking prosecution by asserting customary international humanitarian and human rights law violations as common law applicable in state courts prosecutions. The Federal Assimilated Crimes Acts could also make federal charges on customary international law grounds a possible avenue for criminal prosecution.<br /><br /><strong>Foreign and international prosecution</strong><br /><br />The participants analyzed the status of and possibilities for foreign prosecution of U.S. high-level civilians and/or generals in foreign domestic courts under universal jurisdiction. The recent failed efforts in Germany and France with regard to Rumsfeld were noted. It was pointed out, however, that we should take advantage of the fact that more and more countries are enacting universal jurisdiction legislation. Efforts in England against similar persons in the English political establishment were noted. One of the more interesting tactics described started with over 200 citizens going to their local police stations in England and reporting a crime had been committed - referring to the Iraq War or torture. The police have a duty to investigate and this is a manner in which the ordinary citizen in England could get the wheels of justice rolling. <br /><br />As to international prosecution, the participants discussed the possibility of referrals to the International Criminal Court of United States high-level civilians and/or generals based on crimes committed in countries which adhere to the ICC. It was noted that prosecutors in a number of foreign countries have based their politically motivated dismissals of complaints against high US officials on the mistaken notion that the accused would be prosecuted in the US (the principle of complementarity) as well as on incorrect theories of immunity. The view discussed at the conference was that domestic U.S. efforts and foreign and/or international efforts for criminal prosecution should go forward at the same time so as each can help the other advance as fast as practicable.<br /><br /><strong>State licensing complaints</strong><br /><br />Complaints to state licensing authorities for psychologists and lawyers were examined as a means to sanction those who are considered to have broken the law and betrayed their professional oaths. <br /><br /><strong>Political will for prosecution</strong><br /><br />Many people were shocked by the tactics used by police against demonstrators at the Denver and St. Paul political conventions. It appears that room for dissent in the United States has been significantly narrowed. Notwithstanding this state of affairs, ideas for action to build the political will for criminal prosecution of American war criminals abounded. A march of lawyers on the Justice Department - taking inspiration from the lawyers in Pakistan - was suggested to assert the need to take back the Justice Department and have it now enforce the law instead of flout it. Creative methods of demonstrations by diverse groups to encourage criminal prosecution were discussed. T-shirt campaigns, support of local and national candidates, a plethora of ideas blossomed in the discussions.<br /><br />To help in thinking about 17 specific directions in which efforts could go, it was proposed that a Central Committee be created to try to coordinate the diverse activities related to developing more political will and developing the criminal prosecutions. Participants at the conference are reaching out to persons and organizations who have been fighting to support the rule of law the past eight years in civil cases or in political action, in order to help all aspects of the effort to criminally prosecute these high-level civilians and generals. The Central Committee has already held its first telephone conference and links are being developed with all organizations and persons of goodwill who will support this effort.<br /><br />While many thought that prosecutions would now have to wait until the next administration, none thought that a future Republican of Democratic Administration could be counted on to pursue criminal prosecution. The need for citizens to take up the call and pressure the powers at the local, state and national level to
 take up criminal prosecution and/or impeachment was acutely felt.<br /><br />It became abundantly clear to all present that &quot;the whole world is watching&quot; efforts in the United States to bring U.S. high-level civilians and/or generals to justice through criminal prosecution. These ordinary citizens appeared willing to take up the challenge - even if it takes years - of building the political will and getting the successful prosecutions completed. We must remember that there is no statute of limitations for murder and for many international crimes. Rather than despair, the participants recognized that they need to be determined, disciplined, and prepared to deal with agents provocateurs used by brilliant adversaries in this effort. <br /><br /><em>Benjamin Davis is a professor at the University of Toledo College of Law</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.lums.edu.pk/law_and_policy/faculty_profile.php?fp_id=17">Moeen Cheema</a>, professor of Law &amp; Policy at the Lahore University of Management Sciences in Lahore, Pakistan, says that in the wake of the election of Pakistan People&#39;s Party co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari as the President of Pakistan, the country&#39;s vaunted lawyer&#39;s movement may be dying a slow death without realizing its goal of restoring all the judges dismissed by former President Pervez Musharraf after the November 2006 proclamation of emergency...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/pakistanflaglong.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>fter the big bang of the 'Long March' in June, the lawyers' movement appears to have died down to a whimper, especially in the aftermath of the election of Asif Ali Zardari, co-chairman of the Pakistan Peoples' Party (PPP), as the President of Pakistan. The lawyers appear to have been divided along party line with those supporting the PPP not just staying on the sidelines but vocally opposing the continuation of the movement. Others are simply suffering from fatigue and disillusionment. <br /><br /><strong>Traitors to the Cause?</strong><br /><br />The proverbial stab in the heart, however, has come at the hands of several of those judges whose restoration has been a key demand of the lawyers' movement. In pursuit of an unadulterated principle of rejection of all actions undertaken by an unconstitutional military regime the lawyers' movement, or what was left of it after the departure of the pro-PPP lawyers, has stuck to the demand that the judiciary be restored to its pre-Emergency stature and composition. This would entail the reinstatement of all the dismissed judges as well as the removal of all thosee new appointees who took oath under the Provisional Constitution Order (PCO). <br /><br />The PPP-led government has instead favored a compromise dictated by the backers of General (Retd.) Musharraf, who appear to have secured his resignation on the terms that his 'extra-constitutional' actions shall be indemnified. As a result, the government has proposed the re-appointment of judges removed during the Emergency, if they subject themselves to the administration of a fresh oath. At the same time, the government has proclaimed that the judges who accept reappointment on these terms shall have their seniority restored.<br /><br />This business of fresh oaths and restored seniorities is a messy affair, at least as far as strict legal logic is concerned. If new oaths are administered then these judges are being reappointed, meaning thereby that they are junior to those judges who earlier took oaths under the PCO promulgated during the Emergency period. Granting them seniority over the PCO judges thus defies reasoning. It must also be appreciated that by accepting a fresh oath these judges are conceding that they were rightfully (if not rightly) dismissed in the first place. Hence, their acceptance of this oath is a betrayal for those who admired their stance in refusing to take an oath under the PCO late last year and who have protested for their reinstatement all these months. <br /><br />Most importantly, the government's plan appears likely to dissuade the most unwanted of the judges, especially the CJ, from accepting reappointment on such humiliating terms. This will enable the government to argue that it offered 'reinstatement' (read reappointment) to all judges. In reality, it is making an offer that they cannot accept.<br /><br />The recent refusal of the PCO judges incumbent in the Supreme Court to accord seniority to the reappointed judges brings more dismay to the persistent adherents of the lawyers' movement: such wrangling over the privileges of office is likely to further lower the esteem of the judiciary. Nonetheless, the ignominy of the judiciary, of the PCO ilk or of the re-inducted kind, may at the same time bring home to everyone the need for an independent, impartial and dignified judicial branch.<br /><br /><strong>Political or Legal Accountability?</strong> <br /><br />While the advisors of General (Retd.) Musharraf had predicted such an outcome when proposing the imposition of the state of emergency last November, such a successful dismantling of a movement with populist tendencies could never have been achieved under a military-backed regime. Democratic forces have yet again achieved an anti-democratization victory which the military rulers of this country have only wished for but never attained. <br /><br />Behind the near-nauseating repetition of 'elected' pedigrees of government personalities there exists a deep democratic deficit which the recent elections, electioneering and 'governmenteering' have managed to reduce only at the margins. Most disturbingly, the promises that propelled the two major political parties to their electoral triumphs have so quickly been trashed, especially by the PPP whose ministers' public statements on the issue of the restoration of the judiciary cannot be differentiated from those of the ministers in the last period of General Musharraf's rule.<br /><br />The betrayal of the manifestos is not confined to the issue of the judiciary alone. Just as in 1989, we appear to have entered another era of political infighting and unaccountable governance. While the heads of various political parties are emitting congenial noises, their acts speak differently. Contrary to the stated consensus on the restoration of a parliamentary form of government amongst political parties, the election of the head of the PPP as president ensures that the presidency shall de facto remain the vortex of power. The new president may now retain, even de jure, the powers that his much-maligned predecessor enjoyed. <br /><br />Most significantly, if the government's imperviousness to the public sentiment voiced during the lawyers' movement is any indication, we are witnessing another period of civilian rule that is tantamount to an 'elective dictatorship.' The most significant policies are being made, by all accounts, not in the chambers of Parliament by elected representatives but in the corridors of real power. As a character in a film once summed it up, there are only three real players in Pakistani politics: Army, Allah and America. An elected president, who is vulnerable on many counts, including serious charges of corruption, is as good a puppet as an unelected president desperately in search of legitimacy. Such is the great game!<br /><br />While there is no hope for meaningful political accountability of the governors, the limited legal accountability that judicial review of legislation and executive action that the judiciary may intermittently supply acquires a messianic aura. Such is the failure of accountability in the Pakistani state that those unelected judges who, after years of subservience to the dictates of a military regime, chose to offer some resistance are celebrated and put on a golden pedestal. And yet, despite an acknowledgment of the popular support offered to them, the fact that so many of them fold so meekly in the face of <em>realpolitik</em>, speaks more about the brutality of that reality than the characters of the men facing it.<br /><br /><br /><em>Moeen Cheema is an Assistant Professor of Law &amp; Policy at the Lahore University of Management Sciences in Lahore, Pakistan</em><br /><br /><iframe src="/related/moeencheema.php" frameborder='0' width='100%' height='140' scrolling='no' valign='top' marginheight='3'></iframe><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/faculty/researchpost.php?postid=427">Haider Ala Hamoudi</a> of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law says that the new Iraqi provincial elections law&#39;s creation of a commission to determine the appropriate power-sharing arrangement for the northern Kirkuk region may actually hinder progress towards a more comprehensive solution of the extraordinarily complex problem in multi-ethnic governance that Kirkuk has become...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/hamoudi.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>n the heralded new Provincial Elections Law of Iraq, it seems as if Iraqi politicians have learned an old trick of American politics. When faced with an intractable but very real problem that seems to offer no easy solutions, create a commission to study it. This postpones having to deal with the problem, avoids the necessity of making concessions, and gives at least to the novice eye some indication of progress. Unfortunately, however, it does not deal with the ultimate problem, which is allowed to fester, with uncertain results.<br /><br />Such a commission appears in Article 24 of the new Provincial Elections Law, which concerns the fate of Kirkuk. By way of background, the passage of the law has been delayed for the past several months solely because of Kirkuk. The Kurdish authorities are eager to have elections, believing that this will bring Kirkuk's regional government under even firmer Kurdish control. The Arab and Turkoman populations, the other large population groups in Kirkuk, are resistant. They are suspicious of the good will of the Kurdish controlled executive authority to run free and fair elections in the province. After many months of negotiations, it seems as if Article 24 is the solution, or rather the non-solution, to permit passage of the law and allow provincial elections everywhere else to proceed.<br /><br />Under Article 24, provincial elections in Kirkuk are delayed until the "executive and security authorities, and the positions of public employment" are divided on an equal basis among the three constituent groups that form Kirkuk, with the largest group (almost certainly the Kurds) given the choice to select one of the Governor, Vice Governor or President of the Provincial Council. In order to achieve this, a commission is to be created, composed of two Arabs, two Kurds, two Turkomans and a Christian selected by the representatives of these various groups in the current provincial council. This commission will issue a report by March of 2009 that will outline a mechanism for the sharing of both executive power, and, perhaps equally importantly, positions of public employment, because the use of government positions to distribute largesse to loyalists cannot be underestimated in Iraq. <br /><br />The commission's report will also address the forcible taking of property both before and after Saddam's fall, another very complex and intractable issue, as the Kurdish authorities point to the forcible expulsion of large numbers of Kurds in Saddam's era as disrupting the historic balance of Kirkuk, and Arabs and Turkmen make similar accusations as against the current Kurdish forces. It will also set up a procedure to determine in some fashion who is or is not a resident of Kirkuk through examinations of property records and voter rolls. After receiving the report, the Iraqi Parliament will take necessary steps in accordance with the commission's findings and then enact a law concerning elections in Kirkuk. Thus, the matter is safely delayed for six months, as the commission goes to work.<br /><br />Only a determined optimist would hold even the slightest prospect that the actual work of the commission will lead to some sort of comprehensive solution to the extraordinarily complex problem that Kirkuk has become. The notion that of the hundred of thousands of residents who have complained of forced government expropriation of their homes, both by the former Arab government and by the current, Kurdish authorities, can be dealt with in a six month study is difficult to accept. Even the simpler stuff of dispute, such as how to divide power in the executive branch, requires more compromise and less study. As a result, Article 24 has been largely ridiculed in Iraqi press and in my own private conversations with Iraqi officials, almost never defended on this basis.<br /><br />Government officials will, however, at least in private, raise a second defense in favor of the commission. While this was obviously a stalling tactic, they argue there was a deep and pressing need to proceed with the provincial elections elsewhere in the country. Local, elected Sunni representation in particular is fundamental to having legitimate Sunni control of the Sunni dominated provinces such as the formerly restive Anbar. Even Shi'a areas in Iraq's south chafe at what they perceive to be Baghdad's unwarranted interference in local affairs. Provincial elections help to ensure that local officials with some level of electoral legitimacy will be able to counterbalance this concern. (By contrast, in the Kurdish region, the elections are all but meaningless as two authoritarian parties in the region, led respectively by Jalal Talabani and Masoud Barzani, have a stranglehold on Kurdish politics and divide power between them rather than contest each other. As a result, given that the elections will only confirm the obvious, I have found very few Kurds outside of the government who actually care about participating in these elections.)<br /><br />There is some merit to this position, and certainly, between provincial elections without a Kirkuk solution or no provincial elections at all, the former is the far better option. Yet I cannot help but feel that these are insufficient alternatives, and that momentum towards a more comprehensive solution towards Kirkuk may have been lost by yet another postponement of its ultimate resolution. Without the pressure of provincial elections, Iraqi politicians may continue to wish to defer Kirkuk indefinitely, and at some point, the Kurds, for whom the annexation of Kirkuk to the Kurdish autonomous region is of central importance, will become impatient and demand a solution. That danger is as real today as it was before the enactment of the Provincial Elections Law. This law, for all of its benefits, only postpones the day of reckoning. <br /><br /><br /><em>Haider Ala Hamoudi is a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.stcl.edu/faculty-dir/Geoffrey_Corn.htm">Geoffrey S. Corn</a>, Lt. Col. US Army (Ret.), a former Special Assistant to the Judge Advocate General for Law of War Matters and currently a professor at South Texas College of Law, says that Salim Hamdan&#39;s recent military commission trial - in which he was called as an expert witness for the defense - should remind us that true legitimacy for the US military commissions has never been and will never be defined by the role of the military in the commission process, but instead by the process that civilian leaders create for that role...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/geoffreycornnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he trial of Salim Hamdan reminded us once again of the struggle to establish a legitimate judicial process for trying alleged war criminals. Many commentators were surprised at the seemingly favorable outcome of the trial, citing it as compelling evidence that the government had overplayed its hand by creating the military commissions. Others pointed to the result as evidence that the military commission process is indeed fundamentally fair. While there may be merit for both, these citations to the <em>Hamdan</em> result, has raised a new question about the military commissions: can the professionalism of participants in the process cure the fundamental defects of the process itself? <br /><br />My involvement in Hamdan's trial forced me to contemplate this question as never before. Called as an expert witness by the defense, I played a relatively minor role in the proceeding. But as someone who served this nation in uniform for twenty-one years, testifying in the first contested military commission prosecution on behalf of an admitted al Qaeda operative led me to reflect a great deal on how the trial and the military commissions in general reflected on the core values that always motivated my sense of patriotism and love of the military legal profession.<br /><br />If the outcome of Hamdan's trial is evidence of the credibility of the commission process, it is primarily the result of the professional and ethical conduct of the participants in that process. Nothing about the result has, in my opinion, altered the fundamental defects of a system conceived by the President and endorsed by Congress. But what the trial has done is to raise a very difficult question: can the professionalism of the participants in that process effectively nullify the fundamental defects with the process itself?<br /><br />To suggest this is not a difficult question is to ignore the realities of military justice writ large. From the outset of the military commission debate, criticism of the process has come from many military legal experts. But even the most vociferous critics among this group have always recognized that the saving grace of this process might very well be the integrity and professionalism of the participants. Hamdan's trial confirmed this. In many respects, the Hamdan trial was a model of legal ethics: a military judge exercising independent judgment and issuing rules based on his understanding of the law; a prosecution determined to apply the law handed them by Congress; and a defense team determined to challenge the government as zealously as possible. Perhaps most significant, however, was the obvious integrity of the military jury. The outcome of the trial speaks for itself and rebuts any assertion that commission juries would simply "rubber stamp" government allegations. Instead, the jury followed the instructions of the military judge and tailored a finding and sentence which they believed was supported by the facts and the law. The result shocked many observers for its leniency.<br /><br />But does all this prove that the military commission system is fundamentally fair and legally legitimate? To answer "yes" without careful consideration of why the case turned out as it did would be about as overbroad as the Military Commission Act itself. What the outcome really proves is that the Military Commission Act has thrust the participants in this process in the untenable position of attempting to achieve justice while operating within a flawed legal framework. The most visible example of this is the scope of conduct condemned by that law as "war crimes" and Hamdan's conviction for material support to terrorism - conduct that according to most experts falls outside this definition. <br /><br />The Military Commissions Act clearly indicates that the Commission is vested with jurisdiction over only one category of criminal offenses: war crimes. Nonetheless, the actual criminal prohibitions of the Act extend well beyond that category of offenses, and encompass crimes that have never before been considered within that realm. This was unfortunate for Hamdan, for he was convicted of the purported war crime of material support to terrorism. Was it appropriate for the government to charge him with that offense? It is difficult to argue otherwise when Congress explicitly provided for such charges in the statute. Should the defense have challenged the legitimacy of such a charge? In fact they did so, arguing that it was not within the jurisdiction of the commission because it was not a "war crime." In ruling that the offenses were within the jurisdiction of the commission because they had been defined in the MCA, the military judge exposed the fundamental dilemma of the military commission process: whose role is it to decide that law itself extends beyond the limits of legitimacy?<br /><br />This did, of course, leave to the members &#8212; or jurors - the factual determination of whether the conduct occurred within the context of an armed conflict, an element of proof for every offense subject to the jurisdiction of the commission. That question was the focus of my testimony as part of the defense effort to discredit the allegation that conduct that pre-dated the terror attacks of September 11th fell into this category. I offered an opinion based on an <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1083849">article</a> about to be published in the <em>Temple Law Review</em> that the best indicator of armed conflict between states and transnational non-state organizations is the nature of the authority granted to the armed forces. When that authority permits targeting based solely on determination of an individual's status, it is an indicator of armed conflict because it is an inherent invocation of the principle of military objective.<br /><br />The fact that the Military Commissions Act leaves this question to the finder of fact raises serious questions of legitimacy. If, as the Congress indicated in the pre-amble to the Act itself, jurisdiction of the military commissions is limited to war crimes, determining whether conduct occurred in the context of an armed conflict should not be treated as a factual element. Jurisdiction is a quintessential question of law, and there is no logical explanation why such a critical question is left to the finder of fact, to be determined on a case by case basis with potentially disparate outcomes for different defendants. <br /><br />No level of ethical or professional conduct by the participants in the process can offset such a defect. This, in my opinion, is the true significance of the Hamdan result. Did the defense aggressively challenge the allegation that Hamdan's pre-9/11 conduct occurred in the context of an armed conflict? Yes. Did the military judge permit the defense to present evidence on that question? Yes. Did the jurors receive an instruction that they were required to make this factual determination? Yes. Did the jurors demonstrate a commitment to following the instructions they were given? Yes. None of this altered the fundamental fact that a question essential to the legitimate jurisdiction of a military tribu
nal was left to the jury.<br /><br />There is, of course, one other participant in the process: the prosecutor. It is axiomatic that penultimate duty of the prosecutor is to seek justice. Justice Jackson's famous address after assuming the position of Attorney General captured the immense significance of this duty:<blockquote>Your positions are of such independence and importance that while you are being diligent, strict, and vigorous in law enforcement you can also afford to be just. Although the government technically loses its case, it has really won if justice has been done.</blockquote>There has been much debate regarding whether the military commission system divests the prosecutor of the broad discretion traditionally associated with that position, and I will leave that question to others. But even assuming <em>arguendo</em> genuine prosecutorial discretion, the Military Commission Act itself raises a difficult ethical question: how to exercise that discretion when the range of potential offenses leads the prosecutor into uncharted waters? While scholars have engaged in healthy debates on whether an armed conflict between the United States and al Qaeda can exist and if so, when the armed conflict commenced, the Military Commission Act thrust the prosecutor into the difficult position of making this judgment not in theoretical terms but as an essential predicate to criminal prosecution. How do we define when "justice is done" in relation to such a complex decision?<br /><br />I testified on behalf of Hamdan because I believed the government had overreached when it charged pre-9/11 crimes of al Qaeda operatives as war crimes. Because of the breadth of the Military Commissions Act, I find it difficult to question the propriety of laying such an allegation. But this, in my mind, just confirms that no matter how ethical the efforts of all the participants in the process might be, the conditions set by the Military Commission Act will inevitably lead to illegitimate results.<br /><br />The Hamdan outcome has been hailed as victory by both sides in the case. The government won their first war crimes conviction in an outcome that bolstered the legitimacy of the use of military courts for such trials. The defense achieved an outcome on both findings and sentence that defied widespread expectations of draconian outcomes for alleged al Qaeda operatives. But if Hamdan proves anything, it is only the credibility of military juries and the professionalism of the lawyers and judges dealt the unenviable task of operating within a flawed system. In the final analysis, Hamdan was convicted of a war crime not because his conduct fell into a well established category of conduct prohibited by international law during armed conflict, but simply because Congress took a crime never before considered a war crime and gave it that title. Thus, what Hamdan really reminds us of is that true legitimacy for the military commissions has never been and will never be defined by the role of the military in the process, but instead by the process that our civilian leaders create for that role. <br /><br /><br /><em>Geoffrey S.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.nyu.edu/centers/adminofcriminallaw/facultyandstaff/executivedirector/index.htm"><strong>Anthony S. Barkow</strong></a> [voluntary consultant, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org">Human Rights First</a>]: &quot;The fair administration of criminal justice requires prosecutors to exercise their power and discretion to do justice and defense lawyers who are zealous and effective.  I was in Guantanamo Bay late last month to observe pretrial hearings in the case of <u>United States vs. Mohammed Jawad</u> [HRF <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/detainees/cases/jawad.htm">backgrounder</a>].  The proceedings raised serious concerns about prosecutorial discretion in military tribunals, even as they demonstrated that effective defense representation is possible. <br /><br />Jawad is accused of throwing a hand grenade into a military vehicle in Afghanistan in 2002 and injuring two soldiers and a translator.  He was16 years old at the time of the offense.  According to his lawyer, Air Force Maj. David Frakt, Jawad is &quot;the first child soldier, along with [Omar Ahmed] Khadr [who is also facing charges here in a separate case] to be tried for war crimes in the history of the world, and faces life imprisonment.&quot;  <br /><span style="font-style:italic;"><br />The Prosecutors</span><br /><br />The proceedings in Jawad&#39;s began with the court addressing the recent resignation of the case&#39;s lead prosecutor, Army Reserve Lt. Col. Darrel Vandeveld.  Vandeveld is the fourth known Guantanamo prosecutor to have resigned.<br /><br />Vandeveld submitted a declaration to the court on September 24 giving notice of his resignation and stating he had &quot;ethical qualms about continuing to serve as a prosecutor.&quot; &quot;I am highly concerned, to the point that I believe I can no longer serve as a prosecutor at the Commissions, about the slipshod, uncertain &#39;procedure&#39; for affording defense counsel discovery.  [D]iscovery in even the simplest of cases is incomplete or unreliable,&quot; he wrote.  He added that the discovery problems &quot;are not only appalling, they deprive the accused of basic due process and subject the well-intentioned prosecutor to claims of ethical misconduct.&quot;  He concluded that &quot;[p]otentially exculpatory evidence&quot; that &quot;we have an obligation as prosecutors and officers of the court [to disclose] has not been made available to the defense.&quot;<br /><br />Vandeveld testified via videoconference on September 26, and chronicled his transformation over the past year from a &quot;true believer&quot; into one &quot;truly deceived.&quot;  He described &quot;systemic problems&quot; creating logistical chaos within the prosecutors&#39; office which, in his opinion, make it impossible for prosecutors even to locate all materials relevant to the case.  He opined that the problems are so entrenched they &quot;cannot be remedied at this late date.&quot;<br /><br />The previous day, a government interrogator testified that, under interrogation, Jawad had complained he was &quot;more or less forced&quot; to throw the grenade by an &quot;older man&quot; who &quot;did not give him the option to back out&quot; after he &quot;got cold feet.&quot;  Jawad&#39;s attorney, Maj. Frakt, has suggested that an Afghan militia group deceptively recruited by financial inducement the impoverished Jawad, drugged him, and forced him to be present during the incident.  <br /><br />Vandeveld testified that a government intelligence analyst report backing up this claim &#8212; the report found the militia group targets young men, sexually abuses them, and drugs them before forcing them to engage in violence &#8212; had not yet been disclosed to the defense.  He further revealed that the prosecution had failed to disclose information about another man who had confessed to the same crime.  Vandeveld attributed these two non-disclosures to the prosecution&#39;s endemic disorganization.<br /><br />In his declaration, Vandeveld further explained that he advocated a plea agreement for Jawad to serve a short additional sentence, with rehabilitation so that he could reintegrate into Afghan or Pakistani society.  But defense lawyers in Guantanamo describe the line prosecutors as having no discretion to exercise independent judgment.  And Vandeveld&#39;s supervisors prohibited him from extending such an offer.<br /><br />As news of the Vandeveld declaration broke earlier in the week, Brig Gen. Thomas W. Hartmann &#8212; whom Military Judge Steven Henley previously ordered off the Jawad case -- issued talking points designed to discredit Vandeveld.  Frakt said in court that Vandeveld feared &#8212; and had already experienced &#8212; reprisals after making his allegations.  If the alleged intimidation effort occurred, it may have worked:  Vandeveld initially refused to testify, invoking his privilege against self-incrimination, demanding legal representation, and requesting immunity from prosecution.  By the end of the week, Vandeveld reversed course and testified, but went out of his way to sprinkle his testimony with praise for Hartmann and the chief prosecutor.<br /><br />Filling Vandeveld&#39;s shoes is his former deputy, who has not prosecuted a case since 1995 and who has not been in a courtroom since 2000 (and whose experience seems to consist significantly of prosecuting petty drug and alcohol related cases on military property), and a new junior prosecutor just assigned to the case.  (By contrast, in civilian life, Vandeveld is a career prosecutor in Pennsylvania).  This new prosecution team may be in over its head.  On the first day of the week&#39;s proceedings, the court censured the team more than once for being unprepared.  At one point, the junior prosecutor essentially asked the court to explain how best to prosecute the case.  <br /><br />On the final day of proceedings, more serious infirmities surfaced.  A prosecution witness, &quot;Gunnery Sgt. M&quot; admitted destroying exculpatory evidence.  The defense accused the prosecutors of sanctioning Sgt. M&#39;s act.  An evidentiary hearing was held immediately.  Although Sgt. M&#39;s testimony mutated throughout the hearing, he stated under oath several times that he told the prosecutors that he would &quot;destroy&quot; or &quot;get rid of&quot; the evidence.  The prosecutors insisted that they did not understand Sgt. M to have said that to them.  In the end, Judge Henley found that the prosecutors had no advance knowledge of Sgt. M&#39;s intention, and no ethical violation had occurred. <br /><br />It is a fundamental precept of American criminal justice that prosecutors must disclose all material, exculpatory information &#8212; called &quot;Brady material&quot; &#8212; to the defendant.  Prosecutors and agents must be able effectively to collect, organize, and search materials in order to discharge their disclosure obligations.  They must supervise agents and witnesses to ensure that exculpatory evidence is preserved.  Decisions whether to disclose Brady material are virtually always made autonomously by the prosecution.  And prosecutorial discretion to enter into plea agreements and otherwise dispose of cases is critical.  Thus, for prosecutors to discharge these duties, they must have experience, good judgment, and a strong ethical base. <br /><br />Frakt suggested in court that the problems in Jawad&#39;s case result from top-down political pressure on line prosecutors.  The specter of such pressure, particularly with Hartmann managing the response to Vandeveld&#39;s resignation despite his removal from these cases, undermines one&#39;s confidence in the military commission system.  The fact that, despite having 6 years to prepare its case before charging Jawad, the government cannot locate all relevant materials further lessens that confidence.  And the possibility that the new prosecution team, which faces the same intractable logistical problems that caused Vandeveld to resign, may lack necessary experience does nothing to reassure.  <br /><br />If it is true that the government&#39;s lack of organization renders it unable to comply with its disclosure obligations, and that line prosecutors in Guantanamo have no ability to exercise discretion, defendants will not receive information to which they are entitled, and the cases will barrel forward without meaningful and consistent evaluation by those who are closest to them and know them best.<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Defense Lawyers</span><br /><br />It is also a foundation of the American criminal justice system that an accused has a right to defense lawyer.  To be effective, that defense lawyer must be able to forge a relationship of trust with the client.<br /><br />The history surrounding the Guantanamo detainees&#39; treatment makes the establishment of attorney-client relationships extremely difficult and often impossible.  The detainees have been held in captivity for years.  Some have been subjected to torture, and many have endured abuse.  Even the Bush Administration has confirmed the use of &quot;alternative&quot; interrogation techniques on the high value detainees held in secret CIA custody, including&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;in at least two cases&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;waterboarding.<br /><br />Courts here have found that some of this mistreatment was at the hands of U.S. officials.  All of the appointed military counsel here dress in the same uniforms, which makes it almost impossible for military defense counsel to forge meaningful relationships with their clients.  Quite likely, at least some detainees view their appointed military counsel as identical to, or as extensions of, those who abused them and who currently are their jailers.  Quite likely, they see their lawyers as inexorably untrustworthy, because they answer to and follow the commands of their superiors &#8212; those same superiors who, in the detainees&#39; view, have ordered their abuse and detention.<br /><br />In this environment -- and likely also in light of many detainees&#39; express and intense hostility toward the United States -- it is not surprising that most detainees refuse to allow the military lawyers to represent them. Their hostility extends, too, to the pro bono civilian counsel appointed by the court:  because they are American and because they are appointed by military judges, the detainees typically reject them.<br /><br />Maj. Frakt is one defense lawyer who has succeeded in this atmosphere.  As noted, Jawad was a teenager when he was captured, and he has now spent a quarter of his life detained at Guantanamo. He has attempted suicide, and he was severely abused.  In 2004, Jawad was subjected to the euphemistically-named &quot;frequent flyer&quot; interrogation program, which was designed to make its victims &quot;more compliant and break down their resistance to interrogation.&quot;  Under this program, Jawad was moved from cell to cell 112 times in 14 days, on average once every three hours.  He was shackled and unshackled as he was moved.  Judge Henley has ruled that, at the time Jawad was subjected to this treatment, he &quot;was of no intelligence value to any government agency.  The infliction of the &#39;frequent flyer&#39; technique . . . thus had no legitimate interrogation purpose.&quot;<br /><br />Likely as a result of all of this, Jawad entered these proceedings refusing to participate.  During an early court appearance, he banged his head repeatedly against the defense table, refusing to speak or wear headphones to listen to court interpreters.<br /><br />But over time Frakt has built a relationship of trust with Jawad. Jawad listens to Frakt&#39;s advice, and he is benefiting from Frakt&#39;s representation. Frakt has scored several major legal victories in Jawad&#39;s case: Recently Judge Henley ordered that Hartmann disassociate from the case, and late last month, Frakt convinced Judge Henley that the government cannot rely solely on Jawad&#39;s status as an enemy combatant to prove the act of throwing a hand grenade violated the laws of war. When the latter ruling was discussed in court, the prosecution appeared stymied.  Indeed, based on the colloquy, it appeared quite possible that the government now might be unable to prove its case.  And Frakt has won the court&#39;s respect:  Only half-jokingly, when Judge Henley admonished Frakt to speak more slowly, the judge expressed that he &quot;enjoys listening to [Frakt] speak in court.&quot;<br /> <br />* *  *<br /><br />Most of the line attorneys in Guantanamo &#8212; prosecutors and defense counsel alike &#8212; seem earnest, professional, and well-meaning.  But they are practicing within a flawed, ad hoc system.  Although relationships like Frakt&#39;s with Jawad generate some hope of effective lawyering, one must remember that Jawad&#39;s is only one case, and even Frakt has absolutely no relationship with his other client, Ali Hamza al-Bahlul.<br /><br />As for the prosecutors?  As the Supreme Court once said of federal prosecutors:  <blockquote>The United States Attorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done. As such, he is in a peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the law, the twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer. He may prosecute with earnestness and vigor-indeed, he should do so. But, while he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones. It is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one.</blockquote><br />There have been and still are courageous prosecutors here in Guantanamo.  But they appear to work in an irreparably disorganized logistical environment, and by many indications are not given the discretion or independence from political influence required to exercise their power in accordance with the Supreme Court&#39;s famous admonition.&quot;<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Report from Guantanamo&quot; is a regular column written by <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org">Human Rights First</a>.<br />

		<title>Turkey&#039;s headscarf ban prevents advance of Islamist agenda to undermine pluralism</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Farzana Hassan</strong> [President, <a href="http://www.muslimcanadiancongress.org/">Muslim Canadian Congress</a>]: &quot;The Muslim Canadian Congress, in welcoming the decision of the Constitutional Court of Turkey to <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/turkish-constitutional-court-publishes.php">disallow the lifting of the ban on hijabs</a>, viewed it as a significant triumph of secularism over repressive Islamist practices.  The court recently ruled that amendments to the constitution by the ruling AKP in an effort to permit hijabs in universities would amount to rendering &quot;nonfunctional the basic features of the republic.&quot; At the core of this decision is the recognition that the hijab continues to be a tool of oppression for Muslim women, severely undermining their right to express their faith in their own unique and personal way, if they so desire.   <br /><br />Faith and its expression must be a matter of personal choice rather than something that is handed down as a &quot;categorical imperative&quot; through a system of belief that is repressive and outmoded in its inward and outward manifestations. While the decision of the Constitutional Court of Turkey may restrict the rights of women who claim to have  adopted the hijab of their own free will, one must question the authenticity of such claims through a process unearthing some of the repressive religious underpinnings of such decisions. It is the same suspicion over the authenticity, or lack of it, that European lawmakers have chosen to restrict the use of religious headgear in public institutions. <br /><br />One would need assurances for example, that women who reject the hijab would not be subjected to coercion in the matter, simply because the orthodoxy considers it a religious requirement. The lifting of the ban would have empowered the fundamentalist Islamic forces, resulting in the marginalization and oppression of women, reducing their role in society to one of subservience and subjugation. This would be tantamount to providing leverage to the religious right in their unrelenting attempts at enforcing compliance for the practice where it is not voluntary. <br /><br />Traditional Muslims often bristle at such criticism by downplaying the social pressures faced by women who reject the hijab. This, however, is a gross  misrepresentation of reality. Even women who supposedly opt for it, do so because they are rarely if ever exposed to an alternative exegesis on the issue, which does not regard the hijab as a requirement. Women&#39;s &quot;choice&quot; in the matter can be considered authentic only if they are exposed to other narratives on modesty, which do not entail the covering of the hair. <br /><br />Turkey as a modern state and last bastion of secular Islam, must continue to uphold its tradition of the separation of religion and state. The headgear or hijab is a political tool and a threat to Turkey&#39;s long secular tradition. Currently, there is tremendous pressure on secular women to cover up according to orthodox requirements, even in large cities. The present government has also attempted to eliminate the secular dress code in government offices. It has taken a slower, steadier path, careful not to jolt the establishment too quickly while at the same time floating an occasional trial balloon for social reforms to advance the Islamist agenda. <br />Islamism, quite distinct from Islam, is a fascist ideology that needs to be countered with equal force, blow for blow, at each step of its numerous incursions into civil society. It strikes at the foundational principles of liberal and secular democracies, seeking eventually to undermine cherished values of freedom, pluralism and egalitarianism. Just at the time as Islamists are relying on the pluralism card to advance their religious agenda, they are making plans to eventually kill any other competing worldview.   <br /><br />Muslim and non-Muslim dalliance with pluralism to allow the spread of Islamism is misguided. They are scantly aware of the Islamists&#39; long term agenda to establish an orthodox form of Islam which allows no dissent whatsoever. Proponents of pluralism must recognize that the two philosophies are mutually contradictory at practically every step of the game, and cannot possibly form the basis of a genuine relationship based on universal humanistic principles.&quot;<br />

It focused on the U.S. Constitution as the cornerstone document that supports all other laws, and the need for Congress to actively push back against the Executive branch in order to maintain the constitutional doctrine of separated powers. <br /><br />In his <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/testimony.cfm?id=3550&wit_id=7407">testimony</a>, former congressman Mickey Edwards (R-OK) urged Congress to do more to prevent executive overreach. Citing signing statements, the state secrets privilege, and warrantless wiretapping, Representative Edwards addressed the Legislative branch, saying: &quot;You are not a parliament; you are a Congress &#8212; separate, independent, and equal. And because of that you are the principal means by which the people maintain control of their government. Defend that right, and that obligation, or you lose all purpose in holding these high offices.&quot;<br /><br />Representative Edwards cited Congress&#39; oversight and funding powers as the means by which Congress could restore the proper balance among the branches of government. He serves on the Board of Directors of the <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/">Constitution Project</a> and as a member of its bipartisan <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/libertyandsecurity/index.cfm?categoryId=3">Liberty and Security Committee</a>. The Committee published several reports on separation of powers, with particular regard to <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/pdf/Reforming_the_State_Secrets_Privilege_Statement2.pdf">state secrecy</a>, <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/pdf/NSA_Statement_20071.pdf">domestic surveillance</a>, and <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/pdf/liberty_security_statement_on_prisoner_abuse_5_25_051.pdf">detainee treatment</a>. Additional witnesses included Liberty and Security Committee members <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/testimony.cfm?id=3550&wit_id=7408">Harold Hongju Koh</a>, Dean of Yale Law School, and <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/testimony.cfm?id=3550&wit_id=7415">Suzanne Spaulding</a>, former Chief Counsel for the Senate and House Intelligence Committees.&quot;<br />

		<title>Detention of Uighurs at Guantanamo is inconsistent with US notions of justice</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Moazzam Begg</strong> [former Guantanamo detainee and spokesman for <a href="http://www.cageprisoners.com/">Cageprisoners</a>]: &quot;Few people outside of western China or the neighboring central Asian states of the former Soviet Union have heard of the <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/dc-circuit-extends-stay-of-uighurs.php">Uighurs</a>. I hadn&#39;t heard of them either, until I was held in their company after the launch of &quot;Operation Enduring Freedom&quot; in Kandahar and Bagram detention facilities, Afghanistan, in early 2001, by occupying US forces.<br /><br />In my own ignorance I&#39;d assumed they were Chinese and used to jokingly ask them to teach me kung-fu. The bewildered responses I used to get from them elicited a response that taught me something of their true identity.<br /><br />In the Muslim world they are called &quot;Turkestanis&quot; and are noted for being the forebears of the Turks and their Turkic language, which is still written in the Arabic script. They have a rich and long history and culture which they have been struggling to keep alive in their traditional homeland of East Turkestan (Xinkiang) for centuries.<br /><br />In the wake of the US-led invasion these men - who had escaped the persecution in their own land and sought refuge in neighboring countries - were sold over for bounties of a few thousand dollars by unscrupulous Afghan warlords or Pakistanis seeking the lucrative bounties offered for foreign Muslims by the Bush administration. This was no different to what happened to hundreds of other foreign Muslims in that region. However, the Uighurs were regarded as dissident Chinese, whose cause had previously been - and, ironically still is - approved by the US administration.<br /><br />Comparatively speaking, the detaining US authorities had recognised early on, even by the standards of the Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs) and ensuing Annual Review Boards (ARBs), which determined whether we were still &quot;enemy combatants&quot; or not, that the Uighurs posed little or no threat to the US or its allies. Rather, it was unanimously agreed on both sides that the men faced the very real risk of torture if returned to the Chinese authorities who conveniently claim that since these men are dissident and Muslim, they are by extension dangerous terrorists. <br /><br />In 2006, a woman described as &quot;the most well-known female Chinese dissident&quot; was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Photographs of her recent meetings with President Bush still appear in the world&#39;s press and television screens. But Rabiya Kadeer is a Uighur, who is an ardent campaigner for the rights of her people - which includes around seventeen of the original twenty-two Uighurs still held in Guantanamo.<br /><br />It is a paradox that the only country thus far - which accepted the first five of the Guantanamo Uighurs - is perhaps also the poorest in Europe: Albania.<br /><br />It is also a paradox that despite the recent US court ruling ordering the release of remaining seventeen men to the US (Washington D.C. hosts a small but vibrant community of American Uighurs) -  after seven years without charge or trial - the Bush administration, and the one that follows it, can potentially prolong their incarceration indefinitely. This ruling should be another nail in the coffin of Guant&aacute;namo. But until they are free once again their notion of American justice will remain an oxymoron.&quot;<br />

		<title>Guantanamo&#039;s logistical obstacles frustrate defense counsel and thwart due process</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Commander Suzanne Lachelier</strong> [CDR, JAGC, US Navy; detailed counsel for <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/profiles/ramzi_binalshibh.htm">Ramzi Binalshibh</a>]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/us-military-judge-rules-detainees-not.php">ruling against the defense motion for resources</a> highlights, once again, the obstacles defense counsel face in assisting their clients, whether as full-fledged or as stand-by counsel.  It also underscores the illusory nature of the right to proceed pro se, which the Congress explicitly codified in the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_bills&docid=f:s3930enr.txt.pdf">2006 Military Commissions Act</a> [PDF file].  <br /> <br />The obstacles that the defense&#39;s motions, and the Commission&#39;s adverse ruling, emphasize are greater, and more fundamental, than the absence of internet access for pro se accused.  The commission ruling appears to assume that defense counsel and detainees have direct means of communicating with each other between Guantanamo and the U.S.  They do not, and any direct communication requires defense counsel to travel to Guantanamo.  So, for example, if an accused needs a particular document or case he wishes to cite, he would have to communicate a request for that document via a letter to his defense counsel.  That letter would have to be given to the attorney for the Joint Task Force-Guantanamo, who then delivers it to whichever defense counsel is soonest in Guantanamo to receive it.  Defense counsel would then have to scan the letter (which is presumed to be classified at the &quot;TS&quot; top secret level) in a SCIF on Guantanamo, using only electronic equipment designed to handle classified material.  The letter would then be placed on a secured network, for receipt in a SCIF in Washington, where the accused&#39;s attorney could read it.  Contrary to the Military Judge&#39;s assertion in his ruling, JTF does not allow electronic media (such as thumb drives or disks) to be brought in to the detention camps - so it would be impossible for defense counsel to provide detainees with necessary legal documents in electronic format.<br /> <br />A secured phone line for the accused and counsel, which exists already for counsel representing detainees in habeas proceedings, would solve some of the problems described above in that an accused&#39;s request for information could be expedited - providing him with a document, however, would still entail travel to Guantanamo.  The solution does not lie in assigning counsel to Guantanamo though.  Relocating counsel would only make clients slightly more accessible: meetings are restricted to two times per day during business hours, and only three &quot;high value&quot; detainees can meet with their counsel at any one time (there are around 16 high value detainees represented on Guantanamo). Relocation of counsel would, without a doubt, aggravate the difficulties of getting work done.  Computers available in Guantanamo are so slow, it is virtually impossible to do internet-based legal research; the classified computers are even slower (and only available during business hours), nearly barring the ability to prepare motions on them.  Perhaps more critically, translators are not available on Guantanamo to the defense; they travel, like defense counsel, from various parts of the U.S., and the defense must request their services in advance - so there is no possibility of &quot;hopping over&quot; to the detention facility to visit with a client.<br /> <br />The logistical obstacles prevent defense counsel from serving as the conduit for legal information that the judge&#39;s rulings appear to contemplate.  As outlined, these obstacles are mind-numbing, and far-removed from the provision of actual legal services; indeed, the first &quot;motions&quot; hearing in the 9/11 cases, held in September, only managed to get to addressing these administrative obstacles, and no substantive legal issues in the case.  But that appears to be the point: label the commission proceedings &quot;fair&quot; and &quot;virtually the same as courts-martial&quot; in the media, while bogging down the defense in logistical minutiae that effectively thwart actual due process.&quot;<br />

For decades, environmental laws and regulations - in particular the <a href="http://epw.senate.gov/esa73.pdf">Endangered Species Act</a> [PDF file] - have been treated by the courts as super-statutes that subsume all other legal mandates and competing interests.  Moreover, courts like the Ninth Circuit in the sonar case functionally have ignored traditional principles of equity in environmental cases, automatically granting injunctions against activities that pose even hypothetical harms to species.<br /> <br />This practice is a poor one not just in terms of academic legal theory, but as a matter of tangible, real world policy.  The courts&#39; &quot;species above all else&quot; mindset that leads to injunctions-at-all-costs has blocked projects ranging from a 1970s effort to strengthen New Orleans-area levies to common sense firefighting measures in the Pacific Northwest.  The sonar case, therefore, is about more than the specific national security policy at issue, and is a chance for the Supreme Court to re-establish equilibrium between legitimate environmental protection and other valid interests public and private.&quot;<br />

		<title>Support for pulpit politicking is reckless and misguided</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.au.org/author/boston/"><strong>Rob Boston</strong></a> [senior policy analyst, <a href="http://www.au.org/">Americans United for Separation of Church and State</a>]: &quot;Several of the pastors who took part in the so-called &quot;<a href="/paperchase/2008/09/pastors-challenge-us-ban-on-political.php">Pulpit Freedom Sunday</a>&quot; have been arguing that they have a free speech and freedom of religion right to endorse or oppose candidates from the pulpit. They do - but only if they give up their tax exemption first.<br /> <br />Tax exemption is a benefit, not a constitutional right. It comes with conditions. One of those conditions is a ban on partisan politicking. Tax-exempt groups and houses of worship exist for charitable purposes; their work is not supposed to be political. A church that wants to be political has the option of surrendering its tax exemption.<br /> <br />The law-breaking pastors seem to want all the benefits of tax exemption without meeting any of its conditions. They have been prodded by the <a href="http://www.alliancedefensefund.org/main/default.aspx">Alliance Defense Fund</a> (ADF) to break the law, and that puts them in a dangerous place. They could very well lose their tax-exempt status.<br /> <br />The ADF insists it will defend in court any church that loses it tax exemption. I wonder if these pastors know that precedent is not on their side. In 2000, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled unanimously that the Internal Revenue Service acted within its rights when it revoked the tax-exemption of a New York church that ran a newspaper ad attacking Bill Clinton. In <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=dc&navby=case&no=995097A">Branch Ministries v. Rosotti</a>, the court rejected arguments based on free speech and freedom of religion.<br /> <br />Houses of worship have great freedom in America. Pastors can speak out on issues with no fear. But they must stop short of endorsing or opposing candidates. All 501 (c)(3) organizations - religious and secular - must abide by this rule. It is a reasonable one that keeps our churches, charities and educational groups focused on matters that are not partisan in character and prevents them from acting like political action committees.<br /> <br />The ADF&#39;s recent stunt is reckless and misguided. The pastors who took part may come to rue that decision.&quot;<br />

		<title>Burma prisoner release masks absence of legitimate legal and political reform</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://ratchasima.net/"><strong>Awzar Thi</strong></a> [member, <a href="http://www.ahrchk.net/index.php">Asian Human Rights Commission</a>, Hong Kong]: &quot;Whether the <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/myanmar-junta-to-release-more-than-9000.php">release</a> of some nine thousand prisoners from Burma&#39;s jails last week was an act of self-described goodwill or a strategic manoeuvre by a government preparing the latest phase in its program for continued political control is of little significance when seen against the country&#39;s unchanging legal codes, courts and policing agencies. The excitement over the discharge of star political prisoner U Win Tin, who is a former senior journalist and veteran activist, has not been matched by scrutiny of the laws and institutions that made his long imprisonment possible. <br /> <br />How Burma&#39;s criminal justice agencies have over the last half-century been turned into agencies for injustice is the subject of recent research by the <a href="http://www.alrc.net/">Asian Legal Resource Centre</a>. The Hong Kong-based group has marked the one-year anniversary of the protests last September with a study that links ten cases against alleged protestors and their ringleaders to phased decades-long attacks on a legal system that was once ranked highly in Asia but is now among its worst.  <br /> <br />The study, &quot;<a href="http://www.article2.org/mainfile.php/0703/320/">Saffron Revolution imprisoned</a>, law demented&quot;, reveals the integral yet deeply flawed role that the courts in Burma have played in both guaranteeing and exacerbating nationwide systemic abuse of fundamental human rights. It outlines the executive project to destroy judicial integrity and independence begun in 1962, when General Ne Win seized power, and points to how its consequences are reflected in the behaviour of judges, police and other functionaries today. <br /> <br />Among the common features of the ten cases selected for the study are the absence of rudimentary legal procedure and careless disregard for even minimal standards under domestic law, to say nothing of international norms. Most of the accused were taken and held illegally, some for months, before being brought to court. Little if any evidence has been produced against the defendants, and the police lodging a number of charges admitted that they didn&#39;t know the facts as soldiers had done their work for them. <br /> <br />The case of Khin Moe Aye and Kyaw Soe is indicative. The two were in December accused of holding foreign currency illegally, yet the search that supposedly uncovered the US dollars in their bags was not made until they were already inside the central prison. What then were the grounds for military intelligence officers to waylay them and send them there? And if they were suspected of a crime why were they sent to jail and not a police station as required by law? Whatever the answers to these questions may be, they are not legally coherent ones. <br /> <br />In contrast to the opened doors of the prisons that excited media interest last week, the case of Khin Moe Aye and Kyaw Soe, like those of other Septemberists, is being tried behind closed ones. That to do this contradicts an article of a judiciary law that it itself introduced is no obstacle for a regime that understands legality only in terms of its own exclusive purposes. Its critics must do more to explore and articulate this aspect of its authoritarian rule if they are to make sense of their own agenda, let alone that of the military. Otherwise, there is little to be said about the intermittent liberating of some convicts, just as there is little to be gained from the making of incessant demands for the freeing of detainees who may walk out an open door today, only to walk back in again via the same closed courts tomorrow.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://smallwarsjournal.com/blog/authors/malcolm-nance/bio/"><strong>Malcolm Nance</strong></a> [founding director of the International Anti-terrorism Center for Excellence]: &quot;On Friday the Department of Defense released news of a <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/revised-pentagon-directive-requires.php">revision to the 2005 DoD directive</a> regarding the interrogation of prisoners by a wide range of non-DoD agencies and persons. <br /><br />This recent change, promulgated by Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England on October 9, represents what appears to be a sudden outbreak of common sense in the American captive management and prisoner exploitation program. The latest revision states that trained interrogators from military intelligence will provide mandatory oversight on all interrogations or detentions performed by non-DoD entities - including all US agencies, foreign governments and civilian contractors during military operations. This is a dramatic change.<br /><br />Accountability for interrogations was not always so clear. During the period between September 12, 2001 and October 9, 2008, the military, with explicit authorization from the executive branch, unwisely directed that techniques used at the five Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape schools (SERE) be transformed into a template for creating intelligence mills at Guantanamo, Bagram, Camp Bucca, Abu Ghraib and black sites throughout the world. These techniques, called &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques&quot; amounted to torture and were used to quickly &quot;break&quot; resistant captives in violation of the Geneva Conventions, the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Constitution. <br /><br />Congressional and news media investigations slowly revealed that the White House and DoD sent specific instructions condoning, encouraging and then ignoring abuses conducted by both DoD, non-DoD and foreign governments in the name of the United States. The thinly veiled language of past directives allowed minimal cover for abusers of US military captives and created an environment where interrogations using brutal techniques designed by communist, fascist and totalitarian regimes going back a century were the norm for several years. <br /><br />It should be noted that the information that led to the development of SERE techniques came directly from the blood of American service members held captive by abusive captors since the French and Indian War. Indeed, SERE is a repository of the torture methods of our worst historical enemies. Knowing this, the very same lessons, learned at the hands of the Gestapo, Khmer Rouge, NKVD and North Vietnamese (to name a few) were wholeheartedly embraced for the war on terror. SERE program managers also knew these techniques were actually used by communist and fascist regimes to break the spirit of captives in order to quickly gain false written or oral confessions. False confessions taken under extreme duress were a necessary legal fa&ccedil;ade that would allow a kangaroo court and swift execution of a self-confessed &quot;war criminal.&quot; <br /><br />All the while the White House disregarded the fact that SERE had long ago determined that our enemies never truly gained any intelligence of value no matter how long the captivity or how deep the abuse. <br /><br />Finally, the directive provides another stunning example of what should have been the order of the day in the armed forces and the intelligence community for all operations both before and after the September 11 attacks. The fact that it took seven years to re-embrace the military&#39;s sense of honor on this matter, to doctrinalize integrity in intelligence, and to train and hold other personnel and agencies accountable for murder or abuse is stunning. Secretary England&#39;s directive issues a direct order to all hands, that SERE techniques are removed from the American military mainstream. <br /><br />In the crucial information battle space of the emerging world where al-Qaeda support is greatest, the last eight years of unnecessary and unwarranted abuses have been a horrible failure for the United States military and intelligence. Thanks to our own misguided efforts, al-Qaeda - the mass murderers who systematically vaporized and beheaded Moslems by the thousands, found their bloody outrages eclipsed in world opinion by America&#39;s own moral failing. <br /><br />Secretary England&#39;s clarifying directive is a step forward that may yet again give America the right to claim moral outrage should our people be captured and abused by a future enemy.&quot;<br />

		<title>Ending use of prosecutors as monitors helps keep polling places intimidation-free</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Kristen Clarke</strong> [Co-Director, Political Participation Project, <a href="http://www.naacpldf.org/">NAACP Legal Defense Fund</a>]: &quot;Polling places should be intimidation-free spaces in which all voters are able to freely cast their ballot without interference or obstruction. Both federal law and a number of state laws include provisions that are aimed at ensuring that voters do not face intimidation during elections. The deployment or mere presence of law enforcement, or the prosecutors who work in tandem with them, can have the effect of discouraging and deterring minority voters at the polls on Election Day. Indeed, in those communities where law enforcement officials have had an Election Day presence, citizens believe that the deployments were made with the knowledge of their intimidating impact. The mere presence of criminal prosecutors inside polling places may, in many instances, intimidate the very voters that the Voting Rights Act seeks to protect. <br /><br />Plainly, criminal prosecutors inside the polls can intimidate voters. Indeed, this threat is one that has been acknowledged by the current Administration. As recently as <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/hearing.cfm?id=2434">November 16, 2006</a> [webcast available], former Assistant Attorney General Wan Kim of the Civil Rights Division observed that &quot;[f]ederal prosecutors being involved in voter access issues would lead to intimidation of voters at the polls.&quot; In addition, in <a href="http://www.usccr.gov/calendar/trnscrpt/060608ccr1.pdf">recent testimony</a> before the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, William Welch, Chief of the Public Integrity Section of the Criminal Division acknowledged that &quot;the Civil Rights Division is responsible for protecting the right to vote&quot; while &quot;other Department prosecutors throughout the country...prosecut[e] those who corrupt elections.&quot; Moreover, the well-publicized voter fraud prosecutions mounted by various U.S. Attorney&#39;s Offices in recent years, pursuant to former Attorney General John Ashcroft&#39;s <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2008/July/08-crt-585.html">Ballot Access and Voter Integrity Initiative</a>, makes the chilling effect that criminal prosecutors can have inside the polls clear.<br /><br />The Department&#39;s past use of criminal prosecutors as monitors inside the polls conflict with a number of state statutes that specifically seek to prevent intimidating activity inside of and near polling sites during elections. These statutes intend to prevent any form of undue influence or intimidation that may interfere with a citizen&#39;s free exercise of her right to vote, with a focus on the need to bar law enforcement presence. Collectively, these statutes embody the recognition that the mere presence of any law enforcement activity in or around polling places may have a detrimental effect on the free exercise of the right to vote. And this risk has been met with laws which aim &quot;<a href="http://cha.house.gov/UserFiles/186_testimony.pdf">to insure [an] atmosphere at the polling place [that is] free from intimidation of any sort</a>.&quot; <br /><br />Although the above cited election statutes do not explicitly reference criminal prosecutors, the reality is that Criminal Assistant U.S. Attorneys and other federal prosecutors work in tandem with Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents and other law enforcement personnel to carry out their duties. Particularly in small communities, these criminal prosecutors are easily recognizable and well-known and thus, there is no way to neutralize the public&#39;s perception that the Department&#39;s attorney monitoring efforts are unduly influenced by criminal law enforcement objectives when they should be focused on voter access. Moreover, the Department&#39;s use of criminal prosecutors compounds existing problems of suppression and intimidation already faced by voters. The Civil Rights Division&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/doj-to-stop-sending-prosecutors-to.php">recent announcement</a> that it will terminate the practice of using criminal prosecutors as poll monitors is an important development this election cycle that can help ensure that minority voters are less likely to encounter or face intimidation this November.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/jreynolds/"><strong>Joel Reynolds</strong></a> [Director of Urban Program, <a href="http://www.nrdc.org/">Natural Resources Defense Council</a>]: &quot;In early October, NRDC <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/supreme-court-hears-navy-sonar-sexual.php">argued before the U.S. Supreme Court</a> that executive agencies cannot trump the factual findings of federal district courts and that the district court in our case properly balanced the real harms to whales and other marine mammals from sonar against the alleged harms to the U.S. Navy&#39;s training.  As for the Executive Branch&#39;s overreaching, NRDC strongly believes, and argued before the Court, that the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/ceq/">White House Council on Environmental Quality</a> (CEQ) exceeded its authority in exempting the Navy from the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=browse_usc&docid=Cite:+42USC4321">National Environmental Policy Act&#39;s</a> (NEPA) substantive requirements.  Never before has CEQ found that a district court&#39;s injunction can create emergency circumstances that warrant noncompliance with NEPA.  The White House&#39;s action created a classic conflict between the Executive and Judicial branches of our government, with the Navy endorsing the constitutionally suspect proposition that an executive branch agency can act as a court of errors, reviewing and intervening in a district court&#39;s findings.  Several Justices asked Solicitor General Garre, arguing on behalf of the Navy, whether CEQ has the statutory authority to exempt the Navy from complying with NEPA.  In the past, the Supreme Court has consistently rejected the Executive Branch&#39;s attempts to revise or set aside federal court holdings, doing so just three years after our Nation&#39;s founding in the famous <u>Hayburn&#39;s Case</u>.<br /> <br />NRDC also argued that the evidentiary record fully supports the district court&#39;s finding that the Navy was not harmed by the court&#39;s order because the Navy could still achieve its training goals while implementing common-sense measures that protect marine mammals.  The Justices asked many questions on this point, concerned that the district court may have improperly weighed the competing interests of national security and protection of our environment.  The Supreme Court has consistently upheld federal courts&#39; equitable powers to weigh such competing interests, and, if the Supreme Court follows its precedent, we expect to prevail.  But whatever the outcome, NRDC will continue our efforts, both here in the United States and around the world, to protect these magnificent marine animals from the needless infliction of harm in the oceans.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Bennett H. Klein</strong> [Senior Attorney and AIDS Law Project Director, <a href="http://www.glad.org/">GLAD</a>]: &quot;The <a href="http://www.jud.state.ct.us/external/supapp/Cases/AROcr/CR289/289CR152.pdf">Kerrigan decision</a> [PDF file] is significant as being the third judicial opinion in the country to rule that the <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage violates state constitutional provisions</a>. After the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court&#39;s 2003 <u>Goodridge</u> decision, there was almost a five year gap between the time that California in May and now Connecticut in October joined the ranks of states establishing marriage equality. These recent decisions have created new national momentum for marriage equality. In particular, I think these decisions will help pave the way for legislative gains for marriage equality which have not yet been realized.<br /> <br />I would point to three significant components of the <u>Kerrigan</u> decision. First, in very strong language, the Court declared that in light of the history of discrimination against lesbian and gay people, civil unions have relegated same-sex couples to an &quot;inferior status, declaring them to be unworthy of the institution of marriage,&quot; and sending a message that what same-sex couples have is not as significant as real marriage. Some states may still be tempted to authorize civil unions, rather than marriage, and this decision powerfully describes why a separate status for lesbian and gay citizens, even if it provides important tangible rights, is simply a vestige of past discrimination.<br /> <br />Second, Connecticut now joins California as the second state to rule that sexual orientation discrimination is entitled to heightened scrutiny in equal protection analysis. This is an historic breakthrough as virtually all final appellate courts in the past have rejected this argument. If this trend continues, it will be helpful in eradicating all forms of sexual-orientation-based discrimination, not just discrimination in marriage. Justice Palmer&#39;s majority opinion is the best roadmap to heightened scrutiny I have seen for other courts to follow. <br /> <br />Finally, the <u>Kerrigan</u> decision articulated a powerful point: It is not enough to give lesbian and gay couples <em>equal benefits</em>; the constitution requires <em>equal citizenship</em>.&quot;<a href="http://www.glad.org/"></a><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Carrie L. Davis</strong> [Staff Counsel, <a href="http://www.acluohio.org/">ACLU of Ohio</a>]: &quot;It&#39;s been an eventful week for Ohio voters. <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/ohio-to-proceed-with-absentee-voting.php">Absentee voting began on Tuesday</a>, September 30th. The deadline for registration is Monday, October 6th. And during this one week, courts across the state have ruled on numerous cases relating to voters&#39; access to absentee ballots.<br /> <br />Importantly, every single court has ruled to give the voters more access, not less, to the ballot. Four courts - the Ohio Supreme Court, Northern District Federal Court, Southern District Federal Court, and Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals - all refused to place an unconstitutional &quot;waiting period&quot; on new voters before they can request an absentee ballot. Later in the same week, the Ohio Supreme Court said that absentee ballot requests must be honored, regardless of format differences.<br /> <br />Many across the country are watching this bellweather state and, as a result, every election decision has potentially great consequences. We&#39;re off to a good start if our courts recognize the imporance of maintaining access to the ballot for all eligible voters.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="www.law.unlv.edu/faculty_nancyRapoport.html">Nancy Rapoport</a> of the William S. Boyd School of Law, University of Nevada Las Vegas, says that the current financial crisis reflects a failure on the part of lawmakers and regulators to learn some of the key lessons of the Enron collapse several years ago....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/nancyrapoportnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>n 2002, after Enron had collapsed, Congress scrambled to enact the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in an attempt to shore up market confidence and remove the incentives for future corporate disasters on the scale of Enron, WorldCom, and similar fiascos. Now, it's six years later and we're in an even worse mess. Why? There are a couple of reasons for our current situation: First, you can't separate risk from responsibility without suffering serious adverse consequences. Second, imposing regulations without controlling the improper incentives is a futile activity. <br /><br /><em>Whenever you separate risk from responsibility, you get catastrophic results.</em><br /><br />If we had to pick the theme of the current crisis, it would be that separating the risk of a deal from the deal's potential rewards (if the deal works) or from its adverse consequences (if it fails) leads the dealmakers to take on much more risk than they would if they had to keep those deals on their own books. Consider the components of this particular crisis: First, the government asked lenders to make loans to people who were normally passed over for mortgages at good market rates. (Great idea; but, as we know, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.) Then these subprime mortgages were packaged into securities that were then sold, with less-than-accurate ratings, to third-party entities. Those sub-prime mortgages were based on the theory that people who couldn't qualify for "normal" mortgages with "normal" downpayments or sufficient income would somehow be able to afford an adjustable-rate mortgage that would adjust way above the their true ability to repay. Then we added in a wholly unregulated derivatives market based in part on those poorly conceived securities. Finally, we mixed in the expectation that some combination of market information and regulation would prevent companies from the risks of dramatic undercapitalization. That's the recipe for today's crisis&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;and we're not just eating crow now. <br /><br />Enron's downfall was described as a house of cards, but our current house of cards is a mansion in comparison: one built on a sandbar, awaiting the first ripple of economic downturn before collapsing in on itself. <br /><br />And the group that least suffers the consequences of stunningly bad decisions? That would be the CEOs who manage to lose their companies while retaining the benefits of their golden parachutes. We taxpayers are going to be on the hook for billions, and the failed CEOs are still going to be millionaires. Even the failed Congressional bailout provided that CEOs who seek a governmental handout would still be eligible for a salary of "no more than" $500,000. Did we learn nothing from the Enron crisis? <br /><br />Well, apparently we didn't. But here's what we should have learned:<ul><li> <strong>Rushing into regulation without paying attention to the incentives that the regulation provides is just window-dressing.</strong><br /><br />Just as it did during Enron's fiasco, Congress is rushing to fix the problem out of genuine fear that the failure to do something will lead to the next Great Depression. This current crisis appears far worse than the crisis that Enron and the other corporate scandals of the early 2000s, and time is at a premium. But the actual underlying causes of the crisis are not going to be easy to fix with an omnibus solution. How is Congress to strike the right balance between encouraging innovation to capitalize a company (the smart new ideas) and preventing companies from fully divorcing risk from responsibility (the dumb ideas)? If Congress over-regulates, the economy will lose the ability to move forward after the crisis passes. If Congress under-regulates, we're right back to where we started (or worse).<br /><br />An example? Giving Treasury unfettered, unappealable discretion to fix the crisis&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;thankfully, a proposal that everyone has already shouted down&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;is the same "no risk" idea that got us into trouble in the first place. That type of regulation would create a frightening precedent for handling future crises, even though we might have faith in the two personalities (Bernanke and Paulson) who are urging us to trust them to find the right solution.<br /><br />On the other hand, one of the proposals bubbling up that actually might create incentives for proper behavior is the one that dramatically reduces CEO pay for those companies that make use of the bailout. If a chief executive wants to keep his lucrative pay package, then he should make the choices that will keep his company in the black. Fail to do that, and the executive shouldn't reap big benefits from failure.<br /><br /><li><strong>Don't underestimate greed as a motivator.</strong> <br /><br />Ponzi schemes (which look a lot like many of the deals that have already cratered) have been with us for millennia (even before Ponzi was born). Our best hope is not to eliminate greed from the market. Such an option is just like the old joke about the economist who is stranded on an island with a can of food and no opener. To open the can, the economist will just "assume a can opener." That idea&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;that we can assume the impossible&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;will starve our economy just as it starves the economist in the joke. We can't pretend that greed (or, more nicely put, the drive to make profits in an economy) is going to go away during the crisis. Congress needs to ask itself what unintended consequences are going to come from the bailout, given that companies are going to do everything they legally can to find work-arounds to the regulation.<br /><br /><li><strong>Humans are hard-pressed to learn from their mistakes.</strong><br /><br />Why didn't we learn from Enron? Enron was the very definition of greed run amok&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;of deals that didn't make financial sense and large-scale cover-ups of the failures of those deals to work. We didn't learn from Enron because even the smartest of people have an enormous capacity to fool themselves. Deal-makers who view themselves as the "smartest guys in the room" are not going to be deterred from making fraudulent deals by the threat of criminal sanctions, because they're not going to believe that they could get caught. Even well-intentioned people who think that they're following the law can talk themselves into going forward with a foolish deal because no one else working on the deal is willing to be the one person pointing out that the emperor has no clothes. Desperate people who need to make their budgets will commit to deals that cross the line because of cognitive dissonance&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;the inability to reconcile one's belief that he or she is a good person with the understanding that he or she is doing something really, really awful. A combination of groupthink and cognitive dissonance contributed to Enron's demise, and that combination is likely to do us in here as well, if we're not careful.</ul>Risk must be linked to responsibility, and incentives will always dictate performance. Without a clear understanding of those two principles, no bailout can possibly save us from ourselves.<br /><br /><br /><em>Nancy B. Rapoport is the Gordon &amp; Silver, Ltd.

Bush travels to Ohio, a critical battleground state, to deliver an address that evaluates his administration's impact on the federal judiciary, especially the United States Supreme Court. President Bush's speech will serve as a trenchant reminder of the difficulties created by partisan judicial selection and of how Senator John McCain might approach selection, if elected.<br /><br />Today's conference on the presidency and the courts at which Mr. Bush will speak is sponsored by the Cincinnati Lawyers Chapter of the Federalist Society. The society is a national organization of conservatives and libertarians, who believe that judges should "say what the law is, not what it should be." President Bush has appointed numerous Federalist Society members to the federal bench, while a number of its members have exercised considerable influence in the process for naming judges over the Bush Administration's eight years.<br /><br />The White House has not made public what Mr. Bush will say at the Ohio conference. However, the chief executive will probably tout his success in appointing to the Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justice Samuel Alito, whom many observers consider conservative. The president may concomitantly trumpet analogous success in confirming like-minded judges to the U.S. Courts of Appeals. The twelve regional circuits are essentially the courts of last resort for 99 percent of appeals filed in their geographic areas because the Supreme Court hears so few cases. Judges whom Republican presidents appointed constitute majorities on all of these courts except the Second and Ninth Circuits.<br /><br />President Bush can justifiably claim a measure of credit for securing these appointments and for the judges' effects on decisionmaking in these courts. Most observers believe that Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito have made the Supreme Court more conservative and that the White House's appellate court appointees have similarly affected the circuits on which they serve. <br /><br />However, Mr. Bush's approach to judicial selection has exacted costs. For example, the White House has often failed to select consensus nominees or to consult with senators, even Republicans, from states in which the vacancies arise before officially making nominations. Mr. Bush also nominated on multiple occasions individuals whom Democratic and Republican Senate members clearly opposed.<br /><br />Illustrative are the Fourth Circuit, which presently experiences openings in four of its fifteen judgeships and the Sixth Circuit that encountered vacancies in fully half of its judicial positions at one juncture in the Bush presidency. Poor White House judgment and intransigence have ironically left the Fourth Circuit, which was certainly the most reliably conservative appellate tribunal when Bush assumed office, more liberal today. These phenomena have meant that Democratic and Republican accusations and recriminations, divisive partisanship and paybacks have characterized judicial selection.<br /><br />There have been a few, notable exceptions to these troubling selection dynamics, especially since 2007 when Democrats assumed a Senate majority, which enabled the party to control the confirmation process. For instance, the White House and Michigan's senators reached an accord which led to the expeditious confirmation of one Sixth Circuit Judge whom Bush favored and another whom President Bill Clinton had nominated but the Republican - dominated Senate never considered. The Senate also promptly confirmed a Fourth Circuit Judge whom Virginia's Republican and Democratic senators recommended to Bush. In September, the Senate correspondingly approved ten consensus nominees for the federal district courts, which is rare so late in a presidential election year.<br /><br />Republican presidential candidate Senator John McCain has pledged to appoint nominees who resemble those Mr. Bush chose. In a May address at Wake Forest University, McCain promised to appoint strict constructionists who would not legislate from the bench. As a senator, McCain has exhibited willingness to depart from the bitter partisanship that has plagued selection. For example, McCain was a member of the "Gang of 14," which prevented detonation of the "nuclear option" that would have proscribed filibustering of judicial nominees.<br /><br />When President Bush speaks today in glowing terms about his administration's impacts on the federal judiciary, those who read or hear his speech might ask whether the Bush Administration improved the judicial selection process. Listeners may want to remember that Mr. Bush has perpetuated, and even exacerbated, the counterproductive dynamics of allegations and countercharges, partisan division and paybacks. Whether Senator McCain will continue these deleterious approaches is a question that all voters should ask. <br /><br /><br /><em>Carl Tobias is the Williams Professor of Law at the University of Richmond</em><br />

Edward Sell Chair in Business Law at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, offers a 50-year perspective on the structural roots of the current financial crisis in the United States and what factors ultimately helped to bring it about...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/douglasbranson.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>H</strong></font>arking back to the days of Ozzie and Harriet (the 1950s), mom and dad, or grandparents, made their mortgage application to the neighborhood savings and loan (Friendly). Commercial banks did very little mortgage business in those days. Mom and Dad filled out Friendly's loan application on Friendly's own form, at least to the point at which the loan officer said "that's enough, just sign it at the bottom." The loan officer also might say, "we don't need verification of employment. Everybody knows where you work, Joe (or Josephine)." He might add: "we don't need an appraisal. You just had one a year ago."<br /><br />Friendly. Casual. One shortcoming was that if Friendly had $10 million to lend for 30 year mortgages, once it had used that amount up, Friendly could make no further loans. It lacked liquidity. Another shortcoming was that most home loans were conventional mortgages which required the purchaser to pay 20% of the agreed price, in cash at closing (downpayment). There were a few exceptions, such as Veterans' Administration (VA) and Federal Housing Administration (FHA) home loans, which called for lower downpayments but had limited eligibility and made the borrower jump through a number of additional hoops (get a home inspection, etc.).<br /><br />Friendly's lack of liquidity is not quite as bad as it sounds. The average mortgage has a life of only 13 years. The mortgagor (homeowner) pays off their home loan because they are downsizing, moving to a larger home, or moving to a different neighborhood or city. Nonetheless, in the old days, lenders like Friendly had illiquid, stay-at-home loan portfolios.<br /><br />Fast forward to the 1970s. A innovation arrived on the scene. Mortgage companies and savings and loans like Friendly could, at least if they were large enough, package a group of loans, selling the package to, say, an institutional investor such as an insurance company or a pension plan. If Friendly, now grown larger, packaged up $100 million in home loans, it would sell a "passthrough" $100 million package to, say, North Pacific Life Insurance ( Spokane, Washington) or the Hawaiian Structural Ironworkers Pension Plan (in Honolulu). Home owner would still pay principal, interest, and possibly escrow payments (for taxes and insurance) to Friendly. Homeowner would never know that Friendly no longer had her loan. <br /><br />Friendly would deduct a one half percentage point service fee from the homeowner's payment, "passing through" the rest of the payment to North Pacific Life, who now owed the loan but remained behind the scenes. From Friendly's standpoint, it still made money on loan application fees (2-3 "points") and on service fees on loans it had sold. Most importantly, it's liquidity had been refreshed. Friendly once again had $100 million with which to make loans. <br /><br />Some drawbacks: big chunks (difficult to digest) and a lack of diversification. Only the largest players could purchase many of these "passthrough packages." Moreover, they were relatively undiversified. If Friendly were Chicago based, and the Chicago economy went sour, Pacific Life executives would at least lose sleep, or possibly worse.<br /><br /><strong>Asset Securitization</b><br /><br />Fast forward to the 1990s. Let's break up that package into more bite sized chunks. Many more persons and institutions could participate as purchasers. And the big boys, who could and did purchase the bigger passthrough packages, could now get diversification: some loan participations from Richmond, some from Birmingham, some from Portland (Maine or Oregon). How do we do this? By issuing asset-based (mortgage based) securities. Friendly sells a passthrough package to a wholesaler, such as Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Fannie Mae, or to a private entity such as CountryWide or Home Gold. Some companies, such as Washington Mutual or Countrywide, were both retailers and wholesalers. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, contrary to what John McCain says, were quite small and did no retail business whatsoever (Freddie Mac, for example, has only 3,000 employees). In accordance with their Congressional mandates, they were purely wholesalers.<br /><br />Freddie, Fannie, or another wholesaler would sell bonds to the public, using an implicit government guarantee (never express) to entice investors to purchase the bonds. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac "step bonds," contractually required to re-adjust based upon inflation, were very popular, especially with retired persons. With the money they had thus borrowed, Freddie and Fannie purchased big passels of mortgages from retailers around the country. <br /><br />Freddie or Fannie could do one of 3 things with the mortgage loans they purchased (Freddie and Fannie purchased 50% of the mortgages in this country, close to $2 trillion per year). One, they could keep them. Toward the end, they kept more and more of these mortgages in their "retained portfolio" (40% at Freddie Mac). Two, they could sell them as a passthrough package to a institutional investors, as above.<br /><br />Or, three, they could securitize them. Freddie forms a special purpose entity (trusts, corporations, or limited liability companies - all were all used as SPE's). It puts "offshore" (into the SPE) $100 million in mortgages. The SPE, which is supposed to have 3% independent capital (later 10%) and independent governance, then holds the mortgages, selling securities (almost always interest bearing debt securities) to financial companies, institutional investors, and high net worth individuals. These were the securities Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley, and J.P. Morgan, to name a few, purchased to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars each. The SPE then passes on interest and principal payments to the securities holders, as the SPE receives them and deducts its costs (minimal).<br /><br />Asset securitization grew from a few hundreds of millions early in the 1990s to several trillion dollars per year. Every kind of loan, or cash flow, began to be securitized: home improvement loans, student loans, boat loans, car and truck rentals, Mastercharge, Visa receivables, streams of box office receipts for new movies, and so on. Collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) achieved even greater diversification by packaging a mix (mortgage loans and truck rental receipts, for example).<br /><br />Often the originator had to add a "credit enhancement" to make the "paper" more saleable. The originator might have to retain a residual (liability for the first $3 million in defaults); purchase insurance to cover at least some of the defaults (if defaults there were - a remote possibility); or purchase insurance which was not called insurance, and hence did not require maintenance of legal reserves by the issuer ("credit default swaps" - AIG was a big issuer) which states would require of a true insurance company.<br /><br /><strong>Culprit Number One: Easy Money Up Front</strong><br /><br />So what is the picture here? The financial world is creating a system through which 20 or 30 times the volume may flow. Up front, at the consumer level, credit becomes easier and easier. Retailers, say, California saving &amp; loans, abandon standards all together. The knowledge that they can wholesale anything out the back door means that they will let almost anything come in the front door. They approve loans for people without jobs, mini-mansio
ns for persons who could only afford a house trailer or a modest bungalow, exaggerated and inflated incomes for persons with modest incomes, and adjustable rate mortgages with "teaser" upfront rates which attract people who will be in the zone of default the first time the interest rate adjusts upwards. Downpayments were 5% of the asking price, or downpayment requirements were evaded altogether.<br /><br />Where were Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae? In Tuesday's presidential debate, John McCain put much of the blame on Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. He stated that the credit crisis began with Fannie and Freddie's troubles. Wait a minute! Let's back up.<br /><br />Freddie and Fannie lent discipline to the mortgage industry. Their forms and processes furnished the backbone for the industry. Now every loan applicant had to fill out Fannie's or Freddie's application form, verification of employment, get an appraisal, etc. As much as possible, every loan now had to be like every other loan, because the retailer would in all probability package up the loans and wholesale the package. No more ad hoc transactions as in the old days at Friendly were allowed anymore. The increase in liquidity and the standardization of loan backbones fostered by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac saved consumers billions of dollars (trillions?) and put millions of Americans into homes. <br /><br />Rogue retailers, however, learned to game the system. They completed loan packages for homeowers by instructing or tolerating the rogue lender's employees filling in many of the blanks themselves, exaggerating or making it up. They sometimes made mockeries of the backbones Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae had imposed upon the industry. Was it Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's role to police and discipline this? No, not as Congress set them up. Freddie and Fannie were to be wholesalers, not retailers or "mortgage companies," as politicians, newspapers and editorial columnists report. Yes, as politicans and irate news columnists view the past with 20-20 hindsight: Fannie and Freddie should have acted as police officers.<br /><br />Freddie and Fannie were also hampered by their congressional mandated governance. A third or so of their directors had to be political appointees or representatives of the home building industry. Many of these directors (ex senators, former lobbyists) complained when Freddie Mac asked them even to page through 15 page board packet prior to a meeting. President Bush's appointments to these boards were wholly political and without substance, as probably were his predecessor's as well.<br /><br />Now come the richest of the rich: the financial service firms. On Sixty Minutes on Sunday night, the interviewer asked why these companies had purchased so much of "these risky securities." The problem was in fact just the opposite. These securities appeared to carry very little or virtually no risk at all. Homeowners pay their mortgage and their electricity bills before any other. The default rate on mortgages is less than one-tenth of one percent. Even in the midst of a "mortgage crisis," the default rate is only 3% and likely not to increase much past 4% unless the mortgages drop seriously "under water."<br /><br />The safety of these securities caused financial firms to load upon on them ("back up the truck," in Wall Street parlance). They were considered so safe that financial firms used borrowed funds to buy more, and more, and more.<br /><br /><strong>Culprit Number Two: Greed on Wall Street</strong><br /><br />Easy money up front was the first culprit. Easy money on the back end was the second. Leverage we call it.<br /><br />The average industrial or service firm borrows money but in moderation. The average across all corporations is about 60% or 65% of equity. Thus, if owners put in $10 million (equity), they layer another $6 million in bank loans on top of that. Some companies which have steady cash flows (electric utilities, phone companies) may have more leverage. Ratios of 3 to 1 or even 5 to 1 are not unusual. Financial experts, however, are wary of leverage, or of too much leverage. Leverage makes good years better but it also can work in reverse, making bad years much worse.<br /><br />At Bear Stearns the debt equity ratio was 34. Lehman Brothers' ratio was 32. Merrill Lynch's was 31. Morgan Stanley's was 26. At Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac it was a more reasonable but still immodest 20 to 1.<br /><br />These were conservative securities, say, paying 6% or 6.5%. But purchasers could borrow from banks, paying 3% or 3.5% interest for funds with which they could purchase these safe securities. And they did borrow, more and more and more, to purchase asset backed securities. Bear Stearns put in $10 billion of its own capital but borrowed $340 billion additional dollars. It thus stood to make over a 100% profit on invested capital, that is, as long as the spread stayed positive. When the increasing default rate made the spread appear to be heading for the negative, the value of the securities fell.<br /><br />Thus, both on the front end, and on the back end, the tale is one of unbridled greed: rapacious homeowners and savings and loan officials and equally at fault Wall Street CEOs and other executives.<br /><br /><strong>Culprit Number Three: Excessive Accounting Conservatism</strong><br /><br />Now enter the third player (not culprit really): the accounting rules. When an individual or a company holds assets on their balance sheet, they hold them at cost. Cost in this instance would be approximately the same as the face value of the securities, adjusted for ups or downs in prevailing interest rates. When the assets are investment securities, however, the accounting rules are different. The holder must sort them into piles, such as "hold to maturity," which it can continue to carry at cost. Or, "available for sale," which it must "mark to market." As greater default rates loomed on the horizon, Wall Street firm had to mark down, and down again and again, the carrying value of these mortgage backed securities, CDOs, etc., because all, or nearly all, fell in the "available for sale" category. The balance sheet writedowns created floods of red ink which flowed over onto firms' income, or profit and loss, statements. Suddenly bedrock financial firms had huge losses. Losses triggered defaults on loans the firms have taken out. The red ink chased the firms into the arms of other more solvent firms, or into bankruptcy.<br /><br />It is these marked down securities which the U.S. proposes to buy with the $700 billion "bailout." Is this relieving Wall Street fat cats from the responsibility and the pain for their own greed?. You can look at that way but the firms which have failed still have positive cash flows. It is paper (accounting losses) which did them in in the end. The mid course correction is cleaning up balance sheets which were badly distorted by writedowns that did not jive with reality.<br /><br />Another way to look at it is as a necessary first step to get our economy back on a middling course. We veered far too much toward the permissive before Enron, WorldCom, Adelphia and other accounting and governance imbroglios stopped us in our tracks. Then the pendulum swung but, as it always the case, it swung too far over in the other direction. For one, we became awash in a seas of accounting conservatism.<br /><br />Under this view, the governmental action is not, strictly speaking, a bailout. The government will be an astute buyer of these securities, paying on the order of 20 or 30 cents per dollar of face value. Most of these securities (95%) will purr along, paying interest at the stated rate. And as the homeowners pay off the mortgages, the government will receive 90 or 95 cents on the dollar for securities purchased at a fraction of that. No less an astute investor than Warren Buffett has said he would buy up these securities if he had the fund available.<br /><br /><strong>The Bailout</strong><br /><br />So is it a bailout? Yes, it is a bailout of some highly compensated Wall Street executives who will avoid the full consequences of their own greed. Is it a dea
dweight loss for the taxpayers? No, the US could even make a handsome profit (but no guarantees) on its $700 billion investment. Could the money be better spent distributing it to homeowners who cannot make their mortgage payments, as more than several politicians have suggested? That is a value judgment each of can make but, as currently structured, the government has a better than even chance of getting its money back and then some. Or at least it does if real estate price stabilize. (If many, many more mortgage balances fall below probable market value ("under water"), homeowners will abandon homes, and mortgages in increasing numbers and default rates will rise, perhaps to an unacceptable level. But that's another problem).<br /><br />On the other hand, payments to homeowners to help them catch up would represent a sunk cost, and a deadweight loss to the U.S. Treasury. And it is a bailout of sorts as well. Many of the persons on the verge of defaulting on home loans knowingly over-extended themselves, misrepresenting their income or purchasing much more house than the could realistically afford.<br /><br /><br /><em>Douglas M.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/faculty/profiles/brakedl">Deborah Brake</a> of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law says that important choices about our constitutional structure and the relationship between statutory and constitutional rights are at stake in <em>Fitzgerald v. Barnstable School Committee</em>, one of the lesser noticed cases on this term&#39;s US Supreme Court docket...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/debbiebrake.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>O</strong></font>ne of the lesser noticed cases on the Supreme Court's docket this term is <em>Fitzgerald v. Barnstable School Committee</em>, No. 07-1125, which presents the question of whether Congress precluded constitutional claims for sex discrimination in education when it passed Title IX, the federal statute banning sex discrimination in federally funded schools. So far, the case has generated little attention from the media or Supreme Court commentators. Its notoriety is mostly limited to the relatively small group of lawyers who litigate Title IX claims and have run up against the preclusion problem in bringing equal protection claims for the same conduct. The case deserves a deeper look. At stake are important choices about our constitutional structure and the relationship between statutory and constitutional rights.<br /><br />The obscurity of the case is not for the lack of lurid facts. As a five-year old kindergartner, Jacqueline Fitzgerald was sexually harassed by an older boy on the school bus which she rode to school every morning. The abuse occurred regularly over a sixth month period of time. When Jacqueline told her parents, they wasted no time in reporting the conduct to school officials. At this point, the parties' accounts diverge sharply, as is often the case in such litigation. The parents claim that the school did not do enough to remedy the harassment, effectively putting the onus on Jacqueline to find another way to get to school, with no consequences for the boy who harassed her. The school claims that it responded appropriately but that the investigation was inconclusive. Unsatisfied with the school's response, Jacqueline's parents brought a lawsuit against the school and its superintendent, alleging violations of Title IX and the equal protection clause. The equal protection claim was asserted under Section 1983, a Reconstruction era statute that creates a cause of action for violations of federal rights, both statutory and constitutional, that occur under color of state law. Section 1983 is the primary vehicle for individuals to assert their constitutional rights against state officials.<br /><br />The district court never reached the equal protection claim because it disposed of the case on the Title IX claim alone. Instead, after ruling that the plaintiffs lost on the Title IX claim on the merits, the court threw out the equal protection claim without reaching its merits on the grounds that Title IX precludes equal protection claims for the same conduct. The court's preclusion ruling is especially notable because the plaintiffs argued for a different standard of liability under the equal protection claim than the standard that applied to the Title IX claim. <br /><br />The liability standards governing Title IX sexual harassment claims were set out in a pair of Supreme Court cases from the late 1990s. In order to be liable for sexual harassment that harms a student, school officials must have actual notice and respond with deliberate indifference. In adopting this standard, which is much tougher than the liability standard that applies to sexual harassment by non-agents (coworkers and third parties) in the workplace, the Court emphasized the distinctive nature of Title IX as legislation adopted under the Spending clause and the statute's particular administrative enforcement scheme. Because the Court's rationale for adopting such a tough liability standard was specific to Title IX, it is not at all a foregone conclusion that the same liability standard should govern equal protection claims for sexual harassment in school. When equal protection claims have been asserted against public employers, courts have applied liability standards similar to those that apply in Title VII cases, which are much less stringent than the actual notice and deliberate indifference standard that applies under Title IX.<br /><br />In the <em>Fitzgerald</em> case, the district court ruled that the facts could not establish deliberate indifference under Title IX. Although the investigation could have been more thorough and the school could have responded better, the court concluded that it fell short of deliberate indifference. However, the plaintiffs argued, the disposition of the Title IX claim did not necessarily mean that their equal protection claim would also fail on the merits. They argued that a different liability standard should apply to the equal protection claim, and that the school could be liable for violating Jacqueline's equal protection rights even if it was not liable under Title IX. The court did not reach the plaintiffs' equal protection arguments, however, leaving open the possibility that the Title IX and equal protection claims might indeed come out differently. Instead, the court ruled that Title IX precludes section 1983 claims for violations of constitutional rights.<br /><br />The First Circuit agreed. Remarkably, like the district court, the First Circuit's ruling applies even if the constitutional claim might succeed on the merits where the Title IX claim failed. In a sweeping statement, the First Circuit declared that "[t]he comprehensiveness of Title IX's remedial scheme &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; indicates that Congress saw Title IX as the sole means of vindicating the constitutional right to be free from gender discrimination perpetrated by educational institutions &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;." At a later point in its opinion, the First Circuit described the rule as barring constitutional claims that are "virtually identical" to the statutory claim. Apparently "virtually identical" means something quite different from "actually identical" if a plaintiff might win one claim while losing the other.<br /><br />This brings us to the question that is ultimately at stake in the Fitzgerald case: are our constitutional rights so fragile that they can be displaced by a mere statute&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;in this case, one that does not create any express litigation enforcement scheme at all (Title IX is enforceable in court through an implied private right of action), much less one that expressly displaces constitutional claims for the same conduct? What happened to the maxim learned by every high school civics student that the Constitution is the Supreme Law of the Land, trumping mere legislative enactments? And if this is indeed the state of our law, how did we get here?<br /><br />In a nutshell, the current mess of preclusion law in the lower courts is traceable to the Supreme Court's decision in 1981 in <em>Middlesex County Sewage Authority v. National Sea Clammers Association</em>, which held that statutory rights created by a comprehensive statute could not be enforced under Section 1983 as an end run around the enforcement scheme created by the newer statute. This ruling is unremarkable and entirely defensible: the scope and enforcement of statutory rights created by Congress should depend on Congress' intent. If section 1983 could be used as a vehicle for asserting newly created statutory rights, contrary to Congress' intent, Congress might be less likely to create new statutory rights in the first place. <br /><br />The difficulty surfaced three years later in <em>Smith v. Robinson</em>, the first and only time the Supreme Court has ruled that a federal statute precludes the use of section 1983 to assert constitutional rights based on the same conduct. In this case, t
he Court found that a federal statute, the Education for the Handicapped Act, was so comprehensive that Congress intended to displace constitutional claims for a free and appropriate public education under the equal protection clause. However, even here, the Court's concern was to avoid the short-circuiting of a detailed enforcement scheme that would otherwise occur if claims were brought directly for constitutional violations under section 1983. There was no suggestion that the content of the rights under the statute and the Constitution varied in any respect. In fact, the Court described the statute as effectuating the constitutional rights of disabled persons under the equal protection clause. It is a far different thing to rule, as the First Circuit did in <em>Fitzgerald</em>, that federal legislation has substituted statutory rights for constitutional rights that may differ in their scope and content.<br /><br />Ultimately, this case raises important questions about the role of Congress in effectuating constitutional rights, and the role of courts in interpreting and enforcing the Constitution. In briefs filed in the <em>Fitzgerald</em> case, plaintiffs and their <em>amici</em> seem to assume that congressional intent is dispositive on the question of precluding constitutional rights. They persuasively argue that Congress never intended Title IX to displace constitutional rights for sex discrimination in education, but they seem to concede that, if Congress really did intend to do so, it could displace constitutional equal protection rights with a set of statutory rights different in content. <br /><br />If indeed that is the state of the law, it is in great tension with the judicial supremacy that is at the core of our constitutional structure. In that structure, Congress certainly has the power to set the terms of how people go to court to enforce their constitutional rights&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;including setting limits on federal court jurisdiction and determining the procedures for asserting such claims. But can Congress go so far as to effectively narrow the content of constitutional rights by passing a statute with the intent to displace broader constitutional rights with less generous statutory ones? Or even by passing a statute with "virtually" identical rights, where there is significant "play" in the word "virtually"? Perhaps the answer turns on the extent to which, as some commentators insist, the Constitution is not "self-executing," such that the enforcement of Constitutional rights by individuals ultimately turns on Congress' assent and authorization. This raises the question of whether constitutional rights are or should be so fragile. Modern case law has recognized a number of exceptions to the purportedly non-self-executing Constitution, as in the famous <em>Bivens</em> case against federal officials, and in actions for injunctive relief to halt government actors from trampling on the Constitution. Vindicating individual constitutional rights should not be so precarious as to depend on the care taken by Congress not to displace them. If I am wrong and the First Circuit's ruling in <em>Fitzgerald v. Barnstable</em> is correct, then our constitutional rights are fragile indeed.<br /><br /><br /><em>Deborah Brake is a professor of law at the University of Pittsburgh</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.williamgeorgeross.com/">William G. Ross</a> of Cumberland School of Law, Samford University, says that when they go to the polls in November, American voters should carefully consider the candidates&#39; positions and likely impact on the federal courts as the outcome of the 2008 election could profoundly influence the decisions of those courts, and especially the US Supreme Court, for decades to come. ...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/williamrossnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>J</strong></font>udicial appointments rarely are an important issue in presidential election campaigns. This year's campaign has been no exception. Preoccupied with anxiety over the deteriorating economy and national security, the candidates and the voters seem little concerned with how the election will affect the Supreme Court and other federal courts. <br /><br />But they should be concerned.<br /><br />The federal courts ought to have a prominent role in the 2008 election insofar as the outcome could profoundly influence the decisions of the federal courts, particularly the Supreme Court, for decades to come. It is a truism that Supreme Court appointments are among the most important and enduring legacies of presidents.<br /><br />Although predictions about Supreme Court vacancies are notoriously chancy, there is a strong possibility that John Paul Stevens, who will turn 89 next April, will leave the Court during the next presidential term. Some observers of the Court also believe that Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who is 75 years old and has suffered from health problems, is likely to resign during the next four years. Moreover, David H. Souter, who will be 70 next year, is rumored to be considering retirement. Since each of these "liberal" Justices has determined the outcome of many cases decided by a five-to-four vote, the replacement of even one of these Justices with a more "conservative" Justice could decisively alter the Court's decisions on a multitude of issues, including abortion, affirmative action, criminal procedure, and the scope of federalism and the commerce clause. Meanwhile, the next president has the power to substantially shape the character of the lower federal judiciary.<br /><br />Despite the importance of the courts, the presidential and vice presidential candidates are not making any significant effort to interject judicial issues into the present campaign. Although a substantial majority of voters in at least one poll have indicated that they regard judicial appointments as an important factor in determining how they will vote, there is little indication that judicial issues actually are swaying many votes. <br /><br />The Court was practically forgotten until the third debate between McCain and Obama on October 15, when both candidates discussed judicial appointments in response to a question. Both assured voters that they would not impose any &quot;litmus test&quot; for Supreme Court nominations, although McCain explained that he would nominate judges who favor a strict construction of the Constitution and that he does not believe that anyone who supports <em>Roe v. Wade</em> could fit this criterion. Both emphasized that they would base their nominations primarily on professional qualifications, and Obama added that he also would seek persons who have &quot;a sense of what real world folks are going through.&quot; McCain pointed out that he had voted to confirm the nominations of Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg because he respected their qualifications despite his reservations about their ideologies.<br /><br />Until last night, the Court had attracted widespread attention only once, and then only incidentally, when Sarah Palin during her interview with Katie Couric was unable to identify any decision, other than <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, with which she disagreed. <br /><br />Palin has continued to assail <em>Roe</em>. In a speech in Johnstown, Pennsylvania last week, for example, Palin declared that a "vote for Barack Obama is a vote for activist courts that will continue to smother the open and democratic debate that we deserve and that we need on this issue of life." She does not, however, seem to be addressing other judicial issues. Despite the crash course on civics in which she was immersed during her days in Sedona after the Couric interview, Palin has not demonstrated that she knows or cares any more about the Court now than she did when Couric cornered her. <br /><br />Similarly, McCain has had little to say about the Court since last spring, when he devoted a speech at Wake Forest University to a criticism of "the common and systematic abuse of our federal courts" by judges who "have taken it upon themselves to pronounce and rule on matters that were never intended to be heard in courts or decided by judges." McCain in that speech avoided mention of specific decisions and he failed even to identify most of the subjects of the cases in which judges supposedly had exceeded their constitutional powers. McCain may fear that more criticism of "activist" judges may scare away moderate voters without doing much to fire up the Republican Party's conservative base, which Palin has helped to secure. <br /><br />Joseph Biden, who has been a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee for thirty-five years and served as its chair for eight years, would appear to be the ideal candidate to interject judicial issues into the campaign. Probably no living person who has not served as president has had more influence over judicial appointments. Even Biden, however, has made few references to the Court. Speaking at a roundtable of working mothers in Denver last summer, Biden declared that "the single most important thing Barack Obama can do," other than ending the war in Iraq, "will be to determine who the next members of the Supreme Court are going to be." Predicting that there might be as many as three vacancies on the Court during the next four years, Biden explained that "[i]ts not merely the woman's right to choose which is at stake. It's whether or not you are going to be able to have a fair shot at a fair wage. It's whether or not you are going to be able to demand that you are treated equally in every aspect of your life."<br /><br />Since then, however, Biden has remained largely reticent about the Court. Biden was silent even during his debate with Palin, when many political observers expected him to make at least a passing reference to Supreme Court appointments.<br /><br />Obama appears to have spoken even less about judicial issues than McCain, Palin, or Biden. His reticence contrasts with Democratic presidential nominees in 2000 and 2004. Al Gore attempted to make the Court a significant issue in 2000, when there were few other prominent issues, and John Kerry made at least a few pointed references to judicial appointments in 2004. Having served as president of the <em>Harvard Law Review</em> and as a longtime adjunct professor at the University of Chicago Law School, Obama must be keenly aware of how the election might affect the Court, and his reticence may reflect his general reluctance to encourage perceptions that he is radical. It is telling that Obama's most significant comment about the Court may have been his expression of disagreement with one of the Court's "liberal" decisions &#8212; its five-to-four ruling last June prohibiting capital punishment for any individual crime in which a victim's life is not taken. A Democratic candidate who tries to score points with "conservative" voters by assailing a decision restricting capital punishment is not likely to wax eloquent about how personal liberties are at stake in the upcoming election. <br /><br />Political activists and public interest groups also seem to be making less of an issue of the courts than they did during the past few presidential campaigns. For example, th
e Judicial Confirmation Network recently aired a television commercial that criticized Obama's opposition to the nominations of John G. Roberts and Samuel Alito, but spent more time questioning Obama's association with alleged political radicals.<br /><br />The Court's low profile in the presidential campaign was illustrated last week in a speech about the federal courts that President Bush delivered before the Federalist Society in Cincinnati. Coming at the height of a presidential campaign from a president who often has blasted "activist judges," Bush's remarks were remarkably muted. Bush pointed out that judges can have a "profound impact...on the daily lives of every citizen" and he argued that the Court's various five-to-four decisions demonstrate that "the selection of good judges should be a priority for all our citizens." Bush, however, avoided any direct admonition about the election's importance in shaping the Court's future. He largely confined himself to praising his Supreme Court nominees Roberts and Alito and criticizing the Senate for blocking confirmation of some of his nominations to the lower federal courts. <br /><br />The reluctance of the candidates or their surrogates to address judicial issues is consistent with the Court's low profile in most presidential election campaigns. During the past century, the Court was a significant issue only in 1912, 1924, 1964, and 1968. It was a moderately important issue in 2000.<br /><br />The Court usually has emerged as a significant election issue only when a broad range of its decisions have been intensely unpopular with a large and distinct bloc of voters. In the 1912 and 1924 presidential campaigns, a "conservative" Court's invalidation of economic and social regulatory legislation provided a lightening rod for criticism by advocates of such laws. In 1964 and 1968, the Warren Court's "liberal" decisions on the rights of criminal defendants, desegregation, apportionment of voting districts, and school prayer became major election issues. The 1964 Republican nominee Barry Goldwater castigated many of those decisions and promised to appoint "strict constructionist" judges, as did the Republican nominee Richard M. Nixon and the American Independent candidate George C. Wallace in 1968. <br /><br />In contrast with the Court of the so-called "Lochner Era" and the Warren Court, the decisions of the present Court are quite diffuse. For the past several decades, the Court has defied any simple "liberal" or "conservative" label. Since the 2004 election, for example, the Court has offended many political "conservatives" and pleased many "liberals" in decisions protecting the constitutional rights of alleged terrorists, prohibiting capital punishment for crimes committed by juveniles, and allowing states to exercise eminent domain for purposes of private economic development. During the same period, the Court has dismayed many "liberals" and gratified many "conservatives" with its decisions sustaining the federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, striking down the District of Columbia's handgun ban, and invalidating the use of racial criteria in making school assignments. All of these decisions were closely divided; most were decided by a vote of five-to-four. <br /><br />Since some of the Court's decisions have pleased "conservative" voters and other decisions have appealed to "liberals," neither political party can portray the present Court as a bogeyman and vow to transform its composition, as did Goldwater, Nixon, and Wallace. Discussion of the Court therefore requires candidates and their surrogates to discuss the possible effect of judicial appointments on specific issues.<br /><br />The discussion of such issues in a presidential campaign is difficult because these meretricious contests discourage serious discussion of public affairs. Candidates naturally avoid discussion of specific Supreme Court decisions since most are too nuanced and complex for many voters to comprehend. Palin's apparent ignorance of numerous "liberal" decisions other than <em>Roe v. Wade</em> with she might be expected to disagree illustrates why the Court is not a major issue in this campaign. Palin's apparent lack of knowledge about the Court presumably is shared by many voters and would not be shocking if she were not a governor and a candidate for the vice presidency. Indeed, surveys indicate that the overwhelming majority of voters do not know the names of most of the Supreme Court justices. It is difficult to transform the Court into an issue when so many voters know so little about its decisions and its judges.<br /><br />When candidates discuss the Court at all, they therefore usually confine themselves to a few salient issues that resonate with a broad spectrum of voters. Since abortion is such a highly charged political issue, both Democrats and Republicans during the past several presidential campaigns have emphasized that the election could determine the fate of <em>Roe v. Wade</em>. Palin's ability to name only <em>Roe</em> highlights the likelihood that abortion is the only issue about which the prospect of Supreme Court appointments is likely to influence significant numbers of voters.<br /><br /><em>Roe</em>&#39;s pre-eminence in political discussions of about the Court was underscored again during the third debate, when both McCain and Obama addressed judicial appointments almost solely in the context of <em>Roe</em>. If Obama had not criticized the Court for its recent decision restricting rights of action under the Equal Pay Act, an uninformed viewer practically would have been left with the impression that abortion is the only important issue that the Court adjudicates.<br /><br />Similarly, the Court is an elusive and amorphous election issue insofar as voters cannot be certain that a president will necessarily nominate the type of judges that they favor, that the Senate will confirm such nominees, or that the Justices themselves will conform to the expectations of the presidents and senators who placed them on the Court. As Dahlia Littwick recently observed, "it's hard to generate much public hysteria over nameless, faceless, future jurists deciding nameless, faceless future cases." In the present election, many Republican voters may be particularly skeptical about McCain's ability to place "conservative" Justices on the Court insofar as the Democrats are likely to have a comfortable majority in the Senate.<br /><br />Another reason why voters may be apathetic about judicial issues is that many voters probably do not align themselves as rigidly as do most Justices along so-called "liberal" and "conservative" lines. To a remarkable extent, the Court's five-to-four votes during recent years have mirrored the dichotomy between political "liberals" and political "conservatives" and the divisions between Democrats and Republicans. Among many voters, however, these lines are more blurred. <br /><br />For example, most Supreme Court justices who have opposed strict constitutional limitations on laws prohibiting abortion have favored stringent constitutional restrictions on laws permitting capital punishment, and vice versa. While this alignment generally is consistent with public opinion, various studies have found that surprisingly many opponents of abortion also oppose capital punishment. Similarly, the Court's splits on controversial issues such as affirmative action, gun ownership rights, separation of church and state, and eminent domain usually have reflected "liberal"/ "conservative" dichotomies. Many voters, however, may oppose affirmative action but favor strict limitations on gun ownership, or oppose school vouchers while favoring tight restrictions upon the power of eminent domain. <br /><br />Voters whose political views are not easily labeled as liberal or conservative therefore may not especially care whether "liberal" or "conservative" judges dominate the federal courts insofar as either way the courts will render some decisions that they like and others that they dislike. <br /><br />Judicial issues likewise are often difficult to transform into political issues because the po
litical process can help defuse opposition to judicial rulings. For example, most of the states have enacted legislation in the wake of <em>Kelo v. New London</em> to prohibit or restrict the exercise of eminent domain for private purposes. Similarly, many supporters and opponents of legalized abortion are aware that many states probably would enact relatively liberal abortion statutes even if <em>Roe v. Wade</em> were overturned.<br /><br />Moreover, candidates and their supporters may have little incentive to address judicial issues since such appeals often would be redundant insofar as voters' attitudes toward the judiciary merely reflect how they already feel about a presidential candidate. For example, a voter whose support for Obama is based heavily upon his or her perception that Obama is more pro-choice than McCain is not likely to become any more supportive of Obama because he or she perceives that Obama is more likely to nominate pro-choice judges to the federal courts. <br /><br />Despite the many difficulties and uncertainties of addressing judicial issues, candidates and political activists ought to make more of an effort to call attention to the ways in which the election could affect the federal courts. Since the decisions of these courts so profoundly influence so many facets of American life, judicial issues are too important to ignore in a presidential campaign. Even though judicial issues often are abstract and complex, and the behavior of individual justices is unpredictable, most voters should be able to make intelligent general assumptions about how McCain or Obama nominees would rule on a wide range of critically important subjects. Voters therefore should carefully consider how the election will affect judicial decisions.<br /><br /><br /><br /><em>William G.

The Introduction says that the FBI must "avoid unnecessary intrusions into the lives of law-abiding people." Here's the problem: how can the FBI know that anyone is a law-abiding person without making an investigative intrusion into his or her private affairs? Do the Guidelines provide any limitations to the powers of the FBI?<ol><li>If the FBI comes calling on you, can you ask whether it is a criminal investigation, a national security investigation, or a foreign intelligence collection? The answer is that they will not tell you. The Guidelines give the FBI comprehensive, diffuse, and undifferentiated power within their "legal authorities."<br /><br /> <li>When the FBI's undisclosed objective is investigating federal crimes, must there be a crime? The answer is No. The FBI may determine "whether a federal crime has occurred or is occurring" or whether "planning or preparation for such a crime is taking place." Of course we want the FBI to prevent crimes, but this language is expansive rather than constraining.<br /><br /> <li>When the FBI"s undisclosed objective is investigating threats to national security &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; which is additional to any criminal investigation &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; some specifics are listed: international terrorism, espionage and other intelligence activities, sabotage,  assassination; and foreign computer intrusion. And then, added to these, we find "other matters determined by the Attorney General." Might the term "other matters" include attending a theatrical performance of  "Waiting for Lefty"?<br /><br /> <li>When the FBI's undisclosed objective is collecting foreign intelligence &acirc;&#8364;&#8221;which is additional to criminal investigations and national security&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;do the guidelines "provide standards and procedures for the FBI's foreign intelligence collection activities?" The Guidelines say Yes, but we soon read that the guidelines are open ended: "foreign intelligence requirements may also be established by the President or Intelligence Community officials designated by the President, and by the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, or an official designated by the Attorney General." Memories are short. Recall that in the 1960s agents of the C.I.A. ended up spying on each other. All we need now is for your next-door neighbor to spy on you because you traveled for a week in Europe. He derives his authority as fourth designee of the third designee of the second designee of an official designated by the Attorney General. <br /><br /> <li>Do  these Guidelines, however vaguely worded, at least place outer boundaries on the authority of the FBI?  The answer as provided by the Guidelines is: "These Guidelines apply to FBI activities as provided herein and do not limit other authorized activities of the FBI." In other words, the FBI's authority must fall either inside or outside the Guidelines.</ol>I must add a personal note. In the course of representing clients I have had occasion to talk with a number of FBI agents. I have found them to be, without exception, men and women of the highest integrity. (I cannot say the same of police officers.) My feeling is that if the FBI isn't broke, don't fix it. Especially don't fix it with guidelines that are expansive and might attract into the ranks of the FBI persons on power trips. Even on the face of the Guidelines, as I've suggested by the five examples above, they seem to permit all kinds of encroachments on our civil liberties. <br /><br /><br /><em>Anthony D.Amato is Leighton Professor of Law at Northwestern University, where he teaches international law and human rights.</em><br /><br /><iframe src="/related/damato.php" frameborder='0' width='100%' height='120' scrolling='no' valign='top' marginheight='3'></iframe><br />

Shortly afterward, also on JURIST, Professor Ben Davis <a href="/forumy/2007/07/against-us-terrorist-court.php ">warned against creating "Star Chamber justice"</a> by establishing such a body. <br /><br />Now, however, proponents of what Ben termed "un tribunal d'exception" are pushing the matter before Congress. For this reason, it is important to note several additional reasons why a special national security court should not be created.<br /><br />During an actual armed conflict to which the laws of war apply, a national security court would have to comply with the customary and treaty-based requirements set forth in common Article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions which, as noted in my book <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/9780521884266">Beyond the Law</a>, are absolute and minimum requirements applicable with respect to any person detained during either an internal or an international armed conflict. These mandate that a court be "regularly constituted" and afford "all the judicial guarantees" of due process that are reflected in customary international law &#8212; which include, at a minimum, those mirrored in Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). <br /><br />The Supreme Court aptly affirmed in <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em> that the "core meaning" of the phrase "regularly constituted" has been authoritatively set forth in general commentary by the International Committee of the Red Cross and excludes "'all special tribunals'" and requires that courts be "'established ... [and] already in force in a country.'" While concurring in <em>Hamdan</em>, Justice Kennedy noted that there is little doubt that the phrase relates to "standards deliberated upon and chosen in advance." As <em>Hamdan</em> recognized, a court (1) must not be a "special" tribunal, and (2) must already be in existence. A special national security court simply could not meet the first test and, if otherwise proper, could only operate prospectively with respect to incidents arising after its creation. <br /><br />Additionally, a national security court would comply with common Article 3 only if it provides "all the judicial guarantees" of due process reflected in customary international law. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Hamdan</em>, "[i]nextricably intertwined with the question of regular constitution is the evaluation of the procedures governing the tribunal," and "the phrase 'regularly constituted court' ... must be understood to incorporate the barest of those trial protections that have been recognized by customary international law." The Supreme Court correctly added that "[m]any of these [due process requirements] are described in Article 75 of [Geneva] Protocol I" and in "the same basic protections set forth" as minimum human rights to due process in Article 14 of the ICCPR. Importantly, customary minimum human rights to due process reflected in Article 14 of the ICCPR apply in any social context and pertain, therefore, even when the laws of war are not applicable.<br /><br />As documented in <em>Beyond the Law</em> and recognized by the Supreme Court in <em>Hamdan</em>, violations of customary rights to due process would include: (1) preclusion of the accused and defense counsel from learning what evidence was presented in closed hearings, (2) admission of hearsay evidence, (3) admission of unsworn statements, (4) denial of access by an accused and defense counsel to evidence in the form of classified information, (5) denial of confrontation of all witnesses against an accused, (6) use of "evidence obtained through coercion," (7) denial of the right to be tried in one's presence (absent disruptive conduct or consent), and (8) denial of review by a competent, independent, and impartial court of law (i.e., an Article III court). It seems unavoidable that a special national security court with special procedures that deviate from the federal rules of criminal procedure would not be designed to enhance fairness, fully meet bilateral and multilateral treaty requirements of equality of treatment, or provide more general equal protection of the law to criminal accused.<br /><br />It is likely that some will propose the creation of a special court in order to facilitate convictions that would not be possible in a regular federal district court, especially through use of "evidence obtained through coercion" as part of what John Yoo and President Bush have admitted was a "common, unifying" plan or "program" of coercive interrogation that most know involves several manifest violations of customary and treaty-based international law and that can form the basis for criminal prosecution of (1) direct perpetrators, including those who authorized or ordered coercive interrogation; (2) leaders who were also or merely derelict in duty; (3) those who participated in a "joint criminal enterprise;" and (4) those who aided and abetted coercive interrogation or who were otherwise complicit (through memos or elsewise) in denials of rights under the laws of war, other violations of the laws of war, and violations of other international criminal law such as violations of the Convention Against Torture and customary prohibitions of secret detention. Quite clearly, lack of an intent to commit a crime would not obviate such forms of criminal responsibility and orders or authorizations will not lessen criminal responsibility for conduct that is manifestly unlawful. For example, an aider and abettor need only be aware that his or her conduct would or does assist that of a direct perpetrator. It is pertinent in this regard that there are <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/white-house-memos-to-cia-approved.php ">reports</a> that during multiple sessions in the White House beginning in 2002 Condoleezza Rice, Dick Cheney, George Tenet, Donald Rumsfeld, John Ashcroft, and others viewed simulations of and/or discussed and/or approved use of waterboarding, the "cold cell," use of dogs to instill intense fear in detainees, and stripping naked, among other patently illegal tactics that were to be used as part of the admitted program of coercive interrogation.<br /><br />Perpetuating illegality with a national security court would not serve our traditional values and the best interests of the United States, especially as we seek to regain our honor and international stature during a new Administration committed to the rule of law.<br /><br /><br /><br /><em>Jordan J.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ivanhoffman.com "><strong><a href="http://www.ivanhoffman.com/">Ivan Hoffman</a></strong></a> [Internet law, publishing, copyright and trademark attorney]: &quot;There is ample precedent for the structure of <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/google-agrees-to-settle-two-copyright.php">Google&#39;s settlement with the Authors Guild</a>.  It certainly reflects emerging technology and, as indicated below, will need to be reflected in modified agreements.<br /><br />For many decades, going back into the early 20th century, music rights holders collectively established ASCAP and BMI as &quot;performing rights organizations&quot; to license small performing rights to the rights holders&#39; compositions to locales and other parties who wanted to use the same, such as nightclubs, radio and later television and now via the Internet.  The organizations licensed the compositions either via a blanket license or, for certain &quot;featured performances,&quot; on a composition by composition basis.<br /><br />So the creation of a &quot;Book Rights Registry,&quot; which will collect and administer the use of rights, is a structure that has been used before.  As with ASCAP and BMI, however, it will be up to the individual rights holders to register with the Registry.<br /><br />Book publishing agreements, and other agreements dealing with the use of the content of books, will have to be modified to provide for this form of licensing revenue.  Clearly if the license to Google is work-specific (i.e. the functional equivalent of the &quot;featured performance&quot;), the publishing or other agreement will have to reflect the split between the author (or any other royalty participant) and publisher. This is subject to an arms-length negotiation.  However, in the event a publisher enters into a blanket license covering multiple works, the revenue between the publisher and the author or other royalty participant would have to be allocated according to a formula. For publishers who have been using form agreements, whether copied from a book, CD or obtained from colleagues or otherwise, these forms should be reviewed by an experienced publishing attorney.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://donaldgrehkopf.com">Donald G. Rehkopf, Jr</a>.[Co-Chair, Military Law Committee for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers]:&quot;For those unfamiliar with military practice under the <a href="http://www.military-network.com/main_ucmj/main_ucmj.htm">Uniform Code of Military Justice</a>,reading the recent <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/federal-judge-rules-iraq-war-objector.php">federal District Court decision</a> in <u>Watada v. Head</u>, is probably as baffling as any of the great &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; mysteries.  But, like any of the Holmes&#39; stories, in the end it all becomes quite &quot;elementary.&quot;<br /><br />LT Ehren Watada, an Army officer stationed at Fort Lewis, Washington, along with his unit received orders requiring them to deploy to Iraq in June of 2006.  Believing that the war was illegal and that his participation would subject him to &quot;war crimes&quot; jurisdiction, LT Watada attempted to get his assignment changed to Afghanistan instead.  When the Army declined to accommodate him, he refused to deploy.  After missing the flight carrying his unit, LT Watada participated in a number of public events, explaining his opposition to the war and reasons for disobeying his orders to deploy.  The Army then filed court-martial charges under the UCMJ against Watada for intentionally missing his flight and &quot;<a href="http://www.military-network.com/main_ucmj/SUBCHAPTERX.html#933.133">Conduct Unbecoming an Officer</a>.&quot; <br /><br />Prior to the start of his general court-martial in February of 2007, Watada&#39;s lawyers and the Army prosecutors entered into a written &quot;Pretrial Agreement.&quot;  That agreement provided that if LT Watada signed a comprehensive Stipulation of Fact about the events encompassed by his charges, that the Army would dismiss without prejudice two of the ancillary &quot;conduct unbecoming&quot; charges. The court-martial began on February 5, 2007, and LT Watada entered &quot;Not Guilty&quot; pleas.  At that juncture, the parties discussed the Stipulation of Fact.  Military practice requires that before such a stipulation can be admitted as evidence, the military judge must conduct an inquiry outside the presence of the members (military jurors are referred to as &quot;members&quot;).  This is to insure that the stipulation is both voluntary and the defendant understands the ramifications of its use.  The judge conducted the inquiry without incident, the parties agreed that the inquiry was sufficient and the stipulation was admitted.<br /><br />After normal trial preliminaries - voir dire, opening statements, etc. - proof commenced and the prosecution offered the pre-admitted Stipulation, which was then published to the members.  Shortly thereafter, the prosecution rested and court adjourned for the day.  By any civilian standard, jeopardy had attached.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">The Jeopardy Implosion</span><br /><br />The next day, prior to beginning the defense case, Watada&#39;s defense counsel submitted a proposed jury instruction on a &quot;mistake of fact&quot; defense.  The judge became concerned over language in the proposed instruction, i.e.,:<br />&quot;The evidence has raised the issue of mistake on the part of the accused concerning his belief that he had a legal and moral obligation to refuse to participate in the war in Iraq relating to the offenses of missing movement,&quot; as being in conflict with the Stipulation of Fact Watada had signed and which by now had been both admitted into evidence and published to the members.  After a lengthy dispute, the judge noted that he was inclined to &quot;reject&quot; the admitted stipulation and withdraw it, which in turn would abrogate the parties&#39; Pretrial Agreement.<br /><br />At that point, the military judge sua sponte raised the subject of a mistrial, and the defense immediately responded by raising the double jeopardy issue.  The Army prosecutor then advised the judge that he had no problem with the stipulation, but that the &quot;subjective intent&quot; of the defendant, as encompassed within the proposed instruction, was &quot;irrelevant.&quot;  After further inquiry by the judge - and most importantly as will be seen, no consideration of alternatives - the judge formally rejected the Stipulation of Fact and asked the prosecution if they wanted a mistrial.  Rather than seek a less drastic alternative, the government then inexplicably moved for a mistrial.  The Defense immediately objected, to no avail.  A mistrial was declared and a new trial date established.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">The &quot;Jeopardy&quot; Litigation and the Great Writ</span><br /><br />Prior to the start of Watada&#39;s second court-martial, he moved to dismiss the charges on double jeopardy grounds.  The military judge denied the motion, as did interlocutory appeals to the Army Court of Criminal Appeals and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.  Four days before the scheduled retrial, Watada sought relief via a Writ of Habeas Corpus in the U.S. District Court, which issued a preliminary stay.  A month later, after an evidentiary hearing, the Court issued a preliminary injunction precluding restarting the court-martial proceedings. On October 21, 2008, the federal court in Tacoma, Washington, granted the Writ with respect to the charges against Watada that were before the first court-martial, but denied without prejudice, the claims pertaining to the charges that had been dismissed as part of the original Pretrial Agreement.  <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Watada II</span><br /><br />Watada II, is instructive for all criminal law practitioners.  But, for military law practitioners, it serves as a stark reminder - especially to military prosecutors - that there is a marked distinction between the statutory <a href="http://www.military-network.com/main_ucmj/SUBCHAPTERVII.html#844.44">double jeopardy right in the UCMJ</a>, and the Constitutional prohibition contained in the Fifth Amendment.  Because of the uniqueness of military practice under the UCMJ, which allows a convicted service-member to seek immediate post-conviction relief, both as to the underlying conviction(s) as well as sentence, from the Commander who convened the court-martial before the initial appeal, and because the UCMJ provides for mandatory appeals (unless affirmatively waived by the defendant), in the event of a sentence to a discharge or confinement of one year or more, statutory jeopardy does not attach until that mandatory appellate review is final. A discharge (or dismissal for officers) is not effective until that review is final - the theory being that those convicted ll want to take advantage of a free and mandatory appellate process.<br /><br />Watada, however, had not sought relief under the UCMJ in federal court - he sought the protection of the Fifth Amendment&#39;s Double Jeopardy clause.  That appears to have been overlooked by the Army prosecutors at the time that they made their mistrial motion.  Constitutional Double Jeopardy has long been held applicable to members of our military forces and courts-martial (see <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/206/333/case.html">Grafton v. United States</a>) so the only question was, did it under the circumstances, apply in Watada&#39;s case?  The answer per Watada II, is, yes.<br /> <br />Once the Fifth Amendment Double Jeopardy Clause was deemed applicable, the District Court turned to federal Double Jeopardy jurisprudence pertaining to mistrials.  Thus, a prosecutor seeking a mistrial must first establish a &quot;manifest necessity&quot; for such relief, which includes consideration of less drastic alternatives.  This is the crux of Watada II, as the Court found that not only was there no manifest necessity for a mistrial, but that the judge had not explored possible remedial action with the parties, e.g., a continuance, refusing to give the defense requested instruction, etc.  The vice that the Fifth Amendment&#39;s Double Jeopardy Clause was designed to prevent - a second trial on the same charges - barred Watada&#39;s retrial.<br /><br />In the end, in spite of the twists and turns of military practice, which at first blush might appear to be confusing to the novice, in reading Watada II, like one of the Sherlock Holmes&#39; stories, the result was quite &quot;elementary.&quot;  There simply was no &quot;manifest necessity&quot; justifying the mistrial at Watada&#39;s first court-martial, thus the second for those charges, was barred, and the Great Writ issued.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Stephen Hanlon</strong> [Chair, American Bar Association <a href="http://www.abanet.org/moratorium/home.html">Death Penalty Moratorium Implementation Project</a> Steering Committee]: &quot;While the <a href="http://www.abanet.org/">American Bar Association</a> (ABA) takes no position on the death penalty <em>per se</em>, it has called on U.S. capital jurisdictions to halt executions until policies and procedures are implemented to ensure that death penalty cases are administered fairly and impartially and to minimize the risk that innocent persons are executed.<br /><br />In comprehensive assessments conducted by the ABA in eight U.S. states between 2005 and 2007, the ABA identified numerous areas in which these jurisdictions are failing to ensure fairness and accuracy in their administration of the death penalty. Similar shortcomings were cited by the U.N. Human Rights Committee in its <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/un-human-rights-committee-urges-japan.php">observations about Japan</a>. These problem areas include:<br /><ul><li><strong>Failure to ensure that the death penalty is limited to the most serious crimes. </strong>Comparative proportionality review, where an appellate court compares a death sentence to sentences imposed on similarly situated defendants, helps ensure that the death penalty is reserved for the worst of the worst offenses and offenders. In states examined, the ABA found that courts do not conduct meaningful comparative proportionality review, or, as in Arizona and Pennsylvania, appellate courts do not engage in any sort of proportionality review;</li><br /><br /> <li><strong>Failure to implement law enforcement practices designed to minimize the risk of wrongful convictions. </strong>Eyewitness misidentification and false confessions are two of the primary causes of wrongful convictions. The ABA found that law enforcement agencies in most jurisdictions examined have not implemented national &quot;best practices&quot; on identification and interrogations and that most states do not require law enforcement to video or audio record the entirety of custodial interrogations in murder cases; and</li><br /><br /> <li><strong>Unavailability of meaningful review of a death row inmate&#39;s case for clemency.</strong> The clemency process is the final avenue for review for death row petitioners; however, the ABA found that few states require that the clemency decision-maker meet with an inmate or an inmate&#39;s counsel and that clemency petitions are granted or denied without any explanation of reasons.</li></ul>In 2005, the American Bar Association (ABA), the Japan Federation of Bar Associations (JFBA), and the European Commission sponsored an International Leadership Conference on Human Rights and the Death Penalty held in Tokyo, Japan. Worldwide capital punishment issues were raised at that conference with which Japan and the U.S. each still grapple. The U.S. has much work ahead to prevent injustice, unfairness, and inaccuracy in its death penalty systems and the UN Human Rights&#39; Committee has set forth a similar challenge for Japan.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Joanne Mariner</strong> [Director, Terrorism and Counterterrorism Program, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a>]: &quot;In their sobering report, <em><a href="http://ccrjustice.org/files/Report_GTMO_And_Its_Aftermath.pdf">Guantanamo and Its Aftermath</a></em> [PDF file], researchers at the University of California, Berkeley - working in partnership with the <a href="http://www.ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> - have documented an array of serious abuses.  The report describes how detainees held in U.S. military detention at Kandahar and Bagram, Afghanistan, and at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, were in many cases physically abused, humiliated, deprived of sleep, put in painful &quot;stress&quot; positions, and subjected to psychological isolation. Not simply the actions of undisciplined soldiers, these abuses reflected a decision on the part of senior civilian and military leaders to ignore basic human rights and humanitarian law standards.<br /> <br />The report is based on extensive research, including the testimonies of 62 former detainees, but as it emphasizes, &quot;there is more to be learned.&quot; To ensure that the full story of post-9/11 detention-related abuses comes to light, the report urges the incoming Obama administration to <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/rights-groups-urge-independent.php">establish an independent, nonpartisan commission</a> to investigate the detention and treatment of detainees held in U.S. custody around the world since 2001.  Such a commission, the report emphasizes, should be composed of distinguished figures known for their integrity, expertise, and achievements.  It should also have subpoena power to compel witness and gain access to classified documents.<br /> <br />Such a commission is sorely needed.  It is past time for a full and public accounting of the scale of post-9/11 abuses, why and how they occurred, and who was responsible for authorizing them. Although several congressional inquiries, military reports, and Department of Justice investigations have looked into particular aspects of these questions, there has never been a comprehensive public inquiry into post-9/11 abuses, and investigations to date have either lacked independence from the executive branch or access to necessary documentary and testimonial evidence.  <br /> <br />Only by accounting for the abuses of the past seven years will Americans fully understand what went wrong, and be able to ensure that this ugly chapter in U.S. history is never repeated.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Maiko Tagusari</strong> [researcher on penal system reform, <a href="http://www.nichibenren.or.jp/en/index.html">Japan Federation of Bar Associations</a>]: &quot;In its Concluding Observations, the <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/un-human-rights-committee-urges-japan.php">UN Human Rights Committee made it clear</a> that Japan is going against the requirements under the Covenant and is strongly required to end its continuous and expanded usage of the death penalty.<br /><br />At the end of the session, Mr. Rivas Posada, President of HRC, stated that the Committee members felt frustrated during the review of Japan. Actually, despite the fact that both death sentences and executions are drastically increasing in recent years, the government just repeated its official position that since Japan&#39;s death penalty system is very cautiously operated and supported strongly by public opinion, it should not be abolished. On the other hand, the government never answered the questions posed by the HRC members such as, &quot;Is the government prepared to provide the information on problematic aspects of the death penalty or desirability of its abolition with the public?&quot; or &quot;Does the fact that many death sentences become finalized without exhausting the right of appeal show that using this right is actually difficult for the prisoners?&quot;<br /><br />On top of the lack of dialogue with the Committee, it is safe to say that the executions of two death row prisoners which were carried out just after the session infuriated the Committee. It is true that abolishing the death penalty is not easy for a retentionist country, however, the government should and can take any necessary measures to limit its usage, as seen in practices in the U.S. or even in China, which has already introduced the system of mandatory review by the Supreme People&#39;s Court. Now it is a responsibility of Japanese civil society, including bar associations, to disseminate and fully utilize the recommendations made by HRC, with introduction of a totally new Lay Judge System close at hand.&quot;<br />

		<title>Osborne case forces Supreme Court to consider use of post-trial evidence</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/Bio-PicRCD2.pdf"><strong>Richard C. Dieter</strong></a> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/">Death Penalty Information Center</a>]: &quot;Almost every state in the country guarantees defendants the right to have DNA evidence tested after their trial.  Unfortunately for William Osborne, Alaska is not one of those states.  That is why Osborne has asked the federal courts to order the state to allow DNA testing of evidence that was used to convict him at his trial in 1994.  Today, more sophisticated testing might exonerate Osborne, if the testing is allowed.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held that Osborne does have a right to such testing, but Alaska has appealed to the Supreme Court. Now the Court has agreed to hear this issue in <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/supreme-court-takes-dna-evidence-and.php">District Attorney&#39;s Office v. Osborne</a> (No. 08-6).<br /><br />  This case again brings before the Court the difficult question of what the constitution requires if a convicted defendant offers substantial evidence of his innocence long after trial.  A similar issue has arisen in the Troy Davis case from Georgia, where the state wanted to proceed with Davis&#39; execution despite the fact that 7 eyewitnesses who testified against him at trial have recanted their testimony.  Although the U.S. Supreme Court did not take his case on appeal from the Georgia Supreme Court, another <a href="http://www.abajournal.com/news/court_stays_troy_davis_execution_in_extraordinarily_rare_reprieve/">federal court has agreed to consider</a> the fundamental questions surrounding free-standing claims of innocence.<br /><br />  Osborne&#39;s claim is simpler in that DNA testing has become fairly routine and does not require courts to assess the credibility of witnesses.  There is also no execution date pending since this is not a death penalty case.  The testing might exonerate Osborne, confirm his guilt, or be inconclusive.  But in any event, the state and the justice system would have additional critical knowledge that is easily available, but is now lacking.  It seems a small price to pay to avoid the lengthy imprisonment of an innocent person.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Sharon Kelly</strong> [<a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/etn/elect08/index.aspx?source=home">Elect to End Torture Campaign Manager</a>, Human Rights First]: &quot;One week before the presidential election, the Guantanamo trials grind slowly on, although this week&#39;s trial of Ali Hamza Ahmed Sulayman al-Bahlul, a Yemeni accused of being Osama Bin Laden&#39;s media adviser, may very well mark the beginning of the end of proceedings at the facility. Both Senator Obama and Senator McCain have stated a desire to close the detention facility and, while Defense Secretary Gates has said it will remain <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/vcCandidateFeed7/idUSTRE49K89L20081021">open</a> through the end of the Bush Administration, recent days have brought dropped charges and another prosecutor <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-gitmo22-2008oct22,0,6309987.story">resigning in protest</a>. <br /><br />In a departure from his <a href="http://www.acsblog.org/guest-bloggers-complex-questions-continue-to-hinder-military-commission-progress.html">previous loquaciousness</a> in court, Mr. al-Bahlul has sat mute for the past two days, boycotting his trial. In accordance with the wishes of his client, Mr. al-Bahlul&#39;s lawyer, Major David Frakt, has sat silently at the next table as the prosecution has begun to introduce evidence tying Mr. al-Bahlul to a film celebrating the destruction of the U.S.S. Cole and urging others to join Al Qaeda.<br /><br />In short, the military commissions system which has been almost perversely tone deaf to the impression it conveys to the rest of the world is the forum for the trial of a now-silent propagandist.<br /><br />A trial, not unlike a propaganda film, tells a story. It is the stringent rules governing trial procedure that allow participants and observers to accept a trial&#39;s version of events as coming closer to truth than propaganda. At the trial&#39;s conclusion, a jury renders a verdict and, because the process has been fair, the results can be accepted by parties and the public as final.<br /><br />The ongoing propensity of the Military Commissions to undermine what should be one of its key functions - establishing a record that can be accepted as true and fair - continues with the al-Bahlul trial:<br /><br /><blockquote>The prosecution team has three members actively involved in the trial. A fourth consults from the gallery. The defense consists of one lawyer, and he is not talking. This striking visual disparity is surely an aim of Mr. al-Bahlul.<br /><br />Six of the nine members of the jury previously served on the jury which handed down the maximum sentence to David Hicks, the Australian defendant who was subsequently sent back to Australia and released. The exact same person who served as that trial&#39;s foreman serves as foreman today. Upon inquiry, this duplication, rather than a cynical attempt to stack the deck in favor of conviction and harsh sentencing, is revealed to be the consequence of rather questionable planning: only four panels of potential jurors are available to hear all of the approximately eighty cases currently pending at Guantanamo. While the Military Commissions Act of 2006 authorizes any commissioned officer on active duty to serve as a member of a military commission, what is likely fewer than one hundred people currently comprise the entire jury pool. <br /><br />Finally, what almost surely won&#39;t be addressed within the frame of this trial at all are the troubling suggestions that Mr. Al-Bahlul was abused in American custody. This allegation surfaced in prosecution <a href="http://74.125.95.104/search?q=cache:EAfMCRKnMvsJ:www.thomasjfiscus.net/files/Carr_Wolf_Email0183.pdf+fiscus+and+al+bahlul&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=us">e-mails</a> and may have contributed to <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/137627/page/3">the resignation</a> of prosecutors. With the defense boycotting, the story of what really happened may never come to light.</blockquote> <br />So far, there has been nothing in this trial that would have prevented it from being conducted in federal court. As the growing consensus that Guantanamo must close leads to the question of &quot;what next,&quot; the hard lessons learned here - from prosecutors resigning in protest to stalled cases - must not be lost in a misguided push to establish a new Guantanamo in the United States. It would compound the injustice here if this trial were merely the end of the beginning.&quot;<br /><br /><em>&quot;Report from Guantanamo&quot; is a regular column written by <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/">Human Rights First</a></em>.<br />

		<title>California passage of Proposition 9 shows broad support for victims&#039; rights</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Jack Reilley</strong> [Chair, <a href="http://www.friendsofmarsyslaw.org/">Friends of Marsy&#39;s Law</a>]: &quot;<a href="/paperchase/2008/11/california-backs-victims-rights-measure.php">Proposition 9 passed</a> by 53.5 percent and over five million voters said YES. It was a huge win because Prop 9 was opposed by all major California newspapers, many of the major television and radio station personalities, the Democrat Party, the teacher unions, the firefighter unions, organized labor, the ACLU and a variety of criminal rights groups. Most District Attorney&#39;s took a &quot;no position&quot; stand but privately opposed the initiative. Police and Sheriff organizations generally supported Prop 9. <br /> <br />There was scant money spent to promote Prop 9 during the campaign. Our opponents are angry that they were defeated and will surely initiate lawsuits and will build up bureaucratic obstacles to implementation.<br /> <br />Prop 9 was developed and put on the ballot for victims of violent crime. This was the only recourse since the state legislature would not respond to victim pleas for fairness in the criminal justice process. Victim rights initiatives began in the 1980s, with Prop 9 as the latest. Voters have always supported victims rights and strong anti-criminal initiatives.<br /> <br />Prop 9 provides constitutional and enforceable victim rights in the investigative, plea, bail, pre and post trial decisions, and also during sentencing and parole processes. Victims cannot be excluded from decisions concerning their case and welfare. Victim&#39;s personal lives are protected from unwarranted defense attorney actions. <br /> <br />Prop 9 will prevent the legislature from emptying prisons to balance the budget or relieve overcrowding. This is the main point of contention publicly expressed by the opposition.<br /> <br />Prop 9 will alter the frequency of parole hearings. The Parole Commissioners can decide to delay parole hearing for unrepentant prisoners for various periods of up to 15 years. This is a major win for victims who have to relive the agony of repeated parole hearings for unrepentant prisoners.<br /> <br />All victim initiatives are unsuccessfully challenged in court. Victims are gearing up now to enforce our Prop 9 rights throughout the criminal justice system.&quot;<br />

		<title>Treasury Department must improve terrorism designation procedures</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.erenlaw.com/lawyers/vcomras.html"><strong>Victor Comras</strong></a> [Special Counsel, <a href="http://www.erenlaw.com/">Eren Law Firm</a>]: &quot;The process used to designate, and freeze the assets of, terrorists and those providing material support for terrorism, has come under serious <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/federal-court-rules-against-part-of.php">judicial challenge</a> here and abroad. The <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/">European Court of Justice </a>recently invalidated the EU&#39;s designations (binding on all EU member countries) of Yasin Al Kadi and the European branches of the Al Barakaat network, on grounds they were denied an opportunity to be heard as guaranteed by the European Convention of Human Rights. Similar questions are being raised in several cases now before the US courts.<br /> <br />One of these cases involves the Oregon branch of the international Al Haramain network of charities believed to have helped fund al Qaeda, the Taliban and other terrorist groups in Bosnia and Chechnya. The US Treasury Department originally designated the Oregon based Al Haramain Islamic Foundation (AHIF) in 2004 as a terrorism supporting organization, and then, again, in 2008, as part of its designation of the complete global Al Haramain network. In <u>Al Haramain v. Treasury</u>, now before the US District Court in Oregon, AHIF-Oregon is challenging these designations on constitutional and other grounds. A key issue in this complex case is whether the notice of designation and the hearing procedures provided by Treasury Department meet constitutional due process and Fourth Amendment protection standards.<br /> <br />The ability to designate terrorism supporting organizations and to freeze their assets and financial transactions is critical to international efforts to combat terrorism financing. Identifying and blocking terrorism financing transactions usually entails sensitive and highly classified sources and methods, and quick responsive action. The evidence developed does not often lend itself to prior judicial proceedings. It is incumbent on the government, nevertheless, to stand ready to justify such actions, and each dossier should be prepared from the beginning with oversight and possible judicial review in mind. It seems elementary that the first step in this process is to provide adequate notice of designation and an opportunity for a fair hearing to those against whom such actions are taken.<br /> <br />AHIF maintains that the Treasury Department&#39;s designation and asset blocking orders, in this case, were so lax as to amount to a deprivation of its property without due process. And U.S. District Court Judge Garr King appears inclined to agree. In a 63 page opinion on motions for summary judgment, published November 6, 2008, Judge King expresses serious concerns on the adequacy of current methodology used by the Treasury Department in making designations. While he found that the Treasury Department had sufficient evidence upon which to base its designation of Al Haramain, the deficient notification provided and the lack of procedures for a hearing, raised serious due process and Fourth Amendment unreasonable &quot;seizure&quot; issues.<br /> <br />The Treasury Department&#39;s notification of designation in this case consisted of little more than a letter explaining the consequences of designation along with some 260 pages of excerpts from documents, news clips and press releases attached. No discussion or summary was provided indicating the specific rationale for the designation. Judge King found that such notice failed to meet the due process standards established by <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/424/319/case.html">Mathews v. Eldridge</a>.<br /> <br />In the <u>Mathews</u> case, the Supreme Court recognized that due process generally requires the government to provide substantive notice and an opportunity to be heard before depriving a person of property.  Judge King held that the notification package in this case failed to adequately identify the statutory and factual reasons for the designation. He could find no justification in the record for such cursory treatment. Rather, the Treasury Department maintained only that it was &quot;not obligated&quot; to provide anything more.<br /> <br />Judge King noted also, that while Treasury procedures allowed AHIF to file a request for reconsideration, it remained unclear when and under what circumstances such re-consideration would occur. In fact, it took OFAC some 3 years to consider and deny relief, during which time the assets subject to the designation blocking order remained frozen. Despite these findings, Judge King agreed to defer a final ruling on this point asking the parties to brief further as to whether this constitutional failing constituted more than &quot;harmless error,&quot; given the other factors in the case.<br /> <br />Judge King ruling also expresses concern with the Fourth Amendment consequences which might flow from such Treasury Department asset blocking orders. Such blocking orders, Judge King mused, were more than temporary measures, and might well constitute a &quot;meaningful interference&quot; with property so as to qualify as a seizure for purposes of the Fourth Amendment. The central issue to be addressed, he said, was whether or not such seizure would be &quot;reasonable&quot; under the circumstances. He felt that neither party had briefed adequately on that question.<br /> <br />Given the importance the designation process has for combating terrorism, here and abroad, special efforts must now be made by Treasury to provide as much transparency as possible to the designation process, and to re-assure the public, here and abroad, that appropriate safeguards and judicial review is in place to assure against abuse.&quot;<br />

Bush's term as president is coming to an end, and he has little to show by way of meting out justice for the terrorist attacks of 9/11. Perhaps this is why his administration seems so desperate to score a victory on the judicial battleground of the military commissions. That its target is Omar Khadr, a child soldier at the time of the alleged offenses, makes the spectacle all the more pathetic to the observer, and tragic for Khadr.<br /><br />The charges against Khadr include "murder in violation of the laws of war," and providing material support to the enemy. The most serious allegation against him is that on July 27, 2002 in Afghanistan, he threw a grenade that killed US soldier Sergeant Christopher Speer. Indeed, until a few months ago, the official story went unchallenged in the public domain. Thanks to an inadvertent government leak, we have since learned of evidence supporting at least two alternate scenarios, namely that another combatant might have thrown the grenade or that Sgt. Speer was killed by "friendly fire."<br /><br />None of those questions, however, were the subject of the October 22 pre-trial hearing. Most of the time was consumed by arguments about scheduling of the actual trial. The prosecution accused the defense of what, in hockey parlance, is called "ragging the puck": stalling until the game is over. They cite defense counsel Lt. Cmdr. William Kuebler's efforts to petition the Canadian government to seek the repatriation of its citizen (as every other industrialized country has done with respect to Guantanamo detainees) as evidence that the defense has no interest in proceeding to trial, and every intention of delaying the onset of the trial indefinitely in the hopes of an eventual political resolution. The defense counters that it is unable to prepare properly for trial because the prosecution has systematically refused to fulfill its obligations to disclose relevant and exculpatory evidence. <br /><br />The prosecution has also criticized the defense for wanting to obtain a psychological evaluation of Khadr by independent experts, rather than relying the government's own professionals. <br /><br />Arguments about delay are standard fare in ordinary litigation, and it is symptomatic of a military commission that is both like and unlike a normal trial. In a normal trial, it would not be unusual for the prosecution to accuse the defense of using discovery as a fishing expedition, and to suggest that the defense has no reasonable basis for requesting the information. In the Khadr hearing, the prosecution argued that the defense was engaging in just such a fishing expedition by seeking access to the intelligence interrogators who interviewed Khadr at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan and at Guantanamo Bay. <br /><br />Here is how the argument went: the prosecution stated that it intends to rely at trial solely on statements made by Khadr to law enforcement interrogators, not to intelligence interrogators. Therefore, defense does not need access to the intelligence interrogators, and their evidence is irrelevant. <br /><br />The defense's main response was that, before and after Khadr was interrogated by law enforcement officials (under relatively benign conditions), he was subject to coercion (including possibly cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment and torture) by intelligence interrogators. This experience of recent past abuse and the fear of imminent future abuse by intelligence interrogators would have saturated the environment within which Khadr was interrogated by law enforcement officials. On this theory, statements made by Khadr to law enforcement officials could not be construed as free from coercion, in light of Khadr's past interrogation and fear of future interrogation at the hands of intelligence interrogators. These interrogators included the notorious Sgt. C, who was subsequently implicated in the torture and murder of another detainee around the same time. Therefore, discovery of the intelligence interrogators was crucial to establishing a foundation for a motion to suppress certain statements Khadr made during interrogation.<br /><br />The prosecution's reply? That defense counsel's position regarding the use of coercive techniques by intelligence interrogators was mere speculation and assertion without factual support. So, the motion to obtain discovery of seven intelligence interrogators who interviewed Khadr during three discrete periods (Bagram in July-August 2002, Guantanamo Bay in October 2002 &#8212; February 2003, and late 2004) was an overly broad request built on unsubstantiated conjecture that intelligence personnel employed coercive interrogation techniques against detainees. Only at Guantanamo Bay could a lawyer be heard to make such an assertion without a trace of irony.<br /><br />This is not a normal trial.<br /><br />The other issue argued before the judge, Col. Patrick Parrish, is more complex, and exposes the incoherence produced by a legal order designed not to produce justice, but to secure convictions. The question was whether murder committed by an "unlawful enemy combatant" is automatically a war crime, or whether something more is required to turn murder into a violation of the laws of war.<br /><br />Under the Geneva Conventions, members of a state's armed forces who kill enemy combatants on the battlefield may not be prosecuted for murder under the domestic laws of the enemy state. That protection is called the "combatant's privilege". Individuals who take up arms that are not part of a state's armed forces, so-called unlawful (or, more properly, unprivileged) combatants, enjoy no such immunity from domestic criminal prosecution. This means that the US government could have charged Khadr under US criminal law and tried him in a US federal court. The government chose not to do so. <br /><br />Khadr was instead charged under the Military Commissions Act with murder and attempted murder "in violation of the laws of war." While it is not a war crime to kill an enemy combatant on the battlefield, the prosecution insists that it becomes a war crime &#8212; a serious violation of the laws of armed conflict &#8212; if committed by an unlawful enemy combatant. Defense counsel Rebecca Snyder argued that a battlefield killing only becomes a war crime when a combatant &#8212; privileged or otherwise &#8212; targets a person with protected status, or uses prohibited methods of killing. Protected persons include civilians, all persons in custody, incapacitated military personnel, or military medical or religious personnel. Prohibited methods include the use of human shields, poison gas, or intentional deception designed to induce the enemy into believing that one is a protected person (which is known as perfidy). Therefore, unless the prosecution can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Sgt. Speer was a protected person when killed (which the prosecution does not contend), or that Khadr used prohibited methods of killing (which has also not been argued), his alleged actions could not constitute murder "in violation of the laws of war" even if he were an unlawful enemy combatant at the time. <b
r /><br />The prosecution seems to claim that international law does not matter. It claims that Congress can create a new war crime under US law &#8212; and has in the Military Commissions Act &#8212; even if it has never been considered a war crime under international law in this century or the last. <br /><br />Arguing that all acts of war by unlawful combatants are by definition war crimes points toward the "heads I win; tails you lose" quality of the Military Commissions process. Khadr is a combatant when it comes to detaining him indefinitely (even if acquitted of the charges against him), but not when it comes to providing him the privileges and immunities of combatants. He is a criminal defendant when it comes to charging him with murder, but not when it comes to furnishing him with the rights and protections due to anyone charged with a crime. <br /><br />One status that Khadr can claim unambiguously is his Canadian citizenship. Yet Canada has thus far failed to regard him as a citizen entitled to the protection of his state. It has failed to demand his fair treatment, failed to insist that he be tried in a fair process, and failed to seek his repatriation absent compliance with these requests. Canada, it seems, is missing in action. <br /><br />The trial of Khadr before the Military Commission is now scheduled to commence on January 26, six days after the inauguration of the next US president. Both candidates have vowed to bring to an end the disastrous experiment in injustice that is Guantanamo Bay. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper has remained steadfastly impervious to the growing chorus of Canadians who deplore the continued detention of Khadr in Guantanamo Bay and call upon Prime Minister Harper to seek his repatriation. Harper has preferred instead to follow docilely in the trench dug by the current US president. Perhaps the most viable hope for Khadr is that the next US president will swiftly honor his commitment to close Guantanamo Bay and that Harper will continue to defer to his US counterpart. <br /><br /><br /><em>Audrey Macklin is a law professor at the University of Toronto.

The Yes on Prop 8 campaign's most compelling ads feature children coming home from school with stories of a prince marrying a prince and parents expressing fears that their children will be taught about same-sex marriage in public schools. Proponents of Prop 8 have seized on the political sensitivity surrounding children and parental fears over children's exposure to anything touching on the sexual. But Prop 8 isn't about curriculum &#8212; it's about the fundamental right of lesbians and gay men to marry in California.<br /><br />Prop 8 supporters claim that if the initiative fails and same-sex couples continue to marry, California schools will be forced to teach about same-sex marriage. To make this claim, proponents rely on the California Education Code and the First Circuit's decision in Parker v. Hurley, which rejected a parental challenge to gay-inclusive curriculum in Lexington, Massachusetts. Both, however, fail to provide adequate support for the proponents' contention.<br /><br />First, school curriculum is an intensely local decision. Local school boards, elected by local residents, create, revise, and implement curriculum. While public schools must teach core subjects and ensure that students attain a certain level of competence, they enjoy a tremendous amount of discretion. Nowhere is that discretion more expansive than in the domain of health and sex education. In fact, schools in California may decide to provide no such instruction whatsoever. If schools do offer sex education, the California Education Code requires that schools teach "respect for marriage and committed relationships." But even this statutory provision is silent as to what that instruction should (let alone must) include. Instead, local school districts may include what they like, based on parental feedback, teacher input, and the decisions of politically accountable local officials. Some school districts have for years included material on lesbians and gay men, while many others have omitted such material. That variation will not change (and has not changed) in light of the ability of same-sex couples to marry in California. Schools will continue to exercise their broad discretion and will not operate under any new mandates. Furthermore, parents in California enjoy the right to exempt their children from sex education. This right to opt out will continue to exist, meaning that children won't receive sex education (gay-inclusive or not) to which their parents object.<br /><br />Next, Prop 8 proponents' reliance on Parker is also misplaced. The First Circuit would have ruled in exactly the same way if Massachusetts did not allow same-sex couples to marry. The challenge to the gay-inclusive curriculum failed because parents do not have a constitutional right to control a school's curriculum. Instead, parents, as the court explained, must change the curriculum through political channels. If parents disagree with local curricular decisions, they should voice complaints to school officials or work to elect a new school board.<br /><br />Lexington was not required to teach about the families that lesbians and gay men form. Indeed, Lexington was one of very few school districts in Massachusetts that included such instruction, even though same-sex couples have enjoyed the right to marry since 2003. Rather, the Lexington school district had discretion to build its own curriculum. No statutory provision &#8212; and nothing about the court's decision &#8212; requires Lexington or any other school district to teach students about same-sex couples. The same is true in California. Schools will continue to enjoy broad discretion to fashion a curriculum that reflects their community's values, and parents will continue to influence their schools' decisions. Moreover, the texts at issue in Lexington constituted part of the district's diversity curriculum, rather than sex education curriculum. Schools in California are under no obligation to provide such curriculum and absolutely no obligation to include issues of marriage or depictions of same-sex couples if they do.<br /><br />Based both on California law and relevant decisions from other states, it is clear that the right of lesbians and gay men to marry will not affect public schools' discretion to craft their own curriculum. We shouldn't be distracted from the issue at hand: Prop 8 does not involve children or curriculum; it involves the fundamental right of lesbians and gay men to marry.<br /><br /><br /><em>Douglas NeJaime is the Sears Law Teaching Fellow at the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law</em><br />

Born in 1961, seven years after the Supreme Court&#39;s landmark decision on desegregation in <em>Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka</em> (1954), Obama leads this revolution, which offers racial coexistence to replace memories of slavery, segregation, discrimination, prejudice, and bigotry. <br /><br />Nations do not correct themselves easily. That America has turned on its own history and elected a man the likes of whom have been brutally lynched in our own lifetimes, speaks well for Americans, who overwhelmingly voted to erase a race-bound past. <br /><br />The First American Revolution (1776) sought independence from the British Empire, and established a constitutional democracy. The Second American Revolution (2008) seeks independence from an ideology of prejudice, which has brought sorrow to millions of people at home and abroad. The Obama Presidency can turn the course of history if it acts upon the following principles:<ol><li>discard American Exceptionalism, a morally corrupt metaphysical theory of arrogance, invented to hide, defend, and perpetrate injustices at home and abroad. Let America be a nation among nations, equal and respectful, self-confident but not overpowering, righteous but not self-righteous.<br /><br /><li>discard the &quot;war on terror,&quot; a war that has pitted America against the Muslim world. Invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, attacks on Somali, Sudan, Syria, and Pakistan, threats against Iran, veiled hostility toward Saudi Arabia and other Muslim nations - all these and other policies must end. America must search for peace with the Muslim world, a world comprising of 57 states and more than a billion people. Peace will defeat terrorism.<br /><br /><li>recognize social, economic, and cultural rights. The First American Revolution promised civil and political rights, including the right to free speech, religion, association, and the right to vote. Let the Second American Revolution promise the right to health care, education, cultural diversity, and a decent standard of living for all. The United States must ratify the International Covenant on Social, Economic, and Cultural Rights.<br /><br /><li>recognize that America is a decent and humane nation. Its people have no cravings for aggression, extra-judicial killings, torture, secret prisons, military trials, and exporting &quot;democracy&quot; by means of bullets. Deploy American decency to construct a better nation, a better region, and a better world.</ol>The old ruling elites will pressure Obama to reaffirm the dysfunctional ideology of national narcissism, cold-blooded economics, and an aggressive view of the world foolishly divided into Good and Evil. The Obama Presidency must resist the temptation to woo the forces that have been defeated in the general election and their ideology. Obama must not underestimate the promise of the Second American Revolution. <br /><br /><br /><em>Ali Khan is professor of law at Washburn University School of Law in Topeka, Kansas, and the author of the book, <em>A Theory of Universal Democracy</em> (2003).

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://culaw2.creighton.edu/index.aspx?p=1201&sp=26">Michael Kelly</a> of Creighton University School of Law says that not only should the incoming Obama administration close the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay, it should close down the stigmatized military base as a whole, coverting it into a joint US-Cuban scientific station to monitor and study climate change...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/kellyupdated.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>C</strong></font>andidate Obama pledged, if elected, to shut down the military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He was elected president on November 5. Now what? Detainees should be removed and tried by regular military courts or an international criminal tribunal in Afghanistan and the base should converted into a scientific research center to combat climate change &#8212; a field in which President-elect Obama wants America to lead.<br /><br />The Bush Administration maintains that "Gitmo," as it is known, is a necessary evil. Suspected terrorists held there are too dangerous to release and cannot be tried before open courts in the U.S. because sensitive intelligence would be irreparably compromised. Thus, the combination of indefinite detention and the prospect of trial before military tribunals deficient in due process perpetuates itself. So long as Gitmo remains a "legal black hole," America remains unable to return to a leadership position on human rights and the rule of the law in the world.<br /><br />President-elect Obama realizes this and understands that the war of hearts and minds that has been missing in the Bush Administration's global war on terror cannot be successfully waged with Gitmo as part of the equation. Consequently, the question becomes first, what to do with the detainees, and second, what to do with the base and the stigma that has attached to it.<br /><br />Of the 700 detainees who found their way to Gitmo, 255 remain incarcerated there. The government wants to repatriate 60, but their home countries either won't take them or will mistreat them upon return. That leaves 195 detainees who are potentially dangerous and potentially triable for violating the laws of war. The discrepancy between the large numbers who came through Gitmo and those who remain as "threats" is revelatory of the way many got there in the first place: bounty hunters turn people over to U.S. forces as terrorists or Taliban regardless of whether the allegations are true.<br /><br />Assuming something can be done with the 60 non-threatening detainees, what should become of the other 195? Trial in federal courts is unlikely because the government would not be able to meet the high evidentiary requirements. When detainees were sent to Gitmo, building a case against them was not the government's chief interest. It was collecting actionable intelligence &#8212; even if it had to be extracted by torture. Cases against the remaining detainees have not been and cannot be developed sufficiently to withstand scrutiny in federal courts and evidence extracted by torture is inadmissible. Moreover, even under the Classified Information Procedures Act, the government is loath to risk releasing classified intelligence in court.<br /><br />Trial before regularly constituted military courts under the Uniform Code of Military Justice is much more likely. Indeed, relocation of the detainees to the military detention center at Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas has been suggested as a realistic alternative. The U.S. Supreme Court chastised the Bush Administration for not living up to its commitments under the Geneva Conventions and UCMJ in its Gitmo operations. Traditional courts-martial, while offering less evidentiary and more secrecy protections, are considered fair and constitutional.<br /><br />International trial options are another, more remote possibility. But trial before the new International Criminal Court would require altering its underlying treaty and adding terrorism as a crime (which has yet even to be defined internationally). Trial before a new international tribunal in Afghanistan would present a better alternative. This would require U.N. backing to garner maximum legitimacy and include hybrid features that draw upon not only a blend of Islamic and international criminal law, procedures and protections, but also a blend of Afghan and Islamic as well as international jurists.<br /><br />Either way, once Gitmo is depopulated, what becomes of the base? The stigma attached to Gitmo is insurmountable if it is maintained as a military base. The shadow of what went on there is too long and the steady drumbeat of condemnation from the world community too loud. In fact, Gitmo was little used by the U.S. Navy until its conversion into a detention camp for non-POW's in 2002. The U.S. has held a perpetual lease on Gitmo since Cuban independence. Under a 1934 treaty, this lease can only be terminated upon abandonment by the U.S. or by mutual agreement. <br /><br />Mutual agreement is exactly what should happen now. The U.S. should close down the military base. Then, as a first step in thawing relations between Washington and Havana, a jointly governed scientific station should be installed to monitor and study climate change. The port at Gitmo is perfect for scientific research vessels and the airfield could be used for weather planes. <br /><br />The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is the authoritative scientific body that tracks global warming, but it conducts no research. The IPCC is based in Switzerland and has working groups scattered in the Netherlands, Japan, Britain, and the U.S. Synthesizing fragmentary research from governments and universities is how the IPCC fashions its reports on the climate. A newly focused effort located in the tropics at Gitmo, generously funded with windfall taxes on the oil giants and subsidies strong-armed from OPEC, could attract the best climate scientists to generate the most comprehensive research on global warming for the IPCC. <br /><br />Not only would the negative stigma attached to Gitmo fade away, the new facility would become a front line to combat climate change. A side benefit would be the beginning of talks between Cuba and the U.S. &#8212; frozen since 1959. Where that would lead is anyone's guess, but it certainly would be better than the frozen relationship that currently exists. Perhaps even the embargo could be lifted? The Bush Administration would have loved to send Al Gore down to Gitmo. Now is the time for the Obama Administration to do just that.<br /><br /><br /><em>Michael J.

On this 90th anniversary of the end of World War I, America's new president-elect will do the right thing by recommitting this country &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; if not to end all war - to end all unlawful war.<br /><br />Pakistani officials told General David Petraeus on his recent visit to Pakistan to stop the lethal U.S. raids on their country. America has been carrying out attacks on Pakistani soil without Pakistan's consent. The raids violate Pakistan's sovereignty; they are a serious violation of Pakistan's rights under international law, which no state interested in remaining independent can tolerate. <br /><br />The raids in Pakistan violate Afghanistan's sovereignty, too, because they are being launched from Afghan territory, without its government's consent, a government that is struggling to retain authority. Treating it like our vassal does not help. <br /><br />President Karzai has already contacted President-elect Obama to urge him to stop the bombing of his own country - 37 Afghans were killed last week. Mr. Karzai explained that bombing is no way to deal with terrorism, and, of course, he is correct: using the methods of major war to respond to what is essentially a police problem only exacerbates the problem. <br /><br />The U.S. has also launched a raid into Syria from Iraq without the Iraqi government's consent. The Iraqis are now insisting that we commit in a status of forces treaty not to launch raids from Iraqi territory. The U.S. has no right to launch raids from Iraq without Iraqi consent under customary international law, but to enforce the right, Iraqi officials are insisting on a written guarantee in the new treaty. Without the new treaty, the U.S. can lose its right to be in Iraq at any time and our troops become subject to Iraqi courts immediately.<br /><br />The lack of consent to the raids is, however, only one problem. Even with consent, no country has the right to kill civilians without warning. The right to kill without warning is a wartime right restricted to situations of actual armed conflict and even then to members of the armed forces and civilians directly participating in hostilities. <br /><br />There is no armed conflict being waged in Syria. In Pakistan, the Pakistani Parliament wants to use police measures, not military force in the border region with Afghanistan. Changing the approach is being obstructed by the U.S., which is treating the region like a war zone and sending unmanned drones that cannot give a warning before unleashing a lethal attack.<br /><br />Like President Karzai, the Pakistani Parliament is right to urge the U.S. against using war to stop terrorism &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; the right to resort to wartime tactics is restricted to exigent circumstances, real emergencies when nothing else will work. This rule has grown up over centuries and incorporates our best understanding of what is practical and moral. When police measures can be employed, they should be. Fewer civilians will be killed. The chance of winning "hearts and minds" increases. The United Kingdom's change in tactics in Northern Ireland is a now widely cited example of how to succeed against terrorists. <br /><br />By contrast, the U.S. has been fighting in Afghanistan for eight years only to see the Taliban resurge.<br /><br />When innocent civilians are killed there is always grief and usually anger. When such deaths seem excessive in armed conflict or occur outside an armed conflict, the grief, anger and will to revenge can fuel recruits to violence against those who did the killing.<br /><br />Outside an armed conflict, even a person who is suspected of being a terrorist, is a civilian. He is a suspect with the right to a trial. He may be arrested, but he may not be simply executed.<br /><br />The committee I chair for the International Law Association, the Use of Force Committee, presented its initial report on the meaning of armed conflict in international law in August in Rio de Janeiro. The Committee concluded that terrorism is generally a law enforcement problem. Simply declaring that the U.S. is at war all around the globe does not make it legal to kill anywhere and everywhere or detain people in military prisons without trial. Killing in the name of the global war, torturing, establishing Guantanamo Bay, and all the rest has been lawless and counter-productive. <br /><br />It was such a seriously mistaken and unlawful action to respond after 9/11 with a "global war" instead of far more limited measures that were necessary and proportional to the problem in Afghanistan. The decision for a "global war" and the general pro-war attitude of the Bush Administration officials, especially the neo-conservatives, not only have left us fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, but more recently in Pakistan and Somalia as well. With our focus on these many wars, we have not solved the problem of terrorism or much else. We are farther from solving the problem of nuclear proliferation in North Korea, Iran, and elsewhere than before the Bush Administration took office. Conflicts rage in Congo, Sudan, Colombia, the Philippines, and between Israel and its neighbors with no end in sight. The U.S. has offered almost no credible solutions. <br /><br />This country is paying dearly for this lawless behavior &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; not only are problems not being solved, we have lost our standing in the world and we appear weak and powerless at the negotiating table. President-elect Obama has much good will in the world but he will lose it quickly if he does nothing to get the U.S. back into compliance with international law, especially by ending the unlawful use of force. <br /><br />But will the foreign policy advisers around the new president-elect tell him this? He seems to have many of the old guard around him, indulging in old thinking, lots of "human rights hawks"&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;people who advocate for war almost as strongly as the neo-cons. War will not solve the most pressing problems faced by this country and the world&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;it will only make many of them worse.<br /><br />The new president needs to think really newly about foreign policy. Part of the change he needs to make is in the personnel who advise him. There are people who know how to deal successfully with terrorism, how to negotiate with Iran without bombing it, how to advance human rights without killing.<br /><br />The new president would do well, too, to find advisers who know international law and institutions. He needs to really check credentials, however &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; the lawyers who advised President Bush that he could authorize torture during "the global war on terror" were academics from some of the country's finest law schools.<br /><br /><br /><em>Mary Ellen O'Connell is the Robert and Marion Short Chair in Law at the University of Notre Dame.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.wustl.edu/faculty_profiles/indexfaculty.asp?id=390">Leila Nadya Sadat</a> of Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, Missouri, says that come January, a new US administration led by President Barack Obama should take seven specific steps to restore human rights at home and America's respect in the world ...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/leilasadat.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->A<odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->merica&#39;s human rights record has been badly tarnished by seven years of abuse by the Bush Administration in its conduct of the war on terror, particularly as regards U.S. policy towards detainees. The United States has been criticized before the Torture Committee, the Human Rights Committee, the Inter American Commission, the European Parliament, many national courts and Parliaments and the international press. What should the new administration do to set matters right?<br /><br /><strong>First, close the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.</strong> <br /><br />The existence of this prison camp, which Amnesty International labeled "the gulag of our time" in 2005, has become a lightening rod for criticism of the United States and a recruitment tool for international terrorists. It seems clear from what information is available, that of the approximately 250 detainees left in Guantanamo Bay, most have been cleared for release, but the administration has not been able to find a country willing to take them. Closing "Gitmo" has been advocated by former Secretaries of State, military officers, human rights groups and legal and political experts. During his campaign, President-elect Obama announced that he planned to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay if elected, and he should make it a top priority to keep this promise. <br /><br /><strong>Second, ensure respect for the U.S. Constitution by using existing, ordinary courts &#8212; civilian and military &#8212; to try Guantanamo detainees who are accused of serious crimes.</strong> <br /><br />During his campaign, President-elect Obama also announced that the existing legal system could handle whichever detainees remained to be tried. To his great credit, he voted against the Military Commissions Act of 2006, which permitted the government to classify individuals &#8212; including U.S. citizens -- as "unlawful enemy combatants," and subject them to a special legal regime. Yesterday it was reported that Senator Obama was considering the establishment of a "new legal system" to handle some detainees, which is presumably a reference to the establishment of national security courts recently proposed by a handful of legal scholars. Although advocates of creating a new set of courts to try terror suspects are no doubt sincere in trying to "fix" the problem of what to do with the detainees at Guantanamo Bay, let's remember that at least some of these folks are the ones who gave the advice that supported the practice of rendition and the establishment of Guantanamo Bay in the first place. Indeed, a close look at their proposals suggests a disregard for time-tested rules of law eerily similar to the lawyering style that has pervaded the administration during the past eight years. Let's turn the page on that infelicitous precedent! The federal courts, and regularly constituted military courts, are more than capable of trying individuals accused of terrorism and violations of the laws and customs of war, as they have done so before.<br /><br /><strong>Third, the President should establish a Blue Ribbon Commission evaluating U.S. detention policies over the past seven years.</strong> <br /><br />The Commission needs to examine not only issues of accountability for violations of U.S. and international law, but should make an authoritative record and issue recommendations regarding victim reparations for those who were imprisoned by U.S. officials or under U.S. authority by mistake. The Commission could also make recommendations concerning the other items on this list of suggestions, as well. <br /><br /><strong>Fourth, the President should immediately issue an Executive Order mandating humane treatment for all detainees in U.S. custody.</strong> <br /><br />It needs to be made clear that there is no "CIA exception" to the Convention Against Torture and the Geneva Conventions, and that the United States takes seriously not only its role as a beacon of freedom, human rights and democracy, but its obligations under international law. <br /><br /><strong>Fifth, the President should recommit the United States of America to the international and domestic rule of law; by supporting and ratifying, when possible, the many human rights and humanitarian law treaties that the United States has eschewed during the past decade.</strong> <br /><br />In particular, the United States should support the International Criminal Court and ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention for the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, the Landmines Ban, the ban on Cluster Bombs and the new treaty on Enforced Disappearances. Perhaps the idea of the United States supporting international human rights and humanitarian law treaties is farfetched &#8212; after all, the Law of the Sea Convention continues to languish in the Senate even thought President Bush supports it. Yet Obama's election allows one to hope that what seemed improbable only a few months ago might actually be possible. Moreover, to the extent that a new American era is now at hand, what better way to begin it than to accept international treaties that have been negotiated and accepted by our allies all over the world? <br /><br /><strong>Sixth, the President should not issue pardons to individuals accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity or facilitating torture or cruel, degrading or inhumane treatment.</strong> <br /><br />As of yet, very few individuals have been held to account for the abuses at Abu Ghraib prison, Guantanamo Bay, and detention facilities around the world to which individuals were rendered by U.S. officials or on U.S. instructions. Efforts to insulate individuals in advance included obtaining legal opinions that served, in Jane Mayer's words, as "golden shields" to permit rendition, torture and cruel treatment, and amending the war crimes act of 1996 to try to prevent effective use of federal law to bring prosecutions against individuals who may have engaged in torture or cruel treatment. Without prejudging in any way the outcome of any Commission established to look into issues of accountability, further legal immunization of individuals who may have committed or aided and abetted the commission of these crimes should be off the table. <br /><br /><strong>Seventh, the President should seriously consider joining the Inter-American system by ratifying the American Convention on Human Rights.</strong> <br /><br />Additionally (or alternatively) the United States could consider establishing its own human rights commission. Regional human rights regimes such as the European Convention on Human Rights have clearly had a moderating influence on European efforts to address international terrorism. For example, in <em>A. v. Secretary of State</em>, the U.K House of Lords held that Britain could not indefinitely detain aliens suspected of connections to terrorism.<br /><br />As Lord Hoffman wrote in that case,<blockquote>This is a nation which has been tested in adversity, which has survived physical destruction and catastrophic loss of life. I do not underestimate the ability of fanatical groups of terrorists to kill and destroy, but they do not threaten the life of the nation. Whether we would survive Hitler hung in the balance, but there is no doubt that we shall survive Al-Qaeda.</blockquote>There is no doubt that gov
ernments have a duty to respond to national security threats; but they have equally important obligations to ensure the human rights of their citizens, and their prisoners. Fear causes governments to overreact; strong institutions help nations to respond in a more measured way. Most democracies are members of regional human rights regimes, and many have their own national human rights commissions. The United States could consider these examples as it looks for ways to strengthen its own human rights record, and enhance its world leadership. <br /><br />The new President should consider implementing these suggestions even though cynics could argue that the United States has "gotten away" with conducting the war on its own terms, without regard either to a decent respect for the opinions of mankind or the legal and institutional framework of international law. In addition to the obvious point of enlightened self-interest -- that the United States can only achieve its objectives if it acts with legitimacy and commands respect -- there is the deeper moral question of deciding what we stand for. Do Americans still believe that all human beings are created equal and endowed with inalienable rights, beliefs that many generations of Americans have died fighting for, beliefs that have inspired respect and admiration for the United States the world over, and principles that President-elect Obama invoked in his campaign? <br /><br />The war that was launched from the nightmare of September 11 has produced the nightmare of Guantanamo, the horror of Abu Ghraib, the broken lives of the U.S. soldiers killed or wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan, the deaths of tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of Afghan and Iraqi civilians, and the shattered psyches of America's torture and rendition victims. The United States is better than this -- surely it can temper its great power with reason, to paraphrase Justice Jackson's famous phrase uttered at Nuremberg so many years ago. On January 20, 2009, it is to be hoped that the 44th President of the United States of America will immediately begin doing so.<br /><br /><br /><em>Leila Nadya Sadat is the Henry H.

Torn from families, forced to kill their parents, hopped up on drugs, they tore into their fellow citizens without mercy in a senseless orgy of pain and suffering. These children were dragged off into the bush to fight wars for drug lords, terrorists, gun runners, diamond dealers, and cynical politicians, and in some instances corporations. <br /><br />I recall one witness telling me that they were terrified of the child soldiers that made up most of the various combatant groups fighting in Sierra Leone, because they could not plead for mercy prior to death as the children didn't know what that meant, they could not tell the difference between right or wrong, good from evil. For ten years these small boy units made Sierra Leone a living hell.<br /><br />Since the late 1980s, there have been millions of children recruited into combat around the world. A United Nations report in the mid-1990s found that over 2 million have died since 1988 alone. The report shamed the world and slowly the international community began to respond.<br /><br />In 2003, I indicted those who bore the greatest responsibility for those crimes in Sierra Leone, to include, for the first time in history, the unlawful recruitment of children into an armed force under the age of 15. It was upheld as a new international crime by our appellate chamber at the Special Court for Sierra Leone and most of the 13 indictees were convicted of that unlawful recruitment. The Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, has also charged warlords in Africa for similar crimes.<br /><br />On October 3, 2008, under the leadership of Senator Richard Durban of Illinois, the Child Soldiers Accountability Act was signed by President Bush into law. Designed to identify potential perpetrators and to prosecute them under US domestic law and/or to prevent entry or deport them from the US, this important law is another example of nations leading the way in stamping out this scourge. It certainly gives notice to dozens of countries that may be in violation of this act. Senator Durban stated: &quot;The power to prosecute and punish those who violate the law will send a clear signal that the U.S. will in no way tolerate this abhorrent practice.&quot;<br /><br />Currently the implementation of the law is being worked by the Departments of Justice, State, and Homeland Security and will make the passage of the Child Soldier Accountability Act a reality. Those officials need to continue to move forward to establish the rules and regulations necessary to ensure that those who have destroyed children&#39;s lives are dealt with under this new law. <br /><br />Leadership by the United States in this area is vital. We have the law now to lead the rest of the world in ensuring something is done. Hopefully, action by other states in revising their domestic laws similar to the Child Soldier Accountability Act will be a way for progress to be made. Continued international recognition of this international crime and its elimination must continue with all dispatch.<br /><br />In the 21st Century how can mankind look itself in the mirror with any sense of hope for a brighter future when most of the fighters in various international and internal armed conflicts are kids, many under the age of 15? Those lost generations will come back to haunt us from the graves of the victims of death by child.<br /><br /><br /><br /><em>David M.

On November 5, Robert Verkaik of UK newspaper <em>The Independent</em> discussed the public outrage that greeted the government announcement of "plans to create a database holding information about every phone call, email and internet visit made in the UK". And yet, the European Commission, aided most recently by the Advocate General of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), has set its sights on not only assisting such excesses, but mandating them. <br /><br />For readers unfamiliar with the structure of the European Community, the European Union and the relationship between the two, this may be hard going. I ask you to bear with me because involved in this ostensible struggle for increased legislative competence is a concerted effort to limit fundamental individual rights in the name of 'state security' in an ever-widening sense. <br /><br />On October 14, 2008 ECJ Advocate General Bot upheld the competence of the EC Council (the body that votes on legislation in the European Community) to enact Directive 2006/24EC (On the retention of data generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications network and amending Directive 2002/8) based solely on the single market competence afforded by the EC Treaty. &acirc;&#8364;&uml; AG Bot rejected a claim by Ireland that such legislation should have been enacted under EU's 'third pillar', i.e. Judicial and Police Cooperation, and found instead that single market competence under Article 95 of the European Community Treaty (TEC) was sufficient. <br /><br />Article 95 TEC gives the EC the power to "adopt the measures for the approximation of the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States which have as their object the establishment and functioning of the internal market." <br /><br />The purpose of Directive 2006/24 is set out in its Article 1(1):<blockquote>This Directive aims to harmonise Member States' provisions concerning the obligations of the providers of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks with respect to the retention of certain data which are generated or processed by them, in order to ensure that the data are available for the purpose of the investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime, as defined by each Member State in its national law.</blockquote>Article 5 of the Directive sets out the data to be retained. The categories are as follows (the details are set out under each category):<ol type="a"><li>data necessary to trace and identify the source of communication;<br /><li>data necessary to identify the destination of the communication<br /><li>data necessary to identify date, time and duration of the communication;<br /><li>data necessary to identify the type of communication;<br /><li>data necessary to identify users communication equipment or what purports to be their equipment; and<br /><li>data necessary to identify location of mobile communication equipment. <br /></ol>Article 8 provides that "Member States shall ensure that the data specified in Article 5 are retained in accordance with this Directive in such a way that the data retained and other necessary information relating to such data can be transmitted upon request to the competent authorities without undue delay."<br /><br />To the untrained eye, it would be hard to imagine a more straightforward attempt to legislate for the purpose of collecting and retaining data for the purpose of police cooperation among member states, an activity that falls squarely within third pillar competence. <br /><br />The difference in legal competence underpinning European legislation, i.e. whether the EC does it or the EU does it, is important. At the risk of oversimplification, the difference between EU (third pillar) and EC (first pillar) competence stems from the creation of the European Union as a 'parallel institution' by the member states of the European Community in the 1992 Maastricht Treaty. Through the EU, EC member states could agree to measures and common positions in areas for which they desired to retain more national sovereignty than they could through the EC. The 'third pillar' of the EU (Judicial and Police Cooperation, or 'Justice and Home Affairs' between 1992 and 1999) sets out those areas where member states, acknowledging the need for common action, were nevertheless reluctant to give over full sovereignty, as they had in 1957. For example, the member states agreed to surrender considerable sovereignty to the EC for the establishment of free movement of goods, services, capital and labor, but not for judicial and police cooperation, for which they created the 'third pillar'. (For those curious but uninformed readers, the missing second pillar is Common Foreign and Security Policy). <br /><br />An act under the third pillar cannot affect the 'acquis communautaire' i.e. that body of Community law binding all member states, which includes treaties, secondary legislation and ECJ case law. Third pillar actions cannot amend EC directives and retains 'intergovernmental' status, roughly comparable to a standard agreement under international law between totally sovereign states. It not subject to important structural principles of Community law such as supremacy (of EC law) and direct effect (on individuals). It is also significant that EU legislation (i.e. acts under the third pillar) requires unanimity making it more difficult to conclude, while TEC Article 95-based legislation may be passed by a qualified majority of votes in Council. <br /><br />The reasoning behind the AG's opinion favoring EC single-market legislative competence is puzzling. The opinion twists and turns through exemptions and retained national competences of earlier EC directives on the subject of data protection that Directive 2006/24 is designed to amend, and then, after acknowledging the stated crime-fighting purpose of the legislation, the AG supports his decision to view Directive 2006/24 as single market legislation as follows (paragraph 85):<blockquote>In the absence of harmonisation, a provider of electronic communications services would be faced with costs related to the retention of data which differ according to the Member State in which he wishes to provide those services. Such differences may constitute obstacles to the free movement of electronic communications services between the Member States and may therefore create obstacles to the establishment and functioning of the internal market in electronic communications. They may, in particular, slow down the cross-border development of new electronic communications services which are regularly introduced in the information society. They may also give rise to distortions in competition between undertakings operating on the electronic communications market.</blockquote>Totally absent from the opinion is any mention of the importance with which the protection of personal data has been viewed by member states over the pa
st three decades and within the legal structure of the European Community since 1995. This positivist approach to what constitutes a pivotal area of fundamental rights is in sharp contrast to the privileged position Europe has given to a growing body of human rights law over the past half century. <br /><br /><strong>The Background of Personal Data Protection</strong><br /><br />Personal data protection in Europe is an important offshoot of the fundamental right of privacy as set out in the Council of Europe European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) (Art. 8), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Art. 17) and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (CFR) (Art. 8). It has deep roots in post-WWII constitutions and legislation of EU member states, particularly Germany and France - two countries that have contributed heavily to the structure and substance of EC/EU law. As a human right, it is important to remember that privacy, along with other human rights, is a right that protects individuals from the State. The concept of 'privacy', as an instinct that drives us to walk off into a corner to talk on our cell phones or close the curtains when we are having sex has diluted the idea of privacy as a human right and made most of us associate it with our neighbors rather than the state. To understand the threat of having personal data lose the protection of the law requires that privacy be repositioned as a fundamental human right against actions by the state. <br /><br />Concern for personal data protection was initially the result of a long-standing belief in Germany, where such protection began, that the facility with which pre-war abuses of human rights and personal dignity were carried out, was at least partly attributable to the excessive accumulation of personal data by the Nazi regime (made possible a purpose-built census designed for the regime by IBM in 1933). In the 1990s, the rapid growth of the internet, with its potential for instantaneous and universal dissemination of data, advanced telecommunications, and the new genetic and biometric technologies accentuated the need to protect the fundamental right of privacy in general, and the right to the protection of personal data in particular. <br /><br />In 1995, the European Community undertook to protect personal data by enacting Directive 95/46. This Directive harmonizes the protection and free movement of personal data between member states in the context of the single market. It sets common standards of data protection so as to prevent national law from prohibiting the free movement of data among member states. It includes the proviso that personal data should not be sent to any non-member state unless it is established that the recipient state provides a similar level of legal protection to personal data. <br /><br />Two years later, Directive 95/46 was joined by Directive 97/77 (on data protection in the telecommunications sector) and by Regulation 2001/45 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies (as distinct from the member states) and on the free movement of such data was enacted. This Regulation established a monitoring body, the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), and sanctions for offenders. Like the two directives, it applies not only to data movement within the EU but to personal data sent to non-member states. Article 9 requires that 'personal data shall only be transferred to recipients, other than Community institutions and bodies, which are not subject to national law adopted pursuant to Directive 95/46, if an adequate level of protection is ensured in the country of the recipient...".<br /><br />Article 3(2) of Directive 95/46 states that "This Directive shall not apply to the processing of personal data in the course of an activity which falls outside the scope of Community law, such as those provided for by Titles V and VI of the Treaty on European Union and in any case to processing operations concerning public security, defense, State security (including economic well-being of the State when the processing operation relates to State security matters) and the activities of the State in areas of criminal law." <br /><br />What we see in this article is a line being drawn between EC competence, i.e. that which the EC can rely on to enact legislation in connection with harmonization for purposes of constructing a single market, and EU competence, in areas of public security, defense, etc., and member state criminal law competence. Titles V and VI of the TEU are the second and third pillars, respectively. The inclusion of economic well-being of the state is interesting but deserves further attention than the scope of this essay offers. <br /><br />Under these two Directives, the collection of and access to personal data is limited in use and duration to legitimate purposes for reasonable periods of time. Holders of such data are prohibited from sending it outside the EU to any country which does not have similar data protection laws. Following the enactment and implementation of the Directives in the member states, strict limitations were therefore placed on data collection and retention as well as on transfer of personal data to non-member states. <br /><br /><strong>Globalization, 9/11 and the Decline of Personal Data Protection</strong><br /><br />Europe does not live in a vacuum, however, and events subsequent to 1995 were soon to test the strength of personal data protection in the EC. The unfolding in the 1990s of 'globalization' with its expanding communications technology and its facilitation of transnational crime and then the events of September 11, 2001, introduced serious threats to many individual rights once believed to be central to the self-image of western countries, among them the protection of privacy. The US 'war on terror' and overriding claims of 'national security', especially in their international manifestations, combined with heightened interest in preventing and prosecuting criminal activity ranging from drug and human trafficking to economic crimes such as intellectual property offences. This exacerbated the fundamental tension between state (and economic) interests and individual privacy in Europe as well as in the US (as seen in the wiretapping escapades of the National Security Agency). <br /><br />In November 2001 the US enacted legislation requiring all air carriers to provide the US customs authorities with access to extensive electronic data on all passengers entering or leaving the US (passenger name records, or PNR). Such data once obtained could effectively be retained and circulated for the lifetime of the data subjects. Initially, the EC Commission advised the US that transferring such data would conflict with EC and member state data protection laws, particularly since the US has no data protection laws, let alone laws on the level mandated by Directives 95/46 and 97/77. US pressure on Brussels, combined with the threat to fine all airlines $6000 per passenger entering the US without the requested data, led the EC Commission to issue a Decision to the effect that they were satisfied that the data protection required by Directive 95/46 existed in the US. This was designed to open the way to an agreement whereby data on all passengers entering the US would be provided by the airlines. No provision for extracting data on US passengers entering Europe was requested, and none was given. <br /><br />Again, it is important to note that the US effectively has no data protection legislation (the first US state to enact such legislation was California, in 2003). Nor does it claim to have such protection. Quite the opposite: data is seen as a valuable commodity which is readily transferred, bought and sold in the 'free market'. Individuals' rights regarding the data held on them is effectively limited to finding out what data is held, and potentially correcting it where it is found to be in error. This right is limited to US citizens. The US made no claims that the data would not be distributed among relevant agencies, and stored by
 private companies under the all-pervasive 'privatization' policies of the current US government. Opposition to this arrangement was widespread among data protection activists in Europe, however, and no formal agreement was signed at that time.<br /><br />By early March 2004, however, noting "The fight against terrorism, which justifies the proposed measures" to be "a key priority in the European Union" and seeking to alleviate the "uncertainty of air carriers and passengers and their financial interests" in the absence of a concrete agreement, the Commission issued a Decision to enter into an agreement under which airlines would be authorized to provide the personal data requested by the United States. The European Parliament almost immediately requested a new Decision that would guarantee passengers the fundamental right of protection of their personal data. Failing to obtain such a Decision, the Parliament along with the EDPS brought an action before the European Court of Justice (ECJ) against the Council (the EC institution that votes on all legislation) to annul the Decision on the basis that the EC had no competence to enter such an agreement, that it breached the fundamental principles of the Directive on data protection, and that it violated fundamental rights of individuals as well as the EC principle of proportionality (a basic principle of EC law which restricts acts of the Community to what is necessary and proportional to the legitimate goal to be achieved in a democratic society). <br /><br />To make a long story short, the ECJ set aside the decision on adequacy of US data protection on the basis that the goal of collecting the data, i.e. security and criminal law, fell outside the data protection Directive's purview, as stated in the Directive itself and set out above. Thus, said the Court, the need to evaluate whether the comparable protection required in the directive exists in the US never arises. The Court also found that the EC Treaty did not in fact provide an adequate legal basis for the Commission to enter into an agreement with the US to transmit personal data. The ECJ therefore found no need to decide whether or not fundamental rights would be violated by the Agreement. The so-called Agreement was a dead letter. <br /><br />The EU remained under pressure from the US, however, and proceeded to assure the US that it would comply with its requests. In its capacity as the "EU" (or, lack of capacity, since the EU, unlike the EC, has no legal personality to enter into an agreement, though this didn't seem to bother anyone) it entered into an agreement to provide the data, such agreement to be given legislative effect by an EU Framework Decision assuring the compliance of all EU member states. The Agreement was signed on 23 July 2007. A week later, (according to EU doc. No. 12307/07, linked to Statewatch website) the US Dept. of Homeland Security requested that all negotiation documents related to the PNR Agreement be kept secret for ten years.<br /><br />As the deadline for European compliance with US demands approached in 2007, and perhaps worrying the European population might be bothered by giving up so much (data and protection) and receiving so little (for throughout the negotiations it apparently never occurred to the EC or the EU to ask for reciprocal surrender of personal data of incoming passengers), the EU itself decided to institute its own PNR for passengers entering the EU. It began discussing plans to move beyond air traffic and impose such requirements not only on virtually all forms of travel into the EU, but even within the EU itself.<br /><br />Although plans to extend the requirements to non-air travel have been put on hold, on November 11, 2007 the EU issued a proposal for a Council Framework Decision on the Use of Passenger Name Record for Law Enforcement Purposes (COM 2007 (0654) final). Preempting claims that this violated fundamental rights, the opening sentence of the proposal states that 'Terrorism constitutes one of the greatest threats to&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; fundamental rights". Noting that Directive 2004/82 already requires airlines to communicate Advance Passenger Information (API) to member states' authorities, it bemoans the fact that this is "sufficient only for identifying known terrorists and criminals". What it claims to need is a tool to carry out risk assessments of the persons, for obtaining intelligence and for making associations between known and unknown people." (Rumsfeld lives.) The proposal provides for retention of the data for 15 years and the only restrictions placed on transfer to third countries is that "(a) the authorities of the third country shall only use the data for the purpose of preventing and fighting terrorist offences and organized crime and (b) such third countries shall not transfer the data to another third country without express consent of the Member State (Proposed Article 8). Thus every member state would collect data on all passengers, and such data could be shared with third countries subject only to these restrictions. This is a far cry from the recognition, a mere 15 years ago, that entities, including states, collecting too much data have tended to abuse the data at the expense of individuals and fundamental rights. It is a far cry from Directive 95/46, which allocates competence to collect data for the purpose of state security, etc. to the full sovereignty of the member states. <br /><br /><strong>The 2006 Directive</strong><br /><br />Meanwhile, back in the EC legislative theatre and pursuant to abovementioned rise in concerns about 'state security' and the 'war on terror', the EC passed Directive 2002/58 limiting the scope of the protection of personal data afforded in the original 1995 Directive. Article 15 of this 2002 Directive limited the right to data protection by enabling member states to restrict such rights "when such restriction constitutes a necessary, appropriate and proportionate measure within a democratic society to safeguard national security (i.e. State security), defense, public security, and the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences or of unauthorised use of the electronic communication system". In essence, it allowed states to "adopt legislative measures providing for the retention of data for a limited period justified on the grounds laid down in this paragraph". Notable here is the expansion of state powers from doing what is necessary to pursue terrorists to other unrelated acts including mere 'criminal offences' and unauthorized use of electronic communication systems.<br /><br />There was little reaction to this 2002 Directive, however, and in 2006, Directive 2006/24 (the subject of the recent legislative competence decision by the AG) was enacted to amend the 2002 Directive by mandating data retention. Initially put forward by four countries to be adopted under EU third pillar competence (i.e. judicial and police cooperation, which as mentioned above requires unanimity and is not subject to the principles of EC law), it was seized upon by the Commission and passed as a Directive under the same competence as the earlier and now defunct agreement between the EC and the US, i.e. Article 95 for matters pertaining to single market. <br /><br />It is this competence that was questioned by Ireland, and it is this competence that was accepted by the Advocate General in last week's decision. <br /><br /><strong>Limiting Privacy in the State, the Community, and the Union</strong><br /><br />Anyone who follows the issues of privacy in Europe cannot help but notice that the decline in protection afforded the individual from the prying eyes of the state has been precipitous in recent years. Only Germany for example, among the 27 member states of the EU, found the introduction of 'body scanners ' i.e. full exposure to border officials of passengers' naked bodies, to be an affront to human dignity (a concept itself enshrined in the German constitution). For the others, as for the US where the practice began, 'national security' seemed to justify the gross invasion of privacy of this 'strip sear
ch' technology. In its defense, it should be noted that European Parliament (the least powerful of all EC institutions) voted in October 2008 in favor of a Resolution alerting the EC to the potential for violation of both fundamental rights and the principle of proportionality (a general principle of Community law, similar to 'ultra vires' in the Common law, which restricts the powers of the EC to what is necessary and proportional in a democratic state to achieve its legitimate aims) entailed in such technology. <br /><br />This decline the right to privacy is particularly marked in the UK where a database containing information on all individuals within the UK (this is separate from the communications database discussed in the opening paragraph of this essay), ranging from DNA and biometrics to data contained in various government databases, was recently proposed. The EU is itself about to embark on similar, if less invasive, projects. These include the Internal Market Information System, or IMI through proposed EC Directive 2008/49 (where the Commission relies on a previous decision of its own as a basis for legislative competence, much to the concern of European Data Protection Supervisor), and the EU Framework Decision on European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS).<br /><br />Government access to individuals' private records and documents has taken a great leap forward on both sides of the Atlantic. While personal data has never been subject to protection in the US, the recent US judicial recognition of the legality of the practice of allowing US border officials to take and copy hard disks of air passengers received little or no official comment in Europe. European companies fearing exposure of trade secrets, employee or contact information or other confidential data simply advise employees traveling to the US to go with empty computers and download documents necessary for their business upon arrival. Even this may not protect personal data and information contained on private hard disks, however, if last week's opinion by the Advocate General is upheld by the European Court of Justice and national measures like the UK 'blackbox' data base plans become law. <br /><br /><strong>No Wonder Ireland Voted No</strong><br /><br />Last week's opinion by Advocate General Bot to the effect that EC Directive 2006/24, forcing member states to require Internet Service Providers to collect and save personal data of their customers, was properly passed by the EC under its treaty competence for building a single market will, if followed by the ECJ, provide just one more indication of a reversal of individual privacy rights built up over the past fifty years. <br /><br />The fact that measures to limit data protection rights are now being taken at the European level, and thus subject to neither national constitutional nor electoral challenges, is doubly worrying. Such measures are unchallengeable once treaty competence to enact them is established. Ironically, the Charter on Fundamental rights with its Article 8 protection of personal data is inoperative until the Lisbon Treaty comes into effect. Rejecting Ireland's challenge to what seems on the face of it to be an obviously flawed legislative competence might not be the best way to gain support (from Ireland or any other member state given the opportunity to voice its opinion) for a Treaty that would place even more unbridled power in Brussels. <br /><br />This recent Directive mandating data retention by internet service providers, combined with the extensive personal data on Europeans to be transferred to the US under the PNR and thereby set free to roam along the free market highways of North America do not paint a happy picture of personal data protection under European law. <br /><br />It would seem clear, from a perspective of fundamental rights, particularly in light of the fact that such limitations on access to personal data arose directly out of one of the most horrific periods of state excesses in the history of Europe, that at a bare minimum legislation to reduce protection should only be undertaken unanimously (which is required at the EU level, unlike single market competence that AG has found sufficient, which requires only a qualified majority). While the question posed in this ECJ case was a narrow one, i.e. can legislation aimed at preventing crime by mandating the retention of personal data by private actors, be based on the competence to enact single market directives, the underlying question of whether Europe still supports fundamental rights to data protection and privacy is paramount.<br /><br />In an era where EU member states, most notably but not exclusively, the UK, are taking measures that invade the privacy of individuals to a degree inconceivable even two decades ago (including a national closed-circuit TV system estimated to photograph each UK inhabitant at least 300 times a day, with the suggestion that microphones be added in the near future, and the abovementioned proposed national database under which data is acquired without suspicion of wrong-doing or even the knowledge of the subject), individuals across Europe would be justified in expecting that their unelected officials in Brussels would at least make a show of protecting their rights, if only by refraining from duplicating these measures. Even if the European Court of Justice wisely rejects the AG's interpretation of EC competence to mandate data retention, and hold that only the EU has such power under the third pillar, subject to unanimity and on condition of the enactment of protection currently lacking in the EU legal structure, it would still be questionable state action from the perspective of fundamental rights developed over the past half century. <br /><br />It is encouraging that the European Data Protection Supervisor has recently issued an opinion putting forth yet again his worries and suggesting the installation within the EU legal system a set of guarantees to compensate for the lack of a comprehensive legal framework on data protection in the field of cooperation between police and judicial authorities. But the forces, internal as well as external, in favor of reducing personal data protection are formidable. <br /><br />"National security" and the "War on Terror" have taken the entire western legal order into dangerous territory in terms of reversing advances human rights law has made since its inception after WWII. Even in the United Kingdom, which all agree has the most pervasive system of privacy-invading technology on the planet, no reduction in criminal activity has been noted since these measures were instituted. Initially designed to weed out 'terrorists', this movement now feels justified to undertake full-scale surveillance over all individuals. And it is not just the chilling effect of ubiquitous state surveillance that is at issue in these developments. Corporate economic interests, including but not limited to intellectual property holders, have 'caught the coattails' of (and quite possibly been one of the forces behind, but that is for another essay) this onslaught on privacy. Once the state has full access to our personal data, communicated or stored in our hard disks or held by internet service providers, no one is safe and given what we have seen over the past few weeks in terms of states' ability or will to guard the basic interests of their citizenry, there is no reason to believe that good faith will prevail. <br /><br /><br /><em>Virginia Keyder teaches European Union law at Bogazici University and Sabanci University in Istanbul, Turkey.</em><br />

The inevitable jockeying for advantage, as the Democrats await their enhanced Senate and House majorities in the 111th Congress and Executive Branch control, suggests that little apart from economic measures will receive effective treatment before January. However, if Democrats cooperate with Republicans in a few areas which are critical to the federal courts, they could secure immediate and long-term benefits for the political parties, the judiciary and the country.<br /><br />Judicial selection is an obvious field where Democrats may cooperate with Republicans and make progress. There are presently 42 federal court openings for which President George W. Bush has nominated 26 candidates. The Democratic Senate majority should decide which nominees are acceptable because they are very smart, independent and diligent, have moderate ideological perspectives and possess balanced judicial temperament, while Democrats should help confirm the nominees. The majority can do so with prompt floor votes on nominees the Judiciary Committee favorably considers, expeditious approval of those awaiting panel votes and swift hearings for the remaining nominees. An instructive example is Gregory Goldberg whom Bush nominated to the U.S. District Court in Colorado, which has two of seven seats open and two new judges approved in September.<br /><br />Another important concept would be passage of a thorough judgeships bill, the first comprehensive legislation since 1990. The Judicial Conference has recommended that Congress authorize more than 60 new appellate and district court positions, suggestions that the courts' policymaking body premises on conservative estimates of work and case loads. Confirming nominees and approving and filling new judgeships would enable the judiciary to resolve lawsuits more promptly, inexpensively and fairly.<br /><br />A related notion would be passing a measure that increases federal judges' compensation. Protracted legislative inaction on judicial salaries has eroded many judges' standard of living, prompted some jurists to retire early or quit and discouraged strong candidates from even considering judicial service. Adoption of the judicial pay legislation could prevent experienced judges from leaving the bench and would encourage a broader pool of excellent candidates to contemplate judicial service. <br /><br />The American electorate clearly expressed support for change on November 4. Democrats must respond to this call for reform. One valuable starting point would be the federal judiciary in the lame duck session which opens today. If Democrats work closely with Republicans on federal courts issues, the parties can begin restoring public confidence in Congress and earn the trust which the public bestowed on election day. <br /><br /><em>Carl Tobias is the Williams Professor of Law at the University of Richmond</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.wmitchell.edu/academics/faculty/erlinder.asp">Peter Erlinder</a> of William Mitchell College of Law, says that the recent conviction of "Chuckie&quot; Taylor suggests that President-elect Obama has a chance to demonstrate, by example, what the Rule of Law and "equality before the law," means to the new administration&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;and to him... <br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/petererlinder.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>D</strong></font>uring the run-up to the 2008 Presidential election, legal developments not directly related to the historic McCain-Palin/Obama-Biden contest got little attention. Now that the election is over, several recent but little-reported criminal prosecutions, with potentially great significance for members of the outgoing and incoming administrations, deserve a second look, even though impeachment is a practical impossibility before Obama's inauguration on January 20, 2009.<br /><br />The recent "torture" conviction the son of Liberia's notorious former President Charles Taylor in Miami federal court has the potential to advance the Rule of Law, and to strengthen the concept that even vast power does not create impunity for the commission of great crimes, even by governmental figures claiming sovereign perogative.   And the arrest warrants sought by International Criminal Court Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo for President Bashir of Sudan demonstrate that even the presidents of countries that have not ratified the ICC-Treaty of Rome can be called to account in international tribunals.<br /><br /><strong>Presidential Legal Liability In Office, and Out</strong><br /><br />One important measure of any legal system, grounded in equality and due process before the law, is "equivalency before the law" for the privileged and powerful&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;.as well as those less-favored by vagaries of birth and status. The recent conviction of Alaska Senator Stevens is only the most recent example of this principle in practice.  <br /><br />And, the various Clinton-era legal battles established that even a sitting president is not immune from civil liability arising before the presidential term  and though even "high crimes and misdemeanors" may not be domestically-prosecuted during a presidential term, there is no established  doctrine of immunity from domestic criminal liability following the end of a presidential term, or from international legal standards, either during or after a presidency.<br /><br />The anticipatory pardon of Richard Nixon by the recently-elevated President Ford would not have been necessary if ex-presidents are not culpable under domestic criminal law for crimes committed during their presidency. It is not clear that even a blanket presidential pardon, ala "Scooter" Libby, can insulate executive branch members from potential international criminal culpability.  Also, there is no obvious precedent for presidential power to grant an anticipatory pardon president's own crimes.<br /><br /><strong>Overseas Violation of the Convention Against Torture as a Domestic Crime</strong><br /><br />Earlier this month, "Chuckie Taylor", the son of former Liberian President Charles Taylor, now facing trial at The Hague, became the first US citizen in history to be convicted under 18 USC &Acirc;&#167;2340-2340A, a 1994 federal statute that criminalizes violations of the Convention Against Torture by any US citizen, <em>anywhere</em> in the world.[1] The Bush Justice Department was successful in arguing the constitutionality of &Acirc;&#167;2340A and its applicability to a US citizen for crimes committed in Liberia between 1999 and 2003. <br /><br />Ironically, this overlaps with the period during which the Bush executive branch itself was engaging in what the CIA's George Tenet euphemistically called "enhanced interrogation techniques" in secret CIA overseas prisons and in places like Abu Ghraib and Guantamo. The CIA apparently adopted "waterboarding" and other "torture" tactics when their first high-level captive refused to cooperate in late 2001 or early 2002 [2], and the "torture stain" began to spread to other executive-branch services. <br /><br /><strong>&quot;Top Cover&quot;</strong><br /><br />Tenet did not get written approval for "enhanced interrogations" from the White House until after the Abu Ghraib scandal erupted in June 2004. By then, CIA officials, apparently including the Office of General Counsel, demanded explicit proof of White House support for the CIA torture program. <br /><br />But, according to Condoleezza Rice's written Senate testimony last month, long before 2004 other executive branch agencies were so "uncomfortable" with CIA interrogation methods that she specifically asked then-Attorney General Ashcroft to "&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;advise the NSC principles whether the CIA program was lawful&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;.under U.S. laws or international treaties."[3] Apparently the result was the famous 2002 "torture memo" prepared for the Justice Department Office of Legal Affairs (OLA) by John Yoo, John Delahunty and other deputies.[4] <br /><br />According to a <em>Washington Post</em> article, despite these misgivings in other executive-branch agencies "....[f]ormer and current CIA officials say no...reservations [regarding the legality of the CIA "torture" program] were voiced in their presence...".[5] The major concern within the CIA was that the agency had political "top cover" in the event the torture program was ever discovered.<br /><br />"I]n the agency's view.... '[w]e don't want to continue unless you tell us in writing that it is not only legal, but is the policy of the administration'&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;[t]he CIA understood that [the interrogation program] was controversial and would be widely criticized if it became public."[6] According to the <em>Post</em>, no one in the CIA General Counsel's Office expressed objections to the legality of the secret "enhanced interrogation" program.[7] <br /><br /><strong>OLA's Goldsmith: Crimes of the "Terror Presidency"</strong><br /><br />By 2004, after the exposure of torture at CIA "black sites" and "extraordinary renditions," the CIA euphemism for kidnapping and outsourcing torture to foreign experts, as well as abuses at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo, a new lawyer was brought in to head the OLA. Former University of Chicago law professor Jack Goldsmith was shocked to find the shoddy legal analysis that Yoo and his staff had used to justify violations of long-standing statutory, constitutional and treaty prohibitions against the use of torture by the United States government. As described in Goldsmith's insider account, <em>The Terror Presidency</em>,[8] Bush's Presidential Chief Counsel Addington, Yoo and his OLA deputies were responsible for the pre-2004 assurances that the CIA program was "lawful," which were not challenged by the CIA General Counsel's Office. <br /><br />According to Goldsmith, the legal reasoning was so transparently inadequate that a complete re-writing of the OLA Opinion defining the "torture options" available to executive branch was undertaken. In was not until 2004 that Goldsmith was able to force through the new standards that were much, much closer to the requirements of the Convention Against Torture and the terms of 18 USC &Acirc;&#167;2430A, by threatening to resign if the Bush Justice Department did not replace the John Yoo 2002 OLA opinion [9], an extraordinary event according to OLA protocols.[10] <br /><br />The Goldsmith book and recent disclosures reported in the <em>Washington Post</em> [11] have revealed that even high-ranking CIA lawyers were less interested in stopping the torture than in getting political "top cover" (approval from the White House).[12] In context, "top cover" carries the stench of the "plausible deniability" that may have saved Ronald Reagan from criminal liability for
the Iran-Contra Affair,[13] and is part of the CIA stock-in-trade, described by Tim Weiner in <em>A Legacy of Ashes</em>, his recently published history of the CIA.[14] <br /><br /><strong>Applying the "Rule of Law" to All Heads of State</strong><br /><br />Much of the "human rights" world cheered when the International Criminal Court indicted Sudan's sitting President Bashir for crimes allegedly committed in Darfur.[15] This was only the third indictment of a sitting president by an international tribunal [16], and the only the fourth in history. Like Slobodan Milosevic, Charles Taylor, the ICC indictment of President Bashir asserted the commission of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.[17] INTERPOL warrants have also been issued for a fourth sitting-president. President Paul Kagame of Rwanda has also been indicted for genocide, under international law, by the courts of Spain. French courts have also indicted many of his followers. INTERPOL warrants issued for Kagame and his followers in February 2008[18] and the first member of Kagame's government was arrested in Germany on November 10, 2008.[19] <br /><br />Bashir was indicted by the ICC, even though Sudan, like the U.S., is not a party to the Treaty of Rome which established the Court and granted jurisdiction over heads of state of ratifying nations.[20] Most U.S. allies have ratified the treaty, but shortly after taking office George Bush renounced Bill Clinton's signature and never submitted the treaty for ratification.[21] But the Bashir case shows it is possible for the ICC to indict and potentially seek the arrest the heads of both parties to the treaty, and non-party states, too.<br /><br />The ICC accepted the argument of the ICC Prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, that the issue of the court's jurisdiction over President Bashir should be argued before the Court, once Bashir is in custody and has appeared before the Court.[22] <br /><br />In light of the Bashir precedent, the question is whether the leaders of powerful non-party nations will be treated the same as the heads of state of less-powerful non-party nations? If not, international criminal tribunals and theorists will have to face the anomaly that, presidents of non-party states that charged with crimes committed within their own territory can be held accountable to international justice, while presidents of non-party states that initiate wars of aggression and commit crimes on the territory of other states are treated with impunity.[23] <br /><br />The international "Rule of Law" will have been exposed as merely a thinly disguised "rule of the powerful" being carried out with great pomp on an international stage.<br /><br /><strong>Equality Before the Law and the "Rule of Law&quot; - or Power-Politics as Usual?</strong><br /><br />The Bush Justice Department's success in convicting the son of an alleged "criminal president" establishes clear precedent for prosecuting other citizens who are complicit in overseas acts of "torture". The question for the Obama Justice Department will be whether Mr. Bush, Mr. Cheney, Mr. Addison, Mr. Tenet, Mr. Yoo, Mr. Bybee, and others who have complicit in violations of the Convention Against Torture and 18 USC 2430A [24], will be held criminally liable by the Obama Justice Department the same way Bush's Justice Department has convicted the junior Mr. Taylor?<br /><br />In the international arena, the question for the ICC Prosecutor and the Court, itself, is whether all non-party heads-of-state are equal before the law or not. If not, the Court will be seen as being no more just than the "victor's justice" tribunals at Nuremberg and Tokyo.<br /><br />The question for the 21st Century is whether the Rule of Law actually does apply with the same force to the powerful, as well as those the powerful choose to target. In that regards, it is necessary to recall the debt of gratitude we owe to the majority opinion in <em>Bush v. Gore</em>, which taught both conservatives and liberals, once-and-for, all that "law" is not necessary immune from other considerations.[25] <br /><br />But if the Rule of Law does mean something different for ex-presidents and other citizens, or, for presidents of powerful and less-powerful nations, it might be preferable to put that reality clearly on the table for the people of the United States, and the world, to see. The conviction of "Chuckie&quot; Taylor suggests that President Obama has a chance to demonstrate, by example, what the Rule of Law and "equality before the law," means to the new administration - and to him.<br /><br /><br /><font SIZE=2 style='font-size: 8pt'>(c) 2008 Peter Erlinder. <br /><br />Notes<br /><br />1.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Mike Dubrasich</strong> [Executive Director, <a href="http://westinstenv.org/">Western Institute for Study of the Environment</a>]: &quot;With her most recent <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/federal-judge-limits-2006-ruling.php">decision</a>, Magistrate Laporte is playing a game of judicial chicken, perverting <a href="http://www.epa.gov/compliance/basics/nepa.html">NEPA</a>, and causing catastrophic harm to the environment. <br /><br />Background: the Clinton (Dombeck) Roadless Rule was rushed through (by proclamation) in the waning days of that administration. It was immediately litigated in more than a dozen courts. In 2003, Judge Brimmer, a United States District Court Judge for the District of Wyoming, found, in response to the Complaint filed by the State of Wyoming, that NEPA had been violated on several different levels, including the fact that Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) input from the states had been excluded, the process had been rushed, the United States Forest Service (USFS) had failed to take the requisite &quot;hard look&quot; at the proposed rule, and that the NEPA process was a sham in order to adopt a political rule. Judge Brimmer also found that the Roadless Rule violated the Wilderness Act in that it designated 58.5 million acres as defacto wilderness despite the fact that only Congress has the authority to do so. Judge Brimmer enjoined the Roadless Rule.  The USFS developed an alternative plan to ensure that states would be part of the process.  This plan, called the State Petitions procedure, ensured that not only state concerns would be addressed, but that tribes, local governments, and the general public would be able to express their concerns in order to develop site-specific rules for each National Forest.<br /><br />The usual enviromental groups sued in the Ninth District Court and, in 2006, Magistrate Laporte concluded that the State Petitions procedure violated NEPA because it was not accompanied by an EIS. In the strangest twist of legal logic, she then reinstated the illegal Roadless Rule, and ordered that the USFS comply with its terms.  She made that ruling despite Judge Brimmer&#39;s earlier decision, despite the fact that Judge Brimmer reached his conclusions after a comprehensive review of the Administrative Record, and despite the fact that she had no idea as to whether the Roadless Rule complied with NEPA or not.  Her decision was odd to say the least, which is confirmed by the fact that the State Petitions procedure was not an environmental action per se but a remedy to fix the original defective and illegal Roadless Rule EIS. Requiring an EIS to fix an EIS sets up an infinite loop of EIS&#39;s.<br /><br />Wyoming again filed suit in an attempt to fix the mess created by Magistrate Laporte&#39;s decision.  In August 2008, Judge Brimmer issued yet another permanent national injunction against the Roadless Rule.  Addressing the issue of &quot;cooperating agency status,&quot; Judge Brimmer wrote:  <blockquote>&quot;There is not one good reason in the administrative record before the Court explaining why cooperating agency status was denied to the ten most affected states, including Wyoming, especially in light of the CEQ&#39;s [Council on Environmental Quality] direction that federal agencies should actively seek participation of the states in order to comply with NEPA&#39;s statutory mandate. Absent any such explanation, the Court must again conclude that Wyoming was right in characterizing the Forest Service&#39;s process as a &quot;mad dash to complete the Roadless Initiative before President Clinton left office.&quot; The Forest Service dared not let any of the ten most affected states have cooperating agency status lest its &quot;mad dash&quot; would be slowed to a walk.&quot; </blockquote><br />In short, Judge Brimmer found that the USFS was more concerned about the political legacy of President Clinton than it was in complying with NEPA and the Wilderness Act.<br /><br />Judge Brimmer set forth his conclusion as follows:<blockquote>&quot;The Court, as it did in Roadless I, finds that: (1) the Forest Service&#39;s decision not to extend the scoping comment period was arbitrary and capricious; (2) the Forest Service&#39;s denial of cooperating agency status without explanation was arbitrary and capricious; (3) the Forest Service&#39;s failure to rigorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives was contrary to law; (4) the Forest Service&#39;s conclusion that its cumulative impacts analysis in the Roadless Rule Final EIS satisfied its NEPA duties was a clear error in judgment; and (5) the Forest Service&#39;s decision not to issue a supplemental EIS was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.&quot;</blockquote><br />Judge Brimmer is the only federal judges that has reviewed the Administrative Record related to the Roadless Rule.  Magistrate Laporte has never reviewed the Roadless Rule Administrative Record because it was never before her. Her analysis was supposed to be limited to whether the State Petition procedure passed legal muster.  While she may have had the authority to look at that issue, she surely never had the authority to evaluate the legality or enforceability of the Roadless Rule.<br /><br />Despite Judge Brimmer&#39;s findings set forth in a 102-page decision, Magistrate Laporte has concluded that she has the authority to again resurrect the illegal and defective Clinton-Dombeck Roadless Rule.  While she has attempted to avoid a direct conflict with Judge Brimmer by claiming that her decision only applies to the States in Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (California, Washington, Oregon, Montana, Idaho, Arizona, and Nevada), and New Mexico, the fact is that she has no authority to do what she has done. The Roadless Rule has been determined to be unlawful.  Because it was designed as a nation-wide rule, if it is illegal in one state, it is illegal in all states.  While Magistrate Judge Laporte obviously has a political and environmental axe to grind, she cannot use her office to do so.  The Roadless Rule cannot be brought back to life by Frankensteinesque manipulation of the rules of comity, or by ignoring the findings of the only judge in the United States who has actually looked at the tactics pulled by the USFS in their quest to find an environmental legacy for President Clinton.<br /><br />Magistrate Laporte&#39;s aggressive, in-your-face action is the opposite of comity. It also undermines the spirit of NEPA (public involvement in scientific analysis of potential impacts), making that law little but a partisan political weapon. Worst, it again condemns 58.5 million acres to catastrophic incineration. The USFS has instigated a Let It Burn policy in Roadless and Wilderness Areas. Since Clinton left office, 64.2 million acres (over 100,000 square miles) have burned in wildfires. Laporte&#39;s game of judicial chicken is thus trebly damaging, to the courts, to the law, and to the environment.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://norml.org/index.cfm?Group_ID=5972"><strong>Allen St. Pierre</strong></a> [Executive Director, <a href="http://norml.org/">NORML</a>]: &quot;The recent results on voter <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/switzerland-voters-approve-permanent.php">referendums in Switzerland</a> to allow for permanent heroin assisted treatments, but against decriminalizing cannabis possession are vexingly informative.<br /><br />The near 40% support at the polls for cannabis decriminalization shows a strong plurality, but demonstrates that current Swiss public educational campaigns for cannabis law reform were not as effectively communicated to the voters as one would have thought. And certainly not as well communicated as the politically-charged topic of heroin maintenance.<br /><br />Some Swiss commentators opine that cannabis is already a very low police priority and enjoys a de facto decriminalized status. This is affirmed by the high 40% minority vote that supported the decriminalization of marijuana despite the absence of a grassroots organization, like NORML, advocating for reform. Yet, Swiss voters chose to affirm the science and compassion of &quot;harm reduction&quot; as an effective means to deal with the serious health (and societal) concerns regarding heroin use.<br /><br />Furthermore, the Swiss voters&#39; rejection for cannabis law reform is in stark contrast to emerging social and legal trends worldwide favoring cannabis law reforms circa the 1990s. For example, 65% of Massachusetts voters <a href="http://blog.norml.org/2008/11/05/truth-prevails">recently voted</a> in favor of cannabis decriminalization.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://ramanstrategicanalysis.blogspot.com/"><strong>Bahukutumbi Raman</strong></a> [former head of the <a href="http://www.intelligencesummit.org/speakers/BahukutumbiRaman.php">Counter-Terrorism Division</a>, Research and Analysis Wing (India&#39;s external intelligence agency)]: &quot;From the night of November 26 to early morning on November 29, 160 Indians and 25 foreigners were killed in an unprecedented terrorist strike in Mumbai, which is viewed as India&#39;s economic capital. <br /><br />The terrorists, who came by sea, opened fire indiscriminately on passers-by and then occupied two leading hotels and a Jewish religious and cultural centre for nearly forty-eight hours. All except one were ultimately killed by the Indian security forces. One person - a Pakistani national reportedly belonging to the Pakistan-based terrorist organization <a href="http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/states/jandk/terrorist_outfits/lashkar_e_toiba.htm">Lashkar-e-Toiba</a> - was caught alive and is under interrogation by the Mumbai Police.<br /><br />The terrorist strike in Mumbai came in the wake of serial explosions in other Indian cities dating from November 2007. These cases have not yet been satisfactorily investigated. The Government of Dr. Manmohan Singh has come in for strong criticism for the failure of Indian intelligence, physical security and crisis management, along with the failure to <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/india-pm-pushes-tougher-anti-terrorism.php">strengthen the legal infrastructure against terrorism</a>.<br /><br />The Indian Police and investigation agencies were known in the past for their successful record in the investigation and prosecution of terrorism cases. This record has been sullied since the present Government came to power in 2004. It abrogated the <a href="http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/document/actandordinances/POTA.htm">Prevention of Terrorism Act</a> (POTA) enacted by its predecessor Government, which gave the police additional powers for dealing with terrorism. <br /><br />These powers related to longer periods of police custody for suspected terrorists, admissibility during trials of confessions made to the police, preventive detention of suspected terrorists, enhanced powers for the collection of technical intelligence, fast trial of terrorism cases etc.<br /><br />Muslims, who constitute about 16% of India&#39;s population, saw the POTA as directed against them and demanded its abrogation. The Congress (I) party, which heads the ruling coalition at Delhi, succumbed to their pressure and abrogated the POTA.<br /><br />As a result, the police have been forced to deal with terrorists with criminal laws enacted long before terrorism became a major national security threat. After the Mumbai strike, the demand for strengthening  and updating the legal powers of the police has acquired further momentum, but the Congress (I) and other political parties, which are dependent on Muslim votes, are reluctant to reverse the abrogation of the POTA.<br /><br />Another issue, which has come to the forefront, is the setting up of a federal investigation agency similar to the American FBI.  India has a federal investigation agency called the <a href="http://www.cbi.gov.in/default.php">Central Bureau of Investigation</a> (CBI) for important crimes of a federal nature, but its powers are limited. It can take up a case for investigation only at the request of or with the prior concurrence of the state in whose area the crime was committed. Often, the states are not prepared to agree to this, particularly if the state is ruled by a party different from the party in power in Delhi.<br /><br />To get over this difficulty, there has been a long-pending suggestion for setting up a federal investigation agency to investigate and prosecute only terrorism cases involving organizations, which are active in more than one state. There was only lukewarm support for this idea before the Mumbai incident but there is now greater political support for it. It is still to be seen whether the political will exists to set up a federal agency to investigate and prosecute terrorism-related cases having linkages in more than one state of the Indian federation.<br /><br />Presently, all cases are investigated by the police of the State in whose jurisdiction the terrorist act was committed. The investigations have been piecemeal with very little co-ordination and integration of evidence.<br /><br />Many commentators point out that the US has been able to prevent another 9/11 because of the action it took to give additional powers to its police, the FBI, and other departments fighting terrorism. There are repeated demands that India should emulate the US and other Western democracies and strengthen the legal infrastructure against terrorism.<br /><br />The US is a two-party state with a very small Muslim minority. Bipartisan consensus on legal measures is easier to achieve. India is a multi-party democracy with a plethora of political parties and coalitions, and has the second largest Muslim population in the world after Indonesia. In some of the north Indian states, some political parties are dependent on the Muslim vote for doing well in the elections. Political consensus is, therefore, very difficult to achieve.&quot;<br />

		<title>Canadian Prime Minister threatens national unity with prorogation gambit</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="URL of your webpage"><strong><a href="http://smartpei.typepad.com/about.html">Robert Paterson</a></strong></a> [President, <a href="http://www.paulhickey.ca/associates_6.html">Renewal Consulting Group</a>]: &quot;The <a href="http://www.mapleleafweb.com/features/parliamentary-government-canada-basic-organization-and-practices">Canadian parliamentary system</a> has an unwritten constitution based like the Common Law upon precedent and practice.  It is also a system of indirect democracy where the voters elect a &quot;Parliament,&quot; but do not vote for a Prime Minister.  To operate as a government, a Prime Minister has to have the effective &quot;confidence of the House.&quot;  Crudely put, he has to have the votes.  In majorities, this is easy as the use of the party system guarantees the votes.  If in a minority, the PM has to keep the confidence of the house by balancing the appeal to his base while keeping the opposition reasonably onside.<br /><br />Last week, Prime Minister Harper broke rule number one in a minority by setting forth a program that can only be seen as a provocation.  What made this worse was that Harper said going into the session that he said would be more conciliatory. He had called the last election because he claimed the house was not working. <br /><br />Harper thought he could get away with it because the leadership of the Liberals is up for debate and there are historic differences between the Liberals and the Bloq Quebecois. With a recent election, Harper knew the country was not up for another one and the idea that the three other parties could do a deal seemed remote to him.<br /><br />But his plan misfired when the Liberals and the New Democratic Party formally worked out a plan with the support of the Bloq. With an agreed-on 18-month plan, the opposition would have the votes and hence the confidence of the House. They had an &quot;Opposition Day&quot; scheduled for last Monday that would enable them to table a vote of non-confidence, but the Prime Minister exercised his perogative and extended it to the following Monday.<br /><br />Harper then asked Governor General Michaelle Jean, the Canadian representative for Queen of England, to <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/canada-pm-pledges-to-use-every-legal.php">prorogue Parliament</a> until late January when he will propose the budget.<br /><br />Practice and precedent suggest that the Governor General should have denied this request. Prorogation usually happens very late in the life of a Parliament. The meeting between the General Governor and the Prime Minister lasted nearly 3 hours, suggesting that Harper argued her into agreement. In practice the Governor General should act like a judge and give the Prime Minister her decision - one way or another. <br /><br />So now we will have six weeks of bitter public debate, and in a time of great crisis, Canada has no Parliament. A Government avoided losing a vote of non-confidence by a strategem and can continue for six weeks without any accountability. It can also harness the full power of the state to act on its behalf.<br /><br />The Prime Minister has set a precedent that allows a Government to avoid being held to account in Parliament. It is too early to know what this means in the long run, but it cannot be good. Canada must endure six weeks where all sides will campaign using fear of the &quot;other&quot; to get their way in the court of public opinion. Already the Bloq is being called &quot;traitors&quot; and &quot;treasonous.&quot; Those who disagree with Prime Minister Harper are being called un-Canadian. The rhetoric is already at a fever pitch.<br /><br />There are two very damaging possible outcomes to this process: First, the simmering regional divisions in Canada could burst into flame with the West versus the East and Rural versus Urban, resulting in the tense fabric of the nation being rendered. A second possibility is that Canada&#39;s 150 year use of the British Parliamentary system - itself a product of more than 1000 years of trial and error - is destroyed and replaced with a &quot;plebisciteocracy&quot; - the rule of public opinion. Regretfully, I do not see a counterweight to these gloomy predictions.<br /><br />Americans know the price of a national split in values, as do Spaniards, Bosnians, and the Irish. It is easy to forget that good people can be whipped into a fenzy given the right circumstances and once the line has been crossed, even the best countries can destroy themselves. What saddens me is how this crisis has been manufactured out of political opportunism and miscalculation - much like the response to Archduke Ferdinand&#39;s murder inadvertently set in motion the events that caused World War I. We live in dangerous times.&quot;<br />

		<title>Heroin prescription for addicts is not a viable long-term treatment option</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>David Raynes</strong> [former Assistant Chief Investigation Officer in UK Customs, member of the <a href="http://www.itfsdp.org/">International Task Force on Strategic Drug Policy</a>]: &quot;Observing from the US, what is happening in relation to drugs policy in Europe must seem truly confusing. Lurid headlines &quot;Swiss legalise Heroin&quot; or similar are half-truths. The reality is different. Prescribing heroin for the most chaotic addicts is nothing new, nor was it invented in Switzerland or the Netherlands, though both those countries do a little of it and the Swiss have just had a <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/switzerland-voters-approve-permanent.php">referendum on it</a>. The reality is that both systems are only slight adaptations of the &quot;British System.&quot; <br /><br />The UK has had some sort of programme of heroin prescription for some addicts for over fifty years; it was reduced in the 1960s because of significant heroin leakage into the parallel illegal market in two ways, either from addicts selling some of their prescribed supply or through corrupt or incompetent doctors over-supplying. It was concluded that heroin, if prescribed at all, needed to be taken under direct medical supervision. Of the doctors who have special licences to supply heroin to addicts in the UK, very few show any great enthusiasm for it or seem to believe in it for other than the short term. Only very few clinicians have ever shown any enthusiasm for long-term &quot;maintenance heroin&quot; for addicts. <br /><br />The UK&#39;s top academic expert has questioned if prescribing heroin is really &quot;treatment&quot; or if it is &quot;social problem prescribing.&quot; Certainly in the UK much of the recent enthusiasm comes from some police officers and even the odd politician, frustrated at the lack of success in dealing with crime associated with drug use. They ignore the reality that criminal careers typically precede drug addiction and, in the UK anyway, much crime now is associated with crack cocaine use. That is certainly not being prescribed. The move in Switzerland is only for a select band of addicts who are a tiny proportion of the whole addicted population. It was driven originally, by a wish to clean up &quot;needle parks,&quot; with obvious addict populations dealing and using in specific areas. These initiatives are also subject to <a href="http://www.eurad.net/research/Heroin%20Trials.htm">heavy criticism</a>.<br /><br />So lurid headlines have overstated exactly what the Swiss &quot;experiments&quot; have achieved or even what they represent. The realities are that heroin maintenance on a substantial scale is just not possible. The costs have been massively understated. The cost is not just the cost of the drug. Heroin because of its short acting nature, ties an addict to his or her clinic, in a way that longer lasting oral methadone does not. Heroin, through injection, preserves undesirable and risky injecting behaviour. Each small town needs its own clinic with at least two clinicians depending on addict population plus premises, security, nursing staff (minimum two on duty at any time for security, plus other security) and 365 days a year opening. Larger towns and cities would need more than one such clinic, London for example, would need many. Each clinic would need opening hours of early morning to late evening. On this basis the costs and resources mount alarmingly and the illegal market does not disappear.<br /><br />In addition, if such programs are provided on anything other than a huge scale they will not have much effect on crime. Many addicts would still commit crimes and many are poly-drug users - particularly crack cocaine. The issue is being misinterpreted, sometimes deliberately so, by those who favour legalisation. On any substantial scale it would encourage &quot;drug tourism&quot; across the EU. The arguments against substantial prescription of heroin in the UK are overwhelming. In the UK there is another current debate about to what extent <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/jun/27/drugsandalcohol.drugspolicy">getting users free of addiction</a> is part of the treatment regime. That is what most addicts want. <br /><br />Heroin prescription should only be considered within carefully controlled conditions and for specially selected long term and chaotic addicts. Heroin needs to be prescribed (if prescribed at all) in the context of a real effort (with other committed support), to get addicts free of addiction. The on-going small scale prescription in a few countries will be misrepresented as something else; because the media loves an argument and legalisation lobbyists think it a route to legalised drugs for all. It is not, of that I am absolutely confident.<br /><br />We need to keep speaking out about it and explaining the flaws, a process one might call &quot;reality seepage.&quot;&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://ratchasima.net/"><strong>Awzar Thi</strong></a> [member, <a href="http://www.ahrchk.net/index.php">Asian Human Rights Commission</a>, Hong Kong]: &quot;The <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/thailand-court-disbands-ruling-party.php">verdict to dissolve three parties</a> in Thailand&#39;s coalition government and ban the prime minister and his party executives from politics for five years is the latest in a series of increasingly surreal judgments that have brought the country&#39;s senior judiciary to the center of its political mayhem. It follows a ruling by the Constitutional Court&#39;s predecessor last May to terminate the party of the ousted Prime Minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, from which the newly-disbanded People&#39;s Power Party was born. It also follows another unanimous ruling from the court this September to throw out the then-Prime Minister, Samak Sundaravej, for cooking on TV. <br /><br />Like the cooking show verdict, the judges this time ruled on a narrow legal question under section 237 of the 2007 Constitution. According to this clause, any member of parliament found to have committed or abetted an offense under the electoral act, or contrary to any order or announcement of the Election Commission, shall be deprived of voting rights. These offences could be minor, may change from time to time with new orders from the commission, and do not even constitute criminal acts. But anyhow, if it can be shown that the party leader or any executive member knew about the offense and failed to do anything about it, then it is mandatory that the party is dissolved and its executive banned. <br /><br />Imaginary scenarios for how a similar law might apply to other professions don&#39;t need to be stretched very far to realize the section&#39;s absurdity. For instance, human rights defenders in Thailand have for years raised concerns about the lack of command responsibility in the police force. Officers both condone the criminal acts of their subordinates and actively defend them when they are accused of wrongdoing. Suppose that instead a provision was introduced that not only a policeman found guilty of taking a small bribe be removed from the force, but so too must his entire unit, and his station be shut down: that would be the equivalent for the police of section 237 as it now applies to political parties. Similarly, a doctor found to have committed some trivial malpractice would have her license revoked along with those of her entire medical board, and her hospital would have to be closed. How about a journalist who inserted a wrong fact in a newspaper? There are plenty of them in Thailand, some of whom strongly supported the use of this section against politicians. Why not fire their editorial boards and lock their publishing houses if they print anything that is later proven false?<br /><br />Not surprisingly, when campaigning for office at the end of last year and upon taking government, the People&#39;s Power Party indicated that section 237 was one part of the constitution that it would like to change. As the panel of military appointees that drafted the charter without consulting the public apparently stuck the clause in at the last minute, and as the party had an electoral mandate and the legal authority to amend it, not only should this have been possible - it was necessary as a commitment that the party had given to voters. Still, the idea of an elected government amending the deeply undemocratic constitution of an unelected one proved offensive for opponents going under the misnomer of People&#39;s Alliance for Democracy, who for the last three years have campaigned zealously against anyone and anything associated with the former premier. Having occupied the prime minister&#39;s official compound during August, in October and November they blockaded parliament, preventing lawmakers from debating amendments. While the legislature was unable to carry out its duties, the judiciary went ahead. The Constitutional Court, despite also being forced by demonstrators to move between buildings in order to deliver its verdict, declared on December 2 that since members of the three coalition partners were guilty of wrongdoing under the electoral law, it could do nothing other than dissolve them. <br /><br />The alliance, which by this time had occupied the airports in a manner that bore all the hallmarks of a military-planned and backed operation, had the audacity to declare the court&#39;s judgment a &quot;victory for the people&quot; and announce that it would withdraw from the premises that it had occupied around the city. But it has done so conditionally, <a href="http://www.manager.co.th/Politics/ViewNews.aspx?NewsID=9510000142655">pledging</a> that, &quot;If a proxy government of the Thaksin regime is set up again or if there is an attempt to amend the Constitution or the law to whitewash the wrongdoings of those in the Thaksin regime, to benefit politicians, or to lessen the power of the King, the PAD will return.&quot; The announcement is both a promise and a threat. The alliance has not called off hostilities, but has merely declared a ceasefire for the king&#39;s birthday period. It will be back, just as will members of parliament seeking to amend the constitution and others sympathetic to the former prime minister. But whereas of all these it is the alliance that is devoid of any legal authority for its activities, ironically it is the one that today has been able to claim that the courts are on its side. And so it would seem. There is a lot more constitutional game-playing still to come in Thailand.&quot;<br />

		<title>Military death sentence case may head back for Supreme Court certiorari decision</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Michelle M. Lindo McCluer</strong> [Director, <a href="http://www.nimj.org/home.aspx">National Institute of Military Justice</a>]: &quot;For the first time in half a century, the President approved a military death sentence this summer.  Army Private Ronald Gray was sentenced to death by a military court-martial panel in 1988 after convicting him of two murders, three rapes, an attempted murder, and a host of other crimes.  A military death sentence triggers automatic appeals.  In Gray&#39;s case, his conviction went before the Army Court of Military Review (now the Army Court of Criminal Appeals) and the Court of Military Appeals (now the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces).  The United States Supreme Court declined to review Gray&#39;s case.  Gray currently sits on the military&#39;s death row at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.<br /><br />In accordance with <a href="http://usmilitary.about.com/library/milinfo/ucmj/blart-76.htm">Article 76</a> of the <a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/ucmj.htm">Uniform Code of Military Justice </a>and Rules for Courts-Martial 1113 and 1207, a court-martial death sentence is not final until the President approves it.  While Gray&#39;s case reached the President in 2001, President Bush only <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/bush-approves-first-us-military.php">signed the death warrant </a>in late July of this year.  The Army then scheduled Gray&#39;s execution for December 10, 2008 at the federal penitentiary at Terre Haute, Indiana.  <br /><br />Several weeks before the execution date, Gray filed a petition in the District of Kansas, seeking a stay of his execution and the appointment of defense counsel for his planned pursuit of a writ of habeas corpus.  Normally, federal prisoners are allowed a single petition challenging their conviction or sentence via a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.  Despite the two decades of legal wrangling in this case, Gray has never filed a petition seeking such a writ.  The defense argument, a rather compelling one, is that such a petition would have been premature until the President approved the death sentence.  <br /><br />The federal judge assigned to this case, Senior Judge Richard D. Rogers, agreed to the stay on November 26, 2008.  The government <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/doj-objects-to-stay-of-us-military.php">subsequently responded</a> to the stay order by filing a motion to reconsider the decision, citing Gray&#39;s &quot;delay&quot; in seeking such a stay and his lack of filing a petition seeking a writ of habeas corpus before the weeks leading up to his execution date.  Given the 7 years it took for the President to approve the death sentence and the gravity of the case, the government&#39;s argument is certainly disquieting, to say the least.  The government also based its reconsideration request on Gray&#39;s perceived lack of significant probability of success on the merits and a lack of jurisdiction.  Gray&#39;s attorneys opposed the motion for reconsideration, countering the government&#39;s argument that it was harmed by Gray&#39;s actions in seeking a stay when he did.  On Friday, Judge Rogers rejected the government&#39;s arguments and declined to reconsider the stay order.<br /><br />The next step in this case will likely be for Gray&#39;s attorneys to file a petition seeking a writ of habeas corpus.  In all probability, this case will percolate back to the United States Supreme Court.  Stay tuned.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://linguistics.ucdavis.edu/People/fzojeda"><strong>Dr. Almerindo Ojeda</strong></a> [Director, Center for the Study of Human Rights in the Americas]: &quot;<a href="http://humanrights.ucdavis.edu/">The UC Davis Center for the Study of Human Rights in the Americas </a>(CSHRA) recently posted an <a href="http://humanrights.ucdavis.edu/projects/the-guantanamo-testimonials-project/testimonies/testimonies-of-military-psychologists-index/guantanamos-children">analysis</a> of miltary and diplomatic testimonies showing that the State Department had underreported, to the United Nations, the number of children seized and taken to Guantanamo by a 50 percent margin. In response to subsequent inquiries from the Associated Press (AP),  the <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/us-admits-more-juveniles-held-at.php">Pentagon spokesman revealed</a>, for the first time, that the U.S. had revised its count of juveniles held at Guantanamo from eight to twelve, thus confirming, in detail, the results of the CSHRA study.<br /><br />In its response to the AP inquiries, the  Pentagon added that the U.S. did not intentionally misrepresent the number of children taken to Guantanamo, and that &quot;it remains uncertain the exact age of many of the juveniles held at Guantanamo, as most of them did not know their own date of birth or even the year in which they were born&quot;. It should be emphasized, however, that the CSHRA analysis was based on precise information already recorded by the Department of Defense (dates of birth, in-processing dates, official announcements, and medical reports). There remain, to be sure, uncertainties regarding the dates of birth of many Guantanamo prisoners. But taking them into consideration could only add to the total of twelve already acknowledged by the Pentagon.<br /><br />The CSHRA analysis is part of the CSHRA&#39;s <a href="http://humanrights.ucdavis.edu/projects/the-guantanamo-testimonials-project/index">Guantanamo Testimonials Project</a>. The goals of this project are to gather testimonies of prisoner abuse in Guantanamo, to organize them meaningfully, to post them online, and to preserve them there in perpetuity. As of now, the project has gathered, organized, and posted hundreds of testimonies from a wide variety of sources.&quot;<br />

Passing such a law into practice would be an infringement of basic human rights, and will in fact increase the rate of new infections within the province. <br /><br />Any law that treats people living with HIV as criminals encourages the uncontrolled growth of stigma and discrimination. This in turn causes fear and shame amongst the population, and people become more inclined not to be tested for HIV or admit their positive status, and so avoid seeking treatment and care. As a result, HIV is spread amongst the population at a far more rapid rate than under normal circumstances. <br /><br />Rather, we encourage the Papua government to seek evidence-based solutions to controlling and managing its HIV epidemic. There is no public health rationale to treating HIV-positive people little better than animals.&quot;<br />

These retired generals and admirals know that DADT erodes our military readiness, is unjust and runs counter to the principles our armed forces fight for.<br /> <br />Three quarters of the American public (<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/documents/postpoll_071408.html">Washington Post-ABC News poll</a>, July 10-13, 2008) oppose the ban and 149 members of Congress have signed as co-sponsors of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:H.R.1059:">Military Readiness Enhancement Act</a> (MREA) to repeal the ban and replace it with a non-discrimination policy. In July, the first Congressional hearing on DADT in the fifteen years since its adoption was held with former and retired service members as witnesses who made compelling arguments against the ban. Captain Joan Darrah recounted how on 9/11 she had just left the Pentagon before the plane struck. Captain Darrah had not dared to list her partner on her emergency contact form; she wondered had she been killed, how her partner of 11 years might have learned of her death.<br /><br />Rear Admiral Jamie Barnett (Ret.), who retired this year and signed the repeal statement, wrote in July, &quot;...it is the responsibility of senior military commanders to advise our nation&#39;s leaders on how law and policy affect military readiness. I raised this issue in 2003 when a task force I served on worked on the Navy&#39;s diversity strategy. Senior leaders must state plainly how &quot;don&#39;t ask, don&#39;t tell&quot; affects recruiting, retention and our ability to develop essential military skills. They should speak up about how it affects military honor and integrity. It is our duty, something military leaders understand well, to speak openly of how &quot;don&#39;t ask, don&#39;t tell&quot; injures our military and weakens our preparedness.&quot;<br /> <br />The Servicemembers Legal Defense Network is working to build a solid foundation and develop consensus for open military service. The Defense Department&#39;s role is critical  in this debate and we will work hard to secure  their support and a favorable recommendation to Congress. It is important that we get it done right this time. With more hearings, and increasing support from our military&#39;s leaders, we can lift this ban - to the benefit of members of the military serving under DADT - and for our nation&#39;s security.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.Arielcohen.com">Ariel Cohen</a> [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_b?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=ariel+cohen">Senior Research Fellow</a>, <a href="http://www.heritage.org/">The Heritage Foundation</a>]: &quot;The Russian Constitution proclaims a presidential republic within a multi-party system, with president as a &quot;guarantor&quot; of the Constituion. However, checks and balances in Russia were underdeveloped since the collapse of communism in 1991 (and non-existent under communism).<br /><br />Moreover, since 2000, Russia further suffered from a serious deterioration of those political institutions, such as the Duma and the Supreme Court, which had a potential to balance the executive  branch of power. Furthermore, the mass media has increasingly come under state&#39;s control, with the government now effectivelly controlling all TV channels and most of central newspapers.<br /><br />Political parties were defanged and brought under the Kremlin&#39;s control, with the current 7 percent electoral barrier ensuring that since 2003 only the parties that are given a green light by the Kremlin get elected to the Duma.<br /><br />Governors and senators are appointed by the executive branch. Russia is suffering, in the words of one democratic party leader, from a &quot;mock-political&quot; system, where institutions exist but not playing a role they supposed to in a regular democratic system.<br /><br />Extention of the Russian Constitution as suggested by President Dmitry Medvedev as immediately <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/russia-lower-house-approves.php">confirmed by the Duma</a> most probably is aimed at returning Prime Minister Vladimir Putin into the presidential chair. If this happens, Putin would be in control of the country for up to 24 years: Two terms of four years (2000-2007); a Medvedev interregnum under the Putin control (2008-2012), and potentially two terms (2012-2024).<br /><br />Even if Putin does not come back, Medvedev&#39;s potential prolonged rule, given his appointment as heir apparent and &quot;stage-managed&quot; elections, raise serious questions about Russia&#39;s democratic nature. Putin has hinted that the next presidential elections may be early, and Medvedev evaded the answer as to whether he fills the full term.<br /><br />All this indicates that amidst the global economic crisis the democracy deficit in Russia is making the regime more insecure; and that the current rulers will not consider a peaceful power transition through election, thus closing the door on peaceful transformation.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Richard Huffman</strong> [creator of <a href="http://www.baader-meinhof.com">Baader-Meinhoff.com</a> and author of <a href="http://www.baader-meinhof.com/gunspeaks/gunintrochapter.html">The Gun Speaks</a>]: &quot;Christian Klar, leader of the notorious Red Army Faction, the leftist terrorist group that waged war on Germany from 1970 through the early 1990s, was <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/germany-court-grants-parole-to-former.php">released from prison</a>. Klar had been serving time for, among other things, the murder of Germany&#39;s top federal prosecutor, Siegfried Buback, who occupied a position roughly equivalent to the United State Attorney General.<br /> <br />Klar&#39;s release highlights the difference between the German and American penal systems. In Germany there is essentially no life sentence. Few people die in German prisons of old age. Klar had been given a &quot;life sentence&quot; for participating in nine different murders and eleven attempted murders, yet he was released after twenty-six years in prison in part because he was no longer considered dangerous.<br /> <br />Klar&#39;s release effectively ends the long, challenging relationship this terror group had with the German court system. Though it was certainly not their intention in the beginning, the Red Army Faction managed to inspire a reaction in the German legal system that offered clear parallels to the United States in recent years during our own war on terror.<br /> <br />Much like our efforts at Guantanamo Bay, the German state decided to treat it&#39;s Red Army Faction prisoners as fundamentally different than other prisoners. They experimented on their prisoners with conditions that could be described as torture. They kept many of their prisoners in entirely white cells, with a light on twenty-four hours a day, with no other prisoners in their wing, no sounds in their cells, and no human contact for months on end.<br /> <br />They secretly and illegally recorded many of the conversations of the imprisoned terrorists with their lawyers for months on end, jeopardizing their prosecution. They built a maximum security wing on top of their maximum security prison in Stuttgart to house their prisoners, and housed both men and women together in the same group of cells. They built a massive courthouse right in the prison and held the largest and most complicated trial in German history to convict the &quot;First Generation of the Red Army Faction.&quot;<br /> <br />And in the end, the German state&#39;s efforts only served to elevate the terrorists in the public mind, with many buying into the notion that they were political prisoners and not simple criminals.&quot;<br />

		<title>The Voting Rights Act: Still Needed in Obama&#039;s America</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Laughlin McDonald, Director of the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/votingrights/">ACLU Voting Rights Project</a>, says that with voting in the United States still significantly polarized along racial lines notwithstanding Barack Obama&#39;s presidential win, the Voting Rights Act will remain a necessary tool protecting the right of all Americans to vote under the incoming administration as it has been previously...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/laughlinmcdonald.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->W<odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->hen Congress amended and extended the Voting Rights Act in 2006, it found, among other things, that evidence of racially polarized voting justified continuing its special federal oversight provision. Now, some opponents of this provision - known as Section 5 - have argued that Barack Obama&#39;s election as president in 2008 shows that voting is no longer divided along racial lines, and that it is not necessary to require certain states with egregious histories of racial discrimination to get federal approval of changes in their voting practices. But the record proves these critics are wrong.<br /><br />There is no question that Obama&#39;s election reflects an enormous advancement in race relations in the United States. Few would have thought when the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965 that a black person could win the nation&#39;s highest office within the foreseeable future. But an examination of the election results shows that voting, particularly in the southern states covered by the oversight provision, remains significantly polarized along racial lines.<br /><br />Of the nine southern states covered in whole or in part by Section 5, six went for McCain - Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas. The average white vote for Obama was only 18%. And in some of the states, the white vote for the Democratic candidate declined compared to the 2004 presidential election. Kerry got 19% of the white vote in Alabama in 2004, while Obama got just 10% in 2008. In Louisiana, Kerry got 24% of the white vote in 2004, while Obama got only 14% in 2008. In Mississippi, Kerry got 14% of the white vote, and Obama 11%. <br /><br />Progress has been made in minority political participation, much of it attributable to the Voting Rights Act&#39;s ban on discriminatory tests or devises for voting and the federal oversight of voting changes in the covered jurisdictions. But nothing in the 2008 election casts doubt on Congress&#39;s considered judgment that racially polarized voting shows that racial minorities remain politically vulnerable warranting the continued protection of the oversight requirement. <br /><br />And aside from polarized voting, Congress relied upon other factors in extending Section 5 two years ago. It noted the hundreds of Section 5 objections to discriminatory election practices since the last extension in 1982, the actions undertaken by the Department of Justice and private plaintiffs to enforce Section 5, the hundreds of lawsuits that successfully challenged voting practices that diluted minority voting strength, and the thousands of federal observers sent to monitor elections in the covered jurisdictions.<br /><br />The 2006 amendment and extension of the Voting Rights Act was based upon an extensive legislative record and passed by an overwhelming majority (390-33) in the House and by a unanimous vote in the Senate. Congress correctly concluded that without the continued protection of the Act, the significant gains in minority political participation over the last 40 years would be undermined. <br /><br />The Supreme Court may well determine the constitutionality of Section 5 during its current term. A municipal utility district in Travis County, Texas, filed a lawsuit days after the Voting Rights Act was extended arguing that federal oversight of new voting practices is no longer needed and is now unconstitutional. A three-judge court disagreed and ruled that based upon &quot;the massive amount of evidence Congress collected,&quot; Section 5 remains an appropriate response to the problem of continued racial discrimination in voting. The utility district has appealed to the Supreme Court asking it to reverse the decision of the lower court. A number of civil rights organizations, including the ACLU, are participating in the lawsuit to defend the constitutionality of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. We have asked the Supreme Court to affirm the lower court&#39;s decision so that the voting rights of all Americans remain protected and secure.<br /><br />In 2006, just weeks before Congress reauthorized the oversight provision, all eight Justices who reached the issue held that states had a compelling interest in complying with Section 5. And in 2008 - nearly two years after the extension - the Court applied Section 5 to a case from Alabama, and no member of the Court suggested that federal oversight was now unconstitutional. One cannot predict with certainty what the Court will decide, but there is no doubt that the Voting Rights Act is a necessary tool to protect the right of all Americans to vote.<br /><br /><br /><em>Laughlin McDonald is Director of the ACLU Voting Rights Project</em><br />

		<title>Are Utah and Arkansas the New Centers of the Gay Rights Movement?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.ucla.edu/home/index.asp?page=2497">Douglas NeJaime</a> of UCLA School of Law says that in the wake of California voters&#39; endorsement of Proposition 8, amending the state Constitution to restrict the definition of marriage to a union between a man and a woman, the battle for gay rights may now shift to other states and focus on issues other than marriage equality...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/dougnejaime.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->I<!-- odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end --> haven't heard this much about Arkansas since Bill Clinton ran for president. Recently, I shared a cab with a woman from a relatively conservative part of the country. Our discussion quickly headed toward Proposition 8 and California's fresh ban on same-sex marriage. She explained that she was surprised by the result, but what she really found shocking was the vote in Arkansas, where gay couples (and straight unmarried couples) now can't foster or adopt children. I couldn't help but wonder whether this woman, who admittedly had no connection to the gay rights movement, would even have known what happened in Arkansas if it weren't for the passage of Proposition 8 and the fallout that ensued. Was the potentially narrow activism around marriage actually producing a more comprehensive consideration of the rights of lesbians and gay men?<br /><br />For years, progressive observers of the mainstream gay rights movement have criticized the increasing attention to marriage equality. They point out that advocates devote the bulk of their financial and rhetorical resources to marriage. Indeed, California's Proposition 8 added more fuel to the fire. Gay rights supporters from around the country contributed almost $40 million to fight the constitutional amendment. That was $40 million that wasn't going to the anti-gay initiative in Arkansas that hurt both straight and gay unmarried couples. And that was $40 million that hasn't gone to fight for family law reform, anti-discrimination protection, and non-marital relationship recognition in other states where lesbians and gay men enjoy very few rights.<br /><br />Now, the passage of Proposition 8 has focused even more attention on marriage equality. In a state that already boasted a comprehensive domestic partnership regime, Californians have centered their attention on the significance of the word "marriage," leading to robust public dialogue about the role of religion in public life. Proposition 8's passage set off marriage equality protests around the country, from cities like New York and Chicago to Sioux Falls, South Dakota and Salt Lake City, Utah. Suddenly, marriage equality occupies a primary position in gay rights discussions in every part of the country.<br /><br />This nationwide marriage movement, though, might have the ironic and beneficial effect of helping to focus attention on other potential gay rights advances. Marriage &#8212; for years presented as the issue for the gay rights movement &#8212; had functioned as a serious debate mostly in states with relatively supportive legislation and often significant relationship recognition regimes (e.g., California, Connecticut, New Jersey). Now, by focusing attention across the country, marriage equality has made gay rights part of the dialogue in states where marriage is nowhere near a realistic goal. Citizens and officials might now seriously consider issues facing the gay community and might begin to appreciate the importance of family law reform and anti-discrimination law.<br /><br />Moreover, the marriage debate has forced some gay rights opponents into uncomfortable positions, distinguishing objections to use of the term "marriage" from potential support for other rights and responsibilities. Indeed, following passage of Proposition 8, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints issued a statement explaining that it "does not object" to rights for same-sex couples. In response, Democratic lawmakers in Utah have introduced legislation that would provide some rights to same-sex couples. Forming the so-called Common Ground Initiative, the legislative efforts would create a domestic partner registry, provide health benefits for domestic partners, and allow unmarried partners to sue for wrongful death.<br /><br />Of course, there is an element of wishful thinking to all of this. Perhaps the grassroots activism surrounding gay rights issues will soon subside. Perhaps it won't translate into progress on the ground, especially in states like Arkansas and Utah. And perhaps the current court challenge to Proposition 8 will succeed, which might extinguish the flames of outrage and, worse yet, produce backlash.<br /><br />But perhaps not. People are talking about Arkansas and its treatment of potential lesbian and gay parents in a way that wouldn't have happened in the absence of Proposition 8 and the public discussion following its passage. And the first piece of Utah legislation, which addresses the wrongful death statute, recently passed a committee vote. As more people wake up to the real obstacles lesbians and gay men face in states outside of California, perhaps the situations in those states might improve because of &#8212; and not despite &#8212; the recent attention to marriage.<br /><br /><br /><em>Douglas NeJaime is the Sears Law Teaching Fellow at the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php">Ali Khan</a> of Washburn University School of Law says that the recent Mumbai massacre allegedly carried out by a militant organization fighting for liberation of Indian-occupied Kashmir is a sad reminder that the long-simmering dispute is the tinderbox of South Asia... <br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/alikhan.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he Mumbai massacre is a heinous crime, allegedly carried out by <em>Lashkar-e-Tiaba</em> (Army of the Pure), a militant organization that is fighting for liberation of Indian-occupied Kashmir. Formed in the days when liberation movements enjoyed legitimacy under international law, Lashkar has been outlawed since 2002 as a terrorist organization in Pakistan, India, the United States, and several other countries. The post-9/11 war on terror has further weakened the liberation movement for Kashmir. Under pressure from the United States, Pakistan has withdrawn its moral and military support from militant groups that have been training for decades to liberate Kashmir. The Mumbai massacre is a sad reminder, however, that the unresolved Kashmir dispute is the tinderbox of South Asia. <br /><br /><strong>Origin of the Kashmir Dispute</strong><br /><br />In 1947, British India was partitioned between Muslims and Hindus. The law of partition, however, did not settle the future of more than five hundred semi-independent princely states, including the state of Jammu and Kashmir. The law allowed each princely state to decide for itself. Due to their geographical compulsions, most states had no choice but to join India or Pakistan. <br /><br />However, a dramatic anomaly bedeviled the accession of two princely states. The predominantly Hindu state of Junagadh was ruled by a Muslim prince who opted to join Pakistan. India sent its military forces to annex Junagadh, arguing that the people, and not the prince, must decide the question of accession. Ironically, the predominantly Muslim state of Jammu and Kashmir was ruled by a Hindu prince who opted to join India. India happily accepted the princely accession. A militarily weak Pakistan could not take Jammu and Kashmir by force. A militarily strong India, which relied on the peoples&#39; choice to take Junagadh, has since refused to apply the same logic to settle the Kashmir dispute. <br /><br /><strong>Internationalization of the Kashmir Dispute</strong><br /><br />Over the years, the United Nations Security Council has passed several resolutions in a bid to settle the Kashmir dispute. In 1948, the Security Council passed Resolution 47, which became the principal source for resolving the Kashmir dispute. The Resolution recognized "that the question of accession of Jammu and Kashmir to India or Pakistan should be decided through the democratic method of a free and impartial plebiscite." No such plebiscite was ever held, forcing India and Pakistan to engage in periodic wars. Rebuffing the Security Council Resolution, India gradually shifted away from its commitment to hold an internationally supervised plebiscite. <br /><br />A frustrated Pakistan resorted to war in 1965 to settle the Kashmir dispute. India defeated Pakistan and through mediation of the Soviet Union forced Pakistan to sign the 1966 Tashkent Declaration, a treaty that effectively partitioned Jammu and Kashmir between India and Pakistan. In 1971, India played a key role in breaking up Pakistan. Instead of acquiring Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan lost more than half of its population and territory to the new state of Bangladesh. Furthermore, India forced Pakistan to sign the Simla Agreement, a treaty under which the Kashmir dispute would be resolved through bilateral negotiations. Thus, India finally removed the Kashmir dispute from the international forum. After the Simla Agreement, the Security Council was no longer interested in resolving the Kashmir dispute. A dysfunctional bilateralism produced no settlement either.<br /><br />During the Cold War, even though Pakistan sided with the United States in ousting the Soviet Union from Afghanistan, the United States showed little interest in resolving the Kashmir dispute. As the Cold War ended, the United States abandoned Pakistan and instead began to woo India as an economic and possibly a military partner against China. Pakistan, now completely on his own and nursing the wounds of betrayal, resorted to fomenting militancy in the Indian-held Kashmir. Pakistan's option to keep the Kashmir dispute alive through state-sponsored militancy crashed to ground in the post 9/11 world in which all freedom fighters are now labeled as terrorists. Meanwhile, both India and Pakistan developed nuclear weapons, creating a dangerous stalemate in South Asia. <br /><br /><strong>A Possible Solution for the Kashmir Dispute</strong><br /><br />In 1994, I published an article titled <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=987561">The Kashmir Dispute: A Plan for Regional Cooperation</a> in the <em>Columbia Journal of Transnational Law</em>. After analyzing historical roots of the Kashmir dispute, I offered the following points for a possible settlement:<ol><li>Except for the Valley of Kashmir, which has been a distinct province in the historical princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, India and Pakistan should lawfully partition the rest of the State. In fact, they already have. India controls Jammu while Pakistan controls Gilgit. Other parts of the state have also been partitioned. I suggest that the existing line of control be converted into an international border between India and Pakistan.<br /><br /><li>An internationally supervised plebiscite should be held in the Valley of Kashmir, which would allow its people to choose their own destiny, including the possibility of an independent state such as Switzerland. To preserve its neutrality, the Valley Kashmir may be legally disabled from entering into any military alliance with either India or Pakistan.<br /><br /><li>India and Pakistan should work toward forging an open borders regional community. They can use and develop the existing institutional structure of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) to move toward an economic community. The partition of Jammu and Kashmir will lose many of its scars and burdens in the context of an open-borders South Asia, including Nepal and Bangladesh.</ol>To reverse the process of periodic wars, I have even proposed that India and Pakistan sign a defense pact to avert external threats. South Asia needs a new stimulus framework, a bold psychological initiative, if it wants to solve its more mundane problems such as air pollution, dirty drinking water, load-shedding, and undignified poverty. <br /><br /><br /><em>Ali Khan is professor of law at Washburn University School of Law in Topeka, Kansas, and the author of the book, <em>A Theory of Universal Democracy</em> (2003).

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Tara Lee, a former Navy JAG now a partner at DLA Piper (US) LLP, says that having a Status of Forces Agreement with Iraq that abdicates the jurisdictional reach of the United States over contractors (not just security contractors) who are US citizens acting on its behalf is too high a price to pay for recognizing Iraq&#39;s sovereignty....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/taralee.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>E</strong></font>arlier this week the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq issued a report that is highly critical of the absence of due process in Iraq's criminal justice system. The UN Report notes that "many detainees have been deprived of their liberty for months or even years, often under precarious physical conditions, without access to defence counsel, or without being formally charged with a crime or produced before a judge. Continuing allegations of widespread torture and ill-treatment of inmates are of particular concern." The report is particularly timely, given that as of January 1, 2009, U.S. citizens who are contractors in Iraq will be subject to the jurisdiction of Iraqi criminal and civil courts, according to the terms of the Status of Forces Agreement signed on November 17, 2009.<br /><br />Nothing in this newly-signed Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) with Iraq guarantees that a U.S. citizen contractor arrested in Iraq will get even the most basic due process protections. The SOFA doesn&#39;t even permit the U.S. Government to detain U.S. citizen contractors who are awaiting trial in Iraqi courts. The SOFA requires that U.S. soldiers and government employees arrested by the Iraqi police will be handed over to U.S. authorities within 24 hours of detention or arrest. However, if the detained American citizen is a contractor, he or she is left entirely to the disposition of the Iraqi system, and will be left to sit in the Iraqi jail awaiting Iraqi justice.<br /><br />The <em>New York Times</em> editorial board has called the SOFA's exclusions of protection for contractors "an acceptable price to pay to show this country's commitment to the rule of law." A diplomatic concession that blatantly and offensively treats one class of American citizen differently than others hardly demonstrates the U.S. commitment to the rule of law.<br /><br />What it does demonstrate is that the U.S. government was eager to get a SOFA signed, so as to claim progress on the path to Iraqi sovereignty. To get it signed, the U.S. government made an enormous concession as to the due process rights of one currently unpopular class of its citizens: contractors. By so conceding, we achieved a document we can point to and claim that Iraq is sovereign. Iraqi sovereignty was our stated goal in Iraq. This SOFA is just one last way for us to wave a "Mission Accomplished" banner. <br /><br />There was no legal reason to treat contractors differently. This SOFA does not fill a jurisdiction gap in accountability over contractors. There are already jurisdictional means by which U.S. courts can hold U.S. contractors in Iraq accountable for their actions. Nonetheless, starting January 1, 2009, the U.S. government can only do so if the Iraq government defers. According to the U.S. Department of State, there will be no exceptions to this deference, not even if the contractor is arrested for doing exactly what his U.S. government contract obligated him to do. <br /><br />The U.S. government is offering its contractors no due process guarantees, no indemnification, and worst of all, no answers.<br /><br />A few days after the signing of the SOFA, the State Department faced questions from its contractors at a meeting convened ostensibly to provide answers to the many unresolved questions surrounding implementation of the new agreement. Those questions include:<br /><br />Will Iraqi criminal jurisdiction be retroactive, so that U.S. citizens in Iraq can be charged for offenses allegedly occurring years ago? (The U.N. Report suggests it may be.) Will employees already back in the U.S. now be subject to extradition if they are charged in Iraq? (A 1934 treaty suggests they might be.) Will criminal defendants have rights to or access to legal counsel, basic sanitation, and health care? (The U.N. Report suggests they won't.) In the civil court system, will Iraqi courts allow pre-judgment attachment of U.S. contractor assets and will contractor equipment in Iraq be seized if a contractor is sued as of January 1? (Unknown.)<br /><br />When pressed for answers to these questions, the State Department repeated its diplomat-speak refrain about what a "significant step towards sovereignty this is for Iraq." No answers given, no guidance offered, no concern evident.<br /><br />When asked, "Do you plan to get answers and some follow-on guidance to contractors in Iraq before the jurisdiction takes effect on January 1?" the State Department did finally have an answer&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;. "No."<br /><br />The plan, not entirely surprisingly, seems to be to have no plan. We're just going to wait and see how the Iraqi courts handle each case as it comes up. But we owe better than that to the contractors we have hired to go into harm's way and do the Nation's work.<br /><br />The problems related to criminal prosecution and due process could be solved through additional follow-on agreements that supplement and implement the SOFA. Our government could also work to reach written agreements with Iraq about the minimum due process all our citizens will receive. Both of those measures could theoretically be implemented by Executive Agreement before January 1, 2009, but there is no sign from the State Department that such efforts are even underway. Come January 1, we will be bound by an Agreement that lacks even a mechanism to notify U.S. authorities of the arrest, detention, conviction, and execution of U.S. citizens if they happen to be contractors. The omission of protections for contractors in the SOFA wasn't inadvertent, and no follow-on agreement protecting contractors seems likely so far. We owe better to the people who serve this country, whether they serve in uniform or not.<br /><br />The problems related to civil jurisdiction and its overwhelming costs have an even easier fix. Public Law 85-804 gives the President the ability to authorize federal agencies to indemnify public contractors against unusually hazardous risks they undertake when facilitating the national defense. When indemnification is granted under PL 85-804, the contract is amended to provide indemnification for third-party claims (including litigation costs) resulting from the risk inherent in the contract. The indemnity applies only to the extent that the claims exceed the contractor's insurance coverage, and does not cover claims resulting from willful misconduct or lack of good faith. PL 85-804 indemnification is the right thing to do when we ask contractors to support the national defense and to incur extraordinary risk while doing so. It can be granted by Executive Order. At a minimum, PL 85-804 indemnification or something like it should now be granted to contractors supporting the U.S. mission in Iraq.<br /><br />Sadly, neither due process protections nor cost indemnifications appear to be planned or in progress.<br /><br />If ever we have placed U.S. contractors in harms way and asked them to do extraordinary things, we have done so in Iraq. We have done so because we had to, because our Armed Forces alone lacked the resources and manpower to simultaneously conduct both combat operations and security missions in that country. We called upon a "total force" of soldiers, civil servants, and contractors to undertake that burden. They answered that call, soldiers, civil servants, and contractors. They all acted, and continue to act every day in Iraq, on behalf of the U.S. government. Now, when it has become politically e
xpedient, we have washed our hands of concern for the contractors. <br /><br />Recognizing the sovereignty of Iraq is important, to be sure, but abdicating the jurisdictional reach of the United States over the citizens acting on its behalf is too high a price to pay for that recognition.<br /><br />Since beginning the war in Iraq, America has shown that it cares deeply how we treat the enemy combatants that we detain and try as war criminals. We should care as much about what will happen to the American citizens who are arrested in Iraq after January 1, 2009. But instead, we signed an Agreement that evidences no care for them at all, if they happen to be contractors. That is a shameful abdication of the responsibilities our government owes to its citizens. To ALL of them. <br /><br /><br /><em>Tara Lee is a former Navy JAG and former Resident Fellow at the Center for the Study of Professional Military Ethics at the United States Naval Academy.

In particular, I was struck by her characterization of such proposals as 'rights denial'. With respect to my own <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1299740">proposal</a> nothing could be further from the truth. Quite the opposite &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; my proposal is predicated on a rights-based solution to a problem requiring an immediate, legal answer. Rights denial? Absolutely not. Rights ensuring? Yes. Absolute rights? No. Workable, practical and legal solution to an enormous legal and practical conundrum? Absolutely.<br /><br />Let me explain.<br /><br />In advocating the establishment of domestic terror courts I am seeking both a legal and practical solution to the continued detention of thousands of "post 9/11 detainees". My over-riding concern is for the rule of law and rights of detainees otherwise held, in essence, in indefinite detention. That has been the primary motivation for my proposal.<br /><br />When I testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee (June, 2008) regarding my proposal I suggested that establishing a domestic terror court is the most effective way to begin trying thousands of detainees held by the United States directly or indirectly world-wide. I suggest that the term "GITMO" is misleading. Guantanamo Bay is but one detention facility; what about the detainees held in Abu Ghraib, Bagram and Camp Buco? What about detainees held elsewhere in the world either by or on behalf of the US? What about future detainees? <br /><br />In other words, GITMO must be viewed as a term of art referring to thousands of detainees with an unknown number potentially held in the future. While I suggest there is no "war on terrorism" (an unfortunate and inaccurate term), active and engaged operational counter-terrorism (what has been referred to as "armed conflict short of war") will directly lead to the continued detention of thousands of individuals. That is the reality of terrorism and counterterrorism. My proposal is in response to that continued and perhaps never-ending reality. <br /><br />In developing a "rights-based" alternative legal regime I recommend that "where" individuals suspected of involvement in terrorism be tried is but one piece of the puzzle. That puzzle is comprised of three legs: how and when to detainee, how to interrogate and how and where to try. Looking forward: With respect to detention&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;an individual can be detained only if he is "caught in the act" or if there is reliable, valid and valid intelligence information with respect to his involvement in terrorism. "Round up the usual suspect" and guilt by the association are unconstitutional. They are also enormously problematic from an operational perspective. With respect to interrogations, according to my proposal individuals detained for suspicion of involvement in terrorism will be granted Miranda rights. They will also not be subject to torture no matter what offense they are suspected of. Torture is illegal, immoral and does not lead to actionable intelligence. <br /><br />As to where to try the detainees. I suggest that the military commissions are an unworkable solution. Similarly, a suggested international treaty based terror court is presently unfeasible given a fundamental disagreement by the international community to agree on a definition of terrorism. That leaves two solutions&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;Article III courts and domestic terror courts.<br /><br />The fundamental differences between Article III courts and my proposed domestic terror court is with respect to the introduction of classified intelligence information in camera and bench, rather than jury, trials. With respect to the former, the defendant's 8th Amendment right to confront his accuser will be balanced with the State's absolute requirement to protect intelligence sources. Is this problematic? It most certainly is; of that, there is no doubt. However, it is critical to emphasize that this exception will only be implemented in those cases where the available criminal evidence is insufficient for conviction. In other words, if the prosecutor is convinced that conviction does not require intelligence information the case will be solely based on criminal evidence therefore preserving the defendant's right to confront. However, in those cases where the criminal evidence is insufficient the domestic terror court paradigm will enable introduction of classified information.<br /><br />The judge, in such occurrences, will "wear" two hats&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;that of judge and that of defense counsel. Furthermore, the judge will proactively seek to de-classify otherwise classified information thereby enabling the defendant to cross examine his accuser. While this will not be possible in all cases, the judges "mandate" is to minimize those cases where classified information is introduced. While this is not a "perfect solution" it seeks to balance between two powerful competing interests by suggesting a workable solution.<br /><br />With respect to bench, rather than jury trials I suggest that convening thousands of American citizens to sit as a "jury of peers" of suspected terrorists and expecting them to understand enormously complicated intelligence information and not be fearful of "jury intimidation" is an all but impractical solution. Not only logistically (in the words of the former President of the Israel Supreme Court, Aharon Barak, "the logistic considerations of the executive must not serve as a barrier to the freedom of the individual") but legally from the perspective of protecting the detainee-defendants rights. Bench trials&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;in my proposal by a re-structured FISA Court&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;with appeal to the US Court of Appeals would far more effectively preserve and protect the rights of the detainee than jury trials. Trial by jury of thousands of detainees will undoubtedly be inordinately slower than bench trials thereby continuing to deny the defendant basic judicial rights.<br /><br />That will be the true and continuing "rights denial" Prof Sadat suggests in her commentary.<br /><br />I do agree with Prof Sadat that a discussion on this topic must be held and quickly so for the existing paradigm is unworkable. The debate regarding this question must be robust and candid. It must include policy and decision makers, academics, members of the Bar, civil rights organizations and the public. The over-riding principle is respect for the rule of law with an understanding that balancing between the legitimate rights of the individual with the equally legitimate national security rights of the state is the essence of a democracy.<br /><br /><br /><em>Amos Guiora is professor of law at The S.

While certainly courts martial have taken place for war crimes in Iraq, for the mistreatment at Abu Ghraib, murder and rape in Haditha (which led to a number of life sentences) as well as mass murder in Hamdaniya and Haditha, Iraqis have been understandably skeptical of the United States willingness to prosecute its own citizens for crimes in Iraq.  The Abu Ghraib prosecutions focused almost (but not entirely) exclusively on the enlisted and on noncommissioned officers, for example.  Often prosecutors seem to have a difficult time proving their cases, as in the Haditha killings, where charges against seven of the eight Marines have been dropped, and the eighth awaits trial for negligent homicide, despite considerable evidence (photographic and eyewitness, both from civilians, including children, and fellow soldiers) of a deliberate massacre of over two dozen Iraqi civilians.  The difficulties are compounded in the case of private contractors, where virtually nothing has been seriously investigated.  This includes the shooting and killing of a bodyguard in front of numerous eyewitnesses, and any number of incidents involving the shooting deaths of unarmed civilians, in at least one case dozens of them, in crowded, public areas.<br /><br />More importantly, certain, persistent voices in our political conversation decry virtually any investigation into those activities that appear to be war crimes, describing this as being somehow hostile to the troops and therefore threatening national security.  The fear is that excessive prosecution will hinder the troops' ability to do their jobs effectively and well, because the actions they take in a difficult and deadly combat environment will be judged in hindsight, from those far from the line of fire, to have been criminal in nature.<br /><br />Certainly the concern of overweening prosecution is a legitimate one, and few doubt that the overwhelming majority of troops do their jobs professionally and well in very difficult conditions.  However, a separate issue certainly arises in cases where, as here, the ability and willingness of the United States to prosecute that small minority of soldiers committing war crimes is viewed by the host country, with some degree of justification, with extreme skepticism.  When this happens, as it has in Iraq, the host country becomes not only less amenable to the presence of foreign troops on its soil, but also opposes strongly the grant of immunity against prosecution in the host country courts.  This threatens American national security, and the interests of American troops, far more than, perhaps, a more robust prosecution in Haditha or Abu Ghraib would have.  <br /><br />Thus, in an attempt to protect troops and serve American national interest, we may end up with something that does less of either.  There is that danger in Iraq currently.  A source of the impasse in the current negotiations over the Status of Forces Agreement between the United States and Iraq relates precisely to the question of immunity for US troops.   While some, such as the Sadrists, simply oppose the US presence and will oppose the agreement no matter what it does or says, a principal sticking point among the vast majority of the political powers in Iraq relates to the extent of immunity granted to US soldiers from Iraqi prosecution.  While American media are quick to deride the quality of justice in Iraqi courts, the other side must be taken into account. No Iraqi I have spoken to within government circles takes seriously the notion that American military courts earnestly investigate and prosecute war crimes.  <br /><br />This is an important issue, for our troops and our national security, as it leads Iraqis to stress ever more forcefully the need to prosecute in domestic tribunals.  So far, this has led the United States to make an extraordinary, if largely symbolic, concession; namely, that soldiers who commit war crimes when not on base or on a mission may be subject to Iraqi criminal process.  This is symbolic in that almost never is an American soldier off base and off mission in Iraq of all places, but still, it is quite unusual for the US to concede this.  As an international lawyer who finds value in so many legal systems around the world, I find much to praise in offering such a concession, but I also wonder if it will be enough.  If it is not, the entire existence of the agreement is cast into doubt, hardly a win for the US national security interest.  It either makes the presence of US troops illegal, or it continues their presence under Security Council mandate rather than through treaty with a sovereign, democratic nation.  Even national interest aside, I wonder whether this state of affairs is really more encouraging to troops in the field.  I also wonder whether those so terrified of overweening US court martial investigations are truly satisfied with a compromise that actually grants some level of oversight, however small, to Iraqi courts instead of American military ones.  Sometimes, if one wants to take American national security and troop morale seriously, a broader perspective might be necessary.<br /><br /><br />*I am grateful to U.S. Army Judge Advocate (JAG) Dan E. Stigall for his valuable perspective and insight concerning the current state of military prosecutions for war crimes in Iraq.<br /><br /><br /><em>Haider Ala Hamoudi is a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.

A "global war on terrorism" was declared and new rules for the targeting, detention and trials of persons suspected of acts of terrorism or membership in terrorist organizations were created. Seven years later, upon the election of a new president, there is an intense debate under way in the United States as to what to do about the "global war" and the laws and institutions resulting from it.<br /><br />Attorney General Michael Mukasey expressed his views at a meeting of the Federalist Society November 20 and had this to say about the future:<blockquote>The next Administration will have the opportunity to review the institutions and the legal structures that this Administration has relied upon in keeping the nation safe over the past seven years. I am neither so proud as to think that the next Administration will be unable to make improvements, nor so na&Atilde;&macr;ve as to think that the policy choices, or even the legal judgments, that they make will be identical to ours.<br /><br />What I do hope, however, is that the next Administration understands the threat that we continue to face and that it shares the priority we have placed on remaining on the offense to prevent future terrorist attacks. Remaining on the offense includes not simply relying on the tools that we have established, but also encouraging a climate in which both legal and policy issues are debated responsibly, in a way that does not chill the intelligence community and deter national security lawyers from making the decisions necessary to protect us.<br /><br />And I am hopeful that some time from now, after the next Administration has had the chance to review the decisions made and the legal advice provided, it will acknowledge that despite any policy differences, the national security lawyers in this Administration acted professionally and in good faith and that the country was safer as a result.</blockquote>Three of us, all specialists in international law, especially International Humanitarian Law, take a very different view, which we expressed at a recent Washburn University School of Law symposium on "The Rule of Law and the Global War on Terrorism". The members of the Symposium's final panel on "The Way Forward"[<a href="http://www.washburnlaw.edu/ruleoflaw/#wayforward">recorded video</a>][1], considering important legal issues that will confront President Obama's Administration when it takes office on January 20, 2009, have framed the following:<br /><br /><strong>Washburn Consensus on Post-9/11 Principles</strong><ol><li>The phrase "Global War on Terrorism" should no longer be used in the sense of an on-going "war" or "armed conflict" being waged against "terrorism". Nor should it serve as either the legal or security policy basis for the range of counter- and anti-terrorism measures taken by the Administration in addressing the very real and present challenges faced by the United States and other nations in addressing terrorism.<br /><br /><li>The Administration should announce that it is taking immediate steps to close the interrogation and detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, with a view to removing all remaining detainees by July 1, 2009. <br /><br /><li>The Military Commissions Act of 2006 should be repealed in its entirety, and all activities currently being conducted under the Military Commission process constituted by the Act should be terminated.<br /><br /><li>Persons accused of committing acts of terrorism, war crimes or other serious human rights violations should be tried, as appropriate, before Article III courts or, as provided for in the Uniform Code of Military Justice, by courts-martial or military commission. <br /><br /><li>The Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 should be amended to ensure the application of one standard of treatment and interrogation to all detainees held in U.S. custody or control. <br /><br /><li>The single standard for the treatment and interrogation of all detainees held in U.S. custody or control should be that reflected in Army Field Manual 2-22.3, Human Intelligence Collector Operations.<br /><br /><li>Any presidential findings, statements, Executive Orders, or other forms of authorization related to detainee treatment and interrogation that sanction or authorize methods inconsistent with Field Manual 2-22.3 should be withdrawn.<br /><br /><li>A comprehensive investigation of alleged post-9/11 U.S.-held detainee abuse should be undertaken by an independent, expert commission with the goal of producing a 2009 report detailing both the findings and recommendations of this commission. <br /><br /><br />David E.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.tjsl.edu/faculty_m_cohn">Marjorie Cohn</a> of Thomas Jefferson School of Law says that as US federal courts begin to demonstrate their capacity and willingness to render justice to Guantanamo detainees whose legal process has been too long delayed, the Obama administration should steer clear of setting up special national security courts with reduced due process which would raise many of the same concerns as the US military commissions...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/cohncolor.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>S</strong></font>ince the Bush administration began transporting men and boys to Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo Bay in January 2002, it has tried to prevent them from presenting their cases before a neutral federal judge. Indeed, the naval base was turned into a prison camp precisely to keep the detainees away from impartial courts. The government argued that federal courts had no jurisdiction over men detained on Cuban soil. Twice, the Supreme Court rejected that argument, finding that the United States exercises complete jurisdiction and control over the Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo Bay base.<br /><br />Finally, on November 20, in a stunning development, U.S. District Court Judge Richard J. Leon ordered the government to release five Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo Bay detainees "forthwith." Finding that the government failed to prove the men were "enemy combatants," the judge, in a rare comment, urged senior government leaders not to appeal his ruling. "Seven years of waiting for a legal system to give them an answer . . . in my judgment is more than enough," he said.<br /><br />The five detainees the judge ordered released are Lakhdar Boumediene, Mustafa Ait Idir, Hadj Boudella, Saber Lahmar and Mohammed Nechla. Judge Leon did, however, find that a sixth detainee, Belkacem Bensayah, was properly classified an enemy combatant.<br /><br />It was the Supreme Court's June 12, 2008 decision in <em>Boumediene v. Bush</em> (see <a href="/forumy/2008/06/supreme-court-checks-and-balances-in.php">Supreme Court Checks and Balances in Boumediene</a>, JURIST <em>Forum</em>, June 16, 2008) that allowed Judge Leon to review the enemy combatant classifications. The high court upheld the Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo detainees' constitutional right to habeas corpus and made clear they were "entitled to a prompt habeas corpus hearing." Judge Leon adopted the definition of &quot;enemy combatant&quot; used by the Combatant Status Review Tribunals, which is "an individual who was part of or supporting Taliban or al Qaeda forces, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners. This includes any person who has committed a belligerent act or has directly supported hostilities in aid of enemy armed forces."<br /><br />The six detainees in this case are native Algerians who were residing in Bosnia and Herzegovina, over a thousand miles from the battlefield in Afghanistan. All six held Bosnian citizenship or lawful permanent residence as well as native Algerian citizenship. Arrested by Bosnian authorities in October 2001 for alleged involvement in a plot to bomb the U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo, they were ordered released from prison on January 17, 2002 and then turned over to U.S. personnel who transported them to Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo on January 20, 2002. They have been there ever since.<br /><br />President Bush had withdrawn the alleged bomb plot as a basis for their detention. He argued instead that the men planned to travel to Afghanistan in late 2001 and take up arms against the United States and allied forces. Judge Leon found the government had failed to prove these allegations by a preponderance of evidence in the cases of all but Bensayah. <br /><br />The judge said the Justice Department and intelligence agencies had relied solely on a classified document from an unnamed source. He wrote that "while the information in the classified intelligence report, relating to the credibility and reliability of the source, was undoubtedly sufficient for the intelligence purposes for which it was prepared, it is not sufficient for the purposes for which a habeas court must now evaluate it." He added, "To allow enemy combatancy to rest on so <em>thin</em> a reed would be inconsistent with this Court's obligation under the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Hamdi</em> to protect petitioners from the risk of erroneous detention."<br /><br />The government did, however, present additional evidence which persuaded Judge Leon that Bensayah was "an al-Qaida facilitator" who planned to take up arms against the United States and facilitate the travel of unnamed others to do the same. That, wrote the judge, "constitutes direct support of al-Qaida in furtherance of its objectives" and "this amounts to 'support' within the meaning of the 'enemy combatant' definition governing this case."<br /><br />Bosnian authorities have indicated they are willing to take the five detainees once they are released.<br /><br />In October, another federal district judge in Washington, Ricardo M. Urbina, ordered that 17 Uighur detainees be released from Guantanamo. The judge didn't hold an evidentiary hearing because the government conceded the men were not enemy combatants. But the 17 men from western China languish in custody because the government has appealed Judge Urbina's ruling.<br /><br />President-elect Barack Obama has pledged to close the Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo prison when he takes office. The National Lawyers Guild has urged Obama to ensure that the prisoners are released, repatriated, resettled, or brought to trial (if there is probable cause to believe they have committed a crime) in strict accordance with international human rights and humanitarian law, and the principles of fundamental justice pertaining to criminal proceedings. This includes but is not limited to, the Four Geneva Conventions of 1949, the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The United States has ratified all of these treaties which makes their provisions binding U.S. law under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution. <br /><br />The Guild opposes the creation of national security courts to try the detainees. Although Obama said in August, &quot;It&#39;s time to better protect the American people and our values by bringing swift and sure justice to terrorists through our courts and our Uniform Code of Military Justice," three Obama advisers told the Associated Press that the President-elect is expected to propose a new court system to deal with "sensitive national security cases." <br /><br />Concerns have been cited about disclosure of classified information in civilian courts and courts-martial. However, the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) provides an adequate method of protecting classified information in existing U.S. courts. CIPA allows a judge to assess the importance of sensitive evidence before it is disclosed in open court and, if necessary, create a nonclassified substitute for use at trial. Former federal prosecutors Richard B. Zabel and James J. Benjamin, Jr. studied the 107 post-9/11 cases and prepared a 171-page white paper for Human Rights First called <em>In Pursuit of Justice: Prosecuting Terrorism Cases in the Federal Courts</em>. They wrote, "[w]e are not aware of a single terrorism case in which CIPA procedures have failed and a serious security breach has occurred." National security courts, they write, "would give the government more power and make it easier for the government to secure convictions." <br /><br />President-elect Obama should send those prisoners he intends to try to U.S. civilian and military courts, which are well-suited to protect national security concerns. He should eschew the creation of a new system o
f courts with reduced due process, which will raise many of the same concerns as Bush's dreaded military commissions.<br /><br /><br /><em>Marjorie Cohn is a professor at Thomas Jefferson School of Law and the president of the National Lawyers Guild.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.aclu.org/intlhumanrights/gen/34520res20080319.html"><strong>Jennifer Turner</strong></a> [Human Rights Researcher, <a href="http://www.aclu.org/intlhumanrights/index.html">Human Rights Program</a>, <a href="http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a>]: &quot;On Thursday, a Pentagon spokesman revealed that U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates has <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/us-defense-secretary-orders-pentagon.php">ordered aides to draw up plans</a> for closing down the prison camp at Guant&aacute;namo Bay.  The fact that Defense Secretary Gates has finally taken this concrete action is an encouraging sign that President-elect Barack Obama intends to fulfill his campaign pledge to close Guant&aacute;namo and the unconstitutional military commissions.  <br /><br />Shutting down the Guant&aacute;namo Bay prison camp and military commissions is an important <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/detention/38141prs20081218.html?s_src=HP">first step</a> toward breaking from eight years of shameful policies that allowed torture and violations of U.S. and international law.  By closing Guant&aacute;namo, President-elect Obama can end the poisonous legacy of the Bush administration&#39;s policies and take a critical first step in <a href="http://www.aclu.org/transition/">restoring American values</a> of justice, due process, and human rights.<br /><br />However, in recent weeks, even as President-elect Obama has repeated his promise to close Guant&aacute;namo, some have used fear-mongering to argue we should open a new Gitmo at home by creating national security courts and establishing what amounts to another unconstitutional detention system.  The proponents of this school of thought claim that there are some detainees who are too dangerous to be released but who cannot face criminal charges.  This position is mostly based on flawed assumptions about the capacity of federal courts to handle terrorism cases.<br /><br />It would be legally and morally disastrous to import Guant&aacute;namo&#39;s illegal detention and military commissions system to U.S. shores by creating a whole new detention system and enact new legislation to accommodate the Bush administration&#39;s torture policies.  Last week, the ACLU, along with Amnesty International USA, Human Rights Watch, and Human Rights First, delivered a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/detention/38140prs20081218.html?s_src=HP">letter</a> to President-elect Obama&#39;s transition team urging Obama not to create an on-shore Guant&aacute;namo system.  All four organizations categorically oppose the creation of any ad-hoc illegal detention system or &quot;third way&quot; that permits the executive branch to suspend due process and hold suspected terrorists without charge or trial, essentially moving Guant&aacute;namo on-shore.<br /><br />Instead of perpetuating the Bush administration&#39;s failed detention and military commissions experiment, the new Justice Department should conduct a fresh review of all detainee records to determine whether there is legitimate evidence of criminal activity.  Where there is not, detainees should be repatriated to their home countries for trial or release, or to a third country if there is a risk of torture or abuse in their home countries.  Where evidence of criminal activity does exist, detainees should be prosecuted in traditional federal or military courts, where they will face the American criminal justice system.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Matt Belcher</strong> [<a href="http://www.belcherlawoffice.com/">Belcher Law Office</a>, Chicago]: &quot;If it weren&#39;t so gallingly embarrassing to the city of Big Shoulders, I would just laugh off the (alleged) Blagojevich exploits as another operatic example of the machine politics of the &quot;Chicago way.&quot; For those of you not versed in the &quot;Chicago way&quot; please take note that it is very much like the &quot;Alaska way,&quot; the &quot;New Orleans way,&quot; the &quot;Detroit way,&quot; - but with a homozygous, inbred twist.<br /><br />While Alaska has had a better part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_political_corruption_probe">10 scandals</a> (including the conviction of a sitting U.S. Senator), Chicago is unique because of the Obama factor. Just when the bright lights of fame and fortune start to shine upon the glory that is Chicago, out scurry some cockroaches to contaminate our floor. Before the green grass splendor of our beloved Grant Park has even re-sprouted from the trampling, historic celebration of the Obama victory party, out into the open air comes another dirty family secret. Much like the Union Stockyards of the olden days (think Upton Sinclair&#39;s &quot;The Jungle&quot;) there is a stench in the air that Chicago residents can&#39;t even smell anymore.<br /><br />While Blagojevich was little known outside of Illinois, he has been involved in the Chicago machine at least since 1996; the year he was essentially &quot;slated&quot; by his father-in-law, 30-year veteran Alderman Dick Mell, to be the next U.S. Representative of the 5th Illinois Congressional District.  <br /><br />&quot;5th Congressional District&quot;...why does that sound familiar, you ask? Well that is the current Congressional seat of Rahm Emanuel, who had taken over the 5th District seat from Blagojevich, after Blagojevich was elected Governor. It&#39;s also the same seat occupied by Dan Rostenkowski until 1995. Yes, <em>that</em> Dan Rostenkowski...of the Oxford Federal Correctional Institution Rostenkowskis.<br /><br />And who preceded Blagojevich as Governor of Illinois? Well that would be George Ryan. You know - of the Terre Haute Federal Correctional Institution Ryans. <br /><br />And the Attorney General of the State of Illinois? The one whose legal strategy to have the Governor declared &quot;incompetent&quot; was summarily dismissed by the Illinois Supreme Court (but managed to get her plenty of face time on the Sunday Morning news circuit) &#8212; that would be Lisa Madigan.  Madigan happens to be daughter of Mike Madigan, the Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives and Chairman of the Democratic Party of Illinois, who (allegedly) delayed the Illinois impeachment process to give the AG&#39;s office a shot at publicity before the Supreme Court.  Lisa Madigan is planning her next run for higher office, whether for Governor or U.S. Senate.  <br /><br />And what about Senate Candidate 5?  The one (allegedly) whose emissaries offered Blagojevich up to a million dollars for Obama&#39;s U.S. Senate seat? <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/ConductUnbecoming/story?id=6431739">ABC news says</a> that it appears to be none other than Jesse Jackson, Jr. The same Jessie Jackson, Jr. who is the brother of the Chicago Anheuser-Busch <a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_3_95/ai_54724846">Distributor Yousaf Jackson</a>, the son of the Rev. Jesse Jackson and the wife of Chicago&#39;s 7th ward <a href="http://www.runsandirun.com/biography.html">Alderman Sandi Jackson</a>. Jessie Jackson, much like Lisa Madigan and Rod Blagojevich before him, became the Democratically slated candidate for 2nd U.S. Congressional District in 1995 and he continues in that office today.   <br /><br />Jesse Jackson, Jr. replaced Mel Reynolds in the 2nd Congressional District after Reynolds was indicted for sexual assault and criminal sexual abuse with an underage campaign volunteer. Despite the indictment, Reynolds was reelected in November 1994 but resigned his seat in 1995 after being convicted on 12 counts of sexual assault, obstruction of justice and solicitation of child pornography.<br /><br />So what to make of all this?   <br /><br />This inbred, interdependent and yet internecine &quot;machine&quot; hands out favors, holds personal vendettas, renders quids with quos like a pro and generally disregards, destroys or disassembles anything except that which makes the machine stronger.  <br /><br />The only possible solution to &quot;terminate&quot; the machine is someone who is not beholden to, related to, friends with, associated with or otherwise contaminated by the machine. On October 24, 2001, the nomination of a candidate for U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois was confirmed by the Senate. The Senator who nominated the candidate urged the selection principally because the candidate was not from Chicago.  The candidate was a Harvard law school graduate from Brooklyn whose previous relationship with Chicago consisted of a one-day visit for a wedding in 1982. The citizens of Chicago appreciate that U.S. Attorneys serve at the appointment of the President. The citizens of Chicago realize that U.S. Attorneys offer their resignations when a new President takes office.<br /><br />However, I submit to you as a loyal Obama contributor of money, time and moral support that Patrick Fitzgerald&#39;s resignation should not, cannot, and must not be accepted if we are ever to rid Chicago of the machine politics of old - and give this great city and the nation the &quot;change&quot; we need to believe in.<br /><br />So please join me by spreading the news - the citizens of Chicago want and need Pat Fitzgerald to stay and finish the job!&quot;<br />

		<title>Blagojevich case shows corrupting influence of campaign contributions on legislation</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/about/staff"><strong>Melanie Sloan</strong></a> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/">CREW</a>]: &quot;Federal prosecutors face some difficult hurdles in making a <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/fbi-agents-arrest-illinois-governor-on.php">criminal case against Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich</a>.  The first half of the criminal complaint against the governor involves allegations of a &quot;pay to play&quot; system. Forty of the seventy-six pages in the complaint detail the governor&#39;s efforts to solicit and obtain campaign contributions in exchange for official acts.  The question, given that our campaign finance system allows politicians to solicit campaign contributions from those with business before them, is how did Governor Blagojevich cross the line from legal political horse trading into honest services fraud?<br /><br />Although accepting a contribution to a political campaign can constitute a bribe if a quid pro quo can be demonstrated, Justice Department policy generally has been to prosecute politicians who are personally enriched.  Former Congressman Randy &quot;Duke&quot; Cunningham and newly defeated Congressman William Jefferson, for example, were charged with honest services fraud after personally receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in benefits.  If the Justice Department indicts Governor Blagojevich for trading campaign contributions for official acts, how will this impact members of Congress, who frequently accept contributions from those who have benefitted from legislative actions.  Congressmen John Murtha (D-PA) and Jerry Lewis (R-CA) are two members who routinely insert earmarks into legislation for those who donate to their campaigns.  Are their indictments far behind?<br /><br />Governor Blagojevich&#39;s conduct clearly is despicable, but is it worse than what goes on in our nation&#39;s capitol everyday? Does anyone really believe that campaign contributions bear no relation to legislation?  If so, why do so many lobbyists contribute heavily to the campaigns of those members of Congress who sit on the committees with jurisdiction over their issues?  Perhaps the distinction rests on the fact that Governor Blagojevich was so foolish as to explicitly demand contributions in return for official actions, whereas most politicians are smart enough to leave such matters unstated.  That means the only real difference is the existence of incontrovertible wiretap evidence providing proof positive that the governor traded money for actions.&quot;<br />

		<title>Defense Secretary can aid Guantanamo closure by stopping military commission trials</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/experts/GudeKen.html"><strong>Ken Gude</strong></a> [Associate Director, International Rights and Responsibility Program, <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/">Center for American Progress</a>]: &quot;The news Thursday that Secretary of Defense Robert Gates is <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/us-defense-secretary-orders-pentagon.php">preparing for the closure of Guantanamo</a> early in the Obama administration is more confirmation that the notorious prison&#39;s days are numbered. Yet while it is vitally important that our military leaders plan for every contingency, it is more than a little concerning that Secretary Gates has instructed his current staff to develop a plan &quot;on how to shut it down [and] what would be required specifically to close it and move the detainees from that facility.&quot; There are things Secretary Gates can do right now that would ease the transition to the Obama administration - such as immediately suspend all activity in the military commissions - but having Bush administration officials develop what could be a competing proposal for closing Guantanamo is not one of them.<br /> <br />We know now that Guantanamo is going to be closed. It is good news that Secretary Gates is on board and has begun to prepare the military for that change in policy. If all the Secretary has asked his staff to develop is a plan to handle the logistical challenges of moving the detainees out of Guantanamo, then that is precisely what they should be doing right now and there can be no objection. It does not appear as if that is all that has been requested, however, and that could be a problem.  <br /> <br />Shortly after Gates was selected as President-elect Obama&#39;s Secretary of Defense, he made news by suggesting that legislation would be required to close the prison and specifically mentioned a possible law to prevent released Guantanamo detainees from gaining entry into the United States as asylum seekers, a very odd proposal to say the least. It is clear that Gates&#39; staff believes that it is necessary to pass new laws to govern the continued detention of Guantanamo detainees and that worries many advocates of closing Guantanamo. Ample authority already exists in U.S. and international law to put on trial those detainees accused of crimes, transfer many of the rest to their native or third countries, and in the rare instances when that is not sufficient, continue to hold those who can lawfully be detained as enemy combatants. <br /> <br />Legislation would only be required to establish a new regime of detention and trial, such as the horribly flawed national security court and preventive detention scheme. It beggars belief that the incoming Obama administration would attempt to fix the toxic Guantanamo prison and military commissions system with another new legal experiment. And herein lies the problem. Gates&#39; Bush administration holdovers could put together a proposal to shut down Guantanamo at odds with the plan developed by the incoming Obama team, creating a conflict right out of the gate on an issue sure to receive massive attention early in Obama&#39;s term.<br /> <br />If Gates really wants to help his soon-to-be boss, he can suspend all activity in the military commissions. The fiasco surrounding Khalid Sheikh Mohammed&#39;s hearing a couple of weeks ago could be resolved and the military commission could accept his guilty plea just days before President-elect Obama takes office. If that occurs, the constitutional prohibition on double jeopardy may preclude a trial in U.S. courts. <br /> <br />If Gates is preparing for the closure of Guantanamo he must also be aware that the president-elect prefers trials in U.S. courts rather than the flawed military commissions. The commissions are in no way similar to regular Article III courts and the Military Commissions Act specifically designates the secretary of defense as the convening authority overseeing the entire process. KSM&#39;s offer to confess is not a sincere admission of guilt but rather a cynical ploy to use the illegitimacy of the military commissions to further his political objectives. A trial in an established U.S. court would deny him that chance. Secretary Gates has the power to stop the commissions and he should do so with immediate effect.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="URL of your webpage"><strong><a href="http://www.womenforwomen.org/about-women-for-women/global-management-team.php">Rania Atalla</a></strong></a> [US Executive Director, <a href="http://www.womenforwomen.org">Women for Women International</a>]: &quot;Women in eastern Congo know exactly what it takes to end the conflict: They want the fighting to stop. They want to make a living for their families. And they want the men who are <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/hrw-report-warns-of-congo-war-crimes.php">killing, maiming, and raping</a> to be brought to justice. <br /> <br />Despite the uneasy peace, it is a good sign that government and rebel representatives are meeting this week in Kenya for peace talks. However, we doubt that the negotiations will result in a viable solution unless the suffering of Congolese civilians is fully recognized and addressed. If justice for the survivors is not going to be central to the political settlement the process will be incomplete and people will continue to believe in the rule of gun rather than the rule of law. <br /> <br />The stories of the women we support are brutal illustrations of human rights violations and war crimes that have been going on for years in a climate of total impunity. Marie Jeanne Kabuo was abducted by armed men while working on her fields. She managed to escape when her captors tried to rape her. Antoinette Kabuo, a mother of seven, was beaten up and her husband was kidnapped. Marie Jeanne Kavira saw her younger sister being raped in public. Tabu Tariane lost her uncle and cousin in the recent fighting. Most have been forced to flee their homes more than once and many have survived horrific sexual violence.<br /> <br />Women in this part of Congo have shown a humbling capacity to overcome physical and psychological injuries and rebuild their lives with fairly little assistance. Supporting their recovery benefits their families and communities, because they tend to invest revenues into the education and health of their children, thus contributing to the fabric of their communities. But to complete their transformation from victims to active citizens they also need protection and assurances that perpetrators will not walk freely. <br /> <br />The absence of rule of law in eastern Congo, especially in rural communities, where armed men have created a climate of terror and fear, is one of the largest obstacles to peace in the area. It has undermined the trust of the people in their government and its security forces, which are part of the problem. Violence has become a way of life and the only rule most people know is the rule of the gun. <br /> <br />Last year, the international community declared rape as a weapon of war. Now we must follow through and send a clear sign to perpetrators that their crimes will not go unpunished and victims have an opportunity for justice. We will not achieve this at the negotiation table alone and must also provide rights education for women, men, armed groups, police and youth; livelihood opportunities for women and men to break the cycle of poverty that prevents long-term peace and stability from taking root; and finally, legitimate justice mechanisms that will replace impunity with accountability and provide redress for atrocities.&quot;<br />

		<title>Somali piracy requires balanced solution that deals with root cause</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Dr. Abdullahi Darman</strong> [<a href="http://www.somalilaw.org/">Somali Law Council</a>]: &quot;Somalia has been a failed state since its military dictator was toppled in 1991. As a result it has been missing the ethics of one of the three fundamentals of a state - a functional government.   Although, the paralyzed Somali Marine law specifically punished sea piracy with the minimum of 10 to 20 year of imprisonment. The same goes to whoever violates Somalia&#39;s territorial waters. It was deemed as a crime against the people of Somalia. Old records show that crimes against the crews, goods, and owners of vessels warranted the same punishments, including the confiscation of the vessels and the cargo.<br /><br />The disbanded Somali Coast Guard protected and guarded the people, vessels, crews, and cargos moving across the seas. Specific penal laws, mentioned above, have been applied. Also, regulations about fishing that need specific authorization and concessions within a limited period across Somalia&#39;s territorial waters have been granted to foreign fishing vessels.<br /><br />As a Somali lawyer, I do believe that the sovereignty of the state could not and must not be overtaken or undermined by any power to protect their particular interest, while in the meantime ignoring the real owner of the country - the Somali P\people.<br /><br />I believe that the <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/un-official-calls-for-greater-judicial.php">recent UN resolution</a> is not going to solve the piracy problem in Somalia or anywhere in the world. Remember that piracy flourished during the 16th and 17th centuries wherever governments were unable to protect their own territorial waters. <br /><br />When any legal institution prepares a draft of law, it is important that the law can reach the final goal; it is important to look at its final result and the positive or negative effects it may cause. The resolution needs to look at the root cause of the piracy problem. <br /><br />As a lawyer, I would look to understand what motivates the Somali pirate, something that the world community appears unwilling to do. How about those foreign vessels from European and Asian countries who illegally fish within Somalia&#39;s territorial waters and in the process dump toxic wastes that cause death and disabilities to hundreds of coastal inhabitants on the North East Region of Somalia? Personally, I am against all piracy wherever it may be found. In the case of Somalia Pirates, they have seized cargo ships that carry desperately needed aid for thousands of internally displaced people (IDP).   <br /><br />It does not take much to get the failed state going again. Economic aid can eventually generates job creation.&quot;<br />

		<title>Cone v. Bell highlights need for substance to trump procedure in death penalty cases</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/Bio-PicRCD2.pdf"><strong>Richard C. Dieter</strong></a> [Executive Director, <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org">Death Penalty Information Center</a>]: &quot;Death penalty cases are taking longer to resolve.  In 2007, the average time between sentencing and execution was 12.7 years, the third year in a row in which the time was over 12 years.  Many cases, like <u>Cone v. Bell</u>, which was <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/supreme-court-hears-search-and-seizure.php">recently argued</a> before the U.S. Supreme Court, take much longer to resolve.  Cone is facing execution for a crime committed 28 years ago.  This case illustrates not only the cumbersome nature of capital cases, but also the primary reason for the delay: far too many cases were not conducted fairly at their original trial.<br /><br /><u>Cone v. Bell</u> was argued and decided by the Supreme Court on two previous occasions.  In those earlier cases, the Court upheld Gary Cone&#39;s original conviction and death sentence and reversed lower court decisions that would have given him a new trial.  But now the issue before the Court concerns the very integrity of our justice system, and raises the nagging question of whether a person can be executed even though the state withheld important evidence at trial.  The crucial issue at Mr. Cone&#39;s trial was not his guilt, but whether he was affected by his drug use at the time of the crime, and whether that should be a mitigating factor for the jury considering his sentence.<br /><br />The prosecution argued that Mr. Cone was a drug dealer, not a drug user, and hence there was no reason to spare his life.  Yet the state&#39;s files contained convincing evidence of Cone&#39;s drug use.  State courts dismissed Cone&#39;s claim of prosecutorial misconduct largely on procedural grounds.  Cone had claimed prosecutorial misconduct earlier, before the withheld mitigating evidence was discovered. Since the earlier claim lost on the merits, his new claim was dismissed as repetitive, even though there was new evidence.<br /><br />Even assuming Mr. Cone filed his motions after the deadline, or that the matter had been resolved by state courts, should the federal courts allow a person to be executed where the state itself misled the sentencing jury?  Many cases are lost in our justice system because of procedural problems in the way they were brought.  But when the punishment is death, it seems that substance must triumph over procedure.  And that is why the death penalty will always be cumbersome, expensive, and frustrating to all involved.&quot;<br />

		<title>Cone death penalty case shows priority of authorities is really to protect convictions</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Julien Ball</strong> [Administrative Coordinator, <a href="http://nodeathpenalty.org/content/index.php">Campaign to End the Death Penalty</a>]: &quot;The State of Tennessee wants to execute Gary Cone on a technicality. It is beyond dispute that the prosecution withheld crucial evidence in the case. Cone argued that he suffered from amphetamine psychosis when he committed a double murder and should be spared the death penalty. The prosecution withheld a witness statement confirming Cone&#39;s drug use, yet called his claim of drug addiction &quot;baloney.&quot; Now, because he did not introduce evidence of which he had no knowledge earlier in the appeals process, the State claims that his grounds for appeal are &quot;procedurally defaulted.&quot; In other words, the State of Tennessee would rather send a man to his death than allow a remedy to its own misconduct.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the prosecution is not exclusively to blame for this miscarriage of justice. A number of courts have ruled against Cone, forcing the U.S. Supreme Court to <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/supreme-court-hears-search-and-seizure.php">hear oral arguments</a> on the case last week. Sadly, the court system often values finality over fairness. Georgia death row prisoner Troy Davis, for example, has received three execution dates because no court will admit evidence from seven witnesses who have recanted their testimony. In Chicago, Illinois, dozens of men languish in Illinois prisons because Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan will not initiate evidentiary hearings for prisoners with strong evidence of electro-shock, suffocation and beatings at the hands of Chicago police. The priority for too many police, prosecutors and judges is to protect the convictions that they and their colleagues helped secure, not to ensure justice. A criminal justice system that operates in this fashion is unfit to decide who lives and who dies. The time to abolish the death penalty is long overdue.&quot;<br />

		<title>SOFA highlights US obligation to prevent detainee transfers to uninspected facilities</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Joseph Logan</strong> and <strong>Michael Wahid Hanna</strong> [Researcher, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/middle-east/n-africa">Middle East and North Africa division</a> of <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a>; Program Officer at <a href="http://www.tcf.org/">The Century Foundation</a>]: &quot;On January 1, 2009, the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/iraq/SE_SOFA.pdf">US-Iraq Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA)</a> [text, PDF] will take effect, establishing a legal basis for the continuing US military presence in Iraq. The agreement also sets a framework for the drawdown of US forces - the issue, understandably, of greatest interest in the United States. But many of the agreement&#39;s provisions remain unclear, particularly for Iraqi and other detainees in US military custody.  <br /><br />Prior to the SOFA, the US and other members of the Multinational Force could detain persons in Iraq under the authority of Security Council Resolution 1546 and ensuing resolutions, which expire at the end of 2008.  The SOFA acknowledges Iraqi jurisdiction over some 15,000 persons still in US military detention, and stipulates that US forces transfer custody of detainees to Iraqi authorities upon the request of the Iraqi government. <br /><br />The implementation of this provision could conflict with US obligations under international law, specifically the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/h_cat39.htm">Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</a>, which prohibits state parties from turning over any individual to another state &quot;where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.&quot; In conducting research for the recent Human Rights Watch <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2008/12/14/quality-justice-0">report on the Central Criminal Court of Iraq</a>, we <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/rights-group-claims-iraq-courts-fail-to.php">found credible allegations</a> of torture and other mistreatment during initial detention and interrogation by Iraqi police and military forces. While no such incidents of abuse were documented following transfer of their cases of the Central Criminal Court, recent history and the multiplicity of detaining institutions demand that the US military heed the very real risk of torture in Iraqi custody.<br /><br />US and Iraqi officials have indicated the transfer of jurisdiction over those detainees will not amount to immediate physical transfer. Both sides acknowledge Iraq&#39;s judicial system and detention facilities cannot now handle the cases they have, let alone an influx of new ones. The first stage of the effective transfer of jurisdiction would entail Iraqi review of the detainees&#39; cases, with an eye toward possible criminal prosecution in Iraqi courts. It is as yet unclear how many cases will involve an assertion of physical custody, and when the Iraqi authorities could object to releases the US military may propose unilaterally. In fact, as with many other aspects of the SOFA, the actual mechanisms for initiating review, transfer or release have yet to be spelled out. <br /><br />As that process of review unfolds, the obligation of the United States is unchanged: do not transfer detainees where they are in danger of being tortured. As a practical step toward meeting that obligation, the US government should verify conditions in Iraqi facilities that may receive detainees through regular and credible inspection of those facilities, in coordination with Iraqi authorities and impartial and independent international observers who report their findings publicly.&quot;<br />

		<title>Hong Kong ruling on prisoner voting rights is part of the modern liberal trend</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Pui-yin Lo </strong> [Deputy Chairman, Special Committee on Constitutional Affairs and Human Rights, <a href="http://www.hkba.org/">Hong Kong Bar Association</a>]: &quot;The judgment of Mr. Justice Andrew Cheung of the Hong Kong Court of First Instance on December 8, 2008, <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/hong-kong-court-rules-inmates-have.php ">held that</a>: <blockquote>&quot;the disenfranchisement provisions relating to voting and registration contravene the right to vote constitutionally guaranteed under article 26 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and article 21 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights, so far as they affect prisoners (and those convicted persons who have been sentenced to...imprisonment, and who have not served the sentences or received a free pardon)&quot;</blockquote>It was not unexpected. The court was assisted in reaching the ruling by jurisprudence on the same topic of the top national courts in Australia, Canada and South Africa, as well as the European Court of Human Rights. Reference was also made to the modern trend towards more liberal treatment of prisoners in terms of voting rights noted in the ACLU&#39;s 2006 analysis of &quot;felony disenfranchisement&quot; of various jurisdictions around the globe. <br /><br />Given that the sweeping disenfranchisement provisions in Hong Kong cover a significant portion of the prison population that are serving a term of imprisonment of 6 months or less, and disable a person&#39;s right to vote so long as she is serving a term of imprisonment on election day - taking no account of the expected date of release of a prisoner - cannot be justified under the proportionality test for determining whether they constitute an unreasonable restriction to the important political right of voting. The position of persons remanded in custody pending trial is even more clear: Their right to vote is not affected by the disenfranchisement provisions, but they cannot exercise their right because of lack of access to a polling booth.<br /><br />The sad fact coming out of this judgment is that it disclosed inertia on the part of executive authorities, the statutory Electoral Affairs Commission that oversees elections, as well as the legislature in addressing the topic, even though electoral legislation in Hong Kong had been frequently amended in the last few decades to take account of the development of the political system. It will take strategic litigation by prisoners assisted by NGOs as well as publicly funded legal aid to put the topic squarely on the policy agenda. <br /><br />The Hong Kong Government has indicated that the process of legislative amendments in light of this judgment will begin in early 2009 with a consultation document. This move is in the right direction, but it is hoped that the process will not get mired in political debates and implementation detail arguments.&quot;<br />

The provision of medically supervised heroin injection coupled with psychological support and other treatments has also seen lives stabilized and improved to the point where some of the formerly unemployed addicts have even been able to find and keep jobs. <br /><br />To reach the same level in the UK as the Swiss program would require the Department of Health to expand the program to around 10,000 people out of the 200,000 in treatment here. However, the costs of doing so would pale into insignificance given the typical heroin addict is committing 400-500 crimes per year to fund their street-drug habit, and that no one ever died from an overdose or contracted HIV at a Swiss clinic. <br /><br />In fact, as a (still suppressed) UK Government <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/home-office-backs-heroin-on-the-nhs-in-effort-to-cut-crime-437803.html">Home Office report</a> from 2007 said: &quot;Given the failure of supply-side interventions to have any significant effect on the drugs market, it is worth considering a greater management of the market by wider rolling out of injectable heroin prescription for highly dependent users through the NHS.&quot; <br /><br />So why hasn&#39;t the Government done so? <br /><br />Maybe because it wouldn&#39;t score cheap &quot;tough on drugs&quot; political points. Maybe because it would underline just a little too clearly that a move from prohibition to full regulation and control would work. We should not forget that the need to prescribe heroin in this way, arises out of the overarching system of prohibition that maximizes harms for those who become dependent on street heroin in the first place.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.nesl.edu/students/full_time.cfm?id=50&bfs=1">Micah Berman</a> of New England School of Law says that by bringing attention to the issue of "light" and "low tar" cigarettes, the US Supreme Court&#39;s ruling in <em>Altria v. Good</em> may prompt state attorneys general to finally force an end to this long-running public health deception...  <br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/micahberman.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->L<odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->ast Monday, the US Supreme Court ruled in <em>Altria v. Good</em> that smokers of "light" cigarettes can proceed with their lawsuit against Altria, the parent company of Philip Morris.  The lawsuit, filed as a class action in Maine, alleges that Philip Morris violated the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act (MUTPA) by suggesting to consumers that "light" and "low tar" cigarettes were less dangerous than regular cigarettes, despite the company's knowledge to the contrary.  The trial court granted summary judgment for Altria, finding that the claims ware preempted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (FCLAA), the law requiring warning labels on cigarette packages.  But by a 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court held that although the FCLAA preempts failure to warn claims against cigarette manufacturers, it does not foreclose state law fraud claims.  <br /><br /> Much of the initial commentary about <em>Good</em> has focused on whether the decision signals a retreat from the Supreme Court's broad view of federal preemption. But what of the merits of the underlying claims?  Does the <em>Good</em> decision suggest that cigarette companies are likely to face a new wave of lawsuits and adverse judgments?  Is there a public health litigation strategy that can successfully counter the tobacco industry's misleading promotion of "light" cigarettes?<br /><br /> As a factual matter, the plaintiffs are on solid footing.  There is no question that "light" cigarettes are just as harmful as other cigarettes, primarily because smokers "compensate" for lower levels of nicotine by smoking more and inhaling more deeply. Internal tobacco company documents show that the companies have known since at least the 1970s that their ads for "light" and "low tar" products deceived consumers into mistakenly believing these products were less harmful.  <br /><br /> But these facts are not the end of the story.  Overall, the plaintiffs must overcome numerous obstacles to prevail on their claim, and the odds are heavily stacked against them.  <br /><br />First, the trial judge must now rule on the plaintiffs' motion for class action certification.  Courts have been wary of certifying class actions in similar cases, since issues of individual reliance and damages tend to overwhelm common questions.  A recent Second Circuit decision (<em>McLaughlin v. American Tobacco</em>) decertified a "lights"-related class action, finding that "numerous issues in this case are not susceptible to generalized proof."  Without class action certification, it may be prohibitively expensive for individual plaintiffs to proceed with their lawsuits.  <br /><br />Secondly, although the Supreme Court held that the Federal Trade Commission's sanctioning of the tobacco industry's nicotine and tar testing method did not preempt the plaintiffs' claims, Philip Morris can still assert that its reliance on FTC's guidance protects it from liability under a statutory exemption in the MUTPA.  The MUTPA includes an exemption for actions that are "authorized" or "permitted" by a federal agency, and Philip Morris has successfully used similar statutory language as a defense to "lights"-related suits in other states.  Most notably, such an exemption was the basis for the Illinois Supreme Court overturning a $10.1 billion jury verdict against Philip Morris in 2005.  <br /><br /> More generally, Philip Morris is known for its "scorched earth" litigation tactics, its willingness to appeal any adverse verdicts, and its efforts to shift the focus to the plaintiffs' conduct.  Facing such an adversary, the odds of the Maine plaintiffs ultimately prevailing on their claims and withstanding the inevitable appeals are slim.<br /><br /> But is there another way to address the public health problem highlighted in <em>Good</em>?  Today, the vast majority of cigarettes purchased in the United States are "light" or "low tar," and in many cases, these products are purchased because of the mistaken belief that they are substantially safer than regular cigarettes.  If individual lawsuits are unable to stop the tobacco companies from deceptively marketing these products, who can?  <br /><br />  The state attorneys general are one possibility.  As part of the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) with the states, the tobacco companies pledged that they would stop misrepresenting the health effects of their products.  Nonetheless, they have continued to advertise popular brands as &quot;light&quot; and &quot;low tar,&quot; despite their knowledge that these terms are misleading.  <br /><br />The state AGs could bring an MSA enforcement action against Philip Morris and the other tobacco companies seeking to prohibit the use of the terms "light" and "low tar."  The strongest argument against such action would be that the "light" and "low tar" cigarettes were already a sizable portion of the cigarette market in 1998, and if the MSA had intended to prohibit these products, it would have done so much more explicitly.  This argument, however, fails to recognize the extent to which new evidence has emerged since 1998 demonstrating the tobacco companies' knowledge that their promotion of "light" and "low tar" cigarettes was misleading consumers.  Moreover, there is no grandfathering provision in the MSA that permits tobacco companies to mislead consumers simply because the misrepresentation at issue preceded the settlement agreement.  Though the MSA enforcement process is time-consuming and cumbersome, concerted action by state AGs could put a spotlight on this issue and push tobacco companies towards discontinuing the use of "light" and "low tar" as product descriptors.<br /> <br />There are two other potential, but less promising ways in which this issue could be addressed.  First, a federal government lawsuit against the tobacco industry resulted in a 2006 decision by D.C. District Court Judge Gladys Kessler ordering the tobacco companies to stop labeling their products as "light" and "low tar." It is possible that the D.C. Circuit Court will uphold Judge Kessler's order (it was stayed on appeal), but most observers suspect it will not.  Second, there is pending legislation in Congress that would prohibit the use of the terms "light" and "low tar."  The prospects of such legislation may have increased with the recent election, but it faces strong opposition from tobacco-state senators and is unlikely to be high to Congress's long to-do list. <br /><br />By itself, the decision in <em>Good</em> may do little to restrain the tobacco industry's deceptive marketing practices.  But by bringing attention to the issue of "light" and "low tar" cigarettes, it may prompt the state AGs to finally force an end to this long-running deception.  It is up to the states, but there may well be a litigation strategy that can put out the "lights."<br />   <br /><br /><em>Micah Berman is an assistant professor at New England School of Law, Boston and previously directed the Tobacco Public Policy Center in Columbus, Ohio. </em><br />

		<title>India-Pakistan Extraditions After the Mumbai Attacks</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist Materneau Chrispin, PhD candidate in International Law at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland, says that Pakistan&#39;s refusal to extradite two of its citizens to India where they are wanted in connection with the November terrorist attacks on hotels in Mumbai may be valid under international law if Pakistan commits to prosecuting them itself....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/materneauchrispin.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->T<odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->ensions have been brewing between India and Pakistan following the murderous terrorist attacks that took place in Mumbai on November 26-29, 2008. The situation has escalated lately due to a demand put forward by India that Pakistan extradite or otherwise deliver two of its nationals suspected of involvement in those attacks. Pakistan has been refusing to give in to India's demand, claiming its right to have the alleged terrorists tried by its own courts. While India's demand is understandable, Pakistan's refusal is not lacking legitimacy under pertinent international law rules that govern the subject of extradition.<br /><br />Indeed, the crux of the matter is whether there exists an absolute obligation under international law binding the requested State to defer to an extradition demand that has been put to it by a requesting State. In other words, does the requested State have an unconditional duty to extradite upon a request to do so? The obligation to extradite under international law is generally construed in accordance with the principle <em>aut dedere aut judicare</em> (extradite or prosecute). The latter means that any State facing an extradition request is obligated either to acquiesce to it or to institute criminal proceedings against the individual(s) whose extradition is sought. <br /><br />This principle is contained in various international instruments on the matter of extradition or cooperation for the fight against terrorism. Many are binding on both India and Pakistan. This is the case of some important conventions in the field of terrorism such as the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 14 December 1973 (article 3.2); the International Convention against the Taking of Hostages, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 17 December 1979 (article 5.2); the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 15 December 1997 (article 6.4) or the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 9 December 1999 (article 7.4. Pakistan is not party to this convention). <br /><br />Some similar regional instruments feature the same reference to the aut dedere aut judicare principle. Among them, the SAARC Regional Convention on Suppression of Terrorism, signed in Kathmandu, Nepal on November 4, 1987, is of particular relevance (particularly its article IV). It was drafted in the framework of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, in which India and Pakistan are members and is thus binding on both countries. <br /><br />Equally, several of the core resolutions adopted by the UN Security Council in the fight against terrorism also make explicit references to the <em>aut dedere aut judicare</em> principle while laying out the main obligations of States to combat terrorist activities. This is true for Resolution 1456 (2003) of January 20, 2003 or Resolution 1624 of September 14, 2005. Thus it can be contended that this principle is well grounded in international law and should be the starting point in any legal analysis of this issue. However, its exact status remains a topic of debate among scholars. Some contend that it has achieved the status of customary international law and can even be regarded as a <em>jus cogens</em> norm (Bassiouni, for instance holds such view), while others are reluctant to go that far and consider the principle as being only one of the general principles of international law. <br /><br />One of the questions scholars have concerned themselves with as regards the nature and scope of this principle, revolves around the issue whether the two elements of the principle are distinct, separate (<em>dedere</em> on the one side and <em>judicare</em> on the other) or are to be construed as an alternative, whereby it is the unwillingness to perform one (<em>dedere</em>) that triggers the other (<em>judicare</em>). The other issue has been to determine whether some form of hierarchy exists between the two. Although the debate is still open on these issues, as reflected, among others, in the Second Report of Mr. Zdzislaw Galicki, Special Rapporteur of the International Law Commission (ILC) on the <em>aut dedere aut judicare</em> principle, submitted to the Commission at its 2945th to 2947th meetings, from 31 July to 3 August 2007, it is safe to affirm that no authoritative basis can be invoked in current international law to substantiate a claim of primacy of one of the two elements of the principle.<br /><br />Against this background, Pakistan would be right to assert that it has no obligation to extradite the requested individuals to India if it commits itself to prosecute them in its own criminal jurisdictions. This position is even reinforced by the fact that the alleged terrorists whose extradition is requested by India are nationals of Pakistan. Indeed, some international instruments as well as state practice in this field show that the fact that the individuals to be extradited are nationals of the custodial State can be a legitimate ground to refuse extradition. <br /><br />If the standoff between the two countries is analyzed from the perspective of the legal bases for States to claim jurisdiction over certain crimes and their perpetrators, the conclusions are not substantially different. There exist four bases for claiming jurisdiction: the active and the passive personality principles, the principle of territoriality and finally the principle of universal jurisdiction. India has a clearly lawful claim of jurisdiction under the passive personality principle, since most of the victims of the terrorist attacks were Indians nationals. Pakistan, conversely, has a similar lawful claim under the active personality principle, because the alleged perpetrators sought by India are its nationals. Since there is once again no hierarchy between these two principles, Pakistan seems to hold a slight advantage for it has custody of the presumed criminals.<br /><br />Under the principle of territoriality, the situation remains ambiguous. Indeed the latter principle can be invoked not only by the State on the territory of which the crime effectively took place, but also by a State where such crime has been planned and organized. Thus both India and Pakistan could claim jurisdiction over the crime(s). Again, Pakistan can argue an additional right flowing from the fact that the alleged perpetrators are also presumed to be members of terrorist groups or organizations based on its territory. Moreover, the planning and organization of those attacks against India are criminal offences of their own under Pakistani law, which would give an additional title to Pakistan to exercise its jurisdiction over those acts and the terrorist attacks in Mumbai.<br /><br />One way for India to solidify its claim would be to show conclusive evidence that Pakistan would be unable to effectively prosecute the crimes, because its judicial system does not offer the minimal guarantees required by the rule of law. However considering that Pakistan has consistently handled criminal proceedings a
gainst terrorist groups and activities, it would not be easy for India to build an overwhelming case resting on such argument.<br />     <br /><br /><em>Materneau Chrispin is a PhD candidate in International Law at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the eve of a long-anticipated ruling in the Bagosora &quot;Military I&quot; genocide trial, JURIST Special Guest Columnist Roland Amoussouga, Spokesperson and Senior Legal Adviser at the <a href="http://69.94.11.53/">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR), reviews the Tribunal&#39;s challenges and achievements as it moves towards completion of its mandate...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/rolandamoussouga.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>wo judgements are scheduled for this week at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). One them is the famous 'Military I' Trial, jointly trying Col. Theoneste Bagosora, former Director de Cabinet in the Ministry of Defence, Lt- Col Anatole Nsengiyumva, former Commander of the FAR in Gisenyi prefecture, Major Aloys Ntabakuze, former Commander of the elite Para-Commando Battalion in FAR, and Brigedier-General Gratien Kabiligi, former Chief of Military Operations in FAR. The trial began on 2 April 2002. The other judgement is in the case of Protais Zigiranyirazo, who was brother-in-law of former President Habyarimana and a powerful businessman as well as an alleged member of the powerful 'Akazu' group. His trial opened on 3 October 2005. <br /><br />The ICTR Judicial Calendar for 2009 is indicative and represents the work plan which it aims to follow. The Tribunal has already established a judicially verified record of the crime of genocide and its causes which can support the reconciliation and peace process. Attention will now be given to limiting the scope of the trials to what is relevant to the crimes in the indictments. <br /><br />The Tribunal is also in the process of establishing improved pre-trial management mechanisms to further shorten the delays to the extent this is compatible with the requirements of a fair trial. No dates are fixed for delivery of judgements, as the length of the judgement drafting process is difficult to predict in particular in the complex multi-accused trials. However, the Tribunal is developing additional mechanisms for shortening delays in this phase of the trial. <br /><br />The ICTR is in the process of submitting additional documents on the work load of judges and on their planned date of resignation, which clearly stress an urgent need for additional (four) <em>ad litem</em> judges to be appointed by the Secretary-General. Those judges are essential to cover the up to ten new cases which will be before the Tribunal in 2009, as seven of the current permanent and <em>ad litem</em> judges will have resigned or are not available to take on new cases.<br /><br /><strong>Summary of Sentences Imposed as of 2 December 2008</strong><br /><br />The ICTR&#39;s convicts have been sentenced to prison for terms ranging from a minimum of 9 months (for a witness who gave a false testimony) and from 6 years to life imprisonment for grave violations of international humanitarian law. Thirteen convicts have been sentenced to life imprisonment (1 was reduced to 35 years for violation of the convict's rights and another was reduced to 45 years on appeal). <br /><br /><strong>Transfer of Prisoners</strong><br /><br />Acting on decisions rendered on 3 November 2008 and 5 December 2008 on the enforcement of sentences by the President of the ICTR, in accordance with Article 26 of the Statute and Rule 103 (A) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, the ICTR has recently transferred on Wednesday 3 December 2008 and Sunday 7 December 2008 to the Republic of Mali, nine (9) convicted persons namely, Mr. Laurent Semanza, Mr. Jean de Dieu Kamuhanda, Mr. Samuel Imanishimwe, Mr. Mikaeli (MIKA) Muhimana, Mr. Hassan Ngeze, Mr. Ferdinand Nahimana, Mr. Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, Mr. Paul Bisengimana and Mr. Eliezer Niyitegeka. At present, 15 ICTR convicted persons are serving their sentences in Mali.  Additional convicted persons are expected to also be soon transferred to the designated State (s) of the enforcement of their sentences. They are currently nine more convicted persons awaiting transfer.   <br /><br /><strong>Relocating Acquitted and Released Prisoners</strong><br /><br />The ICTR's experience over the last fourteen years has shown that international criminal justice dispensation can only be successful if there is political will and a clear demonstration of cooperation from member States in addressing challenges. From its inception until today, the ICTR still encounters several obstacles in the relocation of acquitted persons and released prisoners. Indeed, those challenges are made critical by the absence of any specific provisions in the ICTR Statute that could have directly placed an express obligation on the shoulders of member States to assist the Tribunal in the relocation of the protected acquitted persons and the released prisoners. <br /><br />The situation of acquitted persons before the Tribunal is one of the most critical challenges that ought to be absolutely addressed. It is worth noting that since its inception up to date, five persons have been acquitted by the ICTR:<blockquote>a) Mr. Ignace Bagilishema, acquitted by the Trial Chamber on 7 June 2001 and his acquittal was confirmed by the Appeals Chamber on 3 July 2002;<br />b) Mr. Emmanuel Bagambiki, acquitted by the Trial Chamber on 25 February 2004 and his acquittal was confirmed by the Appeals Chamber on 8 February 2006; <br />c) Mr. Andr&Atilde;&copy; Ntagerura, acquitted by the Trial Chamber on 25 February 2004 and his acquittal was confirmed by the  Appeals Chamber on 8 February 2006;<br />d) Mr. Jean Mpambara, acquitted on 12 September 2006; No appeal was lodged; and<br />e) Mr. Andr&Atilde;&copy; Rwamakuba acquitted on 20 September 2006 and no appeal was filed.</blockquote>The ICTR Registrar held extensive bilateral negotiations with the French authorities with the support of their Defence counsel, which have enabled both Mr. Bagilishema and Mr. Mpambara to be relocated to France where they were reunited with their respective families. After a protracted process involving bilateral negotiations and court proceedings initiated by the Counsel for Mr. Bagambiki in Belgium, Mr. Rwamakuba and Mr. Bagambiki have finally been relocated to Switzerland and Belgium respectively, where they also joined their families. <br /><br />Despite some lengthy and arduous bilateral negotiations with some member States and the UNHCR, the Registrar has not yet been able to find a country for Mr. Ntagerura. As a result, Mr. Ntagerura is still under the care of the ICTR. The situation of Mr. Ntagerura is a vivid illustration of the complexity of the challenges that are facing the Registry in complying with the directions given by the ICTR Judges.<br /><br />On 26 February 2004, Trial Chamber III of the ICTR ordered the immediate release of Mr. Andr&Atilde;&copy; Ntagerura following his acquittal on 25 February 2004. Paragraph IV of the pronouncement of the Trial Chamber's decision reads, inter alia, as follows:<blockquote>DIRECTS the Registrar to release immediately Andr&Atilde;&copy; Ntagerura &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;.when satisfied that &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;, the necessary practical arrangements have been made including required consultations with the relevant national and international authorities as well as any other organization deemed relevant for such practical arrangements to be made, in the interim, the Registrar is requested to ensure that Andr&Atilde;&copy;&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;[is] place in a safe house'.</blockquote>The Trial Chamber further subjected the immediate release of Mr. Andr&Atilde;&copy; Ntagerura to the fulfillment of other conditions including the provision of an address where he will reside. The Defence Counsel of Mr. Ntagerura, on his own, actively endeavored to find a place for his client and moved to request the Registrar, in view of the precariousness of the security situation of his client, that an asylum be gra
nted to him in Tanzania pending his transfer to the country in which he will choose to reside.<br /><br />Finally, the ICTR Registry managed to get the support and cooperation of the Tanzanian Government which agreed in May 2004 to grant temporary asylum in the country to Mr. Ntagerura pending his relocation to a third country. The Government asked to be kept informed of any subsequent developments with regard to any re-settlement formalities as soon as they are completed. It is therefore under those special conditions that Mr. Ntagerura has been living temporarily in Tanzania under the care of the ICTR. Mr. Ntagerura proceeded to petition the Tribunal to compel Canada to receive him.  The Appeal Chamber recently disposed of the matter on 18 November 2008, and requested the Registrar to seize the UNHCR in order to seek its cooperation. <br /><br />The case of Ntagerura clearly illustrates the challenges facing the ICTR as well as any accused person who is acquitted of any violations of international humanitarian law for which the ICTR is competent. These challenges are critical in the event that the acquitted person does not wish to return to Rwanda or to the country of his arrest. Neither the ICTR Statute nor its Rules of Procedure and Evidence deal with such situations, except to place a heavy burden on the shoulders of the Registry, which bears the responsibility for the safety and security of accused persons and acquitted persons while they are before the Tribunal, under its custody, or protective care. It is gainsaying that, at this point in time, the ICTR acquitted persons are not immune from being subjected to the application of the ''exclusion clauses'' by the UNHCR, which requires careful and assiduous examination. This situation gives rise to legitimate questions as to the actual consideration and legal weight that are given to ICTR acquittal decisions by all external stakeholders including member States and UN Agencies. The lack of political willingness and the absence of positive obligations on the member States in the ICTR statutory provisions render the challenges quite daunting.<br /><br />In order to enforce the sentences handed down by the ICTR, the United Nations, up to date, has concluded seven separate Agreements with the following States: <br /><br />a) The Republic of Mali on 12 February 1999;<br />b) The Republic of Benin on 18 August 1999;<br />c) The Kingdom of Swaziland on 30 August 2000;<br />d) The Republic of France on 14 March 2003;<br />e) The Republic of Italy on 17 March 2004; <br />f)  The Republic of Sweden on 27 April 2004; and<br />g) The Republic of Rwanda on 4 March 2008.<br /><br />Termination of enforcement of the ICTR as per those Agreements should occur in the following circumstances:<br /><br />a) When the sentence has been completed;<br />b) Upon pardon of the convicted  person or  upon completion of the sentence as commuted in accordance with the provision of those Agreements;<br />c) Following a decision of the Tribunal, as provided for in the provision of the Agreements;<br />d) Upon the demise of the convicted person.<br /><br />The Tribunal also may, at any time, decide to request the termination of the enforcement of the sentence in a given State and transfer the convicted person to another State or to the Tribunal for the remaining of the sentence.<br /><br />So far, two ICTR prisoners have been released in Arusha after having served heir sentences at the United Nations Detention Facility. They were not transferred to other states for the enforcement of their sentences. They are as follows:  <br /><br />- Elizephan Ntakirutimana, (sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment); and<br />- Mr. Vincent Rutaganira (sentenced to 6 years of imprisonment).  <br /><br />Three more prisoners are expected to be released in December 2008, July and August 2009. One of them has already been transferred to Italy where he is serving his sentence while the other two are still in Arusha awaiting their transfer to the States of enforcement of their sentences.<br /><br />For the prisoner who is in Italy, it is expected that his/her relocation after release will not be an issue for the ICTR. However, the experience so far gathered by the ICTR, has shown that upon release of the first prisoners in Arusha, they both requested the ICTR to assist them to relocate to third countries. <br /><br />Until now, the ICTR has yet to be successful in negotiating with member States for their relocation to third countries. It is worth mentioning that the member States that have been approached by the ICTR responded negatively to its request. The ICTR has, however, provided accommodation to the released prisoners pending their relocation. <br /><br />In accordance with the Agreements concluded with the various States, unless the parties agree otherwise, the Tribunal is to bear the expenses related to the repatriation or return of the convicted person upon completion of his/her sentence to Rwanda or another country where he/she is lawfully resident. The current policy of the ICTR does impose an obligation on the Registry to find a State for a released prisoner, who is free of his movement. The Registry may only assist financially and administratively the released prisoner in getting travel documents and securing fund for his transportation to the relocation State of his own choosing, if and when necessary. <br /><br />There is an expectation that the individual member States of the United Nations will enforce orders and judgements of the ICTR. Thus, under the Host Country Agreement that ICTR has concluded with the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania, it is expressly provided that on conviction the person shall be sent out of Tanzania as soon as practicable.<br /><br />Article 26 of the ICTR Statute provides as follows:<blockquote>Imprisonment shall be served in Rwanda or any of the States on a list of States which have indicated to the Security Council of their willingness to accept convicted persons, as designated by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.  Such imprisonment shall be in accordance with the applicable law of the State concerned, subject to the supervision of the International Tribunal for Rwanda.</blockquote>The important point to be noted in this Article is that the imprisonment is served in accordance with the applicable law of the State concerned. This means that the nature of imprisonment for persons convicted of the same offence and sentenced to imprisonment for the same period will vary in accordance with the laws of imprisonment of the State where such imprisonment will be served.  <br /><br />The second point to observe is that the overall supervision of the convicted person serving sentence will remain with the Tribunal or a body designated by it or by the Security Council (after the closure of the ICTR). At present, one acquitted person is still under the care and protection of the Tribunal in Tanzania for an unforeseeable future while awaiting transfer to a state willing to receive it. The ICTR continues its best efforts to find suitable countries for the relocation of protected witnesses and released prisoners. <br /><br />The current situation and the similar foreseeable situation of future acquitted persons and released prisoners who have or would have completed their sentences are important challenges that must be urgently addressed as the Tribunal moves forward to the closure of its operations. <br /><br /><strong>The ICTR: Key Achievements</strong><br /><br />Whatever system is employed to measure the success of the venture, there can be no doubt that peace has been restored and maintained in Rwanda, that there is a credible and ongoing process of national reconciliation, that many of the violations have been addressed and that some have been effectively redressed. Of course work remains to be done, and circumstances have given the Tribunal new tasks. But there can be no doubt that the Tribunal has been a central and stabilising instrument that has made major and lasting contributions to the establishment of international justice, peace and reconciliation that currently prevai
l in the region.<br /><br />Among the most basic and most important of the Tribunal's achievements has been the accumulation of an indisputable historical record, including testimony of witnesses, testimony of victims, testimony of accused, documentary evidence, video recordings and audio recordings.  <br /><br />This record was invaluable to the Appeals Chamber when it discredited and rejected the theory that genocide and widespread or systematic attacks against civil population had not actually occurred in Rwanda in 1994. In a nutshell, the Tribunal has established an important judicially verified factual record of these atrocities. The importance and value of that record and the archival collections of the Tribunal to national, regional and international history should not be underestimated. They have and will continue to contribute to the peace and reconciliation process in Rwanda and in Great Lakes region and offer a guide for addressing similar violations of international humanitarian law in other areas of the world. <br /><br />The Tribunal, and its twin sister ICTY, have been the modern pioneers of a credible international criminal justice system. They have contributed greatly to the development of substantive international criminal law and procedure. The 14 years of our activity have produced a substantial body of jurisprudence, including the definitions of the elements of the crime of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, as well as forms of responsibility, such as superior responsibility. Other international tribunals and courts will have a well established foundation on which to build. The work of the Tribunal has transformed the resolutions, treaties and conventions emanating from the United Nations, into practical and effective tools to be used by the international criminal justice system in its efforts to end to mass atrocities,<br /><br />The Tribunal had also fostered national compliance with international obligations in the human rights sphere. For example, Rwanda has already abolished death penalty in order to facilitate the transfer of cases to its jurisdiction. The Trial Chamber's decision not to transfer the Munyakazi case to Rwanda was recently upheld by the Appeals Chamber. The reasons given in the appellate judgment could lead to even further reforms, including a clarification of the applicable punishment for those transferred to Rwanda, the exclusion of life imprisonment in solitary confinement and strengthening the witness protection program. The referral proceedings have also put the spotlight on other countries that need to adopt domestic legislation implementing the human rights treaties and conventions to which they are parties. The Tribunal's influence, therefore, extends well beyond the Great Lakes region, spreading what are arguably the highest ideals of this body&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;its international standards of human rights&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;transforming them from noble aspirations into enforceable legislation and impartial judicial processes.<br /><br />It is equally worth noting that in spite of all the challenges the Tribunal went through; it has however managed to apprehend 79 persons out of 92 persons who were indicted by its Prosecutor. 15 former Ministers (including the former Prime Minister) of the 19 member-Rwandan Interim Government during the period of the genocide have been arrested. The ICTR notably gained custody of numerous top political and military, religious, business, youth, militia and civil society leaders. These include the former foreign and defence ministers, the former Chief of Staff of the Rwandan Army and Mr. Jean Kambanda, the former Prime Minister, who became the first former head of government to be convicted for Genocide and crimes against humanity. The success of the ICTR in gaining custody of most of the indicted persons of these calibres, including those in highest positions of responsibility throughout the national administrative provinces, goes well beyond the level of failure expected by Tribunal's sceptics. <br /><br />The impressive ICTR case law includes, inter alia, the following:<br /><br />Through its first judgment rendered on 2 September 1998 in the case of Prosecutor v. Jean-Paul Akayesu (Case No. ICTR-96-4-T), the ICTR became the first International Tribunal to interpret the definition of genocide set forth in the 1948 Geneva Conventions. The Akayesu jurisprudence is a particularly important source for both the definition and application of the legal ingredients for the criminal offence of genocide. This case also set out very important legal doctrines and tests for assessing components of genocide crimes. The Akayesu judgment was also groundbreaking for its finding that rape may comprise an act of genocide. Since that decision, the Tribunal has convicted at least three other accused of rape.<br /><br />The ICTR was also the first International Tribunal since the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg (1946) to hand down a judgment against a head of government. The Former Prime Minister of Rwanda, Jean Kambanda, was convicted for genocide and sentenced to life in prison, thus reaffirming the principle that no individual enjoys impunity for such crimes on account of their official position. The case, Prosecutor v. Kambanda, was decided by Trial Chamber I, on 4 September 1998. The Kambanda case was also the first judgment where a head of government pleaded guilty to genocide.<br /><br />In the "Media Case", the Tribunal set the principle that those who use the media for inciting the public to commit genocide can be punished for their communication which amounts to hate speech and persecution as a crime against humanity. This is the first contemporary judgment to examine the role of the media in the context of inciting the public to commit crimes. This important case addresses the boundary between the rights guaranteed under international law to freedom of expression and incitement to genocide. The Media Case also set legal precedence for determining conspiracy to commit genocide. The Tribunal established that through personal collaboration as well as interaction among institutions within their control, the convicts were guilty of conspiracy to commit genocide.  <br /><br />The ICTR Appeals Chamber on 16 June 2006 issued a decision that the Trial Chambers must take judicial notice that between 6 April 1994 and 17 July 1994 there was genocide in Rwanda against the Tutsi ethnic group. The decision was delivered by the Appeals Chamber on the Prosecutor&#39;s Appeal on Judicial Notice in the trial of Prosecutor v. Karemera, Ngirumpatse and Nzirorera, ICTR-98-44-AR73 (C). Judicial notice of the genocide means that the fact of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda is to be taken as established beyond any dispute and do not require any further proof. The Prosecutor no longer has to provide evidence and prove the occurrence of the genocide in each case. Prosecutions can now focus on the personal involvement of the accused persons in the genocide.<br /><br />One of the ICTR&#39;s major judicial achievements is also found in the body of its case law, which has endorsed the application of the doctrine of command responsibility to the civilian leadership. Through the application of this doctrine, military commanders and civilian leaders are equally held personally responsible for human rights violations and other international crimes committed by their subordinates, if as superiors they knew, or should have known about commission of those violations and did not prevent them or punish the perpetrators after commission of the crimes. <br /><br /><strong>The ICTR&#39;s Legacy</strong><br /><br />The ICTR and its sister Tribunal the ICTY have made significant progress towards the completion of their work. Their legacies and contributions to the respective societies in which they function, must be preserved.  In this perspective, it is clear that the legal foundations of the ad hoc Tribunals, their Statutes and Rules of procedure and evidence, and some of their functions cannot terminate immediately upon the conclusion of all trials and appeals. Both Tribunals have been
 working very closely in developing a joint strategic proposal, to address issues relating to residual functions. <br /><br />This will be soon considered by the Security Council. Failure to ensure that these essential functions are carried out once the Tribunals' peak activity is winding down may result in violations of the rights of victims, witnesses, accused and convicted persons.   It is also important to preserve the long-term legacy of the Tribunals, bearing in mind that these courts contribute to international peace, reconciliation and the development of the rule of law, as well as the credibility of the nascent international criminal justice system.<br /><br />For the time being some of the essential functions to be considered  as far as the residual mechanism is concerned, deal with, review of earlier judgments; referrals of cases to national jurisdictions; supervision of prison sentences, early release, pardon and commutation; contempt or perjury proceedings; prevention of double jeopardy in national courts; witness protection; issues relating to defense counsel and legal aid; claims for compensation; archives; public information, capacity building and outreach;  and human resources. It is even possible that the residual mechanism deal with trial of fugitives belatedly arrested. <br /><br />The United Nations Security Council attaches a lot of importance to the establishment of residual mechanisms for both Tribunals.  A Security Council Informal Working Group on the Tribunals (SCIWGT) has already been put in place.  Members of the working group, composed  of representatives of  Belgium, Burkina Faso, China, Croatia, France, Panama, Russian Federation, South Africa, United Kingdom and United States of America visited the Tribunal from the 29 to 30 September 2008. <br /><br />The SCWIGT held extensive exchanges with the President, the Prosecutor, the Registrar and other Senior Officers on ongoing strategic process on matters related to the completion strategy. They were also briefed on the achievements of the ICTR and its challenges as it nears the end of its mandate. The Delegation expressed its satisfaction On 30 September 2008, the Delegation left for The Hague to hold a similar exercise with the ICTY.<br /><br /><strong>Conclusion</strong><br /><br />The effectiveness of an ad hoc international Tribunal such as the ICTR will remain seriously challenged until member States show a firm commitment to support the ICTR. This can be achieved through the enhanced cooperation and assistance of all United Nations member States including UN Agencies in those challenging areas. <br /><br />Although the ICTR can be proud of itself because of its honorable track record, it goes without saying that in order to successfully complete its work within the timeframe that has been prescribed by the Security Council as part of its completion strategy, the ICTR must receive full support in meeting its critical challenges. Failure to support the ICTR in that respect might seriously hamper the foundation of its effort to ensure a lasting contribution to national reconciliation in Rwanda, restoration and maintenance of peace and security in Rwanda, the Great Lakes Region and to the development of a very effective international criminal justice system. <br /><br />The ICTR legacy in those key areas must be enhanced and supported by a residual mechanism that shall guarantee the availability of willing countries, which would accept the relocation of protected witnesses, acquitted persons and released persons after the closure of the ICTR. The Tribunal has also continued to deploy vigorous and commendable diplomatic efforts in the relocation of acquitted persons. As a result, and thanks to the cooperation of Member States, one acquitted person has been relocated. Now only one acquitted person awaits relocation, and efforts are ongoing to find a suitable resolution. <br /><br />Establishing peace, justice, security and reconciliation in the region remains a central activity of the Tribunal.  As a key component of its mandate, the Tribunal provides support in Rwanda to the judiciary, to civil society and to academic institutions through its comprehensive capacity building and outreach programmes. The Registry in particular has continued to promote the Tribunal's work by carrying out a diverse range of public relations activities including training sessions and the production of documentaries and other publications, notably in Rwanda and Great Lakes Region.<br /><br />The Tribunal is working assiduously in compliance with the completion strategy. The task has been daunting. Yet, the ICTR has tackled the challenge with confidence and determination. However, there have been developments which added to the workload on which the time estimates were initially based. Because of the recent arrest of the three fugitives who have to be tried at the Tribunal, the ICTR is now planning trials for which provision had not previously been made. It is important to seize this opportunity to call again on Member States to take more active steps in apprehending the remaining fugitives because the value of our achievements will be diminished unless all these arrests are secured. <br /> <br /><br /><em>Roland Amoussouga is Spokesperson and Senior Legal Adviser for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha, Tanzania</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/law/aboutus/law-school-staff/person-details.html?personKey=Qer95w2U2kqAuz8dc3QQNZPMIfl0K1">Malcolm D. Evans</a> of the University of Bristol School of Law (UK) says European Court of Human Rights rulings responding to growing calls to prohibit the wearing of clothing which is of religious significance in public places have laid down a number of key principles that should be taken into account when setting law and policy in this increasingly sensitive area...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/malcolmevans.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->M<odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->ost people have some rather well formed views about fashion &#8212; 'the colours which go and the colours which don't go', what suits us and what doesn't, what we like and dislike. And if others do not share our tastes, then, well, perhaps we do not share theirs. Few, however, would really wish to ban someone from wearing clothes which we consider to be in 'dubious taste' &#8212; unless it was positively indecent. Yet in recent times, there has been a significant rise in the calls for prohibiting the wearing of clothing which is of religious significance in public places on the basis that this either offends the dominant social or cultural mores or somehow implicates the State in supporting the belief systems in question. As is well known, there have been many contentious cases concerning the wearing of Headscarves or other body coverings by Muslim girls and women in schools, universities, offices, and even in the streets. A British Airways worker was recently disciplined for wearing a cross to work. Questions have been raised as to whether it is right to allow women to wear Burkas in the street. Christmas is coming, but local authorities are increasingly reluctant to allow Christmas Trees to be erected in town centre? Should shops play Christmas carols whilst customers browse? The list of issues expands ever outwards, and as it does tensions increase. <br /><br />Modern Europe political society owes its origins to the struggle to separate political governance from religious governance and affiliations. Tragically, European history has been punctuated by many instances of conflict between followers of various religious beliefs, and of persecution by both the religious and by the non-religious of those who either did not share or who rejected the belief systems of the dominant groups within the societies of which they formed a part. The need to find a means of accommodating religious diversity has therefore played a significant role in the shaping of modern Europe and the nature of the accommodations made have varied over time and each has left its own historical legacy which still have reverberations today. It can hardly be denied that there is now a renewed interest in the role and place of religion and of systems of belief in contemporary society and, as has already been indicated, and few issues have attracted as much attention as the wearing or visibility of religious symbols in public spaces and in the workplace. It was only a matter of time before this issue came into focus before the European Court of Human Rights, and although related issues had been dealt with previously, the decision of the Grand Chamber of the Court in <em>Leyla Sahin v. Turkey</em>[1] in 2005 proved to be a catalyst for debate. In its decision, the Court accorded the state a broad discretion in determining the necessity for and proportionality of an outright ban on the wearing of headscarves at state run universities in Turkey, in the interests of preserving the neutrality of the State. This fed into the ongoing discussions within the Council of Europe on the place of fundamental rights within a plural society and in 2006 the Committee of Ministers' Steering Committee for Human Rights decided to make this one of two particular questions on which to focus further work &#8212; the other being the equally pressing question of 'hate speech'. Working groups were created and Reports on each topic adopted. One of the Recommendations of the Reports was the independent experts be commissioned to prepare manuals on each theme which would 'gather relevant standards, existing case-law as well as provide an analysis of this case-law and give examples of national measures'. These Manuals[2] were launched during the Council of Europe Conference on Human Rights in Culturally Diverse Societies, held in The Hague in November 2008. <br /><br />The <em>Manual on the Wearing of Religious Symbols in Public Areas</em> seeks to provide a human rights based guide to how best to approach such questions, based on the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights. Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights, in common with other major human rights instruments, protects the rights of individuals to 'manifest' their religion or belief in 'worship, teaching observance and practice', and the wearing of religious clothing (such as headscarves or turbans) or symbols (such as crosses or kirpans) is certainly embraced by this protection. However, the state may restrict such forms of manifestation if it is 'strictly necessary in a democratic society' in order to protect, <em>inter alia</em>, the rights and freedoms of others. Moreover, the Court accepts that States have a broad measure of discretion in how to strike the balance between these competing interests. There are, however, a number of key principles which have emerged and which need to be taken into account when assessing the appropriateness of the decisions made. <br /><br /><strong>Neutrality/impartiality</strong><br /><br />The European Court calls on States to act in a neutral fashion as between religions and as between religious and non-religious forms of belief. This means that States must not privilege forms of religious expression - including wearing religious symbols - over other forms of expression, or to sub-ordinate the expression of religion or belief to the non-religious. This duty to remain neutral and impartial has a number of other facets, perhaps the most important being that 'the State's duty of neutrality and impartiality is incompatible with any power on the State's part to assess the legitimacy of religious beliefs <em>or the ways in which they are expressed'</em>.[3] This clearly extends to wearing religious clothing or symbols. If a person considers something to be of religious significance to <em>them</em>, then it is not for others to say that it is not (as has happened in some cases). <br /><br /><strong>Fostering pluralism and tolerance</strong><br /><br />Fostering of pluralism and tolerance is not an 'incidental outcome' but is a goal which is to be achieved in its own right. Most religious belief systems advance truth claims which are, in varying degrees, absolutist in nature and reject at least elements of the validity of others. The Court expects believers to cope with a fairly high degree of challenge to their systems of belief in the pursuit of the more general goals of securing pluralism and tolerance. Likewise, society in general may be expected to be able to cope with a fairly high degree of public display of personal religiosity. Whilst respect for the freedom of religion and belief cannot require others to respect the doctrines and teachings of faith traditions other than one's own (if any) it can, and does, require that one be respectful of them. The role of the State in such cases is to ensure that both believers and non-believers are able to continue to enjoy their convention rights, albeit that they may be troubled or disturbed by what they see and hear around them. The State should not be driving religion 'off the streets' or 'from the workplace' or 'underground' unless there are compelling reasons to do so.<br /><br /><s
trong>Respect</strong> <br /><br />The principle of respect has emerged as the single most important element in determining the scope of limitations on the freedom to manifest religion or belief and the Court has said that it may be 'necessary to place restrictions on this freedom in order to reconcile the interests of the various groups and to ensure that everyone's beliefs are respected'.[4] The Court has developed the principle of 'respect' as a key factor when balancing the respective interests which are engaged and both believers and non-believers are entitled to the respect of those who express themselves on matters pertaining to their opinions, ideas and beliefs - even though, of course, there may be profound disagreement regarding the <em>content</em> of those views, since respect for the believer does not necessarily entail respect for what is believed. <br /><br />In the light of these principles, it is increasingly difficult to justify general restrictions on the wearing of religious symbols in public areas or in the workplace, unless there is a clear functional reason. Neutrality and impartiality does not mean that the public space must be emptied of the religious - it means that all forms of religion or belief must be able to secure their place. Any other approach is hardly likely to help foster pluralism and tolerance or show the appropriate degree of respect for the beliefs of others.<br /><br />As a result, when decision-makers are considering whether or not to place a restriction upon wearing religious symbols in public the following questions should be asked: <br /><br />- is this restriction reflective of a general approach which is neutral and impartial as between all forms of religion or belief or does it seek to prioritise a particular form of religion or belief?<br /><br />- is this restriction discriminatory in that it bears more directly or more harshly on the followers of one religion or belief than of another?<br /><br />- is the restriction directly aimed at the protection of a 'legitimate interest', notably the protection of the rights and freedoms of others?<br /><br />- is there a pressing reason why that interest needs to be protected?<br /><br />- are there alternatives to the restriction which would secure the realisation of those interests and which would not involve a greater diminution of the freedom to manifest one's beliefs through the wearing of such religiously-inspired clothing or artifacts?<br /><br />- assuming there to be no other viable alternative approach, is the restriction limited to the minimum that is necessary to realise the specific legitimate aims identified?<br /><br />- is the imposition of the restriction compatible with the principles of respect and or the need to foster tolerance and pluralism?<br /><br />Above all else, it should be emphasised that the relevant question is not whether a restriction is 'reasonable' in all the circumstances of the case, but whether it is 'necessary' - which is a very different question and which sets a much higher threshold of legitimacy. Should domestic policy and decision-makers address these questions when considering issues concerning restrictions upon the wearing of religious symbols, then it will be more likely that their decisions will be compliant with human rights standards and be properly respectful the freedom of religion or belief whilst striking a fair balance between the competing interests at stake.<br /><br /><br /><font SIZE=2 style='font-size: 8pt'>Notes<br /><br />1. <em>Leyla Sahin v.

		<title>Establishing an International Tribunal for the Mumbai Terror Suspects</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php">Ali Khan</a> of Washburn University School of Law says that an international tribunal should be formed to prosecute persons involved in the Mumbai terrorist attacks in order to avoid the politically unworkable alternatives of retaliatory surgical strikes and the extradition of Pakistani militants to India... <br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/alikhan.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>lthough a war between India and Pakistan is unlikely in the near future, both nations are exchanging muted threats of war veiled in the right of self-defense.  Rumors abound that India is considering surgical strikes on terrorist hideouts in Pakistan to send a strong message to anti-India militants and to warn Pakistani intelligence agencies that India would no longer accept terrorist attacks on its soil. India has also asked Pakistan to extradite the top leaders of Lashkar-i-Taiba and Jammat- ud- Da&#39;wah, the militant organizations allegedly involved in the planning of the Mumbai attacks.   Both courses of action are unacceptable to Pakistan. The ensuing deadlock threatens the peace and security of the region and will further complicate relations between the two nuclear-armed neighbors.  <br /><br />To break the deadlock and to avoid war, I propose that an international tribunal be formed to prosecute persons involved in Mumbai attacks.  The idea of an international tribunal makes sense because the other two options, surgical strikes and the extradition of militants to India, cannot work and may even aggravate the crisis. <br /><br /><strong>Surgical Strikes</strong><br /><br />Surgical strikes as reprisals may have some legitimacy under international law. However, the legality of a course of action does not determine its efficacy. Prudent nations weigh the moral and practical consequences of reprisals. India, as the largest democracy of the world with a substantial Muslim population and an active trade partner with scores of Muslim nations, would not attack Muslim Pakistan on the mere basis of legality.  Iran, Saudi Arabia, and other Muslim nations are already pressuring India to repudiate the option of surgical strikes.<br /><br />Furthermore, Pakistan will not accept surgical strikes without a countermeasure. There was some suggestion that Pakistan should play dead and allow India to launch surgical strikes. In fact, rumors circulate that the Bush administration proposed such a notion of reprisals to deflate the crisis. It now appears that Pakistan is determined not to allow surgical strikes and will resort to the escalating logic of eye for eye. If surgical strikes are launched without the consent of Pakistan&#39;s high command, a devastating war is most likely the consequence. <br /><br /><strong>Extradition and Prosecution</strong><br /><br />While surgical strikes are perilous, India&#39;s proposal that the leaders of militant organizations, who allegedly planned the Mumbai massacre, should be extradited to India for prosecution has merit.  No extradition treaty exists between India and Pakistan and therefore the proposal cannot be legally enforced. However, international law does not prohibit extradition in the absence of a treaty. Extradition will be a gesture of goodwill and commitment to fight regional terrorism if Pakistan were to accept the proposal.  <br /><br />But given the institutional clout that militants enjoy with Pakistani armed forces, intelligence agencies, and even the people, the Pakistani government cannot voluntarily surrender any militant leaders to India. As of now, India has offered no proof that the named militants planned or perpetrated the Mumbai attacks. But even if irrefutable proof is provided, Pakistan, for a host of complex domestic reasons, is unlikely to extradite the militants to India.  <br /><br />Furthermore, the possible extradition of militants to India would exacerbate the threats of terrorism.  Past episodes indicate that militants fight harder when India captures their leaders. In 1999, militants hijacked an Indian passenger aircraft to Afghanistan, then under the rule of the Taliban, and successfully obtained the release of several Muslim militants whom Indian security forces had captured. A voluntary surrender of militant leaders to India would make both Indian and Pakistani governments the targets of violence. Suicide bombings will go into India and multiply in Pakistan.<br /><br /><strong>International Tribunal</strong><br /><br />While the fear of terrorism cannot determine foreign policy, good sense points toward the establishment of an international tribunal. Of course, the international tribunal cannot stem violence. Unless the Kashmir dispute is resolved, militancy against India is unlikely to subside. While the long term solution awaits, the establishment of an international tribunal will defuse the crisis and might even slowdown the progression of terrorism.  Here are a few points that support the idea of an international tribunal:<ul><li>the Tribunal will provide a lawful cover for Pakistani government to hand over its citizens for criminal prosecution. While surrendering Pakistani nationals to India would be regarded as an act of national shame, giving way the same individuals to an international tribunal will be acceptable to the people of Pakistan and its armed forces. <br /><br /><li>neither India nor Pakistan will face the inevitable criticism that the prosecution was unfair in case the militants are tried in either national jurisdiction. Conviction of militants by an international tribunal will boost Indian demands that Pakistan do more to curb militant organizations.<br />  <br /><li>prosecution through an international tribunal will safeguard the defendants&#39; criminal justice rights.  The world cannot presume that anyone charged with terrorism is ipso facto guilty. India and Pakistan, as civilized nations, cannot adopt the disgraceful procedures that the Bush administration has employed to punish and even kill suspected terrorists without any trial.</ul>The establishment of an international tribunal will empower India and Pakistan to demonstrate that terrorist criminality can be handled through peaceful judicial manner.  The logic of surgical strikes and extra-judicial killings of suspected terrorists may satisfy raw emotions for revenge. Such reprisals do little to ennoble our sentiments for peace and justice. <br /><br /><br /><em>Ali Khan is professor of law at Washburn University School of Law in Topeka, Kansas, and the author of the book, <em>A Theory of Universal Democracy</em> (2003).

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.dal.ca/Faculty/Full_Time_Faculty/Bios/A_Wayne_Mackay/index.php">A. Wayne MacKay</a> of Dalhousie Law School in Halifax, Canada, says that while Governor General Michaelle Jean's decision early this month to grant Prime Minister Stephen Harper&#39;s request to suspend the Canadian parliament until January to avoid losing a confidence vote to a coalition of opposition parties is politically popular and what most Canadians wanted (at least outside Quebec), only time will tell if it was constitutionally wise...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/waynemackay.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->R<odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->arely have Canadians (or Americans!) been so riveted by political life in Ottawa as during the late days of November and the early days of December, 2008. The nature of this focus on Canada's Parliament was not the kind of positive energy that surrounded American President-elect Obama's historic election victory a few weeks before, but rather a negative and nervous energy characterized by disbelief, disgust and surprise. In a time of economic crisis rivaled only by the Great Depression of the 1930s, Canada was being plunged into a political crisis not seen since 1926, when then-Governor General Byng denied then-Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King's request to dissolve Parliament, so the Prime Minister could avoid a non-confidence vote in the House of Commons. Governor General Byng denied the request and called upon the leader of the opposition (former Prime Minister Arthur Meighen) to attempt to govern by forging an alliance between the Conservatives and the Progressives &#8212; a coalition of sorts.<br /><br />Fast forwarding to 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper's minority Conservative Government, elected only a few weeks before in a general election, brought forward an economic update that so enraged the opposition parties in the federal Parliament that they formed a coalition of the Liberal and New Democratic Parties, supported by the separatist party from Quebec &#8212; the Bloc Quebecois. The items in the economic update that forged this coalition included a ban on public service strikes, a roll-back of pay equity and the removal of public funding for political parties. The funding cuts would have effectively neutered the opposition parties and epitomized an economic update that was more ideological than economic in nature, and was both partisan and mean spirited. It was also contrary to Prime Minister Harper's pledge after his recent election victory to work together with the opposition parties to combat the looming economic problems facing the nation. Indeed, there was little in the economic update to address economic concerns.<br /><br />It appears that the Prime Minister underestimated the political will of his opponents and forgot the primary role of responsible government in a British style parliamentary system, i.e. that a Government must maintain the confidence of a majority of the members of Parliament in order to govern. This is particularly true in a minority Parliament where no one party has a majority of the members of the elected House of Commons. The coalition parties served notice that they had lost confidence in the Harper-led Government, and would defeat him on a non-confidence motion at the earliest possible opportunity.<br /><br />Prime Minister Harper delayed the non-confidence vote by one week within Parliamentary rules and then went to the formal head of state in a British style Parliamentary system &#8212; the Governor General, currently Michaelle Jean &#8212; seeking to prorogue Parliament, that is to end the current session. This historic meeting between the Prime Minister and the Governor General took place on December 4, 2008 and after a 2 &Acirc;&frac12; hour meeting, the Governor General granted the prorogation request accepting the advice of Prime Minister Harper to put Parliament on hold until January 26, 2009. This gave him time to prepare a budget through which he hopes to regain the confidence of the House of Commons and avoid the looming non-confidence vote.<br /><br />Canada has a Constitution "similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom" in which most of the vital constitutional principles are in the form of conventions &#8212; rules which are binding within the political realm while lacking legal clout. Canada also has extensive written constitutional provisions, including since 1982 a Charter of Rights, but it is the British style conventions which are relevant to the recent "constitutional crisis". Under the written Constitution, the Governor General as the head of state has the ultimate legal authority but on most vital matters she only acts upon the advice of the Prime Minister, as a matter of convention. On this basis some argued that the Governor General was bound to accept the Prime Minister's advice to prorogue the House of Commons, as she ultimately did. Indeed, if she had refused his advice, convention would have required the Prime Minister to resign &#8212; a result some angry Canadian voters desired. However, the matter is not so simple.<br /><br />There is an even more vital convention that a Government can only govern when it has the confidence of a majority of the members of the House of Commons who have been democratically elected. The opposition parties signed a formal document indicating that they had lost confidence in Prime Minister Harper's Government and that when it would be defeated in the upcoming vote of non-confidence, the Governor General should call upon the Liberal and New Democratic Party Coalition (supported by the Bloc Quebecois, which was not a formal part of the coalition) to form the Government. This document was sent to the Governor General. In effect they were requesting what Governor General Byng had done in 1926 when he rejected the advice of then Prime Minister King, who had lost the confidence of the House of Commons. In that case, Governor General Byng refused a request to dissolve Parliament and call an election, in favour of allowing the opposing coalition an opportunity to govern with the confidence of a majority of the House of Commons. That coalition lasted only a few days and then Prime Minister King won the ensuing election, campaigning against the Governor General's failure to accept his earlier advice in line with constitutional convention.<br /><br />In the recent constitutional crisis the advice was not to dissolve the House and call an election, but rather to prorogue the recently elected Parliament, allowing the Government to at least delay, and in reality likely avoid, a vote of non-confidence in the House of Commons. In the view of some constitutional commentators (myself included), this sets a dangerous precedent that is likely to be followed by future Governments facing a vote of non-confidence. It may damage the vital constitutional principle that a Government can only continue to govern when it has the support of the majority of the members of the House of Commons. Governor General Jean made the difficult decision to grant the Prime Minister's request to prorogue Parliament, and by so doing exercised her clear legal authority to do so, but at the cost of establishing a potentially dangerous precedent for the future. There is no question that the Governor General's decision is politically popular and what most Canadians wanted (at least outside Quebec) but only time will tell if it was constitutionally wise.<br /><br />Truth is the first victim of many political battles and that proved true during the recent turmoil. In the lead-up to the December 4th meeting the Prime Minister characterized the coalition as undemocratic and designed to thwart the Canadian peoples choice of him as the leader. In a Parliamentary system unlike the Am
erican Republican system, however, the people elect members of Parliament. It is only as a matter of convention that the leader of the party with the most members elected forms the Government. The key is holding the confidence of a majority of members of the House of Commons. When the governing party has a majority of the members of the House, this is fairly straightforward because of strict party discipline, but in a minority government situation where no one party has a majority of the members, it is more complex. The formation of coalition is neither undemocratic nor lacking in precedent. It was a coalition of parties that led to Confederation of Canada in 1867 and again in 1917 a coalition of Unionists led by then-Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden brought in conscription during World War I. Moreover, there are many precedents for effective coalition governments in Europe and other Parliamentary systems. So long as a coalition has the support of the majority of the House of Commons it is both democratic and legitimate in constitutional terms.<br /><br />Another tactic used to gain popular support for the governing Conservatives and stir up antagonism against the Coalition was the argument that the Liberal-New Democratic Party Coalition had made a pact with the "devil" &#8212; the Bloc Quebecois, whose avowed aim is to separate Quebec from the rest of Canada. Prime Minister Harper, when leader of the opposition in 2004, pursued a similar alliance and his Government has been frequently supported by the Bloc Quebecois. Bloc Quebecois members were democratically elected to represent Quebec in the House of Commons and the demonizing of these members by the Harper Government in recent weeks has re-opened issues of national unity and galvanized most Quebecers against the Conservatives. The forces of alienation in the western provinces of Canada have also been fueled. Another casualty of the recent political crisis may have been a re-opening of national divisions, which were fairly dormant in recent years. It also makes it unlikely that Prime Minister Harper's Conservatives will have much success in electing members of Parliament from Quebec in the near future, thereby reducing their chances of forming a majority government in the next election. Playing the national "unity card" may also have a high price at the national level.<br /><br />As I write this op-ed things have quieted down and it looks less likely that the Harper Government will be defeated by the Coalition. Indeed the Coalition may well unravel, as its original leader and the leader of the Liberal Party, Stephan&Atilde;&copy; Dion, has stepped aside and has been replaced by Michael Ignatieff, who takes the position "coalition if necessary but not necessarily coalition." Assuming that the Harper Government reaches across party lines to produce a budget that at least the Liberal party can support, it will likely avoid a January non-confidence vote. In respect to reaching across party lines and acting in a non-partisan fashion, Prime Minister Harper could take some lessons from American President-elect Obama. Re-establishing the trust and confidence of the House of Commons in the longer term will, however, be a major challenge for Prime Minister Harper and his Government. Many suggest non-partisan co-operation is not easy for the Prime Minister and the Toronto <em>Globe and Mail</em> columnist Gary Mason suggests in the December 6th issue that Mr. Harper may need a Christmas eve visit from the spirits that enlightened Mr. Scrooge in order for him to see the error of his ways and chart a new path. Most Canadians have had just about all the political excitement that they can stand and are asking Santa Claus for a federal Parliament where the members can deploy their collective energies confronting the real economic problems facing the nation and rise above political bickering. May there be peace in Parliament and good will in the land that will inspire the confidence of all Canadians that Parliament will address the real economic challenges rather than create political crises and constitutional distractions. Whether Prime Minister Harper regains the confidence of both Parliament and Canadians may depend upon how well he listens to the spirits of Christmas &#8212; past, present and future. <br /><br /><br /><em>A.

Ashcroft</em>, heard <em>en banc</em> by the Second Circuit last Tuesday, and <em>Iqbal v. Ashcroft</em>, argued before the US Supreme Court last Wednesday, reveal major flaws in the policies of the Bush administration but provide a valuable opportunity for the incoming Obama administration to demonstrate that it is different...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/petermargulies.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->T<odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->wo recent high-profile national security cases illustrate the Bush administration's signature fusion of incompetence and bad intentions. <em>Arar v. Ashcroft</em>, heard by the en banc Second Circuit last Tuesday, and <em>Iqbal v. Ashcroft</em>, argued before the Supreme Court last Wednesday, are a microcosm of the Bush administration's flaws, including detours around established legal rules, dysfunctional performance, and a persistent flight from accountability. However, each case also provides a valuable opportunity for the new administration to demonstrate that it is different. <br /><br />When Maher Arar, a Canadian/Syrian citizen, landed in New York en route to Montreal, United States officials interrogated him for ten days and then deported him to Syria after receiving assurances which the Inspector General for the Homeland Security Department later found were "ambiguous." In Syria, Arar was beaten with electric cables and held for almost one year in the cell the size of a grave. United States officials, whom Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has acknowledged "mishandled" the case, acted after receiving inaccurate information from Canada and a hit from the State Department's "TIPOFF" system, analogous to the no-fly list that for years has included Senator Ted Kennedy on its roster of risks to national security. Officials also misled Arar's lawyer, ensuring that Arar could not file a writ of habeas corpus in federal court to stop his deportation. Eventually, Arar, who apparently has no terrorist ties, received $10 million from Canada and sued in federal court for damages pursuant to the Supreme Court's 1971 decision in <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal Agents</em>. After a federal district judge and appellate panel rejected Arar's claims, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals on its own motion ordered a hearing by the full court. <br /><br />At the <em>en banc</em> hearing, Georgetown Law professor David Cole argued that Arar had been the target of two interrelated conspiracies, one to frustrate Arar's access to statutory remedies under the Immigration Act, and the second to arrange Arar's torture in Syria. Cole's dual theories countered the first government line of defense &#8212; that Arar had failed to take advantage of his rights under the Immigration Act, and that granting Arar a <em>Bivens</em> damages remedy would undermine the Immigration statute's comprehensive scheme. Cole rightly argued that the government's position was a study in hypocrisy, since United States officials who misled Arar's lawyer had undermined Arar's ability to seek recourse under the statute. <br /><br />The government's second argument was that a <em>Bivens</em> remedy would result in the inappropriate disclosure of communications between sovereign states about national security matters. According to the government, possible damage to United States foreign relations caused by such disclosure was a "special factor counseling hesitation" in creating a right of action under <em>Bivens</em>. In a cogent response, Judge Calabresi observed that holding American officials liable for deporting an individual to effectuate torture would further reciprocity in foreign affairs, enhancing the United States' ability to deter abuses by foreign governments.<br /><br />Finally, the defendants argued that they were protected by qualified immunity, since no established precedent barred deporting aliens to facilitate their torture. This argument would provide a windfall to officials who walk on the wild side. In its 1997 decision, <em>United States v. Lanier</em>, the Supreme Court noted that the touchstone of qualified immunity is "reasonable warning." Fair notice does not require a precedent that specifically prohibits any and all egregious abuse, particularly when courts have held officials accountable for the needless and wanton infliction of pain. In <em>Lanier</em>, Justice Souter commented that while no case has accused a state official of "selling foster children into slavery," no reasonable official could regard such as scheme as lawful. Any other result would transform qualified immunity from a doctrine tailored to reduce chilling effects on legitimate policy choices to a license for official overreaching.<br /><br />A holding rejecting the government's position in Arar would also not leave the United States defenseless against terrorists. Officials would properly shrink from sending an individual to a country like Syria that for years has resided on the State Department's list of human rights violators. However, officials had other courses of action available, including detaining Arar in the United States under the immigration laws until they could sort out the inconsistent stories in the case. <br /><br /><em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal</em>, in which the Supreme Court heard argument last Wednesday, raises the same concerns about overreaching with impunity. In <em>Iqbal</em>, undocumented aliens detained in the post-September 11 round-up alleged that Attorney General Ashcroft and other senior officials had established a policy that called for the plaintiffs' abusive treatment. Strong evidence, including a report from the Justice Department's Inspector General, demonstrated that the plaintiffs had been beaten by inmates and guards after their detention. The facilities where the abuse occurred were under the supervision of the Attorney General. The Supreme Court considered whether to require that plaintiffs suing senior officials assert more specific factual claims, to avoid subjecting senior officials to burdensome discovery that could disrupt performance of their duties.<br /><br />As it turned out, the September 11 round-up was a rendezvous with incompetence. FBI agents sorted through 90,000 tips based not on evidence of terrorist ties but on bias, fear, and personal feuds. Moreover, senior officials were aware of reports of detainee abuse within two weeks. The failure to investigate reports of abuse could help prove a claim of "deliberate indifference," which is actionable under <em>Bivens</em> and outside the scope of officials' qualified immunity. <br /><br />Requiring more specific pleading in <em>Iqbal</em>, like a ruling for the government in <em>Arar</em>, would license official overreaching. Current rules provide ample protection against discovery abuses. Indeed, the district judge in Iqbal had already stayed discovery pertaining to senior officials. While Scalia and several other justices were reluctant to leave senior officials at the mercy of individual district judges, those judges appear able to balance opportunity costs for senior officials and plaintiffs' need for information in the search for government accountability. Rigid pleading rules would place a thumb on the scales of justice, leaving victims without redress and permitting officials to abuse their power with impunity.<br /><br />While the prospect of greater license for official lawlessness and incompetence is alarming, both <em>Arar</em> and <em>Iqbal</em> also present opportunities for the incoming administration. The Obama administration could settle both cases, as Canada has with Arar and the Bush administration has done with one of th
e original <em>Iqbal</em> plaintiffs. This move would provide justice to plaintiffs who have been wronged and head off damaging judicial decisions. It would also signal a clean break from the arrogance and haste of the past eight years. As members of the Second Circuit hinted during the <em>Arar</em> argument, the Obama administration should take advantage of this chance to highlight the virtues of an accountable government. <br /><br /><br /><em>Peter Margulies is a professor at Roger Williams University School of Law</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Dr. Maria Alvanou of the <a href="http://www.cepol.europa.eu/index.php?id=greece">Hellenic Police Officers Academy</a> says that the riots that followed the recent police shooting of a Greek teenager in a troubled district of Athens highlight major problems facing Greek police forces and the need for tougher legislation and implementation of laws against police brutality and abuses...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/mariaalvanou.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <!-- odiogo-notts-begin --><font SIZE=3><b><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->O<odiogo-notts-begin --></strong></font><!-- odiogo-notts-end -->n December 6, a 15 year-old boy named Alexandros Grigoropoulos was shot dead by a special guard of the police force patrolling with his colleague in the Exarheia district of Athens. This tragic event led to student and youth protests that escalated into rioting and looting by anarchists in almost all cities of Greece. <br /><br />More then a week later unrest continues, with Athens looking like a war zone. There seems to be no end to violence and there are serious political and social issues involved. Scandals troubling the Greek government, the worldwide economic crisis affecting the country, public institutions not functioning properly, low wages, problems with the education system and deficiency in society's values are part of the background to what is happening today.<br /><br />The protests were started spontaneously by young people and school children, but afterwards a concrete movement of violent anarchists took the lead and started to target and destroy public and individual property of every type: shops, traditional buildings, police stations, houses, universities. The security forces of the country seem to be unable to react effectively and protect the citizens and their property. Some say the government wants to avoid a direct confrontation with the anarchists. After all this is why Exarheia (a central area in Athens) was made a ghetto where police action and protection was virtually non-existent. What is certain is that the Greek state is liable for damages and it will be called upon to compensate the citizens who will sue it. <br /><br />The case of the young boy's death is now in the hands of Greek justice authorities. The two special guards involved in the shooting have been put in pre-trial detention by a decision of the investigative judge. According to their defence lawyer, the whole incident was just an unfortunate accident, while allegations were made that the dead teenager was part of a group of troublemakers and his behaviour was abnormal. Eyewitnesses to the incident, though - as well as friends and the school the boy attended - tell a different story. The defence line was severely criticised by the majority of the Greek media and Greek pubic opinion and it resulted in new violent episodes and the destruction of the defence lawyer&#39;s legal office. However provocative the defence strategy may have been, the fact remains that an accused person has the right to a defence and defence lawyers should be free to represent their clients in the best way they think with their institutional role in the justice system protected by the state.<br /><br />The killing of the young boy has brought to surface many problems facing the Greek police. The issue of police violence is not new in the country, though the democratization that has occurred during the last decades has certainly altered the image of Greek law enforcement. In most cases where policemen are accused of torture and police brutality, court decisions seem to acquit the accused without investigating the truth deeply and without compensating the victims. Greece actually has a record of condemnations in the European Court of Human Rights for cases regarding abuse and torture by the police. Another issue is the lack of basic psychiatric-psychological evaluation of policemen carrying guns. In a characteristic recent case on the island of Lemnos a policeman suffering by severe psychiatric problems used his gun to hold his colleagues as hostages. In addition, special guards like the one involved in the Grigoropoulos shooting who have been incorporated into to the police forces lack the general education and training expected of normal police officers.<br /><br />Greece needs to face this critical moment with bold initiatives on many levels. Tougher legislation against police brutality (and true implementation of that legislation with courageous court decisions), proper education of all policemen on how to manage crisis and determine when and how they use force, and police surveillance of all areas of Athens (with no ghettos) could be positive steps in this direction.<br /><br /><br /><em>Dr. Maria Alvanou is a Greek defense lawyer and Professor of Criminology at the Hellenic Police Officers Academy</em><br />

		<title>Rwanda: No Conspiracy, No Genocide Planning ... No Genocide?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.wmitchell.edu/academics/faculty/erlinder.asp">Peter Erlinder</a> of William Mitchell College of Law and a Lead Defense Counsel at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), says that if - as the ICTR recently ruled in the &quot;Military I&quot; trial - alleged &quot;masterminds&quot; Colonel Theoneste Bagosora and fellow top Rwandan military officers engaged in no conspiracy and no planning to kill ethnic civilians, the tragedy that engulfed Rwanda in 1994 may not properly be called a &quot;genocide&quot; at all... <br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/petererlinder.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he media reports of the December 18 judgment of Chamber-1 at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda focused primarily on the convictions of three of four former top military leaders, who were the supposed "masterminds" of the Rwandan genocide.  But, as those who have followed the ICTR closely know, convictions of members of the former Rwandan government and military are scarcely newsworthy.<br /><br />Ever since former ICTR Chief Prosecutor Carla Del Ponte and ICTR Chief Investigative Prosecutor Michael Hourigan went public in 2007-8 exposing US-UK manipulations to grant <em>de facto</em> impunity to current Rwandan President Paul Kagame and his henchmen, between 1997 and the present, convictions of the vanquished in the Rwanda war are a given.  <br /><br />The real news was that ALL of the top Rwandan military officers, including the supposedly infamous Colonel Bagosora, were found not guilty of conspiracy or planning to commit genocide.  And Gen. Gratien Kabiligi, a senior member of the general staff was acquitted of all charges!  The others were found guilty of specific acts committed by subordinates, in specific places, at specific times - not an overall conspiracy to kill civilians, much less Rwandan-Tutsi civilians.<br /><br />This raises the more profound question: if there was no conspiracy and no planning to kill ethnic civilians, can the tragedy that engulfed Rwanda properly be called "a genocide" at all?  Or, was it closer to a case of civilians being caught up in war-time violence, like the Eastern Front in WWII, rather than the planned behind-the-lines killings in Nazi death camps?  The ICTR judgment found the former.<br /><br />The Court specifically found that the actions of Rwandan military leaders, both before any after the April 6, 1994 assassination of former Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarima, and Burundi&#39;s President Ntaryamira, were consistent with war-time conditions and the massive chaos brought about by the four-year war of invasion from Uganda by Gen. Paul Kagame's RPF/Ugandan army, which seized power in July 1994.<br /><br />Although the Chamber did not specifically mention more recent events, it is worth noting that this is the same Kagame government that was named in a UN Security Council commissioned report on December 12, 2008 as having invaded the eastern Congo (with Uganda) in 1996 and again in 1998 and as occupying an area 15-times the size of Rwanda since that time.  Similar UN Security Council reports in 2001, 2002 and 2003, make clear that Rwanda and Uganda's economic rape of the eastern Congo, and the resulting 6 million-plus civilian deaths, have long been an "open secret."<br /><br />As Lead Defense Counsel for Major Aloys Ntabakuze, who was convicted of three specific crimes committed by troops without evidence they were acting under his authority, I would say the judgment was actually a victory.  Our defense was based on previously suppressed contemporaneous UN and declassified US documents that showed Kagame's RPF as the war-time aggressor, which was responsible for the assassination of the former President and for preventing military intervention to end the predicted civilian massacres.<br /><br />The ICTR oral judgment specifically refers to this "alternative" explanation of the tragic events in Rwanda, as being a basis for rejecting the conspiracy and planning charges against the former military leaders.  But the documents show more.<br /><br />As early as May 17, 1994, UNHCR was receiving reports of massive civilian killings by Kagame's RPF in the 1/3 of Rwanda they had occupied since April 22. Other documents from August, September and October 1994 describe a conscious attempt by UN and US government officials to "cover-up" reports of RPF killings, including memos to Secretary of State Warren Christopher.  Apparently, US policy to create "impunity" for Kagame began nearly as soon as he took power.<br /><br />Had the US "impunity policy" not been in place, Kagame might well have been prosecuted along with Military-1 defendants Bagosora and Nsengiumva, as ICTR Prosecutor Michael Hourigan recommended in early 1997. Kagame's responsibility for the assassination of Habyarimana has been known to the ICTR Prosecutor since at least that time, if not early.<br /><br />Had the US "impunity policy" not been in place, Kagame might well have spent the last decade awaiting trial at the ICTR, rather than getting rich from the resources of the Congo, and the blood of millions of Africans.<br /><br /><br /><em>Peter Erlinder is a professor at William Mitchell College of Law, St. Paul, MN.

		<title>Compensation arrangements in China milk crisis do not ensure improved product safety</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.marlerclark.com/lawyers/view/william-marler"><strong>Bill Marler</strong></a> [Managing Partner, <a href="http://www.marlerclark.com/">Marler Clark LLP, PS</a>]: &quot;According to the latest news reports, the 22 companies implicated in the Chinese powdered milk crisis are <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/china-diary-producers-to-compensate.php">likely to pay</a> 1.1 billion yuan ($160 million) in compensation to the families of the over 294,000 children sickened by tainted milk products.  The reports indicate that the compensation will range from 2,000 yuan ($290) for children who suffered kidney stones to 200,000 yuan ($29,000) for the families of the children who died as a result of consuming tainted powder milk.  To put these figures into perspective, if a similar number of children became sickened by tainted food products in the United States, the payout would rival the current automotive industry bailout.  Nevertheless, one might assume that $160 million in compensation to the victims of this pervasive failure of Chinese dairy safety is a good thing, right?  The answer is both &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no.&quot;<br /><br />The fact that the Chinese companies implicated in the crisis have offered to &quot;shoulder the compensation liability&quot; shows at least some recognition of companies&#39; responsibility to the purchasers of their products.  Furthermore, any compensation the victims receive cannot come soon enough, as many of the families have incurred significant medical bills from their children&#39;s hospitalizations.  Still, the victims of the crisis will be left to ponder the $160 million question:  Will this voluntary form of compensation, meant to ensure customer goodwill, result in safer food products in China?<br /><br />Chinese courts have yet to accept any of the civil cases filed on behalf of victims of the powdered milk crisis.  The cases have sat in limbo for months, and with the prospect of a voluntary corporate payout, the chances of these cases ever seeing the light of day are slim to nil.  The fact remains that, in the kind of rampant business-economy that China seeks to create, civil cases create a liability threshold for corporations.  If a company chooses to ignore safety standards, a well-functioning civil court system will (in theory) ensure that the company faces a significant financial risk in doing so.  Unfortunately, the precedent China has set in the powdered milk crisis, by refusing to hear civil cases and encouraging a corporate payout, creates a system in which corporate liability is a voluntary option.  This, in turn, leads to businesses that do not see manufacturing safe products as a mandatory legal requirement, but as public relations consideration that can be remedied by simply choosing to &quot;shoulder the compensation liability.&quot;  <br /><br />Only time will tell whether the voluntary payout will encourage Chinese companies to manufacture safer products; let&#39;s hope, for the sake of the 294,000 sickened children, that the biggest lesson Chinese companies take from the crisis is that selling contaminated products is not a profitable business.&quot;<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Guillermo Ot&aacute;lora Lozano</strong> [<a href="http://asil.associationsonline.com/interest-groups-view.cfm?groupid=18">International Criminal Law Interest Group</a>, <a href="http://asil.associationsonline.com/index.cfm">American Society of International Law</a>]: &quot;The Italian rulings against Germany for crimes committed during the occupation reflect a growing trend in domestic courts&#39; practice towards the lifting of immunities when international crimes are at stake. The ICJ has already dealt with issues of immunities in the <em>Arrest Warrant</em> (DRC v. Belgium) (2002) and <em>Criminal Assistance</em> (Djibouti v. France) (2008) cases. The first one upheld the personal immunities of a Congolese Minister of Foreign Affairs against charges of war crimes in Belgium, while the second one declined to do so in respect to the functional immunities of Djiboutian governmental staff (due to Djibouti&#39;s failure to claim immunity with respect to France in the first place). However, in both cases the same principle was explicitly or implicitly affirmed: a State may not be the judge of another State (<em>par in parem non habet imperium</em>). This is the same legal principle underlying the jurisdictional immunities of States, whose customary character was most recently confirmed by the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/4_1_2004.pdf">2004 UN Convention on the Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property</a> [PDF file], and several decisions by domestic courts. <br /><br />There is some case-law in support of an exception to this rule when it concerns international &quot;core crimes&quot; (genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, enforced disappearance, torture, and possibly aggression), including the <em>Eichmann</em> judgment by the Israeli Supreme Court, and the much-publicized <em>Pinochet</em> decision by the UK House of Lords in 1998. However, the jurisdictional immunities of States have also been upheld in such cases, for instance, by the European Court of Human Rights in the <em>Al-Adsani v. United Kingdom</em> case, and by the Canadian Supreme Court in <em>Bouzari v. Iran</em>.<br /><br />In sum, there is contradictory authority on the issue, and there is no consensus among international scholars as to whether such an exception exists in international law. <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/germany-files-icj-suit-against-italy-to.php">Germany&#39;s application</a> represents a new opportunity for the World Court to do what it did not do in the 2002 <em>Arrest Warrant</em> case. However, policy concerns about this purported exception need to be taken into account. While ICJ judgments do not formally have the value of precedents (Article 59, ICJ Statute), they do have great effects on the formation of international law and practice. The 2002 judgment effectively shaped European policy with regard to universal jurisdiction. These proceedings, if continued towards a final judgment, could either boost or trample on the nascent customary exception to State immunities in cases of international crimes. This suit is thus not only about World War II atrocities, but the handling of individual claims for redress for more recent crimes or alleged crimes.  <br /><br />The humanitarian appeal of lifting immunities in these cases is evident, but a decision upholding an exception to sovereign immunity in these cases could well create more problems than it would purportedly solve. It could create an incentive for States to take matters into their own hands by exercising their jurisdiction against other States, instead of bringing claims for responsibility before the proper international forum, and undermine the international rule of law which the advocates of this exception seek to establish.&quot;<br />
