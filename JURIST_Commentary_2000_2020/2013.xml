		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.valpo.edu/law/about-us/full-time-faculty/faisal-kutty">Faisal Kutty</a> of the Valparaiso University Law School says that the global community must engage in a serious debate over the limits of free expression as it applies to the defamation of cultures and religions, and that in order to do so the extremists on both sides must face their own hypocrisy...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/faisalkutty.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) recently introduced calls to reexamine the balance between freedom of expression and religious/cultural defamation. Given the usual hysteria surrounding the debate, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that the OIC and its supporters have retreated from their extreme position. Moreover, each time the OIC has introduced calls to create an international defamation of religion offence, it has <a href="http://www.unwatch.org/atf/cf/%7B6deb65da-be5b-4cae-8056-8bf0bedf4d17%7D/OIC%20DOCUMENT%20TO%20AD%20HOC%20COMMITTEE%2029%20OCTOBER%202009.PDF">reiterated</a> [PDF] its "commitment to the freedom of opinion and expression" as well as the recognition that religious criticism "is important for introspection, dialogue and better understanding."</p>

<p>It is indeed encouraging that even with the minimal constructive engagement that has taken place to date on the issue the OIC has moved from defamation of religion to incitement language.  Some may characterize this as a "Trojan horse" but closer analysis may reveal that it is a genuine step closer to the middle.  It is also clear that proponents of the initiative realize that persuasion and engagement with the international community as a whole and within the bounds of international norms is important, even if the ultimate goal may be to try to push the norms to be more reflective.</p>

<p>Despite the nuance, such calls have elicited strong reactions from free speech advocates who appear to be straining to find a clash. "This has exposed a huge fault line in political philosophies," <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/sep/25/world/la-fg-un-free-speech-20120925">claimed</a> Stewart Patrick, of the nonpartisan Council on Foreign Relations. "It may be irreconcilable." This is arguably an overreaction, particularly when we consider that the same tensions exist in non-Muslim jurisdictions as well.</p>

<p>Based on the discussion in my <a href="/forum/2012/12/faisal-kutty-expression-islam-part-one.php">previous commentary</a> on this issue, the OIC position may not be as beyond the pale as portrayed by some. Indeed, as Robert Kahn <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1717198">argues</a>, bringing to light that similar tensions exist outside the Muslim world "helps undermine the frames of culture clash, appeasement, and slippery slopes that dominate the debate[.]" Clearly, the issue should not be seen as an existential threat to the West, but as an opportunity to dialogue. As commentator Jehnzeb Dar <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1717198">suggests</a>, the OIC resolution is "an important opportunity ... to achieve a richer and empathetic understanding about issues related to vilification of Islam in mainstream media, pop culture, and newspapers."</p>

<p><b>International Law and the Search for a Middle Ground</b></p>

<p>At the international level, freedom of expression norms are based on internationally recognized laws and standards for human rights, including the <a href="http://www.un-documents.net/a3r217.htm">International Bill of Human Rights</a>. Free speech proponents argue that expression should not be restricted except in accordance with international human rights laws and standards. These restrictions must be proportionate and in-line with Article 19 of the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR), namely the actions necessary to preserve national security and public order, protect public health or morals or safeguard the rights or reputations of others.</p>

<p>As narrow as this scope may be, there will undoubtedly be a variety of equally valid interpretations of Article 19 given the broad variety of contexts, circumstances and experiences produced by people exercising their fundamental right to self-determination. There is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all model, even if we were to insist that such restrictions must be justified as necessary in a democratic society. Indeed, what counts as a democratic outcome in any given instance is highly dependent on normative contestations and social, legal and political compromises.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/undocs/html/VWS55058.htm">Faurisson v. France</a>, for example, a Holocaust denier challenged his conviction under French law &#8212; claiming that it violated his freedom of expression rights under the ICCPR. The UN Human Rights Committee (UNHRC) found that the ICCPR had not been violated. In its decision, the UNHRC focused on the specific context in which the expression was made. In its reasoning, the UNHRC clearly accepted the French government's argument characterizing "the denial of the existence of the Holocaust as the principal vehicle for anti-Semitism." And, for this reason, the UNHRC justified the prosecution as "necessary" within the balanced rights scheme of the ICCPR.</p>

<p><b>Islamophobia: The New Anti-Semitism</b></p>

<p>Some <a href="http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/43069/the-new-anti-semitism-2">argue</a> that the new growth industry of Islamophobia is the new anti-Semitism. Today, promoting hatred and scorn for Islam and Muslims has become one of the few socially and legally acceptable modern prejudices in western society. Numerous studies have documented the rise in Islamophobia around the globe, including one by the <a href="http://www.runnymedetrust.org/projects/commissionOnBritishMuslims">British Runnymede Trust in 1997</a> and a more recent study by the <a href="http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/199-Synthesis-report_en.pdf">European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia</a> [PDF]. Moreover, Islamophobia was recognized as a form of intolerance alongside xenophobia and anti-Semitism at the <a href="http://www.fasena.de/download/rechts/SIFCI.pdf">Stockholm International Forum on Combating Intolerance</a> [PDF].</p>

<p>The trend is no different in the US. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), for instance, has documented a 50 percent jump in anti-Muslim hate crimes in 2010 from the previous year, while the Southern Law Poverty Center <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2012/spring/the-year-in-hate-and-extremism">recorded</a> the tripling of anti-Muslim groups from ten in 2010 to 30 in 2011. Indeed, earlier this year the University of California Berkeley launched the <a href="http://crg.berkeley.edu/content/islamophobia/islamophobia-studies-journal">Islamophobia Studies Journal</a> to focus on this growing phenomenon and its impact on culture, politics, media and the lives and experiences of Muslims.</p>

<p>Despite growing <a href="http://us.macmillan.com/THEISLAMOPHOBIAINDUSTRY/NathanLean">evidence</a>, some continue to minimize this trend while others raise concerns about semantics, accuracy, vagueness, effectiveness and even compatibility with modern human rights discourse. In response to such critics, Burak Erdenir <a href="http://www.abgs.gov.tr/files/diğer%20faydalı%20dokümanlar/islamophobia_qua_racial_discrimination.pdf">redirects</a> [PDF] the discourse by suggesting that they look at the "new racism" of "Muslimophobia," which "targets cultures, lifestyles, and physical appearances of Muslims." He notes that "identity, to a great extent, is about perceptions, the view of the dominant group is determined and thus one cannot simply disengage from one's faith group by renouncing the religion." Erdenir compares this to anti-Semitism in the way "prejudice and discrimination against an outside group" rests on "a combination of religious and ethnic terms." The most recent example of this is the New York subway <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/30/nyregion/woman-is-held-in-death-of-man-pushed-onto-subway-tracks-in-queens.html?_r=2&">murder</a>.</p>

<p>The frustration felt by many Muslims was summarized by Malaysia's foreign minister Anifah Aman, who <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/09/29/muslim-leaders-say-call-for-global-ban-on-anti-islam-hate-speech-is-not-attack-on-free-speech/">told</a> the UN General Assembly that the creators of the anti-Islam film &#8212; <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/egypt-court-sentences-8-christians-to-death-in-symbolic-trial-over-anti-islam-film.php">The Innocence of Muslims</a> &#8212; had shown "blatant malicious intent." She added: "When we discriminate against gender, it is called sexism. When African Americans are criticized and vilified, it is called racism. When the same is done to the Jews, people call it anti-Semitism. But why is it when muslims are stigmatized and defamed, it is defended as 'freedom of expression'?" </p>

<p><b>The Way Ahead</b></p>

<p>It appears that reasonable people can disagree about the limits and semantics of it and still remain committed to a robust conception of free speech. I would also venture to argue that most people in either camp would find themselves somewhere in the middle, particularly when it impacts on themselves, their community and values as opposed to when it is seen as impacting only the "other." The key is to strike a balance that protects the individual right to expression but at the same time allows the more protective of communitarian values &#8212; such as preventing social unrest, and promoting societal inclusiveness and anti-discrimination values.</p>

<p>There is some basis to believe that the OIC does not seek to restrict legitimate debate or even disagreement with Islam. Even the masses &#8212; as opposed to some fanatical fringes &#8212; in the Muslim world are not against freedom of expression <em>per se</em>. A groundbreaking <a href="http://www.gallup.com/press/104209/who-speaks-islam-what-billion-muslims-really-think.aspx">Gallup study</a> of the Muslim world in <a href="http://jurist.org/feature/featured/911/">the wake of 9/11</a> revealed that Muslims &#8212; in some nations as much as 99 percent &#8212; cited the West's liberty and freedom of speech as what they most admired. Moreover, when asked whether they would include a provision for freedom of speech in a new constitution, overwhelming majorities (94 percent in Egypt, 97 percent in Bangladesh, 99 percent in Lebanon, <em>etc.</em>) in every Muslim-majority country responded "yes."</p>

<p>Healthy criticism provokes thought and fuels the collision of opinion which is a necessary, if uncomfortable, process, which eventually results in an improved understanding of the self as well as the other. However, as Andrew March <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/25/whats-wrong-with-blasphemy/">argues</a>, while it may sometimes be worth offending people on religious grounds from an ethical (and, I would argue, legal) perspective, we may nonetheless wish to restrain ourselves in the interest of maintaining certain social and political relationships. Every society sets certain legal limits defined by respect for local customs, sensibilities and what is perceived rightly or wrongly as existentialist threats. The boundaries placed on free speech should be minimal, but in an increasingly globalized world it must be consistent, minimal and based on treating all equally and with mutual respect.</p>

<p>Rather than hysterically dismissing their calls as leading us down the slippery slope of banning any critical discussion of religion, it would serve us well to engage with the OIC and its supporters in addressing their valid complaints about Islamophobia. This discussion should move from points of agreement to areas of disagreement and work toward developing a new international consensus. Given the existence of similar tensions between religion, hate and free expression in much of the world, the two sides may not be as far apart as many believe.</p>

<p>Is it not time for the community of nations to engage with each other to formulate a new consensus on what is and is not acceptable to the global community? In answering this question, it is important to keep in mind that the only way to ensure universal compliance international norms is by removing the crutch used for so long by opponents &#8212; that the notion of freedom of expression is a uniquely western construct.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.endisolation.org/who-we-are/">Christina Fialho</a> of <a href="http://www.endisolation.org">Community Initiatives for Visiting Immigrants in Confinement</a> speaks out against the isolation of immigrants in confinement across the US...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/christinafialho.jpg" width="120" height="200" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>mmigration detention is one of the least visible societal problems in the US. Few Americans see the slightest hint of it, although close to half a million immigrants are forced into immigration detention annually. The vast majority of Americans are unaware of immigration detention because the system thrives on secrecy. The widespread lack of public awareness of immigration detention has contributed to its expansion. On any given day in 1995, <a href="http://www.ice.gov/doclib/about/offices/odpp/pdf/ice-detention-rpt.pdf">fewer than 7,500</a> [PDF] immigrants were detained. In contrast, <a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/crs/RL32369.pdf">over 32,000</a> [PDF] men and women are in custody on a daily basis today. </p>

<p>This reality is changing. Communities throughout the US participated in the National Visitation Month of Action in December organized by Community Initiatives for Visiting Immigrants in Confinement (CIVIC). December 2012 marks the three-year anniversary of the US immigration detention visitation movement's struggle to end the isolation and abuse of detained immigrants. Over the past few weeks, CIVIC's grassroots, volunteer-based network has led coordinated visits to immigration detention facilities in over 20 cities in 15 states.<br />
  <br />
For the past three years, I have been visiting US immigration detention facilities. The hardships and inconveniences suffered by men and women in immigration detention are unbelievable. Josiah, a father of five US citizen children, lost the use of his leg due to an indescribably grotesque infection during his nine months in a New Jersey detention facility. Lara, a victim of sex trafficking, was detained overnight at an all-male detention facility. Daniel has been in immigration detention for seven years, and no lawyer is available to take his case in Alabama. However, the most intolerable aspect of immigration detention is the denial of basic necessities. Sofia, who was detained for over a year, was denied a mattress to sleep on while in solitary confinement. At a California facility, Anselmo must sleep every night without pillows, which exacerbates his chronic migraines and scoliosis. </p>

<p>Furthermore, the most basic necessity &#8212; fresh air &#8212; is nonexistent at some detention facilities. For instance, the Elizabeth Detention Center in New Jersey does not provide outdoor recreation space. Corrections Corporation of America, a for-profit business, runs the center out of a converted warehouse; the few, small windows throughout the warehouse are near the ceiling, preventing the men detained there from even catching a glimpse of the outside world. Other facilities, such as Delaney Hall, also in New Jersey, are within a few dozen feet of toxic waste sites. The summer heat combined with the foul stench can cause detained immigrants, and visitors alike, to become ill. Of course, not all immigration detention facilities are the same. Many allow for outdoor recreation, provide English as a Second Language (ESL) classes and are run by compassionate men and women. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, I cannot begin to imagine what goes through the minds of men and women in detention when they are first stripped of their clothes and given prison jumpsuits, even though they are being held in non-criminal, administrative confinement. I have been told countless times the worst horror of the immigration detention experience is the sheer fear of the unknown. A few months ago, I met an elderly woman who had been detained the previous night. She did not know where she was or why she was in a jail. </p>

<p>No human being deserves to be cut off from the outside world. This is why citizens across the US are volunteering their time each week to visit and support men and women in US immigration detention. From New York to California, Minnesota to Georgia and Washington to Texas, Americans are standing up and starting visitation programs with CIVIC's support. Visitors offer immigrants in detention an initial point of contact to the outside world. As over 80 percent of immigrants in detention do not have legal counsel, volunteer visitors are often their only connection to the outside world. CIVIC visitors offer sustained one-to-one relationships on a weekly basis, placing CIVIC visitors in a unique position to protect the human rights of individuals in detention, advocate for improvements in detention and ensure that facility staff treat each person with dignity. </p>

<p>Visitation programs also provide the government with a cost-effective solution to expanding services to persons held in immigration detention. Dr. Dora Schriro &#8212; a former appointed Special Adviser to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) &#8212; recommended ICE expand access to visitation in detention. CIVIC can help fulfill this recommendation. As volunteers run visitation programs, ICE and local detention facilities have relatively no overhead cost for providing such a service to persons in immigration detention. </p>

<p>Moreover, visitation programs transform communities. Immigration detention is no longer an invisible practice in communities with active visitation programs. Visitors share first-hand accounts of the immigration detention system with their family, friends, churches and schools. In fact, in the last three years, the visitation movement has grown from four visitation programs to over 20.</p>

<p>However, we must do more. There are <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msa=0&msid=215470556465165809635.0004cbf3e1944017cdf00&hl=en&ie=UTF8&t=m&ll=42.938949,-109.542202&spn=36.725542,80.63383&source=embed">250 detention facilities</a> across the nation. As many of them are in remote places or in unmarked buildings in metropolitan areas, it is possible that one of them is in your backyard.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.regents.ac.uk/home/research/networks_of_power/profiles.aspx">Daniel Aguirre</a> of the Regents College London says that although the recently adopted ASEAN Human Rights Declaration is a significant step forward, much work remains to be done in order to protect human rights in the region...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/DanielAguirre.jpg" width="120" height="200" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n November 18, 2012, the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/asean-adopts-human-rights-declaration.php">put forward</a> the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration ("Declaration") as part of a drive to create an ASEAN community. The promotion of human rights law is new and controversial within the ASEAN mandate. The <a href="http://cil.nus.edu.sg/1967/1967-asean-declaration-signed-on-8-august-1967-by-the-foreign-ministers/">Bangkok Declaration</a> created the organization in 1967 to foster political stability, protect sovereignty and promote economic development. Its membership <a href="http://www.asean.org/asean/asean-member-states">includes</a> Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Brunei Darussalam, Singapore, Indonesia, Myanmar and Vietnam.</p>

<p>Human rights legislation first appeared in November 2007 in the <a href="http://www.asean.org/asean/asean-charter/asean-charter">ASEAN Charter</a>, which was adopted to provide the association a belated legal foundation. It included provisions for an ASEAN human rights body. In 2009, the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission for Human Rights (AICHR) was <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/asean-leaders-establish-human-rights.php">created</a>. The AICHR is faced with the organization's deference to a conservative notion of state sovereignty and its member states' prioritization of foreign investment fuelled economic growth over human rights. Despite these challenges, the adoption of the non-binding declaration signals an historic moment for human rights in Southeast Asia. </p>

<p>The "ASEAN Way" &#8212; a term used to describe the organization's system of cooperation &#8212; has facilitated trust amongst disparate states by avoiding confrontation while promoting consensus and engagement. This commitment is enshrined in the <a href="http://cil.nus.edu.sg/1976/1976-treaty-of-amity-and-cooperation-in-southeast-asia-signed-on-24-february-1976-in-bali-indonesia-by-the-heads-of-stategovernment/">Treaty of Amity and Cooperation of 1976</a>. The ASEAN Charter reiterates this legal entrenchment of the ASEAN Way in its Article 2 making commitments to sovereignty, non-interference and consultative consensus before the principle to respect human rights. This doctrine impedes the implementation of human rights law regionally and allows states to conduct economic development policy, increasingly linked with human rights abuses and environmental degradation without regional oversight and impunity.   </p>

<p>Paradoxically, the organization requires the ASEAN Way in order to cooperate but the doctrine then prevents further integration, especially in terms of human rights. The ASEAN Way came about in order to check the political ambitions of member states and to preserve sovereignty. Members cooperate politically and economically as long as ASEAN does not interfere in their domestic jurisdictions. Yet further regional integration necessitates standardization that is incompatible with ASEAN's traditional approach.</p>

<p>Human rights have never been central to ASEAN. In fact, the organization has traditionally viewed them as foreign, culturally relevant and best dealt with at the national level. But the nature of a functioning human rights protection mechanism is to investigate human rights abuses by states. The ASEAN Way approach undermines this function because monitoring entails interference in domestic affairs to scrutinize national legislation and policy. ASEAN member nations, many of which have poor human rights records and allow no recourse to judicial accountability at the national level, do not accept this. The AICHR terms of reference reflect this and grant no mandate to investigate or enforce human rights law. Civil society's participation has been curtailed. Human rights issues remain an internal matter of domestic jurisdiction, subject to national law and local interpretation. This is human rights law "the ASEAN way."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the AICHR is now a functioning body and touted as a central component of ASEAN despite disagreement between members on what human rights are and opposition to enforcement or even monitoring. The AICHR is a ten-member body, with one representative appointed by each member state to serve three-year, renewable terms. Representatives report to the ASEAN Foreign Ministers. The commission is composed of officials chosen by and accountable to member states, eight of whom held the title of "His Excellency." Only the representatives from Indonesia and Thailand had human rights advocacy experience. While the AICHR can promote ASEAN human rights instruments, raise public awareness and conduct research, the terms of reference do not provide for complaints, monitoring or reporting mechanisms that are essential to the functioning of other regional systems. It has been widely <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/human-rights-organizations-criticize-asean-proposed-rights-protections.php">criticized</a> by civil society <a href="http://www.dvb.no/interview/phil-robertson-%E2%80%98asean-remains-a-toothless-tiger-when-it-comes-to-human-rights%E2%80%99/22110">calling</a> it a toothless watchdog.</p>

<p>The AICHR's first three-year term has been spent trying to agree on the legal nature of human rights, drafting a declaration and formalizing engagement with civil society. The "ASEAN way" relies on consensus decision-making. Cambodia, Laos, Burma and Vietnam &#8212; backed by China &#8212; oppose human rights law as a hindrance to economic development. As a result, the language of the Declaration has been repeatedly watered down as different states opposed different rights. The Declaration has already drawn criticism for subjecting human rights standards to national laws, local cultures, public morality and for not explicitly guaranteeing freedom of assembly while imposing human rights duties on individuals. In addition, two reports commissioned by the AICHR &#8212; one on migrant workers and one on corporate social responsibility &#8212; have been initiated but are incomplete, with few member states contributing.</p>

<p>What does the organization gain from introducing this human rights body? Perhaps the answer is an economic one. The language of international relations, foreign investment and economic development increasingly includes human rights rhetoric. ASEAN's opposition to human rights conditionality may have wavered. ASEAN members can point to the new human rights mechanism as an indication of progress and increased legitimacy without the worries of legal accountability. Even the dictatorship in Burma wrote up a <a href="http://www.burmalibrary.org/docs5/Myanmar_Constitution-2008-en.pdf">new constitution</a> [PDF] and now presides over a semi-democratic parliament. Since then the generals have watched Western politicians and businessmen loosen sanctions and clamor to invest. They will garner vast wealth as local partners for foreign investors. Meanwhile, the AICHR cannot investigate past, present or future human rights violations.</p>

<p>ASEAN's policy with its recalcitrant members has always been one of economic engagement. It is argued that this policy can coax dictatorial states out of isolation. Critics argue that engagement permits human rights violations to continue for decades while regional elites enrich themselves. Either way, these states now seem willing to recognize a regional human rights protection system if it will increases legitimacy and promote foreign investment. In this context, the existence of the AICHR risks legitimizing the status quo. It may provide window dressing that would reduce pressure to reform from other states, from international organizations, and civil society. Human rights treaties serve to signal change. This can result in substantial economic benefits through development aid or foreign investment. Development aid or the proceeds of foreign investment in the hands of extremely corrupted officials &#8212; for example Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar ranking respectively numbers 154, 164 and 180 out of 182 countries in the 2011 <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/183-countries-ranked-in-annual-corruption-index.php">Corruption Perception Index</a> &#8212; can reinforce human rights-violating authoritarian regimes. </p>

<p>The fact that ASEAN has agreed to discuss human rights and recognized a Declaration is a major step forward in the region. Likewise, any institution that can raise awareness of human rights issues in this rapidly developing region is welcome. Local civil society has driven much of this process and is increasingly organized and competent. ASEAN's human rights body must fight to include as much civil society input and cooperation within its mandate as possible in order to create a real ASEAN community. The AICHR has potential to spearhead an awakening of a human rights consciousness but is severely impeded by the power of member states that remain focused on development the ASEAN way. Resource rich regimes are unlikely to voluntarily empower opposition through a potent regional human rights protection mechanism anytime soon. </p>

		<title>Ukrainian National Referendum: Direct Democracy or Constitutional Abuse?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Maksym Popovych, <a href="http://www.ukma.kiev.ua/eng_site/">National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy</a>, discusses the Ukrainian National Referendum Law and decries it as a potentially unconstitutional law that threatens the democratic principle of checks and balances...<hr height='1'><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size='3'><strong>P</strong></font>ublic attention has been growing related to the Ukrainian National Referendum Law, beginning when Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/ukraine-president-approves-law-on-national-referendums.php">signed</a> the controversial act in November 2012. During the last round of voting on the law, 265 deputies supported the draft law. However, years have passed since the registration of this draft in the Verkhovna Rada (the Ukraine's unicameral legislature) and it expressed a great deal of criticism. </p>

<p>The main criticism lies in determining the scope of the national referendums that have been authorized pursuant to the new law. Article 3 of the law defines the scope of such national referendums, which include the adoption of a new constitution, the adoption of any amendments to the existing constitution and the cancellation or adoption of amendments to any Ukrainian law. Although the language of the <a href="http://static.rada.gov.ua/site/const_eng/constitution_eng.htm">Constitution of Ukraine</a> is quite clear in this regard, the Constitutional Court of Ukraine explained in a <a href="http://www.ccu.gov.ua/en/doccatalog/list?currDir=18147">case</a> regarding the adoption of the constitution and laws of Ukraine at a referendum that, by exercising the right to direct democracy, Ukrainian citizens can take part in national and regional referendum to decide any economical, legal, cultural or other issue besides those that are explicitly or implicitly prohibited by the constitution.</p>

<p>While Article 20(1) of the new law limits the scope of such referendums by excluding questions of taxation, budget planning and amnesty, it does not prohibit referendums on those issues that are implicitly eliminated by the constitution from the referendum's scope. This means that from now on Ukrainian people may decide presidential term limits, the composition of the Constitutional Court or the time and format of public elections. </p>

<p>It would be an understatement to call the law unconstitutional.</p>

<p>Another controversy revolves around the format of these national referendums. The new law does not provide any limitations on the quantity or subject matter of questions raised in a referendum. This means that every Ukrainian can choose international policy for a few decades, determine the presidential term and decriminalize rape on the same, single voting sheet. Would anybody call this a promotion of effective direct democracy? In fact, the law is in complete conflict with the position of the Council of Europe, expressed in the Parliamentary Assembly's <a href="http://assembly.coe.int/ASP/Doc/XrefViewPDF.asp?FileID=16532&Language=EN">Resolution 1121</a>. The Resolution calls upon states to "limit the number of subjects per referendum to be held the same day in order to clarify the debates on the documents subjected to a vote and to help citizens to reach a decision[.]" Indeed, the new law seems to be designed to eliminate any debate on the pending matters and to prevent people from receiving adequate and decent information on the questions they are to decide at referendum.</p>

<p>Probably, the most tendentious provision of the new law is Article 3(3), which creates a legal basis for the adoption of a new constitution by referendum. In the <a href="http://www.ccu.gov.ua/en/doccatalog/list?currDir=24333">case</a> of Ukrainian referendums on people's initiative, the Constitutional Court examined the constitutionality of the question: "Do you agree that the Constitution of Ukraine that will be adopted at the national referendum?" The court reached the conclusion that that given question excludes the very issue of necessity in adopting a new Constitution and, thus, declared the question unconstitutional.</p>

<p>The ambiguity in the law can be easily illustrated by the proposed model of verifying results of a referendum, which removes the parliament from the process. Pursuant to Article 15(7), the results are upheld by presidential act. On the contrary, Verkhovna Rada's involvement can only be characterized as insignificant. The Central Judicial Office of Verkhovna Rada noted that the provisions of the law dealing with presidential powers are in conflict with the constitutional requirement of the Parliament's involvement in the process of adopting constitutional amendments. Moreover, the Constitutional Court noted in a <a href="http://www.ccu.gov.ua/en/doccatalog/list?currDir=12345">case</a> on guarantees of activities of national deputies of Ukraine that the list of presidential powers enumerated in the Constitution is exhaustive, thus making it unconstitutional to vest any additional powers by law. Apparently, the new law disregards this legal position.</p>

<p>A number of controversies rise in the context of referendum procedures. According to Article 22(8), it is the president of Ukraine and the Central Election Commission who has the power to examine the constitutionality of the subject matter of any referendum. This could potentially be seen as limiting the powers of the Constitutional Court with regard to constitutional interpretation, which is certainly unconstitutional. Excluding judicial or legislative organs from this process and creating new control mechanisms for administrative agencies can barely be regarded as creating legal guaranties for direct democracy.</p>

<p>Finally, it is necessary to look at Article 74(2), which prohibits the media from imparting information concerning referendum questions to the public, unless they sign a contract with a pressure group and receive funding from one. To smash the media completely, the law has given the Central Election Commission the power to supervise and monitor media involvement. This provision is providing a method for direct and unjustified state interference in a referendum campaign. Furthermore, these limits do not only affect the media. In fact, political parties and non-governmental organizations are not recognized as subjects of the referendum initiative. This leads to unreasonable presidential discretion with regard to referendum proposals. Moreover, according to Article 31(2) the Central Election Commission has even wider discretion with regard to pressure group registration. The law does not specify the reasons for the denial of such registrations and, thus, vesting an unlimited amount of influence in the Commission.</p>

<p>The above-examined flaws of the new law kindle doubts as to the possible usage of this legal framework to legitimize the abuse of power and elimination of what is left of checks and balances in the government of the Ukraine. The Ukrainian opposition has already <a href="http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/yanukovych-signs-law-on-national-referendums-316772.html">expressed</a> their intention to bring the matter before the Constitutional Court of Ukraine to declare the law unconstitutional, although they have also <a href="http://www.unian.ua/news/537967-opozitsiya-oskarjit-referendum-u-ks.html">noted </a> that the Constitutional Court's impartiality on the matter is questionable.</p>

<p>The Venice Commission is now examining the new law. While the final decision is yet to be made, the secretary of the commission confirmed the European disquiet with regard to the possibility of altering the constitutional order in Ukraine. In any event, even a brief analysis of this law raises a range of reasonable doubts as to the declared aim of direct democratic development in Ukraine.</p>

How did the nation's most rural state come to support marriage licensing for same-sex couples by a margin of <a href="http://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/prior12-13.htm#nov">53 percent to 47 percent</a> in November, particularly after <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/maine-voters-veto-same-sex-marriage.php">voting against</a> marriage in 2009? This vote came from a citizen's initiative petition for a law which had been signed by over 105,000 voters and certified by the state's secretary of state. Of the three states that passed marriage measures in November, Maine's was the only initiative. Citizens in Maryland and Washington state also <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/maine-maryland-voters-approve-same-sex-marriage.php">voted</a>, as did citizens in Maine's 2009 referendum, whether or not to repeal a legislative enactment.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/bills/bills_125th/billtexts/IB000301.asp">new law's</a> title is crisp and descriptive: "An Act to Allow Marriage Licenses for Same Sex Couples and Protect Religious Freedom." The reference to "marriage licenses" clearly connotes that only civil marriage and not religious marriage is at issue &#8212; a point of confusion for voters in 2009. The initiative allowed marriage for same-sex couples, added a religious exemption and repealed operative parts of a <a href="http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/statutes/19-a/title19-Asec650.html">marriage ban</a> enacted in 1997.</p>

<p>The law's title clearly identified that initiative proponents were supporters of religious freedom. In substance, the law clarified that clergy and religious institutions could refuse to perform or host marriages in accord with their religious beliefs. The lead signer of the initiative, a Methodist minister whose own church opposes religious marriage rites for same-sex couples, <a href="http://www.mpbn.net/Home/tabid/36/ctl/ViewItem/mid/3478/ItemId/22368/Default.aspx">cited</a> the religious exemption as crucial to clergy support. The religious exemption sets forth existing <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> protections allowing religious denominations to make their own choices about what marriages to perform, and it provides that no church or religious institution must "host" any marriage &#8212; even when that institution rents its facilities to the general public. Underscoring the point, a religious institution's refusal to "perform or host" a marriage "cannot be the basis for a lawsuit or liability and does not affect the tax exempt status" of the religious institution in question. Apart from this minor modification to the non-discrimination law in public accommodations, existing non-discrimination laws affecting housing, public accommodations, credit and employment stayed on the books, unchanged.</p>

<p>A little background highlights the significance of the vote. The 1997 state ban on same-sex marriage, an initiative sponsored by "Concerned Maine Families," had been devised specifically to "inoculate" the state from the "threat" of "same-sex marriage." As other groups did in other states, "Concerned Maine Families" argued that the 1993 Hawaii Supreme Court decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9275123432984088983">Baehr v. Lewin</a>, which came near to allowing marriage for same-sex couples, created an urgent need for "protection." After the group gathered sufficient signatures to force a vote, the legislature was required either to pass it and bypass the vote, or reject it and allow the vote to go forward. The legislature passed the law and then-Governor Angus King (now a US Senator) let it become law without his signature.</p>

<p>Rather than mount a state constitutional challenge to the new law, supporters of marriage equality organized and worked hard for the next fifteen years to win the "hearts and minds" of the people with a variety of legislative and public engagement efforts. Advocates' first major victory on marriage was followed by painful defeat. In 2009, the Maine legislature repealed the 1997 law and became the first state in the nation to <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/maine-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage.php">pass</a> a marriage law and have it signed by the governor. Opponents promptly initiated a "people's veto" repeal referendum, blocking it from going into effect. After a campaign featuring television ads claiming that "homosexual marriage" would be taught in schools, that churches could lose their tax-exempt status, and that a flood of lawsuits would ensue, voters in 2009 <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/maine-voters-veto-same-sex-marriage.php">repealed</a> the law by a margin of 53 percent to 47 percent.</p>

<p>Advocates learned important lessons in that vote. In early 2010, they started a state-wide effort to have conversations with conflicted or unsupportive voters focusing on finding common ground and shared values about why marriage matters. Ultimately, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/25/us/politics/second-time-around-hope-for-gay-marriage-in-maine.html">largely volunteer effort</a> resulted in over 160,000 <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2012/11/18/maine-gay-marriage-vote-model-for-ballot-persuasion/gnRDt11TvPT0M7ArSwCH0K/story.html">conversations</a> with those conflicted or unsupportive voters &#8212; 17 percent of all registered voters. Advocates discovered many unlikely supporters along the way. Some were later featured in television ads expressing their love for their gay family members or friends and their wish that they could share in the freedom to marry. The ads featured a World War II veteran and his wife at the dining room table with four generations of their family talking about their lesbian granddaughter and her partner, firefighters talking about one of their brothers on the force and an Episcopal priest whose son had just returned from military service in Iraq but who did not himself enjoy the freedom to marry here at home. One rural father and his wife simply <a href="http://bangordailynews.com/2012/08/21/politics/new-pro-gay-marriage-ad-features-monroe-couple/">stated</a>: "We have a set of twin boys [who are now adults], one is straight, one is gay [and] marriage matters to both of them." A large and diverse coalition, including the Religious Coalition Against Discrimination and Catholics for Marriage Equality, played a visible role in the campaign. The campaign focused on love, family and commitment rather than rights or legal equality. </p>

<p>Does the Maine vote mark a turning point in the national quest for same-sex couples to marry? The Maine vote certainly is significant, and reflects amazing change over a decade and a half. But nothing is inevitable. Turnout was high from the presidential election with a president popular in Maine who had recently come to support marriage and shared his own journey in arriving at that support. (President Barack Obama won <a href="http://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/prior12-13.htm#nov">Maine's popular vote</a> with a margin of 56 percent to 41 percent). Also, Mainers are more accustomed to voting on issues pertaining to the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) citizenry, since anti-gay groups have forced popular votes on legislation for over 20 years.</p>

<p>Maine provides a powerful example that a citizens' initiative petition can be used to grant rights at the ballot box rather than to preempt protections or reverse rights granted by legislatures, marking a huge milestone and creating momentum for other states. The example of Maine shows both that enough voters can be persuaded to support marriage equality to win, even in some surprising places. It also shows that superb ground organization and tenacious, consistent work are essential for victory.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.cato.org/people/louise-bennetts">Louise Bennetts</a> of the <a href="http://www.cato.org">Cato Institute</a> gives a critique of Dodd-Frank and argues that recent regulatory trends are incompatible with a rule-based system...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/louise_bennetts.jpg" width="120" height="200" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>t seems that "rules-based" is the new DC buzz phrase. There is little disagreement that a "rules-based" approach to financial regulation generates better outcomes than does one based on bureaucratic discretion or amorphous "principles."  The thousands of pages of "rules" released under the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ203/pdf/PLAW-111publ203.pdf">Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act</a> [PDF] may lead a reasonable person to assume that we have entered an era where rules reign supreme. Upon closer inspection, however, many of these rules are "RINOs" &#8212; Rules in Name Only &#8212; or, put differently, discretion masquerading as rules.<br />
 <br />
Badly drafted statutes seldom result in good regulations, and Dodd-Frank is no exception. Rather than setting a clear mandate for regulators, Dodd-Frank <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/obama-signs-financial-reform-legislation.php">creates</a> a framework, underpinned by objectives and principles &#8212; often inconsistent &#8212; and gives regulators considerable leeway to implement the provisions as they see fit.<br />
 <br />
A key foundation of any rule-based system is that the outcomes should be the same regardless of who is enforcing the rule. Well-drafted rules minimize the temptation of regulators to pick winners and losers in the marketplace. Yet, under Dodd-Frank, outcomes will depend on who sits in the driver's seat at the major regulatory agencies. Many of Dodd-Frank's provisions are triggered by a determination of what has become known as "systemic importance." This concept is so poorly-defined and nebulous that even Paul Volcker has described it as "fuzzy." Dodd-Frank makes vague references to institutions whose failure "could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States." However, any potential threat is in the eye of the beholder, and one regulator's "systemic event" may be another's market correction.<br />
 <br />
Additionally, Dodd-Frank's central pillar and the public's security against future bail-outs, the Orderly Liquidation Authority, gives the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation &#8212; at the direction of the treasury secretary &#8212; the power to liquidate financial companies, bypassing the usual bankruptcy process. However, glaringly absent are both meaningful guidelines as to when this authority should be invoked and, once invoked, clear limitations on regulatory action. Given the absolute discretion that regulators have to use this tool, the question is: will they? Historical precedent suggests not. Seemingly no treasury secretary would want to initiate the failure of a major financial company. Also, it must not be forgotten that the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are subject to their own dedicated insolvency regime that is still begging to be used.<br />
 <br />
In a rule-based system, it must be clear which agency has the authority to draft rules, implement them and monitor compliance. Dodd-Frank gives multiple agencies overlapping jurisdiction over everything from living wills to derivatives regulation. Case in point: two competing initial drafts of the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/president-obama-proposes-new-banking.php">Volcker Rule</a> &#8212; messy enough without the complication of multiple versions &#8212; were released. This sets the stage for a turf war among the agencies involved, as well as a general lack of accountability. For companies, adherence to rules is difficult when they do not even know which regulator they are supposed to report to.<br />
 <br />
Adding to the uncertainty is a recent agency trend to release regulations as "guidance" rather than rules, which is preferential from the regulator's perspective. It does not require the standard public notice and comment periods. It affords regulators maximum discretion to change the guidance without going through a formal revision process. Most importantly, it is far more difficult for market participants who feel that an agency has overstepped its authority to challenge regulatory guidance in the courts. Notably, this trend comes hot on the heels of a federal court <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/89BE4D084BA5EBDA852578D5004FBBBE/$file/10-1305-1320103.pdf">decision</a> [PDF] <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-appeals-court-throws-out-sec-proxy-access-rule.php">striking down</a> a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proxy rule, deemed to be "arbitrary and capricious." It seems that regulators are anxious to avoid a repeat of the SEC debacle. <br />
 <br />
The broad discretion that Dodd-Frank accords to regulators is as much by design as it is by accident. We cannot know where the next financial crisis will come from or what new products the sector will develop, the theory went, so we need to give regulators as much flexibility as possible. But flexibility comes at a cost. The financial industry's major regulators now have jurisdiction over products and firms that they have no experience monitoring. If regulators do not understand financial firms and products well enough to develop a coherent set of rules, why are they regulating them in the first place?<br />
 <br />
Giving regulators too much discretion creates uncertainty, and while uncertainty in the market is a fact of life, uncertainty in regulations is costly and ultimately self-defeating. We have had 70 years of the rule of the regulator, with decidedly mixed results. Perhaps it is time to give the rule of law a chance.</p>

The initial working capital of the bank is, under Article 3 of the law, 50 billion Iraqi dinars (roughly $43 million), and it can be raised from time to time from resources that the bank itself develops. The purpose of the bank, under Article 2 of the law, is to "provide financial and banking services consonant with the rulings of the Islamic shari'a and the development of the Iraqi economy." In a concluding paragraph offering reasons for enacting the legislation, it is said that it stems in part from a "desire of a broad slice of citizens in obtaining banking services that accord with the Islamic shari'a." The law is, thus, the first, major, public effort of the Iraqi government to enter into the rising field of Islamic finance.</p>

<p>On the surface, there is nothing particularly surprising about this. Article 2 of the <a href="http://www.uniraq.org/documents/iraqi_constitution.pdf">Iraqi Constitution</a>  [PDF] does provide for a robust role for Islam in the legal order of the state after all, declaring it not only the religion of the state, but also "a foundational source of legislation." The same Article further obligates the state to guarantee the sustainment of the Islamic identity of Iraq's Muslim majority population. The creation of the Islamic bank is certainly very much in line with these commitments.</p>

<p>Yet, two interesting questions arise from the law that created the bank. The first of these becomes apparent when one compares the language of Article 2 of the new law with Article 2 of the constitution. The latter not only establishes Islam as foundational source of legislation, but it also prohibits the enactment of any law that violates the "settled rulings" of Islam. The former calls for the establishment of a bank whose services are "consonant with the rulings of the Islamic shari'a[.]" If the purpose of the new bank is to create an institution which operates in a manner that is consonant with shari'a, would that not mean that existing banks operate by rules that are not consonant with the rules of the Islamic shari'a? Indeed, this would be the conclusion of the majority of Iraq's authoritative juristic and scholarly authorities on Islam, given that conventional Iraqi banks routinely take and pay interest. Moreover, the only sensible reason to establish an Islamic bank would be if other, existing banks were not Islamic.</p>

<p>Yet if this is so, how can the laws within Iraq that specifically authorize the taking and paying of interest on the part of institutions and individuals alike be permitted to stand? If the state may enact the law establishing the Islamic Bank of Mesopotamia under the Islamizing provisions of Article 2, must the Federal Supreme Court of Iraq also strike down the laws authorizing any other non-Islamic banking institutions?</p>

<p>If the life of the law were driven by logic rather than experience, the answer would surely be "yes" &#8212; there is no basis upon which to conclude that one part of Article 2 of the Constitution is somehow more effective than any other part of it. But it is hard to imagine that the Federal Supreme Court would, or could, ever take such a step given the almost certain disastrous effect on the Iraqi economy if it did. The major constitutional court in the region to have heard a claim on the Islamicity of interest &#8212; the Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt &#8212; managed to avoid the problem of declaring interest void by an artful dodge, effectively <a href="http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3381676?uid=3739256&uid=2134&uid=2129&uid=2&uid=70&uid=4&sid=21101547285301">indicating</a> that any laws that were un-Islamic were immunized from the effect of a subsequent amendment requiring the law to conform to Islamic dictate. There is no indication from its current case law that suggests that the Iraqi Federal Supreme Court finds such strained reasoning particularly appealing. It is also apparent, as I have indicated in an <a href="/forum/2012/04/haider-hamoudi-iraq-islam.php">earlier piece</a>, that the Federal Supreme Court has always found ways to uphold older legislation as against an Islamicity test, often by avoiding the issue rather than actually evaluating the law on the basis of its consistency with Islam. It seems almost certain that the court would do the same in this instance, either not dealing with any case that sought to challenge interest or finding a way to dispose of the case without deciding that issue. Certainly it is rather noteworthy that none of Iraq's premier Islamist parties have made an interest ban a noticeable part of their legislative agenda, making it all the easier for the Court not to deal with the problem.</p>

<p>The second interesting point in the law is the tangential role that religious scholars and religious institutions play in the operation of the bank. Article 1(3) requires the director general of the bank to have a college degree and experience in banking, but not necessarily Islamic jurisprudence generally or Islamic finance specifically. The same is true for four of the six members of the board of directors. Even as to the other two members, where some experience in Islamic finance is necessary, the reference is remarkably ecumenical. These individuals do not need to be graduates of any particular seminary or have any particular level of religious knowledge, they merely need to have "experience and specialization in Islamic economics," broadly speaking. Moreover, they are appointed by the director general, who might know next to nothing about the <em>shari'a</em>.</p>

<p>One may contrast this against the recently enacted laws administering the <em>waqfs</em>, or Islamic charitable trusts. There are two such laws for Muslims &#8212; one for the Shi'a and one for the Sunnis. The head of the bureaus administering Sunni and Shi'a <em>waqfs</em> respectively cannot even be appointed unless approved the relevant non-state religious authorities. In the case of the Shi'a Waqf Bureau, this gives Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani formal veto power over the appointment of a state official. Each law moreover requires three other members of the board of the relevant Bureau to be jurists of sound reputation selected by the head of the Bureau, who is, as noted, already vetted by the highest relevant religious authorities.</p>

<p>The contrast between the operation of these Islamic institutions and the Islamic Bank of Mesopotamia is rather surprising. Indeed, the level of representation of Islamic experts on the Islamic bank is less than the level of representation of such experts that some Islamist parties seek on the Federal Supreme Court, despite the fact that the latter is not an Islamic institution at all.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the reasons have to do with legislative awareness of the manner in which Islamic finance operates, relative to the methods used to organize Islamic institutions and projects elsewhere in Iraqi society. Generally speaking, when Shi'a Islamists in particular are interested in rendering the <em>shari'a</em> more prominent in the lives of Iraqis, this is done through calling for more deference to the rulings of the authoritative jurists who preside over the Shi'a seminaries in Najaf. In the case of family law, such deference is achieved through a (as yet unimplemented) call to permit Iraqis to follow juristic rulings rather than state law in the area. In the case of the <em>waqfs</em>, it is achieved through formalizing a role for these non-state actors in state administration.</p>

<p>Yet Islamic finance does not in fact organize itself in this manner, and deference to the rules of any single jurist would simply not be in keeping with the practices of this now global autonomously functioning industry. Instead, the industry adopts a patchwork of rules and regulations derived from the rulings of medieval and modern jurists of various schools of thought. Indeed, it must do this to preserve the flexibility necessary to function in a modern economic setting. Even with such flexibility, derogation from some Islamic rules is almost inevitable. The Iraqi legislators were merely recognizing this reality by having ecumenical experts appointed, and rendering them a clear minority and therefore unable to impede the bank's activities even if they did find a particular practice un-Islamic.</p>

<p>As with the failure of the state to ban interest, there is very little that is logical, or coherent, in the state's sanctioned approach to operation of the Islamic Bank of Mesopotamia. It makes little sense for Shi'a Islamists to support the creation of a bank that operates through an amalgam of rules of different jurists from different schools of thought while describing as un-Islamic a <a href="http://apps.americanbar.org/rol/publications/iraq_personal_status_law_1959_english_translation.pdf">Personal Status Code</a> [PDF] organizing the law of the family and inheritance that does precisely the same thing in a different area of law. Yet this is precisely what has been done. It is another demonstration of the deep levels of nuance, complexity and, indeed, self-contradiction that color the issue of the role of Islam in the Iraq's legal and constitutional infrastructure.</p>

		<title>Contraceptives and the ACA: Going Over the Mandate Cliff</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.cato.org/people/ilya-shapiro">Ilya Shapiro</a>, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the <a href="http://www.cato.org/">Cato Institute</a>, says that the ACA's contraception mandate unduly infringes on the First Amendment...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src=" /hotline/ilyashapiro.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>S</strong></font>oon after the enactment of the <a href="/feature/featured/health-care-reform/">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010</a> (ACA), or Obamacare, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that qualifying health insurance plans under the law would have to cover contraceptives and "morning after" pills. Many religious institutions &#8212; most notably the Catholic Church &#8212; <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-court-blocks-contraception-mandate-for-construction-company-over-religious-objections.php">objected</a> to being forced to fund products and procedures that offend their religious beliefs. This particular mandate may be among the less costly parts of the Affordable Care Act &#8212; as we learned from the <a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/02/boehner-condemns-limbaughs-comments/">Sandra Fluke imbroglio</a>, birth control isn't that expensive &#8212; but it certainly struck a nerve and is the subject of much of the "second wave" of Obamacare litigation.</p>

<p>In August 2011, HHS bowed to political pressure and provided exemptions to certain religious organizations, those that only serve people of their own faith and are engaged only in religious activities. That is, the exemption covers churches &#8212; presumably only churches that don't provide social services &#8212; but not the panoply of religious institutions, such as schools and hospitals, that aren't purely worship institutions. And it certainly doesn't exempt businesses run by religious people, whose objections are identical: being forced by the government to do something against their religion as a condition of continuing in operation.</p>

<p>Accordingly, more than 40 cases challenging the <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/state-ags-file-suit-to-block-new-contraception-mandates.php">challenging the contraceptive mandate</a> are now active across the country by various individuals, religious institutions, nonprofit organizations and small businesses. <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to-health-care-contraception-provision.php">District courts</a> have split on the lawsuits, though many have dismissed them as being premature &#8212; because final regulation have not yet been promulgated and the mandate only went into effect this past New Year's Day.</p>

<p>Two of those suits were consolidated late last year for the first appellate argument on the issue: one <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=wheaton+college&hl=en&as_sdt=4,77,130,140&case=3761212800546416278&scilh=0">brought</a> by Wheaton College, a Christian liberal arts college in Illinois, and another <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3624232496134251783&scilh=0">brought</a> by Belmont Abbey College, a North Carolina college based around a Benedictine abbey. The legal point here is somewhat technical, but incredibly important for anyone who thinks his freedom of conscience may be violated by the government in the future (a category that includes essentially everyone). </p>

<p>As noted above, the contraception mandate came to include a narrow exemption for religious institutions, one that wasn't available to religiously affiliated colleges. After the strong backlash against even that "narrowed" mandate, HHS issued a "safe harbor statement," saying that the government wouldn't enforce the mandate for a year (until August 2013) against certain nonprofit organizations religiously opposed to covering contraception. In other words, the contraception mandate is still in place but just won't be enforced &#8212; but only for a year and individuals are still free to sue to enforce it against their religiously opposed employers. </p>

<p>HHS also issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) that announced the department's consideration of more permanent methods of accommodating religious institutions. Because of the safe harbor notice and the ANPRM, the district court dismissed the colleges' lawsuits for lack of standing and ripeness, holding that the colleges weren't suffering any injury and it was too early to challenge the proposed rule. The case thus went to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, where the colleges argued at a December 14 hearing that they are in fact suffering a current injury &#8212; having to plan for a Hobson's choice &#8212; and that the mere possibility of a future accommodation is too remote to terminate their case. </p>

<p>The Cato Institue  filed an <a href="http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/Wheaton-College-filed-brief.pdf">amicus brief</a> [PDF] supporting the colleges in that technical argument, joining the Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence and the American Civil Rights Union. We argued that the trial court misapplied the constitutional test for standing by not focusing on the facts that existed at the outset of the case; subsequent government actions, such as the ANPRM, are irrelevant to the preliminary question of standing. We also argued that the district court's ruling compromises the principle of separation of powers by allowing the executive branch to strip a court of jurisdiction merely by issuing a safe harbor pronouncement and an ANPRM (which doesn't legally bind an agency to act in any way). It was thus entirely speculative whether the agency would alleviate the harms that the colleges are suffering. </p>

<p>Without intervention from the courts, therefore, the colleges would be left in legal limbo while facing immediate and undeniable harms to their religious freedom: On one hand, they can't challenge the constitutionality of a final regulation. On the other, they can't very well rely on a proposed regulatory amendment that may be offered at some unknown point in the future. The trial court rulings in the Wheaton College and Belmont Abbey College cases were thus frightening examples of judicial abdication that permit the expansion of executive power far beyond its constitutional limits.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the circuit court agreed. In a brisk three-page <a href="http://www.becketfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DC-Order1.pdf">opinion</a> [PDF] released December 18 (four days after argument), the <em>per curiam</em> court held as follows: (1) the colleges have standing because that's assessed at the time lawsuits are filed (here, before the ANPRM); (2) the government's representation that the rule would never be enforced in its current form is "binding"; and (3) the government must update the court every 60 days. Accordingly, the lawsuits shouldn't have been dismissed and are instead to be held "in abeyance" pending "the new rule that the government has promised will be issued soon."</p>

<p>Assuming that the government doesn't act in contempt of court, religiously affiliated nonprofits &#8212; or service organizations, or whatever the final wording will be &#8212; will thus join religious-worship institutions as exempt from the mandate.</p>

<p>But that's not the end of the matter. Employers engaged in for-profit activity, including those who have the exact same objections as Wheaton and Belmont Abbey, will still be forced to choose between continuing their business and maintaining their religious principles. Most notable among these companies is Oklahoma-based Hobby Lobby, Inc., the art-and-crafts chain that employs 21,000 people and has well over $2 billion in annual revenues.</p>

<p>Hobby Lobby <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=hobby+lobby+aca&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=11193347871033276555&scilh=0">lost</a> its motion for a preliminary injunction against the mandate, the Tenth Circuit declined to issue an injunction pending appeal, and, on December 26 &#8212; coincidentally St. Stephen's Day, honoring Christianity's first martyr &#8212; Justice Sotomayor (as circuit justice) <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-justice-denies-injunction-against-contraceptive-coverage-mandate.php">declined</a> to provide such an injunction as well. Thus, when the mandate went into effect last week, Hobby Lobby became potentially subject more than $1 million in daily fines.</p>

<p>That's a shame. If we're to respect religious belief, why does the motive of those espousing them matter for whether the government gets to trample them? The owners of Hobby Lobby donate plenty to charity out of the profits they make, possibly having greater impact than many of the nonprofits that are (or will be) exempt. Dven if they didn't, however, this country was founded on ideals of religious liberty that went on to be enshrined in the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment">First Amendment</a>, so why would we just ignore them?</p>

<p>Indeed, when one of these lawsuits finally reaches the Supreme Court &#8212; which it will unless at least this part of Obamacare is repealed &#8212; the plaintiffs should win without even getting to the constitutional claims. That's because the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000bb">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a> prohibits the government from placing a "substantial burden" on the exercise of religion unless it has a "compelling interest" and uses the "least restrictive means" to achieve it.</p>

<p>Americans understand that the essence of religious freedom is that government can't force people to do things that violate their religious beliefs. Some may argue that there's a conflict here between religious freedom and women's rights, but that's a "false choice" &#8212; as the president himself like to call such things. If the HHS rule is repealed, women will still be perfectly free to obtain contraceptives, abortions and whatever else isn't against the law. They just won't be able to force others to pay for them.</p>

<p>But there's an even bigger issue here. This is just the latest example of the difficulties in turning health care &#8212; or increasing parts of our economy more broadly &#8212; over to the government. As my colleague Roger Pilon has <a href="http://www.politico.com/arena/perm/Roger_Pilon_2512A673-DCE4-4698-959D-DD00F212A676.html">written</a>, when health care (or anything) is socialized or treated as a public utility, we're forced to fight for every "carve-out" of liberty. Those progressive Catholics who supported Obamacare, or the pro-life Democrats who voted for it, who are now appalled by certain HHS rules should have thought of that before they used the government to make us our brother's keeper.</p>

<p>The more government controls &#8212; whether health care, education, or even marriage &#8212; the greater the battles over conflicting values. With certain things, such as national defense, basic infrastructure, clean air and water and other "public goods," we largely agree, at least inside reasonable margins. But we have vast disagreements about social programs, economic regulation and so much else that government now dominates at the expense of <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2012/02/15/how-the-bishops-undermined-individual-responsibility/comment-page-1/#comment-677607">at the expense of individual liberty</a>. Those supporting Wheaton and Belmont Abbey Colleges and Hobby Lobby are rightly concerned that people are being forced to do what their religious beliefs prohibit. But that all comes with the collectivized territory.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/about-us/staff/gabor-rona/">Gabor Rona</a>, International Legal Director of <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/">Human Rights First</a>, says that the Obama administration must place an enhanced focus on disclosing its drone policy...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/gaborrona_resize.jpg" width="120" height="178" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>ur government executes death sentences against people who have not been charged, tried or sentenced in a judicial process &#8212; or met on an actual battlefield. Officials from the administration of US President Barack Obama have been drip-feeding defenses of the practice but have not provided nearly enough detail to truly justify it. Meanwhile, the judicial branch has consistently rejected efforts to force the administration to say anything more about the practice than it wants to. That is a shame because, in a democracy governed by the rule of law, we, the people, are surely entitled to know who our government is extrajudicially killing in our name, and why. <br />
 <br />
On January 2, 2013, Judge Colleen McMahon of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-judge-denies-request-for-information-on-targeted-killings.php">offered</a> a bittersweet recognition of all this in a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the <em>New York Times</em>, which sued for disclosure of the legal memoranda produced by the Obama administration to justify its drone war. The plaintiffs' argument was that the government had effectively waived its defense that the classified materials were subject to FOIA exemptions by having publicly disclosed the existence and some details of the classified drone program. McMahon disagreed, noting how paltry those public disclosures have been in comparison to what a studied analysis and debate would require: "a far cry from a legal research memorandum,"  "cryptic and imprecise," wrote McMahon. Essentially, the government is not required to "show more leg" because it has not voluntarily shown enough of it.</p>

<p>While making explicit reference to a "catch-22" and the "Alice-in-Wonderland" nature of her ruling, she said that she was constrained by law from preventing the government "to proclaim as perfectly lawful certain actions that seem on their face incompatible with our <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/">Constitution</a> and laws, while keeping the reasons for their conclusion a secret."</p>

<p>That did not, however, prevent McMahon from volunteering an observation:<blockquote>More fulsome disclosure of the legal reasoning on which the administration relies to justify the targeted killing of individuals, including US citizens, far from any recognizable "hot" field of battle, would allow for intelligent discussion and assessment of a tactic that (like torture before it) remains hotly debated.</blockquote>Meanwhile, a recent <em>New York Times</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/world/white-house-presses-for-drone-rule-book.html?ref=scottshane&_r=1&">article</a> highlights that after four years of dealing death by drone, the Obama administration was suddenly motivated to establish more detailed rules and procedures out of pre-election fears that a Romney administration could not be trusted to use this power judiciously. Actually, what the lack of detailed rules and procedures shows is simply that &#8212; a lack of detailed rules and procedures, reflecting the administration's "just trust us" attitude.<br />
 <br />
Into this mess comes the account of a drone attack that challenges the administration's mantra of "legal, effective and necessary." Adam Baron, writing for <em>McClatchly Newspapers</em>, <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2012/11/28/175794/family-neighbors-of-yemeni-killed.html">reported</a> on a November 7, 2012, a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) drone killing in Yemen of an alleged al Qaida adherent, Adnan al Qadhi. Baron's account contains no denial of al Qadhi's al Qaida sympathies. Instead, it asks why this man, who has previously been arrested and was well-known in his community &#8212; a community that, by the way, is nine miles from the capital and is home to the former president and much of the military's leadership &#8212; was extrajudicially executed instead of arrested. By contrast, the <em>Washington Post</em> recently reported the arrest in Yemen of another al Qaida suspect, Suleiman Hassan Mohammed Murshed Awad, who Yemen's Interior Ministry <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/yemen-says-it-has-arrested-al-qaida-leader">called</a> "one of the most dangerous criminal elements in al Qaida who is involved in killing security men and joining others in terrorist attacks on foreign targets in Sanaa."<br />
 <br />
It is true that under the law of armed conflict, members of opposing armed forces and even civilians who are directly participating in hostilities may be targeted. However, putting aside the fundamental question of whether the US is even at war in Yemen, or whether Adnan al Qadhi meets targeting criteria as an enemy in a conventional conflict, consider what then-Pentagon General Counsel Jeh Johnson recently <a href="http://www.lawfareblog.com/2012/11/jeh-johnson-speech-at-the-oxford-union/">said</a> at Oxford University:<blockquote>[W]e refuse to allow this enemy, with its contemptible tactics, to define the way in which we wage war. Our efforts remain grounded in the rule of law. In this unconventional conflict, therefore, we apply conventional legal principles &#8212; conventional legal principles found in treaties and customary international law ... We employ lethal force, but in a manner consistent with the law of war principles of proportionality, necessity and distinction.</blockquote>The key here is the principle of military necessity, meaning that the use of force must be necessary to the accomplishment of a legitimate military objective. In a conventional conflict, military necessity is pretty much assured where combatant confronts combatant on the battlefield. The American and German soldiers who met on the beaches of Normandy were not required to ask their opposite numbers if they wished to surrender before opening fire on them. <br />
 <br />
However, in conflict against non-state actors that looks much more like a hybrid between war and law enforcement (and occurs outside of a traditional battlefield), it is not so simple. In fact, it is &#8212; and should be &#8212; difficult to make the case that the "conventional legal principle (of military necessity) found in treaties and customary international law" is satisfied in targeting someone who is eminently detainable outside of a traditional battlefield.  Indeed, Baron's account notes that "American counterterrorism officials have painted drone strikes as a tool of last resort, utilized only when targets represent an imminent threat and are nearly impossible to take out by other means." That would be a proper rule of engagement under these unconventional circumstances.<br />
 <br />
Because that is a correct rule of engagement under international law, the targeted killing of al Qadhi tells us much more than could any mere dispute about whether someone was correctly or incorrectly labeled a bad guy. It tells us that the Obama administration has a long way to go before it can assure the American people, the international community and itself that its targeted killing practices are legal.<br />
 <br />
Legality, however, is not the only issue. Baron notes that the strike has sown resentment, indeed, "local outrage" in Beit al Ahmar. He says that al Qadhi's brother openly speaks of revenge. "Any action has a reaction. Any violence will breed violence," another local is reported to have said. Even if the strike was legal, it is quite something else to say that the killing of Adnan al Qadhi is a net advance in the fight against terrorism.<br />
 <br />
The dictates of law and sound national security policy lead to several questions about US targeted killing, questions that should be put to Chuck Hagel and John Brennan in their confirmation proceedings for secretary of defense and director of the CIA. </p>

<p>First, should an inherently non-transparent agency such as the CIA, whose traditional legitimate role is intelligence gathering, and whose forays into killing have always ended in tears for human rights as well as for legitimate US policy interests, be involved in killing at all?</p>

<p>Second, does the US targeted killing program risk creating a dangerous precedent in other countries that have this technology, such as Iran, Russia and China, or others that will soon have it? Is the US prepared to reap what it sows, or will it add one more basis for others to accuse it of hypocrisy when it criticizes other countries' targeted killing practices (as it used to in the case of Israel before <a href="/feature/2011/09/9-11.php">9/11</a>)?</p>

<p>Third, with whom is the US at war? With everyone who would do us harm, or against all terrorists, including those who have no intention of targeting Americans? On what basis are we conducting targeting operations in Somalia and other countries where other assorted bad guys are found? What is the asserted legal basis for concluding that we are "at war" with disparate groups (such as Al Shaabab) simply because they have some association with al Qaeda? In international armed conflict, concepts of co-belligerency apply to states, but to simply transplant that concept into wars against non-state actors is presumptuous, to say the least.</p>

<p>Fourth, even where the US is at war, will targeting continue to be justified by assertions that the target was a "terrorist," "insurgent" or "militant," even though those terms have no significance under international law? What of the requirement that the target be either a member of the enemy's armed forces or a civilian directly participating in hostilities?</p>

<p>Fifth, what was the basis upon which you (Brennan) once declared that civilian casualties are few to none? Is it because of a sleight-of-legalistic-hand determination that any dead, military-aged male in a strike zone is presumed to have been targetable?</p>

<p>Finally, what about the alternatives to targeting? Are prosecution, sanctions and addressing the causes conducive to terrorism not the preferable strategies? Is killing not more harmful than helpful, especially where it results in the death of innocents? Is it not true that very few countries support US targeted killing policy and that the resulting diminished American moral authority on human rights elsewhere has serious national security consequences at home? </p>

<p>More broadly, democracy cannot survive where judges are constrained by "Alice-in-Wonderland catch-22s" from requiring the government to explain why it can kill people without charges or trials. The Obama administration needs to step up with increased transparency and much greater detail on drone policy. Only then will we know whether US targeted killings are legal and whether they make us safer or place us at greater risk.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.fiu.edu/faculty-2/megan-a-fairlie">Megan A. Fairlie</a> of the Florida International University College of Law says the International Criminal Court (ICC) will ultimately delay pursuing an investigation into the effect of Palestine's non-Member Observer State status on the Court's jurisdiction...<br />
<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/meganfairlie.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>A</strong></font>lmost immediately after the UN General Assembly voted to give Palestine non-Member Observer State <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2012/ga11317.doc.htm">status</a>, the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) at the International Criminal Court (ICC) <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/icc-to-consider-legal-meaning-of-palestine-statehood.php">announced</a> its plan to "consider the legal implications" of Palestine's upgrade. In theory, OTP's assessment could lead to a blockbuster result: an ICC investigation into the serious crimes alleged to have been committed on the territory of Palestine, and the subsequent prosecutions of the perpetrators deemed responsible, whether Palestinian or Israeli. In reality it seems more likely that OTP will opt to remain silent about its assessment for some time, and that it ultimately will delay pursuing an investigation.  </p>

<p><strong>The 2009 Declaration</strong></p>

<p>The Palestinian Authority began its efforts to accept the ICC's jurisdiction in 2009, when it lodged a <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/icc-to-weigh-palestinian-authority.php">declaration</a> under <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Article 12(3)</a> of the Rome Statute of the ICC. This provision allows a State that is not a party to the Rome Statute to consent to the retroactive jurisdiction of the court over all ICC crimes (genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity) committed on its territory. Written in the wake of Israel's <a href="http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/preliminary-assessment-of-israels-operation-cast-lead">Operation Cast Lead</a>, the declaration aims to grant the ICC jurisdiction over persons alleged to be responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Gaza and the West Bank since July 2002. </p>

<p><strong>The Issue of Statehood</strong> </p>

<p>Once the declaration was lodged, the fundamental threshold question was whether Palestine qualified as a "State" capable of making a declaration under Article 12(3), an issue that former ICC Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo left unresolved in his April 2012 <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/C6162BBF-FEB9-4FAF-AFA9-836106D2694A/284387/SituationinPalestine030412ENG.pdf">"update"</a> [PDF] on the situation in Palestine. In a much <a href="/forum/2012/04/valentina-azarov-icc-palestine.php">criticized</a>, two-page document, the then-prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/icc-lacks-jurisdiction-to-investigate-palestine-war-crimes-claims-prosecutor.php">claimed it would be beyond the power of OTP</a> to resolve the statehood question, and that the OTP should take its cue on the matter from "the relevant bodies at the United Nations" or the ICC's <a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ASP/">Assembly of States Parties</a>. </p>

<p>With the November 2012 General Assembly vote, the statehood hurdle has now been crossed; yet prospects for an ICC investigation seem uncertain at best. The Court's new Prosecutor, <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/fatou-bensouda-sworn-in-as-icc-prosecutor.php">Fatou Bensouda</a>, has been consistently non-committal about the potential effect that a positive decision regarding Palestinian statehood might have. Prior to the November vote, Bensouda noted that a change in Palestine's status would only prompt her office to <a href="http://www.cfr.org/international-criminal-courts-and-tribunals/international-criminal-court-new-approach-international-relations/p29351">"revisit what the ICC can do."</a>  This statement is fairly apt; as things currently stand, whether the ICC can do anything at all is entirely dependent upon Bensouda. </p>

<p><strong>The Mechanics of the ICC Process</strong></p>

<p>Since the declaration at issue comes from a non-member state, the matter cannot advance at the ICC unless the prosecutor asks the court's <a href="http://www.iclklamberg.com/Caselaw/CAR/Bemba/PTCIII/ICC-01-05-01-08-14-tENG.pdf">Pre-Trial Chamber</a> to authorize an investigation. Before she can do that, Bensouda must first <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">conclude</a> that "there is a reasonable basis to believe that a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been committed."  </p>

<p>According to the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber, the question of whether a crime falls within the jurisdiction of the court is a broad one. The crime must not only be of the type the ICC is authorized to prosecute; the court must also have temporal and personal or territorial jurisdiction. Following this pronouncement, both times that the prosecution has requested authorization to initiate an investigation, in the situations in <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc785972.pdf">Kenya</a> and the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1097345.pdf">Ivory Coast</a>, the prosecution supplied the court with the reasons that supported its belief that the ICC had territorial jurisdiction at the time that the alleged crimes were committed. This comprehensive approach to the question of jurisdiction has its merit. Indeed, as Bill Schabas has <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=iIbAkLRWPUgC&pg=PA660&lpg=PA660">observed</a>, it would be illogical for the prosecutor to seek investigatory permission based solely on subject matter jurisdiction if she will be ultimately unable to proceed because additional jurisdictional markers are lacking. </p>

<p>Following existing precedent, if the prosecutor requests authorization to conduct an investigation into the war crimes <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/israel-gaza-operation-violated.php">allegedly committed</a> during Operation Cast Lead, she would need to do more than simply refer to the UN Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict's <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/un-report-finds-both-israel-and.php">report</a> detailing those crimes. She would also have to provide a reasonable basis for the belief that Palestine was a state at the time of the conflict during 2008 and 2009, and that the Gaza Strip then comprised a part of the state's territory.</p>

<p>The latter issue is seemingly less contentious. Even the US, by abstaining from <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2009/sc9567.doc.htm">Security Council Resolution 1860</a>, has implicitly accepted that the Gaza Strip "will be a part of the Palestinian State." The very language of that 2009 resolution, however, suggests that the court lacks temporal jurisdiction over the crimes committed during Operation Cast Lead. At best, this means that whether Palestine was a state from 2008 to 2009 remains uncertain. <br />
 <br />
<strong>Predicting the Prosecutor's Decision</strong></p>

<p>In all probability, the ICC prosecutor will be reluctant to determine the point in time at which Palestine became a state. In fact, Bensouda is likely to perceive a number of advantages to concluding that it is beyond her remit to do so. By rejecting the role of arbiter of the characteristics of the Palestinian state, she renders herself incapable of making a final determination regarding the fate of the 2009 declaration. This effectively tables the matter for the time being, an outcome likely to generate less backlash than either requesting authority to investigate or finding that there is no reasonable basis for an investigation.   </p>

<p>Doing nothing has additional practical benefits as well. It leaves the Palestinians with <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/dec/15/international-criminal-court-lever-palestinians">leverage</a> regarding future Israeli conduct, in particular, the proposed expansion of Jewish settlements from Jerusalem to the West Bank. At the same time, doing nothing also means that the prospect of the Court's exercising jurisdiction over the occupied territories, a move currently opposed not only by the US and Israel, but also by a number of key <a href="http://m.euractiv.com/details.php?aid=516369">European countries</a>, is likewise placed on hold. Indeed, the Palestinians themselves appear to presently favor the do-nothing approach, ostensibly because moving forward could come at the price of <a href="http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=295678">"the most effective outcome,"</a> but, perhaps, also because the Palestinians recognize their own <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2012/1205/ICC-membership-may-hurt-Palestinians-Hamas-more-than-Israel-video/(page)/2">vulnerability</a> to ICC prosecutions should an investigation take place. </p>

		<title>The Case of Donaldson, et al. v the State of Montana Is Not Over</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Jon Ellingson of the <a href="http://www.aclumontana.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Montana</a> argues that many of Montana's state statutes are unconstitutional, especially those which confer particular rights and responsibilities upon only heterosexual spouses while simultaneously denying same-sex couples of the same rights and responsibilities...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/jonellingson.jpg" width="120" height="200" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he politics of Montana present unique challenges to those who are working to protect and advance the rights of gay and lesbian residents.<br />
 <br />
In 2004, the voters amended the <a href="http://courts.mt.gov/content/library/docs/72constit.pdf">Montana Constitution</a> [PDF] to prohibit same-sex partners from marrying. And while we have routinely elected moderate Democrats in statewide elections, the legislature has recently been firmly controlled by conservative Republicans who are far from friendly to the rights of gays and lesbians. Given this political environment, it may have seemed that little could be done to protect the rights of this important segment of our population. The constitutional amendment <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/montana-judge-dismisses-same-sex-marriage-lawsuit.php">foreclosed</a> a challenge to the ban on same sex marriage, and working with the legislature for the enactment of a civil union/domestic partnership act would have been an act of futility.<br />
 <br />
But we did not give up.<br />
 <br />
The national <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), together with the <a href="http://www.aclumontana.org/">Montana ACLU</a> and statewide gay and lesbian organizations devised a new strategy. We decided to challenge the constitutionality of the numerous state statutes that confer benefits and impose responsibilities on people who are "spouses," but which deny those benefits and responsibilities to similarly situated same sex partners. These statutes affect a wide range of events that occur for both married couples and same sex partners, but which have different implications depending on whether or not partners are married. For example, a same sex partner is not automatically recognized by health care providers as someone entitled to information about a sick partner or given the right to participate in making healthcare decisions about that partner. Similarly, that partner may be denied bereavement benefits because he or she is not a "family" member. Nor will that person have any right to the property of a deceased partner under the laws of intestate succession.</p>

<p>We <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/aclu-sues-montana-for-recognition-of-same-sex-civil-unions.php">filed suit in July 2010</a> and requested a broad declaration that the statutory structure described above is unconstitutional as applied to same-sex partners. Our plaintiffs are similarly situated to married heterosexuals in all respects except for their gender orientation and consequent inability to marry. We asserted that these couples were being denied the equal protection of the law and that there was neither a rational nor a compelling state interest that could justify the distinction.<br />
 <br />
The case eventually made its way to the Montana Supreme Court after the lower court granted the state's motion to dismiss and denied the Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment. <br />
 <br />
We argued our case in front of the Montana Supreme Court in April 2012. On December 17, the <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/montana-high-court-dismisses-same-sex-marriage-suit.php">judgment</a> of the court was issued. Three of the seven justices agreed with us entirely. They would have declared that all of the statutes that address the rights and responsibilities of spouses should be revised to include same-sex, committed partners. But four of the seven, while not necessarily disagreeing with us in principle, held that, procedurally, we had asked the court to do too much at one time. These justices <a href="http://missoulian.com/montana-supreme-court-opinion-in-same-sex-benefits-lawsuit/pdf_9f3f37d8-489e-11e2-9d48-0019bb2963f4.html">denied our request for declaratory relief</a> and remanded the case back to the district court. In sending the case back, the Court gave us the right to proceed at the district court level by amending our complaint to list the specific individual statutes that we wish to challenge.<br />
 <br />
Justice James Nelson wrote a passionate dissent that characterized the judgment as "defeat." While I appreciate enormously his opinion and commitment to our cause, I cannot agree with him. We are not defeated, but only temporarily diverted from own goal. We will go back to the district court and amend our complaint. We will demonstrate concretely, with reference to specific statutes, the injustice that is suffered by our plaintiffs. And we will prove that in a society that aspires to recognize individual human dignity, that each of us has the right to responsibly direct and control the most intimate aspects of our own lives. In such a society there is no state interest that can justify this statutory discrimination against gays and lesbians. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/main.asp?PID=34">Jordan Paust</a> of the University of Houston Law Center says that, if Iran proceeds with building nuclear arms, Israel may be legally justified in launching a military attack as a means of self-defense...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/jordanpaust.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>U</strong></font>nder international law, would Israel have a right to engage in measures of self-defense against Iran if Iran creates a nuclear warhead and continues to proclaim its desire to wipe Israel off the map? A number of persons might assume that if such a significant weaponization occurs Iran will not be mounting an armed attack and they might initially conclude that Israel would not have a right to engage in self-defense. But the matter is more complex, and Iran's creation of a nuclear weapon could result in an extreme loss of lives &#8212; an outcome that no one should prefer.</p>

<p>Under <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter7.shtml">Article 51</a> of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/index.shtml">Charter of the United Nations</a>, Israel would clearly have an inherent right of self-defense "if an armed attack occurs," although the equally authentic French version uses the phrase "armed aggression" (<em>agression arm&#233;e</em>) instead of the more narrow <em>attaque arm&#233;e</em>, and the word aggression might arguably apply to conduct prior to initiation of an attack. A minority of states and textwriters prefer that the express limitation of the right of self-defense to a circumstance where an armed attack or armed aggression "occurs" not pertain when an armed attack is "imminent," especially an imminent attack with a powerful nuclear weapon that can produce deadly effects in a matter of minutes. This latter preference is best labeled "anticipatory" self-defense as opposed to an extremely rare preference for a manifestly impermissible form of "preemptive" self-defense when merely a significant threat is posed but an armed attack is not imminent. Some in the US government have even used the phrase "imminent threat" but, of course, an imminent threat logically is not even a present threat and use of such a criterion would be legal nonsense. In any event, the majority view, backed by decisions of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), is that the inherent right of self-defense is conditioned by the need for an initiation of an armed attack and the ICJ has not chosen a different criterion under what might logically be a broader reach when using the French phrase <em>agression arm&#233;e</em>. But exactly when does an armed attack commence?</p>

<p>The ICJ has <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&p2=3&k=66&PHPSESSID=05fad554ae9feec6f32e8fcea282db53&case=70&code=nus&p3=4">ruled</a> that "the financing, organizing, training, [and] supplying and equipping" by a state of a group engaged in armed violence against another state is not an armed attack by the first state against the second state, even though the first state is complicit in group attacks and has responsibility under international law for its violations of international law. For an armed attack to be attributed or "imputed" to the first state, the ICJ has ruled that it would have to have control over the group that is engaged in armed violence. With respect to Iranian financing, training, supplying and equipping of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hezbollah">Hezbollah</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hamas">Hamas</a> while they are engaged in continued armed attacks against Israel, under the ICJ test Iran is recognizably violating international law and engaged in what some term indirect aggression, but such unlawful conduct does not itself amount to an armed attack on Israel by Iran. Nonetheless, Iran's continued complicity in armed attacks on Israel and its stated animosity to the very existence of Israel are necessarily significant features of context with respect to Iranian intent and its overall conduct in relation to Israel.</p>

<p>Iran would also be violating international law if it created a nuclear weapon. Iran is a party to the <a href="http://www.un.org/disarmament/WMD/Nuclear/NPT.shtml">Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons</a> and, as such, is bound by treaty law to not "manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices." Additionally, the UN Security Council (UNSC) has <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-security-council-imposes-new-sanctions-on-iran.php">demanded</a> that Iran suspend all of its nuclear enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, and Iran is in <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/un-sg-concerned-about-iran-human-rights.php">violation</a> of the resolutions of the UNSC and subject to economic and other sanctions for its violations. In a recent <a href="http://www.nti.org/gsn/article/senators-press-obama-toughen-stance-iran/">letter</a> to US President Barack Obama, 57 US senators have also warned that Iran "has taken a significant step closer to possible weapons-grade uranium by enriching up to 20 percent." Although an Iranian violation of the non-proliferation treaty and its continued violation of UNSC decisions would not themselves constitute an armed attack, these violations would also necessarily be part of important features of context with respect to Iranian intent and its overall conduct during a time of extreme tension. Such conduct includes a stated desire to wipe Israel off the map, continued unlawful complicity in armed attacks on Israel, and the significant and unlawful creation of a nuclear warhead that could have a devastating impact within Israel in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>Although it can provide an imperfect analogy, recalling what allegedly happened in the old West when one person went gunning for another and they met in the street, staring each other down, can allow recognition of the fact that a process of attack can move through various stages and can be underway prior to the firing of a weapon. In movie and television portrayals, the "good guy" was often faster on the draw than the "bad guy" who was gunning for him. The good guy usually waited until the bad guy began to draw his pistol from his holster, but the good guy was faster and accurate, defending himself with a precise and deadly shot. It was not necessary that the bad guy shoot first, although this happened occasionally. Moreover, upon reflection it is evident that the good guy could have drawn first once it was known that the bad guy was gunning for him and they were staring each other down in the street. Someone was about to draw first and, in context, the process of attack had begun and a right of self-defense had been triggered even though it was possible that the bad guy might back down and make this clearly known before the good guy fired.</p>

<p>By analogy, when would an armed attack by Iran begin? It is evident that an attack would begin not merely when Iran has fired a missile with a nuclear warhead toward Israel, not merely when Iran has "drawn" a missile with a nuclear warhead and aimed it at Israel, and not merely when Iran has pulled a missile with a nuclear warhead out of its "holster." In context, given the facts that: (1) Iran is publicly "gunning" for Israel, (2) Iran has already been continuously complicit in ongoing armed attacks against Israel by Hezbollah and Hamas in violation of international law, and (3) Iran is bound by treaty law to not produce weapons-grade nuclear material and nuclear weapons, one can recognize that an attack would begin at least when Iran continues to violate international law, creates a nuclear warhead, and starts to load it onto a missile without backing down and making such clearly known. If it is known that Iran is building a nuclear weapon for use against Israel, in context it would be logical to claim that an armed attack is underway when Iran starts to create such a weapon.</p>

<p>Many fear that Iran will create a nuclear warhead in the near future. If so, Iran might trigger a disastrous defensive response by Israel that would otherwise involve a lawful measure of self-defense under international law. Iran claims that if this happens, its response will also be devastating. Israel might also receive assistance from the US as part of permissible collective self-defense and Iran might expand the conflagration as it has warned if the US uses military force. Instead of massive death and destruction, one hopes that Iran's leaders will wisely decide to avoid a predictable catastrophe for both the Iranian and Israeli people (as well as others in the Middle East), shift their attention to peace, and comply with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and relevant UNSC resolutions and not create a nuclear weapon. Working towards peace is still possible.</p>

		<title>ICC Suspects Can Hide &#151; and That Is the Problem</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnists <a href="http://www.hrw.org/bios/richard-dicker">Richard Dicker</a> and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/bios/elizabeth-evenson">Elizabeth Evenson</a> of the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> argue that the efficacy of the International Criminal Court depends upon international efforts to apprehend criminals...<br /><hr height="1"><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he International Criminal Court (ICC) has been in business for a decade and faces plenty of hurdles in delivering justice for the world's worst atrocities. However, getting its suspects arrested has proven to be the court's Achilles' heel. The need to arrest ICC suspects often pits compliance with international criminal law against the prerogatives of sovereignty-minded countries. Lacking its own police force, the ICC depends on determined action by governments to arrest its suspects. Those governments, under the influence of competing diplomatic or economic objectives, can be fickle or outright obstructive.  </p>

<p>Six suspects have been surrendered to the court by the Democratic Republic of Congo, France, Belgium and C&#244;te d'Ivoire. However, arrest warrants against 12 others remain outstanding, and these suspects are wreaking murder and mayhem. The <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/icc-prosecutor-predicts-kony-will-be-arrested-this-year.php">failure</a> to arrest <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17299084">Joseph Kony</a> and other senior commanders of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) has left this brutal rebel group free to export atrocities across the borders of central Africa, creating new generations of victims in the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and the Central African Republic. Similarly, the failure in eastern Congo to arrest <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/icc-issues-new-arrest-warrant-for-congo-general.php">Bosco Ntaganda</a>, who until recently was protected by Congolese authorities and promoted within the Congolese army, has left an unbroken record of new abuses there.</p>

<p>Lack of action on the court's arrest warrants has been particularly stark in Sudan, where the UN Security Council (UNSC) <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/icc-launches-darfur-investigation.php">brought in the ICC</a> because of the violence in Darfur. Despite <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/icc-issues-sudan-president-arrest.php">ICC warrants for his arrest</a>, Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir remains in office, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-prosecutor-sudan-president-continues-crimes-against-humanity.php">and continues to preside over serious human rights violations</a> not only in Darfur but in border regions with the <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/south-sudan-officially-gains-its-independence.php">newly independent</a> South Sudan. The UNSC has done nothing to back up its initial commitment to justice. </p>

<p>Significantly, the movement to bring justice for the worst crimes through international courts has accumulated rich experience in arrests over two decades, particularly through the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL). The ICTY gained custody of all 161 people it indicted. The Sierra Leone Court went 9 for 9. The "lessons learned" through these arrests should be mined and applied.</p>

<p>As a permanent court with potentially worldwide jurisdiction, the ICC admittedly faces more complex challenges than the <em>ad hoc</em> tribunals did. These courts handled geographically limited areas where the international community had forged a consensus that the horrors done to civilians had to be addressed, in part, through criminal trials. This consensus, and the focus it generated, are more difficult to sustain across several different situations, each with its own particularities. Justice-supporting countries can aid in bringing about these arrests. </p>

<p>No apprehension for the ICC is simple, and the problems involved vary. <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Lubanga">Thomas Lubanga</a> &#8212; the Congolese rebel leader who was the first person convicted by the court &#8212; was already in the custody of the country where the crimes occurred when he was turned over for trial. Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo &#8212; another Congolese militia commander-politician who had gone into exile in Europe &#8212; was turned over by Belgium. The Kony case falls into another category &#8212; a situation of armed conflict where the territorial government is unable to apprehend a suspect through normal law enforcement. Although politics certainly has its role here, such arrests may require an operation involving complex military decisions and troops acting extraterritorially.</p>

<p>The al-Bashir case is one in which a recalcitrant government that is implicated in the alleged crimes is shielding one of its own and refuses to arrest a suspect whose whereabouts are well known. This is "the hard case" of ICC arrests. These "hard cases" risk the delivery of justice and serious collateral damage for the court. If suspects are not brought to trial, the opportunity for justice is lost for the victims, their families and their communities. The communities have no independently verified record of individual criminal responsibility as a reference point for societal healing. In fact, the absence of accountability and its deterrent effect opens the door for future abuses. Moreover, stalled court proceedings freeze in place witness protection programs and leave victims' rights before the court hanging in the balance as costs spiral upward. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the ICC invariably takes the reputational hit, instead of the governments that fail to act. The paralysis generates an undercurrent of criticism that the court is inefficient, expensive and perhaps useless. The damage can be even more pernicious. A high-profile suspect like al-Bashir who continues to function in a senior position, ostentatiously conducting official visits to other capitals and hosting high-level visitors, flouts the warrant in a way that is corrosive to the credibility of the court. </p>

<p>In these hard cases, where arrests are unlikely in the short term, experience shows that justice-supporting countries nonetheless can and need to take steps that, over the long haul, may lead to arrest. Without these more immediate measures the prospect of future arrest dims. The court's member states and other justice-supporting countries must exert diplomatic, political and economic clout &#8212; in other words, political will &#8212; for arrests. Justice must take precedence amid other competing, and sometimes contradictory, objectives. These governments should take every opportunity to raise the importance of arrest in their one-on-one diplomatic contacts with the non-cooperating states, with third-party states that have influence on the non-cooperating states and in multilateral intergovernmental settings. The opening of the UN General Assembly, an EU summit or the African Union's Political Assembly provide a high-profile stage for private and public diplomacy on behalf of arrests. Using EU summit meetings to press for arrest of suspects was a successful tactic for the Yugoslavia tribunal. Diplomacy puts arrest on the agenda, creating expectations of follow-through.  </p>

<p>Justice-supporting countries also need to identify and use effective leverage points for arrests, another lesson from the US and EU's approach to apprehension at the ICTY. In 2001, the US used the pressure of donor conferences and World Bank loans to press for the arrest and surrender of Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia's wartime leader. In the first four months of 2005, Serbia transferred 12 Serb and Bosnian Serb indictees to The Hague. This dramatic increase in cooperation with the tribunal was directly related to diplomatic pressure around Belgrade's prospective accession to the EU. In 2006, NATO states sweetened their advocacy with the offer to allow Belgrade into the alliance's Partnership for Peace. The European Commission, which held the keys to the kingdom of EU membership, continually recalibrated its mix of pressure and concessions as the politics of governments in Belgrade and Zagreb changed. </p>

<p>As valuable as these lessons are, it would be a mistake to view them through rose-tinted glasses. Linking economic and political pressure to the arrest of war crimes suspects in the Former Yugoslovia evolved through twists and turns over more than a decade. The EU moved forward, backward and sideways in its insistence on Serbia's full cooperation with the tribunal in the face of political instability, anti-Western governments in Belgrade and independence for Kosovo. In addition, ready-made effective points of leverage for justice may be hard to replicate in countries where the ICC investigates. Nonetheless, in countries far beyond the Western Balkans, where the means of leverage were less obvious, wielding pressure and concessions has succeeded. The former Liberian president Charles Taylor <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/nigeria-president-says-indicted.php">enjoyed safe haven</a> in Nigeria between 2003 and 2006 despite his indictment for war crimes and crimes against humanity. At that time, Nigeria's then-president, Olusegun Obasanjo, was seeking international support for a third presidential term, forgiveness for Nigeria's debt and a White House meeting with President George W. Bush. Using these points to press President Obasanjo, the UK, the US and Liberia helped bring about Obasanjo's <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/breaking-news-charles-taylor-captured.php">decision to surrender</a> Taylor in March 2006. The three governments played their cards well.</p>

<p>In a demonstration of creative justice diplomacy, ICC-supporting diplomats have created an "early warning system" to head off visits by al-Bashir, effectively curtailing his travel schedule. While these measures do not have the impact of arrest, the resulting stigmatization and isolation take a toll. <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2011-06-22/world/35233960_1_bashir-sudanese-president-omar-hassan-yin-gang">reported</a> that before his trip to China in June 2011, al-Bashir specifically asked Beijing to guarantee that he would not be arrested there. Getting the message across to suspects, who are still presumed innocent, that there can be no more business as usual while they are on the run from the law is a smart intermediate tactic. </p>

<p>Finally, it's imperative that the UNSC becomes more actively engaged in seeing the court's warrants are executed, especially following the council "referring" a crisis situation to the ICC. </p>

<p>Justice-supporting states should recognize that they are playing a long-game and that it could take years to arrest suspects, as it did with Bosnian Serb suspects <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Karadzic">Radovan Karadzic</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mladic">Ratko Mladic</a>. There is a synergy between the immediate steps and arrests over time; the more vigorous and meaningful the former, the greater the likelihood of the latter. Lack of results in the short term should not become a rationale for inaction or indifference. The short-term measures maintain the integrity of the court's warrants and facilitate the long-term objective. </p>

<p>In the ICC's second decade, ICC nations need to up their game on the court's behalf. Political will is essential. That means increasing pressure for arrests relative to other security, diplomatic and economic objectives. These governments need to give the court's arrest warrants traction &#8212; no matter how uphill the road. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Elena Landriscina, <a href="http://www.nyclu.org/content/about-nyclu">New York Civil Liberties Union</a> Legal Fellow, revisits her <a href="/dateline/2012/04/elena-landriscina-chagos-islanders.php">article</a> on the displacement of the Chagos Islanders by the US and UK. Here, she examines what she argues is the lackluster response of the US to a petition of the plight of the Chagossians and calls for the US to right its wrongs...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/dateline/elena_landriscina.jpg" width="120" height="200" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n December 21, 2012, after 8 long months, the White House finally <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/response/response-we-people-petition-redressing-wrongs-against-chagossians">responded</a> to a <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/us-government-must-redress-wrongs-against-chagossians/gPRF7hmz">petition</a> concerning the plight of the Chagossians &#8212; an indigenous population of the Chagos Archipelago which the US and UK forcibly displaced in the 1960's and 1970's to make way for the US military base on the island of Diego Garcia. The Chagossians' petition, which secured more than 30,000 signatures, called on the White House to redress the harms that the US caused to this native population, which now lives as a marginalized community (mostly in Mauritius and the Seychelles).  </p>

<p>The White House response is remarkable for what it says and does not say.</p>

<p>First, the response is remarkable because it is the first acknowledgment by the White House's of the "hardships that [the Chagossians] have endured" as a result of their forced displacement. Since displacing the Chagossians, no US president since Gerald Ford has <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-vine/chagossians_b_1341493.html">commented</a> on the Chagossians. Until now, the executive branch has barely recognized the Chagossians' suffering, even while members of the US Congress have. On October 20, 1975, for example, Senator John Culver (D-IA) stated that "[n]o amount of rationalization by our State Department can alter US responsibility for uprooting the native residents of Diego Garcia in order to make way for a military base." The White House's response was signed by three high-level State Department officials: Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor Michael Posner, Assistant Secretary for European &#38; Eurasian Affairs Philip Gordon and Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs Andrew Shapiro.  </p>

<p>In addition, the White House does not disclaim responsibility for the Chagossians' suffering &#8212; it cannot. As has been well-documented by historians, <a href="http://www.fpif.org/reports/the_other_guantanamo">anthropologists</a> and journalists, half a century ago the US set its sights on transforming the island of Diego Garcia into a strategic military base. In the 1960s and 1970s, the US government worked deliberately and carefully with the UK to create a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/apr/18/archives-diego-garcia">fiction</a> that the Chagossians were mere "contract workers" who had no permanent claim to the Chagos Archipelago and who could easily be "resettled" to other lands. The tactics used by the governments to displace the Chagossians included an embargo that aimed at starving the population, death threats and the rounding up and extermination of the Chagossians' pets.  </p>

<p>In its response, the White House, however, does little more than recognize the "difficulties intrinsic to the issues raised by the Chagossian community." As in many instances where the US is accused of committing human rights violations, the difficulty is the inability of the US to muster the will to provide a remedy. The Chagossians have sought redress from the US in the form of resettlement aid, compensation or employment opportunities.  </p>

<p>Instead of offering redress, the White House speciously passes the buck to the UK based on the view that the UK has sovereignty over the islands in the Chagos Archipelago. That stance is particularly offensive given the US presence and role in decisions that affect the Archipelago. The US operates <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175568/">missions</a> in the Middle East out of the Diego Garcia military base and has used the base as a stop-over for extraordinary rendition flights. In addition, under the terms of a 1966 agreement between the US and UK governments, the UK consults with the US about matters affecting the Archipelago. The coordinated policy of the US and UK government continues today. There appears to be nothing accidental about the timing of the White House's statement, as it came one day after the European Court of Human Rights <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-115714#{"itemid":["001-115714"]}">decision</a> in favor of the UK on a technical question of the admissibility of the Chagossians' complaints.</p>

<p>The White House listed a series of initiatives that the UK launched &#8212; many of which have begun only recently &#8212; to engage the Chagossian community that resides in the UK and Mauritius. Yet, the UK government's efforts to involve the Chagossian community do not relieve the US of its share of responsibility. The White House supports these efforts, but words do not offer the exiled Chagossians the ability to be reunited with their homeland, to visit and tend the graves of their loved ones or to no longer be marginalized in their communities. The Chagossian petition highlighted the urgency of their plight: it was written shortly after the passing of <a href="http://www.chagossupport.org.uk/lisette-talate-1949">Lisette Talate</a> at the age of 70 in January 2012.  "We cannot let others die without the opportunity to return home and obtain redress," the petition urged. Just days before the White House response, on December 16, 2012, another member of the exiled Chagossian community &#8212; <a href="http://www.chagossupport.org.uk/charlezia-alexis-dies-aged-79-2266">Charlezia Alexis</a> &#8212; passed away at the age of 79.   </p>

<p>The US has both a role and an interest in the Chagos Archipelago. It has a responsibility to make sure that the dwindling population of exiled Chagossians and their families no longer suffer the effects of the US decision to rip them from their homelands. Much more than words and recognition of the Chagossians' hardship are needed by the US government to account for its wrongs.</p>

		<title>Legalizing Same-Sex Marriage By Popular Vote</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Walter Smith, <a href="http://www.law.washington.edu/">University of Washington School of Law</a> Class of 2013, discusses Washington state legally recognizing same-sex marriage by popular vote...<hr height='1'><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size='3'><strong>O</strong></font>n December 6, Washington state <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/washington-governor-certifies-same-sex-marriage-referendum.php">certified</a> its statewide election returns and officially became the first US state to begin legally recognizing same-sex marriages by popular vote. Maryland and Maine, the only other states to approve same-sex marriage by statewide ballot, <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/maine-maryland-voters-approve-same-sex-marriage.php">passed their own measures</a> on Election Day 2012. This year's votes approving same-sex marriage mark the end of what had been a continuous losing streak for same-sex marriage proponents, who had lost every single one of the 32 previous statewide ballot contests relating to same-sex marriage. </p>

<p>Now that the 2012 election is over, the question arises: is the fight over same-sex marriage at an end, at least in Washington? Below, I explore two ways that the struggle over same-sex marriage continues in states that have legally recognized same-sex marriage and elsewhere. First, same-sex couples legally married are treated differently from opposite-sex married couples under federal law and most states' laws. Therefore, states like Washington have a responsibility to advocate for judicial and legislative recognition for couples married within their jurisdiction. Second, Washington's electoral experience suggests that voters no longer view marriage substitutes like domestic partnership or civil unions as true equivalents to marriage, which should be relevant to courts considering whether marriage substitutes are a constitutionally acceptable alternative to same-sex marriage.</p>

<p><strong>I. Taking on DOMA and State Laws Discriminating Against Married, Same-Sex Couples</strong></p>

<p>Even same-sex couples legally married in states like Washington continue to be denied legal recognition and financial benefits by the federal <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/defense_of_marriage_act_doma">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) and by state constitutional and statutory bans on same-sex marriage in most US jurisdictions. For example, Section 3 of DOMA provides that the federal government only recognizes marriages between opposite-sex couples. Accordingly, the federal government withholds many benefits from the surviving spouse of a same-sex married couple &#8212; including the estate tax exemptions and Social Security survivor's benefits available to surviving spouses of opposite-sex married couples. Because the discriminatory rules of Section 3 of DOMA are enacted and enforced at the federal level, they deny benefits to same-sex spouses in every state in the union, even those that recognize same-sex marriage.</p>

<p>Additionally, same-sex couples legally married in states like Washington who venture into other US states may find their relationships &#8212; including relationships to a same-sex partner's biological children &#8212; denied legal recognition by state law and Section 2 of DOMA, which purports to allow states to deny legal recognition to same-sex marriages from other states. Because most US states consider same-sex marriage contrary to public policy, same-sex married couples are only entitled to full legal recognition in nine states and the District of Columbia.</p>

<p><a href="/feature/2012/02/same-sex-marriage.php">Same-sex marriage remains a live issue</a> in states like Washington because other states' laws and DOMA will continue to deny legal recognition for same-sex couples lawfully married in Washington for the foreseeable future. Washington and other states recognizing same-sex marriage have a responsibility to protect couples lawfully married under local law through legal challenges or requests for legislative action from Congress and other states.</p>

<p>The US Supreme Court has accepted review of cases that could shake up the law relating to same-sex marriage in the coming term, including <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3347215060435660826">United States v. Windsor</a>, a challenge to Section 3 of DOMA, and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3166560998749928304">Hollingsworth v. Perry</a>, a challenge to <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/same-sex-marriage-bans-approved-in.php">Proposition 8</a>, California's 2008 ballot measure repealing same-sex marriage. Other states recognizing same-sex marriage, including Massachusetts, have taken a vigorous role in the DOMA litigation. Now that Washington recognizes same-sex marriage, the state should intervene in litigation like the DOMA and Proposition 8 cases to challenge discrimination against Washington married couples. Additionally, Washington could bring future legal challenges or undertake legislative advocacy to challenge state bans on same-sex marriage and Section 2 of DOMA.</p>

<p><strong>II.	Paradigm Shift: Accept No (Marriage) Substitutes?</strong></p>

<p>The recent election is also relevant to the question of whether jurisdictions may extend marriage-like rights to same-sex partners without recognizing same-sex marriage outright. Although several jurisdictions, including Washington, have recognized such same-sex marriage substitutes, the recent election undermines arguments that substitutes are acceptable alternatives to marriage. Before the recent election, Washington already provided same-sex partners essentially all the rights of marriage under the "everything but marriage" <a href="http://www.secstate.wa.gov/elections/initiatives/text/r071.pdf">law</a> [PDF] passed in 2009. The question in 2012, then, was limited to whether, in addition to giving same-sex couples "everything but marriage" in the form of comprehensive domestic partnerships, the state should also recognize same-sex marriage.</p>

<p>Washington voters' conclusion that "everything but marriage" was not enough points toward the meaningful intangible qualities marriage substitutes lack. Moreover, both proponents and opponents of same-sex marriage in Washington apparently agreed that even "everything but marriage" is not the same as marriage; were it otherwise, 2012's hard-fought electoral contest would not have been necessary.</p>

<p>Whether marriage substitutes provide enough recognition for same-sex couples is relevant not only as a question of policy but also as a matter of constitutional law. <em>Perry</em>, the California Proposition 8 case pending before the US Supreme Court, arose when voters overturned a state court ruling recognizing same-sex marriage in 2008. Despite enacting Proposition 8, however, California has continued to recognize domestic partnerships that are legally equivalent to marriage. One possible argument in favor of Proposition 8 is that it does not, in fact, discriminate against same-sex couples because domestic partners are given the same rights as married couples under California law. In its opinion in <em>Perry</em>, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit offered a colorful response to this line of argument, and contrasted the significance of marriage and marriage substitutes:<blockquote>We are excited to see someone ask, "Will you marry me?", whether on bended knee in a restaurant or in text splashed across a stadium Jumbotron. Certainly it would not have the same effect to see "Will you enter into a registered domestic partnership with me?" ... Had Marilyn Monroe's film been called How to Register a Domestic Partnership with a Millionaire, it would not have conveyed the same meaning as did her famous movie, even though the underlying drama for same-sex couples is no different.</blockquote> The US Supreme Court has not yet addressed whether marriage substitutes provide a constitutionally adequate alternative to the right to marry. If the Court reaches this question in the coming term, it should consider the Ninth Circuit's argument above in light of the increasing consensus that domestic partnerships and the like are not substitutes for marriage. The Court could accordingly recognize the hypocrisy of laws extending marriage-like rights, but not marriage, to same-sex couples. As the Court once recognized in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12120372216939101759">Brown v. Board of Education</a>, when a state undertakes to provide an important right to its citizens, it must do so on equal terms.</p>

<p>Washington's 2012 election shows that public opinion relative to same-sex marriage is rapidly shifting. Yet the shift in attitudes at the state level does not signify the end of the struggle for legal recognition of same-sex married couples in the US, since federal and state laws continue to deny recognition to same-sex couples married in states like Washington. Even though the Supreme Court will consider same-sex marriage related challenges in the coming term, the Court is unlikely to adopt a sweeping holding recognizing a fundamental constitutional right to marry a person of the same sex. While the Court overturned laws forbidding intermarriage between white and nonwhite races in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5103666188878568597">Loving v. Virginia</a> in 1967, <em>Loving</em> only invalidated laws in some 16 states, while 41 states currently ban same-sex marriage. But the Court could invalidate laws in the smaller number of jurisdictions that extend marriage-like rights to same-sex couples while denying them the right to marriage. In doing so, the Court would give constitutional significance to the intuitive judgment of voters that marriage substitutes and marriage are not created equal.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.icj.org/staff/themes/">Allison Jernow</a> of the <a href="http://www.icj.org/">International Commission of Jurists</a> argues that recent court decisions reflect inconsistency in weighing marriage equality and religious freedom...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/allijernow.jpg" width="120" height="178" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>C</strong></font>laims that same-sex marriage is on a collision course with religious freedom have dominated the headlines (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/28/nyregion/rights-clash-as-town-clerk-rejects-her-role-in-gay-marriages.html?_r=0">The New York Times</a> and <a href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-09-14/opinions/35498079_1_tangled-web-ceremony-free-exercise">The Washington Post</a>) in the US, especially with <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/maine-maryland-voters-approve-same-sex-marriage.php">recent ballot-box victories</a> in Maryland, Maine and Washington, as well as the US Supreme Court's grant of <em>certiorari</em> in <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-to-review-constitutionality-of-same-sex-marriage.php">Hollingsworth v. Perry</a>. Equal marriage legislation in the US always include exemptions for religious leaders in the performance or solemnization of same-sex marriages and, in some cases, in the provision of accommodations or services related to the solemnization of such marriages. In some states the very title of the <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=3294&ChapterID=59">legislation</a> or <a href="http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2012/Bills/A0500/1_I1.PDF">proposed legislation</a> [PDF] reflects the presumed conflict of rights. In the UK, recently proposed legislation would actually <a href="http://jurist.org/hotline/2012/12/paul-johnson-coe-homosexuality.php">prohibit</a> the Church of England and the Church in Wales from performing same-sex marriages. This is clearly a sensitive question for marriage equality and religious freedom advocates.</p>

<p>The applicability of exemptions for religiously motivated individuals extends far beyond whether clergy must marry same-sex couples. Courts in a variety of countries, including <a href="http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onscdc/doc/2002/2002canlii13799/2002canlii13799.html">Canada</a>, the <a href="http://www.lambdalegal.org/in-court/legal-docs/benitez_ca_20080818_decision-ca-supreme-court">US</a>, the <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/83.html">UK</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VCAT/2010/1613.html">Australia</a> have heard cases concerning whether services, facilities and accommodations generally available to the public may be refused to same-sex couples or gay and lesbian individuals on religious grounds. In other words, does sincere religious conviction exempt one from non-discrimination laws?   </p>

<p>Now the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has weighed in on the debate about the intersection of religious freedom and equality with its judgment in <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/webservices/content/pdf/001-115881">Eweida and Others v. United Kingdom</a> [PDF], issued on January 15. The <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/EN/Header/Basic+Texts/The+Convention+and+additional+protocols/The+European+Convention+on+Human+Rights/">European Convention on Human Rights</a> (ECHR) guarantees the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion &#8212; including the right to manifest one's religion in public or in private, under <a href="http://www.hri.org/docs/ECHR50.html#C.Art9">Article 9</a>. Manifestation is broadly defined as "worship, teaching, practice and observance." It has been held to include wearing headscarves, reading sacred texts, observing dietary restrictions and proselytizing. The right to manifest one's religion, however, may be limited, provided that the limitation is prescribed by law, necessary in a democratic society and for the purpose of one or more or the aims set out in Article 9(2). One of those aims is "the protection of the rights and freedoms of others." Unfortunately, those looking for guidance on how to balance potentially competing rights claims may well be disappointed. </p>

<p><em>Eweida</em> &#8212; which consolidated applications from four British nationals claiming that their rights to freedom of religion and to be free from discrimination had been violated &#8212; concerned two different types of restrictions on religious freedom. In the first pair of joined applications, <em>Eweida &#38; Chaplin</em>, the issue was whether employers could prevent their employees from wearing crosses at work. The court found a violation in the case of <em>Eweida</em>, where the employer's asserted rationale of projecting a certain corporate image was not a sufficient justification, but none in the case of <em>Chaplin</em>, where the purpose of the restriction was the health and safety of hospital staff and patients. </p>

<p>The second pair of cases, <em>Ladele &#38; McFarlane</em>, directly addressed the religious freedom-sexual orientation discrimination conflict. Lillian Ladele and Gary McFarlane claimed that they had been unfairly treated by their employers for refusing to provide services to same-sex couples. Ladele was a marriage registrar with the London Borough of Islington who refused to conduct same-sex civil partnerships, in violation of Islington's equality and diversity policy. She believed that same-sex unions were "contrary to God's will." McFarlane was a relationship counselor employed by a private counseling service who did not wish to counsel same-sex couples on psycho-sexual issues because of his "adherence to Judeo-Christian sexual morality." Both were disciplined by their employers. Ladele ultimately resigned and McFarlane was dismissed.</p>

<p>The court held, unanimously in the case of McFarlane and by a vote of 5-2 in the case of Ladele, that there had been no violation of the right to manifest one's religion or, specifically in the case of Ladele, the right to be free from discrimination on religious grounds. The objective of protecting same-sex couples from discrimination was a legitimate and important one. </p>

<p>So far so good. The court could hardly have done less, given its earlier judgments in sexual orientation cases. In a series of decisions, the court has emphasized that the non-discrimination guarantee of the ECHR includes <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-58404">sexual orientation</a>, that differences on the <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-61263)">basis of sexual orientation</a> require "particularly serious reasons by way of justification," and that same-sex couples have the same need for legal <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-99605">recognition and protection</a> as opposite-sex couples. Nevertheless the court missed a significant opportunity to clarify the interaction of these rights. In at least three areas it may have actually weakened the hand of equality advocates.    </p>

<p>First, the court rejected the argument, which had been articulated earlier by the ECtHR in a series of admissibility decisions (<a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-3379">Konttinen v. Finland</a> and <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-3620 ),">Stedman v. United Kingdom</a>), that the possibility of resigning from one's job meant that there was no interference with the employee's religious freedom. The court instead concluded, "rather than holding that the possibility of changing job would negate any interference with the right, the better approach would be to weigh that possibility in the overall balance when considering whether or not the restriction was proportionate." </p>

<p>Second, the court relied heavily on the <a href="http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/cooperation/lisbonnetwork/themis/echr/paper2_en.asp">margin of appreciation doctrine</a>. Since competing ECHR rights were at stake, the court afforded the UK "a wide margin of appreciation" in determining where to strike a fair balance. Under this standard, the UK authorities had not "exceeded the margin of appreciation available to them." What this might mean in a future case where a same-sex couple alleges discrimination by a service provider claiming a religious exemption is unclear. Moreover, the application of a very deferential margin of appreciation was unnecessary, given the court found that any interference was in pursuit of a legitimate aim, necessary and proportional. By granting extremely wide latitude to states, the court left open the possibility that refusals by religiously motivated individuals to provide services to potential clients or customers because of their sexual orientation do not violate the ECHR.   </p>

<p>Finally, and perhaps most disappointingly, the court accepted at face value the assertion that the refusal to offer same-sex couples publicly available services (whether civil partnership ceremonies or relationship counseling) was, in fact, a manifestation of belief. The UK had <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/EN/Header/Press/Multimedia/Webcasts+of+public+hearings/webcastEN_media?id=20120904-1&lang=lang&flow=high">maintained</a> that these acts did not amount to manifestation, referring to Strasbourg jurisprudence holding that Article 9 did not "always guarantee the right to behave in the public sphere in a way which is dictated by" religion or belief and that the "term 'practice' in Article 9 does not cover each act which is motivated or influenced by a religion or belief," (<a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-23159;">Porter v. United Kingdom</a>; <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-96383">Skugar and Others v. Russia</a>). </p>

<p>In a case that would seem to be directly on point &#8212; and was cited by the Court of Appeal in its <em>Ladele</em> <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2009/1357.html">decision</a> &#8212; the ECtHR <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-43011">found</a> [French] inadmissible the application of two French pharmacists who had refused, for religious reasons, to fill prescriptions for contraceptives. Indeed, in <em>Pichon &#38; Sajous</em> the court stated:<blockquote>As long as the sale of contraceptives is legal and occurs on medical prescription nowhere other than in a pharmacy, the applicants cannot give precedence to their religious beliefs and impose them on others as justification for their refusal to sell such products, since they can manifest those beliefs in many ways outside the professional sphere.</blockquote>The refusal of pharmacists to sell contraceptives was described by the court as recently as 2009 as an example of acts which "were not recognized as a direct expression of the applicants' beliefs protected under Article 9 of the Convention." Nowhere in the <em>Eweida</em> judgment does the court explain why the reasoning of <em>Pichon &#38; Sajous</em> does not apply to the actions of Ladele and McFarlane. </p>

<p>There will continue to be cases, within Council of Europe member states and elsewhere, addressing claimed conflicts between religiously motivated individuals and general non-discrimination laws. <em>Eweida and Others</em> tells us only that a state may interfere with a manifestation of belief in the interest of equality, but it does not tell us that a state must do so.  </p>

		<title>&amp;apos;Right to Work&amp;apos; in Michigan: Depleting Unions, Dashing Dreams</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.msu.edu/faculty_staff/profile.php?prof=8">Susan H. Bitensky</a> of the Michigan State University College of Law says that Michigan's December passage of a "right to work" law will weaken the people and families who depend upon the benefits and protections negotiated by labor unions...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/betinsky.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n December 11, 2012, Michigan became the twenty-fourth state to <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/michigan-enacts-freedom-to-work-bill.php">enact</a> so-called "right to work" (RTW) laws. Though elsewhere these laws are not a new phenomenon, it was nevertheless shocking when Michigan took the plunge. Michigan, after all, is the <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20080916/AUTO01/809160319">birthplace</a> of the United Auto Workers, has provided the backdrop for many historically significant <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20080916/AUTO01/809160319">labor struggles</a> and, until December 11, has stood as a bastion of <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/12/11/news/economy/michigan-right-to-work-vote/index.html">unionization</a>  in a country that has seen organized labor dwindle to 11.8 percent of the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/union2.pdf">workforce</a> [PDF].</p>

<p>That RTW could happen in Michigan may tell us something dire about the future of the American dream. Regardless of whether the latter was merely a bill of goods before, Michigan's RTW statutes now surely reduce that vision to cruel myth. The demotion is assured by the fact that RTW laws severely <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2012/12/19/how-will-the-passage-of-right-to-work-measures-in-michigan-affect-the-state-economy/">weaken</a> labor unions, the very institutions created and controlled by workers to improve their economic circumstances. As such, unions are uniquely situated to make rank-and-file dreams a sometime reality. If unions are to be weakened in Michigan, then where will they be strong?</p>

<p>So, what is this law that puts unions and their constituencies into such bleak decline? Despite the name, RTW enactments do not give anyone a right to work that he or she would <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2012/12/11/right-to-work-laws-explained-debunked-demystified/">otherwise not have</a>. A RTW law, instead, permits workers in an organized bargaining unit to refuse to join the union and refuse to pay union dues while still enjoying all the <a href="http://www.aflcio.org/Legislation-and-Politics/State-Legislative-Battles/Ongoing-State-Legislative-Attacks">benefits</a> of union representation. Indeed, the union remains legally bound to fairly represent all employees in the unit, whether they pay dues or not. Though this arrangement is unjust in more ways than one, the focus of this article is on the institutional damage RTW statutes wreak upon unions primarily by <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/top-business-stories/why-right-to-work-really-does-mean-right-to-work-for-less-money/article6227966/">depriving</a> them of funds. With less funding, of course, unions are less able to organize, negotiate for and otherwise represent employees.</p>

<p>Yet, the US economy has long been structured so that, in all but the coziest of "mom and pop" businesses, employers possess massive power (subject to statutes setting only minimal protections for workers) to dictate the terms and conditions of employment to unorganized workers. This extreme imbalance is caused not only by the privileged position of capital in our society, but also by the circumstance that, when employees have no union, each employee must fend for himself or herself in dealing with the employer. Visualize, for example, a lone worker asking the likes of Boeing or Exxon Mobil for a raise, and the problem becomes clear.</p>

<p>It is this gargantuan gap in bargaining power between worker and boss that makes robust labor unions a moral imperative. Statistics show that, where RTW statutes exist, working people across the enacting state suffer serious adverse economic consequences, including:<ol><li>The <a href="http://www.aflcio.org/Legislation-and-Politics/State-Legislative-Battles/Ongoing-State-Legislative-Attacks/Right-to-Work-for-Less">average worker in RTW states</a> earns $1,540 less annually than workers in non-RTW states. </li><li>Poverty rates are higher in RTW states than in other states.</li><li>People in RTW states are less likely to have health insurance than their counterparts elsewhere.</li><li>RTW states have a workplace mortality rate at a whopping 36 percent higher than in non-RTW states.</li></ol>While the foregoing data applies to state populations in general, studies indicate that RTW statutes are also antithetical to children's needs in particular. For example, in RTW states: infant mortality rates are 15 percent higher than in other states; 10.8 percent of children have no health insurance compared to 7.5 percent of children elsewhere; 21.5 percent of children live in poverty while the rate for child poverty is 18.1 percent in other states; and, $3,392 less per student is expended on elementary and secondary education than is spent in the rest of the country. Thus, should newborns in RTW states survive past infancy, their normal physical and intellectual development are at increased risk.</p>

<p>In sum, RTW regimes set in motion a relentless downward spiral: RTW laws lead to weaker unions, and weaker unions lead to worsening economic conditions for those who can least afford it. Michigan, regardless of its pro-union traditions and culture, is now headed into that vortex.</p>

<p>It is probably true that unions are rarely in a position to act as a full counterweight to corporate power. But, if RTW laws were taken out of the mix, unions would retain the means to make the economic playing field, if not a field of dreams, then at least somewhat more level. Given the wildly asymmetrical distortion of power and wealth in the US, that is not a lot to ask.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.tjsl.edu/directory/linda-m-keller">Linda M. Keller</a> of Thomas Jefferson School of Law explores the potential impacts for the International Criminal Court of new Palestinian status at the UN in part one of this two-part series ...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/lindakeller.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) of the <a href="/feature/featured/icc/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) is <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/icc-to-consider-legal-meaning-of-palestine-statehood.php">reportedly considering</a> how the new status of Palestine at the UN impacts the ICC. The UN General Assembly recently <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/67/19">granted</a> non-member observer state status to Palestine. The most immediate issue is whether the General Assembly resolution will change the OTP's previous <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/icc-lacks-jurisdiction-to-investigate-palestine-war-crimes-claims-prosecutor.php">decision</a> refusing to go forward with a preliminary examination of international crimes in Palestine. Although Palestine filed a declaration accepting ICC jurisdiction, the OTP decided that Palestine's status as a "state" was too uncertain for the declaration to be effective. The General Assembly vote might change that determination. Moreover, the OTP and others at the court are likely considering how the resolution might affect potential ratification of the ICC statute by Palestine. </p>

<p>Some media <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/163062#.UND9nORINjQ">reports</a> assume that the resolution means Palestine will join the ICC and imply that a case against Israel for military action or settlements will be soon forthcoming. The reality is far more complicated because:<ol><li>Palestinian officials may not take any further action to prompt the OTP to reconsider its prior refusal;</li><li>The new prosecutor might not follow the prior prosecutor's reasoning, which underlies the presumption that the resolution resolves the statehood issue before the ICC;</li><li>The Palestinian declaration accepting ICC jurisdiction over Palestine, made prior to the General Assembly resolution, might not be valid;</li><li>A potential new Palestinian declaration might not cover acts prior to the resolution, particularly as far back as originally envisioned;</li><li>If a declaration is effective, an investigation might still not go forward based on:</li><blockquote>(a) A lack of a state or Security Council referral or request by the OTP to open an investigation;<br />
(b) The principle of complementarity (in that Israeli investigation or prosecution might render the case inadmissible);<br />
(c) Lack of gravity of the alleged crimes;<br />
(d) The exercise of prosecutorial discretion, finding that investigation or prosecution is not in the interests of justice.</blockquote></li><li>If an investigation does go forward, there are issues regarding temporal and territorial scope;</li><li>If Palestine decides to ratify the statute rather than rely on a declaration accepting jurisdiction, the process would take significant time and similar issues would arise.</li></ol>Part I of this article explores these first four points, while Part II will examine the remaining issues.</p>

<p>If the ICC attains jurisdiction over Palestinian territory, such jurisdiction would not be limited to Israeli crimes. Palestinian actions would also be considered as potential international crimes, which may complicate both Palestinian decisions to move forward at the ICC and the prosecutor's tasks in evaluating potential crimes. </p>

<p>Palestinian officials initially indicated the possibility of pursuing the declaration long-term. However, after Israel's announcement of further settlement expansion in the highly controversial E1 area in the West Bank &#8212; a potential war crime &#8212; Palestinian officials might well turn to the ICC sooner than <a href="http://www.bostonreview.net/BR37.6/david_luban_palestine_israel_international_criminal_court.php">planned</a>. </p>

<p>On the other hand, Christian Wenewaser, former president of the ICC Assembly of States Parties, has <a href="http://turtlebay.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/11/29/will_the_palestinians_go_to_the_international_criminal_court">speculated</a> that Palestinian statements about the ICC are more likely political tactics than realistic threats of immediate action. He notes that the ICC would also be tasked with investigating Palestinians firing rockets into Israel, which might discourage further Palestinian action. This seems especially pertinent given the apparent ongoing <a href="http://www.guardiannewsngr.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=107222:fatah-hamas-seek-reconciliation-palestinian-unity-&catid=76:world&Itemid=560">efforts</a> at reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas. Nonetheless, Palestinian officials may reopen the OTP's preliminary examination of international crimes in Palestine, if only to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/dec/15/international-criminal-court-lever-palestinians">strengthen their hand</a> against continued Israeli settlement activity (a strategy known as "lawfare"). It is not clear whether Palestine might try to reactivate the prior declaration, enter a new one or ratify the treaty.</p>

<p>The implications of the General Assembly resolution depend on the complex ICC system. The ICC is a treaty-based body established via the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a> to prevent and punish genocide, crimes of humanity and war crimes (as well as <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/icc-nations-adopt-crime-of-aggression.php">aggression</a>, should aggression amendments be adopted). The ICC is not a court of universal jurisdiction, but generally has jurisdiction over crimes committed on the territory of state parties or by their nationals. (One exception relates to a UN Security Council referral, which grants ICC jurisdiction over a non-state party such as <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/icc-un-security-council-must-do-more-in-darfur.php">Sudan</a>; obtaining custody over the accused is another matter.) Israel is not a party to the Rome Statute. Given the US veto in the Security Council, it will not be referred to the ICC. As a result, the ICC has no jurisdiction over crimes committed on the territory of Israel or by its nationals in Israel. Palestine is not a party to the Rome Statute either. However, the government of Palestine attempted to trigger jurisdiction over acts on the territory of Palestine using another avenue.</p>

<p>Under Article 12, "a State which is not a Party to this Statute" may lodge a declaration that accepts the jurisdiction of the ICC "with respect to the crime in question." The government of Palestine lodged such a <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/74EEE201-0FED-4481-95D4-C8071087102C/279777/20090122PalestinianDeclaration2.pdf">declaration</a> [PDF] on January 22, 2009, accepting jurisdiction for "acts committed on the territory of Palestine since 1 July 2002." The declaration responded to Israel's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=operation+cast+lead">Operation Cast Lead</a>, Israeli military action in Gaza subsequently deemed to be war crimes and crimes against humanity in the <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/un-report-finds-both-israel-and.php">Goldstone Report</a>, though not without controversy. </p>

<p>Under Article 11, the ICC has jurisdiction over crimes committed after the entry into force of the statute for that state, unless the state has filed a declaration under Article 12(3). The interplay of these two articles is <a href="http://opiniojuris.org/2012/12/01/palestinian-statehood-and-retroactive-jurisdiction/">disputed</a> as it relates to a potential ratification of the statute by Palestine, as will be discussed in Part 2. But it apears a non-state party can accept jurisdiction prior to the date of the declaration.</p>

<p>The prosecutor considered the Palestinian declaration for over three years. On April 3, 2012, the OTP issued an <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/icc-lacks-jurisdiction-to-investigate-palestine-war-crimes-claims-prosecutor.php">update</a> on the situation in Palestine. It noted that jurisdiction under Article 12 is a precondition to any examination of other conditions for jurisdiction or any analysis of alleged crimes. It noted that Article 12 refers to a "State" filing a declaration to accept jurisdiction. Rather than determining whether Palestine qualifies as a "State" under the terms of the Rome Statute, the OTP concluded that it lacked the authority to do so. It noted that it is the UN secretary-general who decides whether to accept the accession of a "State" ratifying the statute. The secretary-general typically follows or seeks the advice of the General Assembly in reaching such a determination.  </p>

<p>Although the reasoning for deferring to the secretary-general has been <a href="http://jurist.org/forum/2012/04/valentina-azarov-icc-palestine.php">criticized</a>, the OTP concluded that the secretary-general &#8212; with the guidance of the General Assembly &#8212; has the competence to decide disputes over the status of the "State" of Palestine with regard to Article 12(3). The OTP also noted that the ICC Assembly of States Parties might take up <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/C6162BBF-FEB9-4FAF-AFA9-836106D2694A/284387/SituationinPalestine030412ENG.pdf">the issue</a> [PDF].</p>

<p>The OTP then examined the UN status of Palestine, presumably as a proxy for the secretary-general's putative determination of statehood. At the time, Palestine had "observer" status at the General Assembly and Palestine's application for admission as a member state had not yet been acted upon. The OTP <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/structure%20of%20the%20court/office%20of%20the%20prosecutor/comm%20and%20ref/decision%20not%20to%20proceed/palestine/Pages/palestine.aspx">concluded</a>: "The Office could in the future consider allegations of crimes committed in Palestine, should competent organs of the United Nations or eventually the Assembly of States Parties resolve the legal issue relevant to an assessment of article 12." </p>

<p>On December 4, 2012, the General Assembly apparently made such a decision: it <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/67/19">upgraded</a> Palestine to "non-member observer State" status. However, some states voting for the resolution "<a href="http://www.asil.org/insights121208.cfm">underscored</a> that statehood could only be achieved through dialogue between the parties, implying that Palestine had not yet achieved statehood." Nevertheless, the resolution might satisfy the condition set by the OTP. But the OTP is now led by a new prosecutor, <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/fatou-bensouda-sworn-in-as-icc-prosecutor.php">Fatou Bensouda</a>, who <a href="http://www.asil.org/insights121208.cfm">may disavow</a> her predecessor's prior position. <br />
 <br />
Bensouda could conclude the prior determination improperly deferred to the secretary-general of the UN. She could decide that the determination belongs to the Assembly of States Parties, which could derail or delay further action. Yet, if Bensouda decides that the ICC should decide, she may proceed with the preliminary examination.</p>

<p>Assuming that the resolution qualifies Palestine as a state, it is <a href="http://www.amicc.org/docs/Palestine_and_the_ICC.pdf">not clear</a> [PDF] how the Palestinian declaration should be treated. If Palestine was not a state until November 29, 2012, could it have properly submitted a declaration accepting jurisdiction in 2009? Could that declaration properly extend the court's jurisdiction all the way back to July 2002 well before the resolution? Could a new declaration <a href="http://www.asil.org/insights121208.cfm">cure</a> the problem or is it impossible for a state to consent to jurisdiction prior to its statehood? Perhaps any Palestinian declaration would be effective only with regard to crimes allegedly committed after the resolution satisfying the OTP's statehood concern.</p>

<p>On the other hand, perhaps Bensouda will set an earlier date for effective statehood. Many states recognized Palestine as a state years ago. Further, on October 31, 2011, UNESCO <a href="http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/general_conference_admits_palestine_as_unesco_member_state/">admitted</a> Palestine as a member state, which would <a href="http://www.ejiltalk.org/icc-prosecutor-decides-that-he-cant-decide-on-the-statehood-of-palestine-is-he-right/">likely suffice</a> in terms of treaty ratification, the apparent test previously used by the OTP. Thus, there is much uncertainty related to the declaration itself. </p>

<p>Part II will explore the issues that arise even if the declaration is considered valid.</p>

		<title>Banning Niqabs in the Canadian Courtroom: Different Standards for Judges</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.queensu.ca/facultyAndStaff/facultyDirectory/baines.html">Beverley Baines</a> of the Queen's University Faculty of Law says that the new framework forged by the Supreme Court of Canada in the recent niqab ban case, <em>R. v. N.S.</em>, weakens the protections offered to niqab-wearing women...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/bevbaines.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n their December 2012 decision in <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/canada-top-court-rules-witnesses-may-wear-face-coverings-in-some-cases.php">R. v. N.S.</a> the Supreme Court of Canada decided that a Muslim witness does not have the right to wear her niqab when testifying in court against two men accused of sexually assaulting her. The decision split the Court: 4-2-1. </p>

<p>Dissenting, Justice Rosalie Abella would accord niqab-wearing Muslim women the right to testify. Justice Louis LeBel with Justice Marshall Rothstein would deny them this right. Despite disagreeing with the majority position that niqab bans should be decided on a case-by-case basis, LeBel's opinion is not labelled a dissent. It is "concurring" because he agreed with the majority decision to remit the ban in <em>N.S.</em> to the preliminary inquiry judge who issued it. </p>

<p>Why the inconsistency? "Because of the way the litigation and the appeals were conducted," LeBel wrote. His statement lacks the force of principle. What story might we tell about this inconsistency? Did the justices fear leaving the final outcome to a bare majority might give rise to an allegation of "Islamophobia" in a world all-too-ready to use this label? After all, no Muslim sits or has ever sat on the Supreme Court of Canada. Or did LeBel and Rothstein want to send a message to the preliminary inquiry judge expressing faith in his ability to make the right decision again? </p>

<p>Such speculations are not the stuff of legal analysis. Common law legal analysis demands reasoning from precedent. Authored by Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin, the majority decision forged a new framework for <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=niqab">niqab ban cases</a> by relying on two precedents that involved publication bans: <a href="http://canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1994/1994canlii39/1994canlii39.html">Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corporation</a> and <a href="http://canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2001/2001scc76/2001scc76.html">R. v. Mentuck</a>. McLachlin did not explain the analogy between niqab and publication bans. While publication bans aim to protect identity and preserve the presumption of innocence, these objectives are not necessarily identical under niqab bans.</p>

<p>Identity is a complex matter in <em>R. v. N.S.</em>. Given that the accused assailants were her uncle and cousin, they knew the identity of the testifying victim. From N.S.'s perspective, her identity as a Muslim woman was threatened by the niqab ban. Her faith requires her to cover her face in the presence of men who are not members of her immediate family. Removing her niqab would rob her of her religious identity just as would depriving a Jewish man of his kippah, a Sikh of his turban or an Amish of his hair. Nor is the link between the niqab and the presumption of innocence transparent, despite the chief justice's repeated reference to the niqab portending a wrongful conviction. If the niqab is such a serious impediment, might wearing it not result in a wrongful acquittal?</p>

<p>What if the majority had not analogized the niqab and publication ban cases? The issue &#8212; whether the niqab ban violated the guarantee of freedom of religion under <a href="http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/charter_digest/s-2-a.html">Section 2(a)</a> of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms &#8212; could be resolved using two precedents. One, <a href="http://canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2004/2004scc47/2004scc47.html">Syndicat Northcrest v. Amselem</a>, was invoked directly or indirectly by all eleven appellate judges in <em>R. v. N.S.</em>. <em>Amselem</em> requires a religious belief be "sincere", not "strong" as the preliminary inquiry judge maintained when he used N.S.'s removal of the niqab for her driver's licence photo to deny her religious claim. The other precedent, <a href="http://canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1986/1986canlii46/1986canlii46.html">R. v. Oakes</a>, sets out the justificatory test required under <a href="http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/charter_digest/s-1.html">Section 1</a> of the Charter.</p>

<p>In <em>Oakes</em>, Chief Justice Brian Dickson designed the justificatory test with two central criteria: (1) the impugned measure must have a pressing and substantial objective, and (2) it must meet a proportionality test. This proportionality test had three components: (1) there must be a rational connection between the impugned measure and the objective; (2) the impugned measure must impair as little as possible (minimally impair) the right in question; and (3) there must be a proportionality between the effects of the impugned measure and the objective. </p>

<p>Despite lip-service to the <em>Oakes</em> test, the <em>N.S.</em> majority did not apply it. Instead, McLachlin adopted a justificatory test proposed by Chief Justice Antonio Lamer in <em>Dagenais</em>. He had decided it was "necessary to reformulate the common law rule governing the issuance of publication bans in a manner that reflects the principles of the Charter." He believed, and most scholars accept, that this reformulation enhances the <em>Oakes</em> test. In <em>Dagenais</em>, McLachlin issued a concurring opinion (as a non-chief justice) in which she relied on <em>Oakes</em> and made no mention of Lamer's reformulation. </p>

<p>Breaking her silence in <em>N.S.</em>, McLachlin incorporated the <em>Dagenais</em> reformulation (slightly modified by <em>Mentuck</em>) in her new framework, posing four questions:<ol><li>Would requiring the witness to remove the niqab while testifying interfere with her religious freedom?</li><li>Would permitting the witness to wear the niqab while testifying create a serious risk to trial fairness?</li><li>Is there a way to accommodate both rights and avoid the conflict between them?</li><li>If no accommodation is possible, do the salutary effects of requiring the witness to remove the niqab outweigh the deleterious effects of doing so?</li></ol>Leaving aside the first question, which is not part of the justificatory process, the remaining three come directly from the <em>Dagenais</em> reformulation. They compare unfavorably with the <em>Oakes</em> test.</p>

<p>Question two changes the focus of the analysis by asking whether the niqab creates a "serious" risk (drawing on the <em>Mentuck</em> modification of <em>Dagenais</em> which would have asked whether the niqab presents a "real and substantial" risk). In contrast, <em>Oakes</em> would ask whether the ban has a "pressing and substantial" objective. Granted "serious," "real," "substantial" and "pressing" express qualitative similarities (<em>viz</em>. all are more than trivial), the reformulation targets the niqab; <em>Oakes</em>, the ban. The ban, not the niqab, is the state action that <em>N.S.</em> impugned; the ban is what the state and the accused must justify. Moving the lens from the ban to the niqab removes the state and the accused from the framework and inserts N.S. But justification is not N.S.'s task. </p>

<p>The new framework poses no question that addresses the first component of the <em>Oakes</em> proportionality test: rational connection. This omission allowed McLachlin to advance a "common law assumption" for which she provided no evidence or precedent, and about which she said "[t]he record sheds little light." According to this assumption, "the ability to see a witness's [sic] face is an important feature of a fair trial." She refused to weigh arguments and articles submitted by N.S. and supporting interveners to the effect that the importance of seeing a witness's face has been greatly exaggerated. According to McLachlin, they had not been tendered "through an expert available for cross-examination." But then neither was her assumption. </p>

<p>Question three of the chief justice's new framework subverts the minimal impairment component of the <em>Oakes</em> proportionality test. Question three provides an optional remedy &#8212; if there is an alternative to the ban, the Court will accommodate it. In contrast, the <em>Oakes</em> minimal impairment requirement is a mandatory test; failing it means the ban also fails. Moreover, Charter jurisprudence shows the court seldom "saves" an absolute ban; the state must consider alternatives. Ironically, then, McLachlin probably issued her concurring opinion in <em>Dagenais</em> to make the point that the publication ban should be set aside because it failed the rational connection and minimal impairment tests. Would she have adopted the same approach in <em>N.S.</em> if the rational connection and minimal impairment tests had continued to figure into her justificatory analysis?</p>

<p>Question four stole all the thunder when Lamer first announced it in his <em>Dagenais</em> reformulation. But, unlike the rest of his reformulation, it makes no significant change to the third (proportionality) component of the <em>Oakes</em> proportionality test. My comment about McLachlin's response to this question in <em>N.S.</em> is that there was no reason to reach it. The majority should have decided that the niqab ban, like the publication ban in <em>Dagenais</em>, failed the rational connection and minimal impairment tests. </p>

<p>Sending the justificatory test back to the preliminary inquiry judge will not assist N.S. if he follows McLachlin's new framework. Derived as it is from the <em>Dagenais</em>/<em>Mentuck</em> reformulation, this framework weakens the protection <em>Oakes</em> offers to niqab-wearing women. Of course, the new framework is attractive to judges. It applies easier standards to the task of justifying court orders. But, given its origins, this new standard applies not just to court orders concerning niqab bans, but to those involving publication bans and who knows what else.</p>

		<title>Full Separation Pay for Veterans Discharged Under &amp;apos;Don&amp;apos;t Ask, Don&amp;apos;t Tell&amp;apos;</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.aclu.org/blog/author/joshua-block">Joshua Block</a> of the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">ACLU</a> discusses the importance of the ACLU's recent victory, which will provide full separation pay to certain veterans who were discharged under the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/joshuablock.jpg" width="120" height="200" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he government <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/veterans-discharged-under-dadt-to-receive-full-separation-pay.php">finally agreed</a> this month to pay full separation pay to gay and lesbian service members who were discharged under the discriminatory <a href="/feature/2011/09/dont-ask-dont-tell.php">"Don't Ask, Don't Tell"</a> (DADT) policy as part of a class action lawsuit brought by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">ACLU</a>. Approximately 181 honorably discharged veterans will now finally receive severance pay that had previously been cut in half solely because of their sexual orientation. Although the settlement provides much-needed relief for these veterans, it is also a reminder that the legacy of unfair treatment of gay and lesbian veterans continues even after the formal repeal of DADT.</p>

<p>Here's how the military's "separation pay" policy worked: by statute, all service members who serve six years in the military and are then discharged involuntarily are supposed to receive separation pay to ease their transition to civilian life. But the Department of Defense (DOD) had an internal policy &#8212; not required by any statute &#8212; of cutting that separation pay in half if service members were discharged, even honorably, for "homosexuality." That's what happened to the lead client in our <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/aclu-files-suit-over-military-discharge-pay-policy.php">class action lawsuit</a> challenging this needless policy. Staff Sgt. Richard Collins was a decorated Air Force officer who served nine years before being kicked out under DADT. He was seen kissing his civilian boyfriend, in a car at a stoplight, when he was off-duty, out of uniform and 10 miles off base. After being discharged, Collins discovered that his separation pay was cut in half.</p>

<p>Collins' story is hardly unique. Many of those who were discharged under DADT were distinguished soldiers, airmen or cadets and had unblemished records. They were service members in good standing, and there was nothing dishonorable about their discharge. Yet, they are denied the same separation pay as other honorably discharged service members merely because they are gay or lesbian.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the settlement cannot fully make up for the harm caused by DADT. Even though veterans will now belatedly receive the full separation pay they were entitled to, the time when they needed that separation pay the most &#8212; when they were initially discharged and transitioning back into civilian life &#8212; has passed. Unfortunately, because of the statute of limitations for suing the government, we were able to get relief only for service members who were discharged on or after November 10, 2004. </p>

<p>This settlement is also about more than money. It is about fairness. The discriminatory "separation pay" policy added insult to injury by telling lesbian and gay veterans that their service was worth only half as much as everyone else's. As Collins told us: "We gave all in serving this nation. The Pentagon should not give us half in return."</p>

<p>Another service member &#8212; who was discharged under DADT and has since reenlisted &#8212; <a href="http://outservemag.com/2013/01/thank-you-richard-collins/">described his experience</a> in an interview:<blockquote>Halving the rate was an insult to veterans like me not because it was less money, but because it was justified using the reason for our separation: "<em>Homosexuality</em>". It was, in essence, a slap in the face for those of us who were being involuntarily separated under Honorable conditions simple for being labeled gay. "<em>You're only worth half as much as the typical service member because you're gay</em>." It was the penultimate dig before we received DD-214 discharge papers with "<strong>Homosexual...</strong>" written at the bottom. </blockquote>Lesbian and gay service members and their families still face barriers to fair and equal treatment. The Pentagon has refused to provide service members with explicit protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation. As a result of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3396.ENR:">Defense of Mafrriage Act</a> (DOMA), service members with same-sex spouses still cannot give the same protections to their loved ones that other service members are able to give. And transgender people are still categorically barred from service. There are many challenges ahead for LGBT service members and veterans, but this settlement is a small and important step for basic fairness. </p>

		<title>New Legislation on National Referendums in Ukraine: Legal or Political Decision?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Oksana Siruk, <a href="http://www.ukma.kiev.ua/eng_site/">National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy</a>, discusses the procedural violations and controversy behind the Ukrainian National Referendum Law...<hr height='1'><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size='3'><strong>O</strong></font>n November 6, 2012, the Ukrainian Parliament <a href="http://rada.gov.ua/?art_id=322023&cat_id=37486">adopted</a> [Ukrainian] new legislation regulating national referendums. Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/ukraine-president-approves-law-on-national-referendums.php">approved</a> the law on November 27, 2012. This controversial decision has provoked much discussion in Ukraine. </p>

<p>The draft of this new legislation was adopted in 2010 but the law only entered into force at the end of 2012. Typically, the <a href="http://zakon2.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/254%D0%BA/96-%D0%B2%D1%80/print1348734176425585">Constitution of Ukraine</a> [Ukrainian] requires a three-step process to adopt any act, whereby the parliament must approve the draft three times. During this process, each article of the proposed law must be separately approved. However, for this act, the Ukrainian Parliament neglected amendments which had been offered during this review process and adopted the original, unamended version of the act. The famous Ukrainian lawyer Viktor Musiyaka &#8212; the author of Ukraine's constitution &#8212; has <a href="http://news.liga.net/print/articles/politics/765585-neytralizator_rady_zachem_vlasti_novyy_zakon_o_referendume.htm">declared</a> [Russian] the legislation unconstitutional because of the procedural violations during its adoption. The <a href="http://zakon2.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/5475-17/print1348734176425585">Legal Act on the National Referendum</a> [Ukrainian] provides the guidelines for amending the constitution, ratifying territorial boundaries and establishing legislation.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://zakon1.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/254%D0%BA/96-%D0%B2%D1%80">Article 73</a> [Ukrainian] of the Constitution of Ukraine, changes of the territorial boundaries of the country can be made only by referendum. However, the previous <a href="http://zakon2.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/1286-12/print1348734176425585">Legal Act on National and Local Referendums</a> [Ukrainian] did not include this requirement. Article 18 of the Legal Act on National Referendum 2012 contains a provision defining the process of changing the territorial boundaries of the Ukraine through the approval of international treaty, modifying the territory of Ukraine via referendum. As to the overall objective of the referendum, the 1991 Act contained a provision which allowed for defining the main aim of Ukraine's constitution and legal acts by national referendum. The new legislation replaces this provision with a more general referendum mechanism.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the new Act contains a provision establishing that any new versions of the constitution and legal acts may neither narrow the scope of existing human rights nor liquidate the independence of the state. Also, legal acts which damage territorial integrity may not be offered for referendum. The new legislation on the national referendum defining the scope of referendums conforms to the Constitution of Ukraine. At the same time, general referendum is allowed for addressing any number of potential problems. This amendment, at least, seems reasonable because it permits referendums on necessary problems.</p>

<p>According to Article 15 of the Act, the Constitution of Ukraine can be adopted via referendum. Amendments to the constitution &#8212; or its termination &#8212; may also occur through referendum, and do not require the future approval of the parliament. The Parliament of Ukraine excluded this provision from the draft in the "second step" of approval described above, but, in 2012, this provision somehow appeared in the final version of the act. Therefore, Parliament ignored second-step amendments and simply adopted the first version of the act. However, the aforementioned norm has a sufficient legal basis. For instance, according to an April 2008 <a href="http://zakon2.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/v006p710-08">decision</a> [Ukrainian] of the Constitutional Court of Ukraine, any act adopted via referendum does not require any future approval by Parliament to take effect. Regarding the adoption of a new constitution, the process of drafting a new constitution is not prescribed by the legislation on the national referendum. This contradicts the decision of the Constitutional Court of Ukraine, where the Court stated that this process should be prescribed by the constitution.</p>

<p>As to the procedural part, there are some amendments in the new act, but, generally, the procedure remains the same. For instance, the procedure of citizen-initiated, national referendums has become more complicated. Now, initiative groups can be formed by a meeting that has to consist of more than 2,000 citizens. The previous legal act only required 200 persons to form such an initiative group. However, the most dangerous provision of this legislation is that the new version of the constitution comes into force as soon as the results of the referendum are officially announced. The same provision is applicable to any act or amendments adopted via referendum. Such provision violates Article 94 of the Constitution of Ukraine. According to this article, a legal act enters into force only after its official publication. Even if any other procedure is prescribed by the act, a legal act cannot enter into force before its official publication. Additionally, Article 97 of the Legal Act on National Referendum establishes that any decisions via referendum should be published during the five days after the official announcement of the referendum's results. This contradicts Article 8 of the constitution, which states that all the legal acts adopted in Ukraine must be adopted on the basis of the Constitution of Ukraine and cannot contradict it. However, the Constitutional Court of Ukraine stated that Article 94 is not applicable to adopting acts via referendum. The Court mentioned nothing regarding the constitution &#8212; only about legal acts in general.</p>

<p>The previous Legal Act on National Referendum contained a provision that any referendum is invalid if less than half of the listed citizenry participated in the election. However, the recently adopted Legal Act on National Referendum does not contain any similar provision. Article 69 of the Constitution of Ukraine defines referendum as a form of direct democracy in Ukraine. This means that the referendum should represent the wishes of the whole nation. A referendum cannot be representative if less than half of the citizens take part in it. Consequently, the new law violates the principle of direct democracy. Moreover, the lack of such safeguards becomes more dangerous in the Ukraine because the level of citizens' participation in any kind of voting has decreased every year since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. For instance, only <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/polls-close-ukrainian-elections/24753520.html">56.76 percent</a> of constituents participated in Parliamentary elections in the fall of 2012.</p>

<p>The biggest dangers of the new law are the provisions that allow the constitution to be adopted via referendum and the fact that the new constitution will enter into force just after the publication of the results of the referendum. It is <a href="http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/96545">not a secret</a> [PDF] that there are big problems in Ukraine with <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/europe-human-rights-overseer-urges-open-and-honest-elections-in-ukraine.php">fair elections</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/ukraine-pm-files-lawsuit-challenging.php">falsifications of the results</a>; hence, there is a higher likelihood for fraud to occur during a referendum. </p>

It would be unconscionable for government-licensed therapists to carry out this form of treatment. Yet, this is exactly what US governments have been doing by permitting "reparative therapy," also known as sexual orientation change efforts (SOCE). This "therapy" has repeatedly been shown to not only be ineffective, but dangerous in that it often causes severe mental trauma &#8212; and even death &#8212; for some children.</p>

<p>Last year, the California State Legislature <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/california-lawmakers-approve-ban-therapy-to-reverse-homosexuality-for-minors.php">exercised</a> its power to protect public health and passed <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/sen/sb_1151-1200/sb_1172_bill_20120416_amended_sen_v97.html">Senate Bill 1172</a> (SB 1172) [PDF], the first law in the nation to ban SOCE for minors. <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-judge-refuses-to-block-california-sexual-orientation-change-therapy-ban.php">Case law</a> &#8212; and the plain language of the statute &#8212; show that this law is constitutional. </p>

<p><strong>The Dangerous Quackery of SOCE</strong></p>

<p>There are many words to describe SOCE, but perhaps the best two are these: "dangerous quackery." SOCE therapies have included castration, electrical shocks, nausea-inducing drugs and bogus psychotherapeutic treatments, such as  promoting heterosexual intercourse to gay children, or telling them that God cries because they are gay.</p>

<p>At least ten major professional health organizations have rejected reparative therapy and warned about its dangers. The American Psychological Association (APA) conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed journal literature on SOCE and issued a <a href="http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/therapeutic-response.pdf">report</a> [PDF] in 2009 stating that "sexual orientation change efforts can pose critical health risks to lesbian, gay, and bisexual people, including confusion, depression, guilt, helplessness ... suicidality ... increased self-hatred ... sexual dysfunction, high-risk sexual behaviors ... and a sense of having wasted time and resources."</p>

<p>The APA concluded: "The potential risks of reparative therapy are great, including depression, anxiety and self-destructive behavior." In May 2012, Pan American Health Organization Director Dr. Mirta Roses Periago <a href="http://new.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=6803&Itemid=1926">stated</a>: "These supposed conversion therapies constitute a violation of the ethical principles of health care and violate human rights that are protected by international and regional agreements." During <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/california-becomes-first-state-to-pass-a-law-banning-sexual-orientation-therapy.php">the signing of SB 1172</a>, California Governor Jerry Brown <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/01/us/california-bans-therapies-to-cure-gay-minors.html?_r=0">asserted</a> that "[t]hese practices have no basis in science or medicine and they will now be relegated to the dustbin of quackery."</p>

<p><strong>The First Amendment Does Not Shield Therapists From Public Health Regulations</strong></p>

<p>Upon SB 1172's enactment, two groups of plaintiffs filed lawsuits to enjoin the law. Their primary argument is that reparative therapy includes speech and therefore the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> to the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/">US Constitution</a> prevents such regulation. The argument is specious because virtually all medical treatment involves speech. When a doctor calls in a prescription or tells a patient his diagnosis, it is done through speech. Yet, a doctor is not shielded from medical malpractice if he calls in the wrong prescription &#151 or misdiagnoses one's cancer &#8212; simply because the doctor conveyed the information verbally.</p>

<p>If the plaintiffs were correct, then the state could never regulate the medical profession because all doctors engage in some sort of speech when they practice medicine.  Recognizing this absurdity, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6298856056242550994">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</a>, the US Supreme Court stated that, when speech is "part of the practice of medicine, [it is] subject to reasonable licensing and regulation by the State."</p>

<p>With regard to therapists specifically, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8267578729426838250">National Association for the Advancement of Psychoanalysis (NAAP) vs. California Board of Psychology</a>, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that therapists are not entitled to special First Amendment protection:<blockquote>[T]he key component of psychoanalysis is the treatment of emotional suffering and depression, not speech ... That psychoanalysts employ speech to treat their clients does not entitle them, or their profession, to special First Amendment protection.</blockquote>In the case at hand, the entire house of medicine has concluded that a person's sexual orientation is not a medical disorder or disease that requires a cure. Homosexuality, for example, is not listed in the <a href="http://www.psychiatry.org/practice/dsm">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a> (DSM). No ethical therapist would ever attempt to "cure" something that is not a mental disorder. Reparative therapists have been misdiagnosing their patients and committing medical malpractice on a massive scale. Recently, six plaintiffs in New Jersey sued their reparative therapists for fraud and other torts.</p>

<p>Neither the Supreme Court nor the Ninth Circuit have ever interpreted the First Amendment as shielding licensed therapists from medical malpractice and medical licensing laws because their practice of medicine includes talking. For this same reason, the First Amendment does not preclude SB 1172 &#8212; a public health law &#8212; from applying to therapists.</p>

<p><strong>Judge Mueller Upholds Constitutionality of SB 1172</strong></p>

<p>Relying in part on <em>NAAP</em> and the plain language of SB 1172, District Judge Kimberly Mueller <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16871266642217865516">found</a> that the First Amendment does not apply to SOCE treatment. The language of SB 1172 does not regulate speech. Rather, it regulates medical practices, and SB 1172 defines SOCE as "practices" by mental health providers "that seek to change an individual's sexual orientation." Mueller found that "plaintiff therapists have not shown they are likely to succeed in bearing their burden of showing that the First Amendment applies to SOCE treatment; they have not shown that the treatment, the end product of which is a change of behavior, is expressive conduct entitled to First Amendment protection."</p>

<p><strong>Judge Shubb's Ruling Leads to Absurd Situations, Ignores the Plain Language of SB 1172</strong><br />
 <br />
A second federal district judge, however, <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-judge-blocks-california-law-banning-sexual-orientation-change-therapy.php">issued</a> an <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6232536737721914160">injunction</a> against SB 1172, but applied it only to the three plaintiffs who brought the lawsuit. District Judge William Shubb believed that the First Amendment applied to SOCE therapy and held that SB 1172 failed to meet a strict scrutiny test since it was a content and viewpoint based regulation on speech. Shubb's ruling unfortunately could lead to all sorts of dangerous situations. Would therapists now be immune from medical malpractice claims because their "speech" is protected by the First Amendment? Could therapists now say whatever they want to a patient regardless of how unethical or dangerous it is?</p>

<p>Consider the following example: suppose a group of therapists believed in the assisted suicide movement and recommended that for some patients experiencing immense mental suffering suicide would be the best alternative. These therapists then embark on a course of treatment seeking to cause their patients to commit suicide. Under Shubb's ruling, California would not be able to pass a law stopping this suicidal medical treatment because it would be a content and viewpoint based regulation on the therapists' speech.</p>

<p>Another problem with Shubb's ruling is that it ignores the plain language of the statute. As explained above, SB 1172 does not regulate speech, it regulates mental health practices. SB 1172 only applies to "practices" carried out by a "mental health provider." Under SB 1172, a priest, a doctor who does not specialize in mental health or even a layperson could still engage in SOCE. If the intent of SB 1172 was to somehow prohibit speech, it would be a curious way to do so since the 99 percent of the citizenry who are not licensed therapists can still engage in SOCE under SB 1172.</p>

<p>The line that SB 1172 draws is the same reasonable distinction that all of us understand: licensed professionals are held to different ethical standards than the rest of us. For example, suppose someone showed skin discoloration on his hand to his lawyer friend, who responded: "Don't worry, it's just an age spot." Unfortunately, the discoloration turned out to be cancer. This unfortunate person could not sue their friend for medical malpractice. However, if that same person went to a dermatologist and the physician uttered the exact same phrase, the patient could indeed sue for medical malpractice. The primary difference between the lawyer and the doctor in this situation is a medical license, which is the same distinction SB 1172 draws. That is why the remedy SB 1172 provides is based entirely on licensing. Violations of SB 1172 "subject a mental health provider to discipline by the licensing entity for that mental health provider."</p>

<p>Our laws also make a similar distinction in other professions. As a civilian, I can say: "The president is a traitor." However, if I utter that exact same statement while on military reserve duty I can be court-martialed. Like mental health professionals, military members are held to a different, higher standard. The First Amendment protects civilians who criticize their president, but not military members, because the status of the speaker matters. The same is true for the mental health profession &#8212; it matters if the person giving a diagnosis is a licensed therapist as opposed to a layperson, even if the exact same statement is made. The same goes for SB 1172: it matters if the person giving the reparative therapy is a mental health provider or, alternatively, a layperson.<br />
 <br />
Shubb's ruling also disregards the critical fact that, under the plain language of the statute, a therapist can still say whatever the therapist wants. A therapist can say that homosexuality is evil, or that God cries because a child is gay, or that he believes homosexuality can be cured. What SB 1172 guards against is a therapist subsequently embarking on a course of treatment to "cure" the patient of homosexuality.</p>

<p>Moreover, SB 1172 allows therapists not licensed in California to avoid the statute altogether. One of the primary points of SB 1172 is that California state government does not want its imprimatur on a purported therapy that is dangerous and has been overwhelmingly discredited. California certainly should be able to legislate that its California-licensed reparative therapists need to stop subjecting children to harmful practices that have been rejected by every mainstream professional medical organization.</p>

<p>The Ninth Circuit will hear the appeals from both Judge Mueller's Order and Judge Shubb's Order later this year. The case law, plain language of the statute and common sense dictate that SB 1172 should be upheld.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.tjsl.edu/directory/linda-m-keller">Linda M. Keller</a> of Thomas Jefferson School of Law explores the potential impacts for the International Criminal Court of new Palestinian status at the UN in part two of this <a href="/forum/2013/01/linda-keller-icc-palestine-part1.php">two-part series</a> ...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/lindakeller.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>A</strong></font>s discussed in <a href="/forum/2013/01/linda-keller-icc-palestine-part1.php">Part I</a>, the General Assembly <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2012/ga11317.doc.htm">resolution</a> granting Palestine "non-member observer State" status raises difficult issues for the <a href="/feature/featured/icc/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC). Any determination that a Palestinian declaration is valid is only the starting point. If we presume that the old declaration is effective or if a new declaration were filed, the first stage of preliminary examination would be passed, but other obstacles remain. The Office of the Prosecutor's (OTP) earlier <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/icc-lacks-jurisdiction-to-investigate-palestine-war-crimes-claims-prosecutor.php">examination</a> of the declaration cited Articles 13 and 53 of the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a>. Article 13 refers to a state party or UN Security Council referral, or the opening of an investigation by the OTP with the approval of the Pre-Trial Chamber. If no state party were willing to provide a referral, then the prosecutor would need to trigger the investigation herself, perhaps leaving the statehood question to the Pre-Trial Chamber that must approve such a request. According to David Luban, the ICC would <a href="http://www.bostonreview.net/BR37.6/david_luban_palestine_israel_international_criminal_court.php">likely pass</a> the statehood decision to the Assembly of States Parties, where investigation would end because of reluctance to accept Palestinian statehood as it relates to the Rome Statute. Yet there is no guarantee that the prosecutor would seek to open an investigation or that another State would refer the situation in Palestine in the first instance &#8212; a hurdle often overlooked.</p>

<p>Assuming that a preliminary examination goes forward, the OTP must also consider Article 53, which relates to prosecutorial discretion. The OTP must consider whether there is a reasonable basis that an ICC crime has occurred, whether a case would be admissible and whether the interest of justice would be served. Similar criteria apply to the determination of a basis for prosecution. These provisions are quite controversial.  </p>

<p>First, the OTP must delve into whether the facts support a finding that a crime has occurred. The <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/un-report-finds-both-israel-and.php">Goldstone Report</a> indicated that crimes against humanity and war crimes likely occurred during <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=operation+cast+lead">Operation Cast Lead</a> but apparently even Justice Goldstone has <a href="http://a-mid-east-journal.blogspot.com/2013/01/israel-palestine-and-international.html">reconsidered</a> that conclusion in light of additional information. Moreover, an outside finding does not guarantee the OTP could obtain evidence to support a finding of a reasonable basis for crimes, particularly if Israel does not cooperate. At the least, this endeavor would likely take substantial time.</p>

<p>Next, the prosecutor may determine that a case is inadmissible under Article 17 of the Rome Statute on any of several grounds. A case is inadmissible if it is being investigated or prosecuted or has been investigated with a determination that prosecution is not warranted by a state with jurisdiction, unless the state is unwilling or unable genuinely to investigate or prosecute. A case is also inadmissible if the person concerned has already been tried for similar conduct. Finally, the case is inadmissible if it is not of sufficient gravity.</p>

<p>Regarding Article 17, the OTP would examine whether the state (such as Israel) can effectively block prosecution at the ICC under the principle of complementarity: the ICC is not able to assert jurisdiction if a state with jurisdiction is genuinely able or willing to investigate, prosecute or decide not to prosecute. Finally, the OTP would have to examine the gravity issue, a concept that has led to <a href="http://humanrightsdoctorate.blogspot.com/2008/12/gravity-are-lives-of-civilians-not-as.html">criticism</a> in the past, such as regarding the refusal to launch an investigation into crimes in Iraq. The cyclical and reciprocal nature of much of the violence between Israel and Palestine might further <a href="http://www.academia.edu/383227/Israel_Palestine_and_the_ICC">complicate</a> the analysis of the gravity issue.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Article 53 allows the OTP to decline to investigate or prosecute if it would not be in the "interests of justice" &#8212; an undefined and controversial concept. Given the highly fraught, political nature of any investigation into Israeli (or Palestinian) crimes, and the emphasis on resolving issues such as boundaries via negotiation, the OTP may decline to go forward under Article 53.</p>

<p>If an investigation does go forward, other issues arise. As noted in <a href="/forum/2013/01/linda-keller-icc-palestine-part1.php">Part 1</a>, retroactive jurisdiction is an issue in terms of the scope of the investigation. In addition, there may be interpretative difficulty with the terms of the declaration, which refers to "the territory of Palestine." What exactly is the territory of Palestine? While it would most likely include Gaza and the West Bank, jurisdiction over disputed areas is <a href="http://www.ejiltalk.org/settlements-territory-and-the-icc/">controversial</a>. Moreover, David Luban has <a href="http://www.bostonreview.net/BR37.6/david_luban_palestine_israel_international_criminal_court.php">posited</a> that the territory of Palestine might not include Gaza, because of its "separate and antagonistic government." On the other hand, the resolution refers to pre-1967 borders, which might help provide some guidance for the ICC, despite <a href="http://www.bostonreview.net/BR37.6/david_luban_palestine_israel_international_criminal_court.php">criticism</a> that the resolution is "contradictory and vague" on this matter. </p>

<p>It should also not be forgotten that the crimes in question are not necessarily limited to those committed by Israelis. The Palestinian declaration refers to "crimes committed on the territory of Palestine," which would include war crimes committed by Palestinians, such as the deliberate targeting of civilians. Some commentators have <a href="http://opiniojuris.org/2012/11/29/yes-palestine-could-accept-the-iccs-jurisdiction-retroactively/">noted</a> that Hamas attacks on civilians might be easier to establish than Israel's war crimes, though such claims are disputed, particularly in the context of Israeli settlements.</p>

<p>For example, Jennifer Trahan and Belinda Cooper <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/news/opinions/palestinian_120612.html">note</a> that "prosecutions of future Hamas crimes might proceed more easily than similar prosecutions of Israeli crimes." Likewise, it can be argued that Israel has a better chance of blocking the case based on the aforementioned principle of complementarity. Israel has a track record of conducting at least some investigations into war crimes allegations and might undertake more if an ICC investigation seems probable. There seem to be few, if any, <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/news/opinions/palestinian_120612.html">investigations</a> of Hamas rocket fire into Israel. Thus, any OTP reconsideration of the declaration is itself a complex process that might not lead to an investigation or prosecution of Israelis or Palestinians. Furthermore, if an investigation or prosecution is considered a threat to international peace and security, the UN Security Council can ask the ICC to suspend investigation or prosecution under Article 16, though this seems unlikely given the power of veto-bearing members to block such a move.</p>

<p>Many media reports also refer to Palestine joining the ICC. If Palestine were to decide to become a state party to the Rome Statute, there might be <a href="http://www.ejiltalk.org/category/palestine/">issues</a> with regard to statehood. Yet it seems more likely that the UN secretary-general would follow the lead of the General Assembly and the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in considering Palestine a state for the purposes of treaty ratification. If Palestine becomes a party to the Rome Statute, it could refer the situation in Palestine to the ICC &#8212; as could any state party. The jurisdiction of the ICC would cover not only crimes committed in the territory of Palestine, but any crimes committed by Palestinians worldwide. As noted above, the territory of Palestine might be controversial, but jurisdiction based on nationality should be less so, assuming the statehood of Palestine. In addition, there is <a href="http://opiniojuris.org/2012/12/01/palestinian-statehood-and-retroactive-jurisdiction/">uncertainty</a> over the potential retroactivity of jurisdiction to certain dates prior to the General Assembly resolution. It is generally <a href="http://www.intlawgrrls.com/2012/12/in-case-of-palestine-no-sense-in.html">agreed</a>, however, that any ICC investigation would likely encompass allegations of both Israeli and Palestinian crimes.</p>

<p>As Trahan and Cooper <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/news/opinions/palestinian_120612.html">point out</a>, Palestine as a state party would have a duty to cooperate with investigations and implement arrest warrants, while Israel would not have such a legal obligation. Palestine may come to regret a decision to join the ICC, particularly if it is asked to effectuate arrest warrants against Hamas militants.</p>

<p>In the end, the prosecutor might take the decision out of the hands of Palestinian officials by reconsidering the prior OTP decision in light of the General Assembly resolution and seeking to open an investigation. It seems more likely, however, that the prosecutor will not be eager to dive into the fraught political controversy between the Israelis and Palestinians. In particular, commentators have <a href="http://www.thejc.com/comment-and-debate/analysis/93479/joining-hague-court-will-have-implications-palestinians-too">pointed out</a> that the settlement issue is one that should be decided politically, rather than by the ICC, as "even the Palestinians concede that some settlements will be on the Israeli side of a future boundary."  </p>

<p>Many commentators have warned Palestine of the dangers of pursuing its declaration or joining the ICC. Moreover, the Palestinians are facing continued pressure from states not to go to the ICC. The US Senate, for example, is reportedly <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/palestinian-war-crimes-case-faces-long-road-205624000.html">considering</a> legislation that would eliminate aid and close diplomatic offices of the Palestinians if the Palestinians push for ICC action. In light of these pressures it is possible that Ambassador Christian Wenewaser is correct in <a href="http://turtlebay.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/11/29/will_the_palestinians_go_to_the_international_criminal_court">interpreting</a> the Palestinian statements as tactical position rather than an immediate action plan.</p>

<p>Even if Palestine does go forward with a new declaration aimed at Israeli settlements, that is only the first step. There are many potential obstacles that may delay or derail any ICC investigation or prosecution into alleged crimes on the territory of Palestine. Anyone anticipating the General Assembly vote to trigger swift action, or a clear resolution to issues of Palestine and the ICC, is likely to be disappointed.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Brittany Giusini, <a href="https://law.widener.edu/">Widener University School of Law</a> Class of 2014, discusses the negative impacts of the recent Russian ban on US-based adoptions...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/dateline/brittany_giusini.jpg" width="120" height="200" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n January 14, 2013, Russia <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/russia-denies-petition-to-repeal-us-adoption-ban.php">denied</a> a petition, effectively preventing US citizens from adopting Russian children. Several commentators submit the ban is a response to US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/obama-signs-russia-trade-and-human-rights-bill.php">signing</a> the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.4405:">Magnitsky Act</a> into law in December 2012 &#8212; an act meant to punish Russians who were previously involved in human rights violations. One part of the Magnitsky Act prohibits Russians involved in human rights violations from traveling to the US and from owning assets and real property located on American soil. Irrespective of the reason underlying Russian's denial of the adoption ban, prohibiting US citizens from adopting Russian children will undeniably have widespread societal, economic and legal implications. Most importantly, such a ban will stall ongoing cooperative efforts between Russia and the US regarding important international law issues.</p>

<p><strong>I. Adoption Overview</strong> </p>

<p>The ability and manner in which to adopt children varies both within, and among countries, as there is no set international law regarding adoption procedures and rights. Even the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/">US Constitution</a>, according to <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10367190265801738113">federal case law</a>, does not guarantee the right to adopt a child. The adoption process is a creature of state law and parental rights involving adoption have historically been governed by legislative enactment. Therefore, even in the US, a country which places great importance on familial rights &#8212; such as the fundamental right to control and direct the upbringing of one's child &#8212; there remains a lack of formality regarding adoption procedures. These evident fragments are demonstrative of the difficulties faced by individuals seeking to adopt; fragments which are magnified when inter-country and international adoption is sought.<br />
 <br />
Notwithstanding this fragmented adoption process, <a href="http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=states.listing">international agreements</a> have played a role in making adoption procedures safer and easier. Both Russia and the US have been active in these efforts. Notably, the <a href="http://adoption.state.gov/hague_convention.php">Hague Adoption Convention</a>, closing in 1993, was an international effort to safeguard inter-country adoptions. The agreement put in place various structural changes to ensure the safety of adoption across country lines. These changes include adoption certificates, documentation of fees and evaluation of agencies. Though Russia is not a party to the Convention, it did sign it, symbolizing an effort to work with other nations on this issue. Further, signing the Convention signifies intent to become a party to the Convention. Though Russia appears to be willing to cooperate with other nations on adoption issues, its recent banning of US citizens from adopting Russian children represents a huge step back in the international efforts to harmonize adoption procedures.</p>

<p><strong>II. International Implications</strong></p>

<p>Passage of the ban exemplifies the turbulent relationship between the US and Russia in international affairs. Political gaming on Russia's part calls into question the strength of international conventions and the lack of enforcement that plagues them. What binds these countries when outside factors come into play, creating tension and a desire to act against the agreements once thought to be beneficial? International agreements, such as the Hague Convention, and the principles guiding them, seem to fall by the wayside in times of international tension. Unlike intra-national issues, where a nation depends on its own laws to rectify issues and prevent further harm, international disputes are more difficult to resolve because countries often ignore agreements during times of strife. I argue that lack of enforcement mechanisms often lead to an outright disregard for international agreements. For example, even prior to Russia's ban on the adoption of Russian children, the US refused to comply with the convention <a href="http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/2012/04/01/u-s-court-refuses-to-enforce-hague-convention/">on at least one occasion</a>.</p>

<p>Technically, since Russia did not ratify, and is therefore not bound to any specific provision in the Convention, the recent ban on the adoption of Russian children does not violate it. Even though the Convention does not explicitly deal with the right to adopt children from Russia nor prohibit a ban such as the one put in place, it signifies Russia's active efforts to safeguard adoption. Moreover, Russia's recent behavior exemplifies countries' constant disregard for progress made in the international realm. With no uniform international law system, countries can engage in this back-and- forth activity while trying to disadvantage another country. With some mechanism binding the cooperating nations, actions such as the Russian ban will be minimized. In the wake of weak enforcement mechanisms, countries have no incentive to prevent bans such as this. These countries have little incentive to refrain from passing a ban in retaliation of another country's past action. As a result, this puts a hold on the progression of international affairs and is even more damaging to the status of Russian orphans. </p>

<p><strong>III. Effect on Society and the Child</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/russia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo">Statistically</a>, the ban will have grave consequences for the Russian society as a whole:<blockquote>About 1,000 Russian children were adopted in 2011 by parents from the United States, which leads in adoptions from Russia, and more than 45,000 such children have been adopted by American parents since 1999.</blockquote>As <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/17/opinion/jean-russia-adoption/index.html">one commentator</a> has suggested, the ban eliminates the only chance for many children at having a family and a home. Most orphans with disabilities have no chance at finding a family other than through American <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/17/us-russia-usa-adoption-idUSBRE90G0YU20130117">adoption</a>. In fact, <a href="http://www.firstthings.com/onthesquare/2012/12/russiarsquos-cruel-adoption-ban">orphans with disabilities</a>, if left in Russia, will most likely not live past the age of 10. "More than 730,000 <a href="http://www.iorphan.org/russian_orphans/index.asp">children</a> in Russia either have no parents or have been abandoned by their parents" and most are living in conditions of "cruelty and neglect." Though the number of <a href="http://www.russianlife.com/blog/plight-orphans/">orphans</a> has been calculated to some degree, the number of children who remain homeless in Russia is unaccounted for. The ability of <a href="http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/120574/putin-is-wrong-about-my-kids">Americans</a> to adopt Russian children has spared the lives of many. This is mainly due to the fact that Russia <a href="http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?id=39533">does not have a strong adoption process</a> in place and many orphans stay in facilities until they reach adulthood. Russia, by implementing this ban, is not only hurting the well-being of children living within its borders but is making their social conditions worse off. This is because the Russian <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/russia/overview">economy</a> is experiencing low growth. </p>

<p>By disallowing US citizens from adopting Russian children, more orphans will be living in Russia, imposing a greater financial burden on a Russian government already witnessing lagging economic growth. Thus, there is no winner in light of this ban. Russia's economy losses, US citizens lose, international relations lose, and most importantly, the Russian children lose.</p>

		<title>Regulating Internet Speech in France: A Broken Policy of Enforced Silence</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.wethenet.eu/about/lauteur/">F&#233;lix Tr&#233;guer</a>, Policy and Legal Analyst at <a href="http://www.laquadrature.net/">La Quadrature du Net</a> says that waging a "judicial guerilla war" in France on "hateful" Internet content unduly stifles free speech...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/felix_treguer.jpg" width="120" height="180" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he ghost of <em>Yahoo v. LICRA</em> has come back to haunt us. In 2000, after a criminal lawsuit was filed by the <a href="http://www.fighthatred.com/fighting-hate/organizations/619-licra-international-league-against-racism-and-anti-semitism">International League Against Racism and Anti-Semitism</a> (LICRA), a French judge ruled that auctions of Nazi-related paraphernalia hosted by what was then the hippest online service &#8212; US-based Yahoo &#8212; were illegal in France. The judge consequently ordered Yahoo to "take all necessary measures to dissuade and make impossible" for France-based Internet users to access these auctions. </p>

<p>At the time, many people were dubious about the ability of French courts to enforce such a ruling on a US-based company. It took many years until the case was resolved in both France and the US but, by the time it finally was in 2006, it had become clear that French territorial law (and, consequently, other territorial law) did apply to online services (even if such services were based in the "free speech haven" that is the US). After deploying geo-identification technologies to locate French Internet users and block them from accessing the illegal web pages, Yahoo eventually decided to withdraw all Nazi paraphernalia from its auction site. The company declared that it would "no longer allow items that are associated with groups which promote or glorify hatred and violence ... to be listed on any of Yahoo's commerce properties."</p>

<p>Fast-forward to the fall of 2012. The famous micro-blogging platform Twitter has ended up in the eye of a legal storm. In the past months, odious jokes using anti-Semitic and other hateful hashtags (such as #AgoodJew, #AdeadJew and #Ifmysonisgay) have attracted widespread media attention, as several organizations (including LICRA) that fight against anti-Semitism, racism and homophobia brought charges against Twitter before a Parisian court. According to the plaintiff organizations, the tweets are illegal under the 1881 <a href="http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070722&dateTexte=vig">Law on the Freedom of the Press</a> ("Press law"), which provides that those posting content that incites hatred or discrimination &#8212; or those that utilize racist insults &#8212; can be punished by up to a year in prison. There is also plenty of political pressure for Twitter to do more to fight against hate speech. In December 2012, Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, the Minister of Women's Rights and spokesperson for the French government, went on to publish an <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2012/12/28/twitter-doit-respecter-les-valeurs-de-la-republique_1811161_3232.html">editorial</a> [in French] in France's most influential newspaper, <em>Le Monde</em>. In the piece, she made it clear that the kind of hate speech that has blossomed on the popular social network could no longer be tolerated: "This means that the company Twitter must find solutions so that the messages sent from our territory, in our language and intended for our fellow citizens, do not manifestly violate the principles we hold dear."</p>

<p>Just like Yahoo did a decade ago, Twitter tried to argue in court that it was a US-based service not bound by French law. After all, the company argued, Twitter has only a tiny office used for marketing purposes in France, hardly any staff in France and its servers &#151 as is the rest of its technical platform &#151 are located in the US. </p>

<p>On January 24, 2013, after the failure of a mediation process, a Parisian judge rejected these claims and <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/jurist-a-french-court-on.php">issued an injunction</a> requiring Twitter to provide the identifying data it stores on the authors responsible for anti-Semitic tweets so that the plaintiff organizations can prosecute them. Based on the company's "Twitter Rules," which <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/18311-the-twitter-rules">require</a> "international users to comply with local laws regarding online conduct and acceptable content," the ruling also orders Twitter to establish a reporting system allowing users to report anti-Semitic and racist tweets so that they can be taken down by Twitter's staff. </p>

<p>For the many citizens weary of increased governmental control over online communications, this injunction is bad news. It means that Twitter could be forced to develop a comprehensive <em>a posteriori</em> censorship process to delete allegedly racist tweets flagged by its users. In the process, the crucial principle that only a judge should decide the illegality of content would be further undermined.</p>

<p>Of course, such systems are already widespread. For the past several years, many online platforms like <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/abigailesman/2012/08/06/facebooks-censors-strike-again-is-america-to-blame/">Facebook</a> and YouTube have implemented similar extra-judicial, privatized censorship schemes based on their respective "terms of service" to take down allegedly copyright-infringing, obscene or otherwise offensive content. However, as various  <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2012/01/consent_of_the_networked_how_google_facebook_and_other_cyberspace_powerhouses_handle_digital_power_.html">uncovered cases of abuse</a> have made clear, "over-blocking" of perfectly legal content is commonplace, with no possibility of judicial redress. </p>

<p>Rather than encouraging these dangerous censorship systems, as occurred in the Twitter case, public authorities and judges in particular must seek to alleviate the abuse inherent to privatized law enforcement. They should do so by designing regulatory frameworks and developing judicial precedents that bring the most comprehensive protections to online speech, even within these "quasi-public spheres" that Internet platforms have come to represent. By failing to do so, democratic regimes risk further undermining their moral high ground in the international discussions on "Internet freedoms." </p>

<p>However, this case highlights a more fundamental issue regarding the doctrine of freedom of expression in Europe. Since the inception of the Internet, France and other EU democracies have acted as if the legal framework developed over the past century to regulate speech in a traditional media environment was perfectly transposable onto the online world, where the vast majority of citizens can express their views. At its core, the Internet is the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> to the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/">US Constitution</a> made flesh on a global scale. By trying to fight against this techno-political reality so as to assert territorial law, national legislations and courts are fostering the Balkanization of the Internet and are undermining its key architectural features, in particular its decentralized, end-to-end structure. Moreover, to the extent that such regulation of <a href="http://p2pfoundation.net/Mass_Self_Communication">"mass self-communication"</a> rests on extra-judicial and automatic enforcement, online speech restrictions are bound to disrespect the rule of law.</p>

<p>As a global community of Internet users, we are faced with the choice of either accepting that the Internet commons be progressively dismantled at the expense of the fundamental rights to freedom of expression or recognizing the need for reform. As US President Barack Obama <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1209/26/sn.01.html">said to the UN General Assembly</a> after the wave of violence that followed the publication of an anti-Islam film online, "at a time when anyone with a cell phone can spread offensive views around the world with the click of a button, the notion that we can control the flow of information is obsolete." Though this is something of an overstatement, we must at least recognize the great costs that exerting such control inherently carries and must ask ourselves whether the cost of enforcing the current hate speech criminal provisions and other speech-restricting laws is not vastly disproportional with regards to its actual effect.</p>

<p>As both a French and global citizen, I wish racism and other forms of intolerance could vanish from public discourse. With that being said, I strongly doubt that the "judicial guerilla war" currently waged by anti-discrimination organizations against online hate speech will be effective in curtailing actual discrimination in our pluralistic societies. I would rather see these organizations focus more on the education of French citizens regarding inter-cultural understanding, on being more vocal in criticizing rampant Islamophobia and hostility in political discourse and on innovative ways in which online hate speech can be countered. In that regard, they should reflect on the point made by US Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis in the 1927 case <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=whitney+v+califonria&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=9558803063364299687&scilh=0">Whitney v. California</a>: "If there be time to expose through discussion the falsehood and fallacies, to avert the evil by the processes of education, the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence." </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the government does not seem ready to reform its broken policies to promote greater freedom of speech. Just a few days after the ruling against Twitter, French Interior Minister Manuel Valls announced during a conference on cybercrime that, "taking into account the Internet's firepower," the government would soon propose that crimes pertaining to hateful speech be taken out of the Press law &#8212; where they enjoy special procedural safeguards &#8212; and instead be included in the French Penal Code in order to bolster the repression of such speech.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/main.asp?PID=34">Jordan Paust</a> of the University of Houston Law Center says that arguments put forward in the case of <em>Bond v. United States</em>, claiming that the federal law implementing the Chemical Weapons Convention is unconstitutional, are based on a fundamentally flawed understanding of the US Constitution...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/jordanpaust.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he US Supreme Court has accepted the case of <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/supreme-court-grants-likely-final-cases-for-the-term.php">Bond v. United States</a>, a case involving a criminal conviction under a federal statute that implemented a multilateral treaty known as the <a href="http://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention/about-the-convention/">Chemical Weapons Convention</a>. The convention implicates serious national security interests with respect to international criminal law and possible terroristic use of certain weapons here and abroad, and the legislation is clearly rationally related to national security and, like any multilateral treaty, foreign affairs. Relying primarily on <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8930976133950292975">Missouri v. Holland</a>, the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=967890202113571023">affirmed</a> the conviction despite defense claims that the crime was localized, was otherwise normally prosecutable by a state, and conviction under the statute was somehow inconsistent with the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/tenth_amendment">Tenth Amendment</a>, a vague implied "federalism" and an allegedly implied "subject matter" limitation that appear nowhere in the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/">US Constitution</a>. </p>

<p>In sharp contrast to defendant's claims, a <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1484842">prior study</a> of the treaty power <em>vis a vis</em> the power or sovereignty of the states that addressed more than ninety cases (thirty-two of which are US Supreme Court cases) reveals that there is a lack of any inhibiting state authority. The thorough study of cases also reveals that there is no imaginary "subject matter" limitation and identifies eighteen general categories or subject areas where the treaty power prevailed over matters that had otherwise been the prerogative of the states, including state criminal law and state criminal procedures. What follows is a slightly revised text from that study.</p>

<p>Under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution, any remaining state powers or aspects of state sovereignty are expressly limited to: (1) those "powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution," and (2) those powers that are not "prohibited by it to the States." The treaty power was expressly delegated under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii">Article II</a>, Section 2 (<em>i.e.</em>, the president "shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate to make Treaties") and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii">Article III</a>, Section 2 (<em>i.e.</em>, "[t]he judicial Power shall extend to all Cases ... arising under Treaties") of the Constitution. The treaty power was also expressly prohibited to the states in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei">Article I</a>, Section 10 (<em>i.e.</em>, "[n]o State shall enter into any Treaty"). For two trenchant reasons, therefore, the text of the Tenth Amendment precludes the possibility that an exercise of the treaty power could be inconsistent with the Tenth Amendment or could be limited by or impermissibly encroach upon any allegedly remaining state sovereignty. Clearly, the text of the Tenth Amendment places express and structural limits on state authority and precludes any inconsistent implied "federalism" limits of federal authority.</p>

<p>Additionally, the text of the Constitution clearly and unavoidably mandates that "all" treaties are <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">supreme law</a> of the land &#8212; binding the states and the state judiciary. Expressly, therefore, there are no limitations of any kind regarding the nature, scope or subject matter of treaties that are supreme law <em>vis a vis</em> state power or sovereignty. The text of the Constitution expressly requires that "all" treaties have that reach. As Alexander Hamilton famously wrote in <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/home/histdox/fed_23.html">Federalist No. 23</a>, the treaty power "ought to exist without limitation ... [with] no constitutional shackles." And as Representative William Vans Murray <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ccfZAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA435#v=onepage&q&f=false">remarked</a> in 1796, because of the "explicitness of the instrument itself" with respect to the supremacy of treaties, "nothing ... is left for ... sophistry."</p>

<p>As Supreme Court cases have long recognized, there is no competing or inhibiting power or sovereignty of the states. Indeed, with respect to treaty law, the Supreme Court and other federal courts have <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2412865658294709561">stated</a> that "the Tenth Amendment is no barrier" <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15467298964043586801">and</a> "whatever is within ... [the] scope [of the treaty power] is not reserved to the states [and] the Tenth Amendment is not material." As one federal court <a href="https://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F1/0001/0001.f.0481.html">recognized</a> in 1880:<blockquote>There can be no mistaking the significance or effect of these plain, concise, emphatic provisions. The states have surrendered the treaty-making power to the general government, and vested it in the president and senate; and, when duly exercised ... the treaty resulting is the supreme law of the land, to which not only state laws but state constitutions are in express terms subordinated.</blockquote>No nonconforming, theoretic construct or revisionist, professorial preference can rightly avoid the textual strictures and structure of the Constitution in this regard. The express textual strictures of the Tenth Amendment and the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/supremacy_clause">Supremacy Clause</a> and related structural bonds with Articles I, II and III are reason enough to preempt invitations to engage in judicial reconstruction of the Constitution in the name of an allegedly implied federalism or an imaginary subject matter limitation that was not chosen.</p>

<p>As the Supreme Court has rightly <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8930976133950292975">affirmed</a>, "treaties of course 'are as binding within the territorial limits of the States as they are elsewhere throughout the dominion of the United States'" and treaties can reach "matters which in ... [their] silence ... the State may regulate." With respect to matters that "usually fall within the control of the State," "a treaty may override its power." Indeed, a <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=17219030762688622185">treaty is</a> "obligatory" domestically and "must necessarily control all acts issuing from the inferior authority which might contravene it" (i.e., the state, including unavoidably the state judiciary). As one federal court <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=11844098316132133181">recognized</a>:<blockquote>[T]he treaty furnishes the law, and with that treaty no state or municipal corporation thereof can interfere. Admit the wedge of state interference ever so little, and there is nothing to prevent its being driven home and destroying the treaty-making power altogether.</blockquote>As noted in the study, generations of federal and state judges have consistently recognized the overriding domestic reach of treaty-based law and law radiating from other international agreements to matters that otherwise might have been the prerogative of the state, such as: state court criminal jurisdiction and criminal law, state court criminal proceedings, state statutes of limitation, state rules of evidence, other state procedural laws regarding access to courts and remedies, state personal injury laws and workmen's compensation, state family law, title to and use of land and leases, control of water, title to personalty located in the state, control of debts, police power control of local businesses and employment, state power of exclusion and detention of persons and the alleged necessity to seize persons in order to protect state security, contract bidding, state registration of persons for employment and vehicle registration and driver's licenses, state taxes and inheritance. Additionally, treaties can enhance the power of Congress under Article I, Section 8, clauses 3, 10, and 18 of the Constitution to reach matters that states might otherwise regulate. With respect to related congressional powers, the study cited <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=694937900291385380">US v. Lara</a>, <em>Missouri v. Holland</em>, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=4438516634803756378">US v. Haun</a> and, with respect to a similar congressional power to implement customary international law, cited <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5449810766498372449">US v. Arjona</a>.</p>

<p>To summarize, Supreme Court opinions have long recognized that there are no competing or inhibiting sovereign powers of the states with respect to the reach of treaty law and whatever had previously been a matter of state concern or within its sphere can be overridden by the reach of treaties. Treaties can necessarily "intrude" on traditional areas of state concern and can do so with even more authority when coupled with rationally related legislation. The text and structure of the Constitution require this result. </p>

		<title>Assault Weapons Ban: Constitutional Parameters of Gun Control</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.fordham.edu/faculty/nicholasjohnson.htm">Nicholas Johnson</a> of the Fordham University School of Law says that the US Supreme Courts' potential handling of proposed assault weapons ban legislation is uncertain because of an increasingly popular two-step analysis that is more suited to legislation placing a burden upon gun ownership rather than legislation banning certain guns...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/nicholasjohnson.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he coming debate over <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/nra-ceo-dismisses-renewal-of-ban-on-assault-weapons.php">the proposal for a new assault weapons ban</a> (AWB) will have a variety of strands. The political ones are difficult to constrain, and in that arena, predictions of outcomes are the purest speculation. The parameters of the constitutional debate are slightly more predictable. I will attempt to elaborate a few of them below. </p>

<p>When the US Supreme Court affirmed the individual right to arms in <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-dc-gun-ban.php">District of Columbia v. Heller</a>, it suggested, among other things, that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment">Second Amendment</a> to the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/">US Constitution</a> protects firearms in "<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-290.ZS.html">common use</a>." This invoked the longstanding view that "militia," as referenced in the prefatory clause, equals the body of the people bearing their own private arms in common use at the time.</p>

<p>I have shown in my previous scholarship (specifically in the <a href="http://hlpronline.com/2010/04/johnson_commonuse/">Harvard Law and Policy Review</a> and <a href="http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/lawreview/vol50/iss4/6/">Santa Clara Law Review</a> [PDF]) how "common use" yields objective assessment of whether a gun is functionally, ballistically or numerically common. This assessment would protect firearms in the families of handguns, shotguns and rifles in the civilian inventory. It would exclude "dangerous and unusual" weapons, like fully automatic machine guns that are numerically uncommon, functionally distinct and have been specially regulated since the 1930s. It also would answer "no" to snarky questions, such as: "do US citizens have a right to bazookas, stinger missiles, tanks, etc.?"</p>

<p>The common use standard offers a relatively straightforward basis for evaluating the constitutionality of the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/s150/text">proposed AWB</a>. One of the rifles on the ban list is the AR-15. Functionally, this rifle is the same as countless repeating rifles that have not raised the ire of legislatures. But, based on its styling (it looks like the military M-16), it is perennially on the wish list of guns that should be banned. After the horror in Newtown, Connecticut, it is for many, the exemplar of the class of "bad guns" that should be <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/new-york-governow-signs-gun-control-measures-into-law.php">banned</a>. </p>

<p>The thing is though, there are millions of AR-15s in the civilian inventory, so they are undeniably common. This is one of the unintended consequences of the now-expired <a href="http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.uscongress/legislation.103hr3355">Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994</a>, which in the same breath banned the AR-15 (and a variety of other guns) and blessed functionally identical guns like the Ruger Mini 14 and cosmetically modified AR-15s (i.e., the same guns minus the superfluous flash suppressors, adjustable stocks and bayonet lugs). The central enduring legacy of the 1994 law was to juice demand for this style of gun, ironically pushing the number in the civilian inventory from a few hundred thousand to a number now approaching ten million. </p>

<p>Predictably, whether the AR-15 is constitutionally protected is a more complicated question than this counting would suggest. Because, although the Supreme Court has plainly said that guns in common use are protected, lower courts <a href="/sidebar/2013/01/dan-peterson-gun-control-overview.php">interpreting</a> <em>Heller</em> are in the midst of developing less-robust standards of review that make the constitutionality of assault weapons bans an open question. The lower court efforts are not simple usurpations. They stem from the fact that the common use standard offered in <em>Heller</em> has a limited scope. It works well for assessing the legitimacy of flat technology bans &#8212; the precise type of question raised in <em>Heller</em>. But most gun laws are not gun bans. Many gun regulations &#8212; e.g., time, place and manner regulations &#8212; just impose friction on the right to arms. Many post-<em>Heller</em> challenges focused on those sorts of laws. </p>

<p>To solve these allowable friction questions, lower courts need something that the Supreme  Court did not provide. The emerging dominant standard draws from the familiar rhetoric of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/intermediate_scrutiny">intermediate</a>, heightened and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/strict_scrutiny">strict scrutiny</a>. Different courts have done subtly different things, but basically they have assessed Second Amendment questions through a two-part filter: asking, first, whether the law impinges on a core Second Amendment right; and second, whether it survives under the appropriate level of scrutiny. Different courts have applied different levels of scrutiny, and it is hard to discern what guides those choices. </p>

<p>The thing that makes the AWB question uncertain is the real possibility that courts will apply this two-step standard of scrutiny analysis (which is suited to friction cases) to a plain gun question (where the common use standard would be truer to <em>Heller</em>). In fact, this already has happened in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit's 2011 decision in <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-appeals-court-upholds-dc-gun-laws.php">Heller v. District of Columbia</a> (<em>Heller II</em>). The decision addressed a challenge to the gun law devised by the district in response to the Supreme Court's 2008 <em>Heller</em> decision. Addressing a variety of challenges to the new law, the DC Circuit applied its version of the emerging dominant standard, asking: (1) whether a restriction impinges upon a core right protected by the Second Amendment (with "longstanding" regulations presumptively lawful), and if it does, then (2) whether the restriction passes muster under the level of constitutional scrutiny the court deems appropriate. </p>

<p>Both the majority and the dissent acknowledge that the AR-15 is a gun in common use (before the trial court, the evidence showed Americans owned close to 4 million AR-15s; the number has climbed rapidly since then). How the Court proceeds from there is illuminating. The dissent treats common use as a solid, liberty-protecting standard. Guns in common use cannot be banned. For the majority, acknowledging the AR-15 as a gun in common use is just a rhetorical lead-in to the two-stage standard of review. The court found that the DC law did, in fact, burden a core Second Amendment concern. But, during the second stage of analysis, the majority determined that the ban does not "substantially burden" the right to self-defense (people could still have handguns and many other types of long guns).</p>

<p>The majority's reasoning is not derived from <em>Heller</em> and it is interesting to speculate what else would pass muster under this approach. Pushed hard, it would seem to allow very broad gun bans, as long as some core self-defense guns remained legal. That result would approximate the District of Columbia's backup argument in <em>Heller</em> (rejected by the majority of the Supreme Court) that there was an implicit self-defense exception to the original DC law, which required long guns to be kept disassembled and unloaded. It also hews closer to the balancing approach offered by Justice Stephen Breyer's dissent than to the decision of the <em>Heller</em> majority.</p>

<p>The level of discretion appropriated by judges under the second stage of the burgeoning standard is remarkable. The level of scrutiny courts choose to apply is largely outcome determinative and there are no evident restrictions on what level of scrutiny courts can select (except for the consensus that the open pipe of "rational basis" would be insufficient). In fact, the standard seems to allow courts to create from whole cloth previously unexpressed levels of scrutiny. For example, the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17044109654189761463">applied</a> "not quite strict scrutiny" to a Second Amendment case. Evidently, this is something more demanding than intermediate scrutiny. Why this level and not something else? Who knows? And from judge to judge &#8212; case to case &#8212; what do these filters demand? Who is to say?</p>

<p>To complicate things further, the two-step, scrutiny analysis is not the only possibility for evaluating the proposed AWB. Another potential standard is rooted in abortion jurisprudence. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16860306062835348173">Nordyke v. King</a>, and <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1265118">Judge J. Harvie Wilkinsen</a> have both invoked an abortion rights analogy in post-<em>Heller</em> treatments of the Second Amendment. I will delve into this analogy in a forthcoming JURIST article.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.syr.edu/deans-faculty-staff/profile.aspx?fac=152">David Crane</a> of Syracuse University College of Law says that the upcoming prosecution of Sergei Magnitsky by the Russian government is an unprecedented violation of rule of law principles...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/DCrane.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>ver the past year I have been <a href="/forum/2012/07/david-crane-magnitsky-iii.php">writing</a> about the first prosecution of a dead man during the modern era. Recall in past <a href="/forum/2012/02/david-crane-posthumous-prosecution.php">editorials</a> for JURIST, I pointed out that prosecuting the dead is rare in history. On February 18 we will see the opening of a spectacle beyond understanding and logic, the <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/moscow-court-postpones-posthumous-hearing-for-russia-whistleblower.php">prosecution</a> of Sergei Magnitsky by Russia for alleged crimes. Magnitsky was tortured to death by that same Russian government in 2009. The Russians are prosecuting a dead man.</p>

<p>By way of background, Magnitsky, while a lawyer working for Hermitage Capital Management, exposed a massive tax fraud scheme centered around the Putin government amounting to over two hundred and thirty million dollars. For this he was detained and <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/report-alleges-corruption, torture-in-russia-lawyer-prison-death.php">died in prison</a> at the hands of his jailors before any real judicial proceedings could begin.</p>

<p>Since that time the Russian government has sought to sweep under the rug this sordid incident. Despite their attempts and through the efforts of Magnitsky's former employer, William Browder among others, international pressure has exposed not only what happened to this young lawyer, but also a cynical Russian regime's true attitude toward the rule of law and for basic human rights. </p>

<p>Russia is governed by the mob. Russian President <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Putin">Vladimir Putin</a> and former President <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=medvedev">Dmitry Medvedev</a>, now prime minister (the two switch jobs to stay in power) are complicit in massive corruption. The rule of the gun governs Russia, not the rule of the law. This augers poorly for the future of a democratic Russia, as the country is slowly slip-sliding away into potential anarchy.</p>

<p>Though initially slow in organizing its opposition, the international community has taken a stand and acted. Laws have been passed that ban travel for perpetrators of this torture and cover-up, as well as funds seized as part of the tax fraud monies deposited in foreign banks. The world has pointed a finger at Russia and has shouted "shame!" The US has not been shy in pushing Russia in a direction of an open and fair accounting of the death of Magnitsky. US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/obama-signs-russia-trade-and-human-rights-bill.php">signed into law</a> on December 14, 2012 the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.6156:">Russia and Moldova Jackson-Vanik Repeal and Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act</a> which provides travel bans to the US for, and allows the seizure of assets belonging to, those alleged to have tortured and killed Magnitsky. The law is a clear statement of policy and a signal to Russia that it is moving in the wrong direction related to human rights and the rule of law. </p>

<p>Russia will not back down and admit wrong doing in the Magnitsky matter. It apparently will prosecute this dead man despite the fact that it makes no sense and is unprecedented. As his former employer recently stated, "this is the most cynical legal procedure in a thousand years". The trial appears to be finally set and the world will watch in amazement and horror. I wonder what Magnitsky's sentence will be...</p>

		<title>Truly Comprehensive Immigration Reform Must Address LGBT Issues</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Victoria Neilson of <a href="http://immigrationequality.org/">Immigration Equality</a> argues that although important steps have been taken in support of the LGBT immigrants, there are still many questions unanswered and issues unsettled that demand a continued battle on behalf of this population...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/victorianeilson.jpg" width="120" height="200" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he last immigration overhaul took place in 1996, and the last full legalization program was enacted by US President Ronald Reagan in 1986. To put it mildly, the <a href="/feature/2012/04/immigration.php">comprehensive immigration reform</a> (CIR) <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/us-senators-unveil-immigration-reform-plan.php">discussions</a> which have at last begun in earnest are long overdue.<br />
                <br />
                One of the primary issues in the CIR debate is whether the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants should have a pathway to citizenship, and if so, what it means for them to go to the end of the "waiting line" for citizenship. The notion of an orderly line is deeply problematic, in that it implies that some aspiring Americans could have had a place in this "line" but chose not to. The reality is that most of the undocumented people in the US have no line to get into, or have been so prejudiced by harsh enforcement rules implemented under the 1996 overhaul that they cannot leave the country to process their papers for fear of not being allowed to return. <br />
                <br />
                Among those for whom there has never been a "line" are lesbian and gay immigrant families. Under current US immigration law, it doesn't matter how long a lesbian or gay couple has been together, whether they are raising children together or even whether they are legally married &#8212; there is currently no way for a foreign national to legalize immigration status based on a primary, same-sex relationship. </p>

                <p>Thus, for a couple like Edwin Blesch and Tim Smulian &#8212; despite turning their lives upside down to maintain their relationship and marrying in Smulian's home country of South Africa &#8212; Smulian has been <a href="http://immigrationequality.org/clippings/binational-couples-file-doma-suit/">unable to obtain permanent lawful status</a> in the US. When he ran out of options to maintain lawful status here, his husband sponsored him for lawful permanent residence, knowing that the application would likely be denied solely because of his sexual orientation. Although he was given a short reprieve in the form of deferred action, he fears every day that he could be torn away from the side of his husband, a US citizen who is diagnosed with AIDS.<br />
                    <br />
                    Some may argue that there is simply no need to include lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) families in CIR because if the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/html/PLAW-104publ199.htm">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) is struck down in the summer, the immigration problems of LGBT families will be solved. However, immigration reform comes about every twenty years or more. If we sit on our hands, betting that the US Supreme Court will do the right thing and we're wrong, then families who are suffering today will have to wait another generation for Congress to take up immigration reform, or for the Supreme Court to revisit marriage equality.</p>

                <p>That is why it was so important that President Obama <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/01/29/fact-sheet-fixing-our-broken-immigration-system-so-everyone-plays-rules">included LGBT families</a> in his principles of immigration reform and that before him, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus <a href="http://gutierrez.house.gov/sites/gutierrez.house.gov/files/One%20Nation_Principles%20on%20Immigration%20Reform.pdf">included LGBT families</a> [PDF] in its principles. </p>

                <p>Relationship recognition is not the only issue in CIR that matters to the LGBT community. LGBT individuals comprise a sizable percentage of the 11 million undocumented immigrants, and those who are not in a relationship with an American citizen have their hopes pegged to a broad legalization program &#8212; just like heterosexual undocumented people. Young LGBT individuals have been a critical voice within the movement to pass the <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/senators-introduce-immigration-reform-bill.php">DREAM Act</a>, and it is crucial that individuals who were brought to the US as children and have since attended school or joined the US military, have an expeditious means to legalize their status and obtain full legal status in the country they already view as their home. The activism and courage of "coming out" in this movement &#8212; both as LGBT and as an undocumented immigrant &#8212; is a model for all of us. It is heartening to see the DREAM Act provisions included in both the president's and the senators' principles for CIR. </p>

                <p>One of the harshest immigration provisions enacted in 1996, was the addition of a one year filing deadline for asylum cases. At Immigration Equality, we have seen the disproportionate impact this deadline has on LGBT applicants who have no reason to know that asylum could be available to them based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.  The proposal laid out by the President calls for "eliminating the existing limitations that prevent qualified individuals from applying for asylum."  We are hopeful that as CIR moves forward, it eases the path for the most vulnerable aspiring citizens to obtain safe haven in the US. Likewise, we hope that once CIR provides a pathway to citizenship for many of the undocumented, that the emphasis on immigration detention will diminish, and the inhumane conditions that LGBT detainees have faced will become a thing of the past.  </p>

                <p>The LGBT immigrant community is multi-faceted and different sectors will benefit from different components of immigration reform. But, of course, the central issue affecting LGBT immigrant families is recognition of our core family relationships. Every day my organization hears from couples who are desperate to live together in the US and to start a life together out of the shadows. Too often, couples are forced to leave the US, to have long-distance relationships, to juggle visas to maintain status, or to simply fall out of status to remain together. </p>

                <p>Even if the Supreme Court strikes down DOMA in <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-to-review-constitutionality-of-same-sex-marriage.php">Windsor v. United States</a>, it is not certain that LGBT families will immediately benefit in all areas because <em>Windsor</em> is an as-applied challenge, which deals specifically with estate taxes. Since DOMA is a definitional statute it is hard to imagine how it could be struck down as-applied to one benefit but not another. However, we will not know until we read the final decision. Further, the Supreme Court appointed Harvard Law Professor Vicki Jackson to argue that there was no standing to appeal. If the Supreme Court finds that there was no standing, it is unclear how wide-reaching the lower court decision in <em>Windsor</em> would be.</p>

                <p>Even in the best-case scenario, there are some couples who could be left behind. Because couples cannot currently marry in all states or in all countries, there may be couples who are excluded by a system that requires marriage. For example, if a gay binational Florida couple has never married, and the foreign partner was placed into immigration detention for driving without a license, he could be unable to apply for lawful permanent residence to defend against his deportation because his detention would prevent him from traveling to a marriage equality state to marry. There are myriad reasons that individuals might not be able to travel to marry &#8212; including health, work, criminal justice, child care and child custody issues.</p>

                <p>The inability to marry abroad is also a concern. For example, if a Ugandan lesbian flees the country for her life, leaving her partner behind, she cannot file an application for her partner to join her in the US until she becomes a US citizen. This extended period would be five years after winning asylum, at the earliest. If she had been able to marry her partner (almost by definition, LGBT people from asylum-producing countries will not be able to marry), she could immediately file a petition to bring her partner to the US after winning asylum herself.</p>

                <p>This is an exciting time. It feels as though we are on the threshold of lasting change and lasting equality. But until LGBT families are able to clearly cross over the threshold and know that their relationships will be honored by the immigration service, we must continue to fight on every front for full immigration equality.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Ilan Wurman, <a href="http://www.law.stanford.edu">Stanford Law School</a> Class of 2013, argues that the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit's decision holding that US President Barack Obama's National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) appointments were unconstitutional reveals methodological problems with the use of history to answer questions of legal construction...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/dateline/Ilan_wurman.jpg" width="120" height="200" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>nteresting theoretical and methodological issues emerge from the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit's <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2423466848603742363">Noel Canning v. National Labor Relations Board</a> decision, which <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-appeals-court-finds-obama-recess-appointments-unconstitutional.php">held</a> that US President Barack Obama's intrasession "recess" appointments to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) were unconstitutional. One issue is the use of history and longstanding practice, or the absence thereof, to determine originalist questions. The panel employed the method of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10894716839911389166">Printz v. United States</a> &#8212; in which the US Supreme Court held federal commandeering of state executive officers to be unconstitutional &#8212; whereby a longstanding absence of a particular exercise of power in the early Republic implied to the majority on the Court that the power never existed. Yet recent scholarship has shown that the majority's interpretation of the historical absence of the congressional practice of commandeering in <em>Printz</em> had very plausible, non-constitutional reasons. While this scholarship may not be as relevant to the absence of intrasession appointments, it does suggest that courts ought to consider more carefully their use of what one might call an absence of history to determine answers to originalist questions. </p>

<p>In <em>Printz</em>, the Supreme Court gave significant weight to the absence of any federal commandeering of state executive officials in the early Republic. To be sure, in <em>Printz</em> "there [was] no constitutional text speaking to [the] precise question." So the answer to whether the power of commandeering existed had to "be sought in historical understanding and practice" and "in the structure of the Constitution." (Conversely, in Canning there were textual provisions to analyze; I am questioning only the use of history as a supplement to the textual analysis.) The court acknowledged, quoting an earlier <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1455380748525546418">decision</a> by Chief Justice William Howard Taft, that "contemporaneous legislative exposition of the Constitution..., acquiesced in for a long term of years, fixes the construction to be given its provisions." While it did not give the absence of a particular exercise of power "conclusive" weight, the Court declared that such an absence would give it "reason to believe that the power was thought not to exist." The Court concluded that because there was no exercise of federal commandeering power in early congressional practice, that power, which would have greatly aggrandized the federal government, likely did not exist. </p>

<p>Wesley Campbell has shown, however, in an <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2012744">article forthcoming</a> in the Yale Law Journal, that it was the Anti-Federalists who desired commandeering of state officials, believing that state officers would act as checks on the federal government. A key reason that the Congress, under the Articles of Confederation, failed to raise revenue from the states &#8212; a flaw fatal to that charter and which ultimately led to the Constitutional Convention &#8212; was because some states would not give the federal government the power to appoint or remove the officials who would collect the imposts. To satisfy the Anti-Federalists, who still desired state collection of federal taxes, the Federalists had to compromise on this issue. Even Alexander Hamilton, who preferred a sprawling national bureaucracy, focused during the ratification debates on the role states and their officers would play in executing federal law. Campbell argues quite convincingly that the absence of early congressional commandeering resulted simply from a bait-and-switch. Now that the Federalists were in control of the government under the ratified Constitution, there was no need to use state officers to execute federal laws. In other words, while the Supreme Court in <em>Printz</em> gave significant weight to this absence of exercising the power of commandeering, there are quite possibly more plausible, non-constitutional reasons why the power was never exercised, even though both Anti-Federalists and Federalists seemed to agree that such a power would in fact exist. </p>

<p>This analysis points to the challenges inherent in relying on the absence of historical practice; and yet the DC Circuit in <em>Noel Canning</em> relied on just such an absence of historical practice in deciding whether the President could fill a vacancy during an intrasession recess rather than "the Recess" in between official sessions of the Senate. It is important to repeat that the holding can still be supported textually. It is worth challenging the use of history in this fashion, however, lest it become too commonplace in court decisions; the DC Circuit panel, after all, wrote that "[t]he interpretation of the [<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii">Recess Appointments Clause</a>] in the years immediately following the Constitution's ratification is the most instructive historical analysis in discerning original meaning." How we interpret early congressional practice is, in other words, very important. </p>

<p>The panel seemed to recognize that there was a logical flaw in its reliance on the absence of intrasession appointments: "[I]t is true that intrasession recesses of significant length may have been far less common in those early days than today[.]" Nonetheless, the court immediately proceeded to declare, it is "the case that the appointment practices of Presidents more nearly contemporaneous with the adoption of the Constitution do not support the propriety of intrasession recess appointments." This conclusion does not seem correct. The historical evidence may tell us nothing at all one way or the other; but it surely does not tell us that an act undertaken in a given condition is unconstitutional when that condition simply did not exist in the early American republic.</p>

<p>The panel then proceeded to decide the question of whether the vacancy itself had to occur or "happen" during "the Recess." As the panel admitted, the issue was unnecessary to resolve which raises a separate question of methodological propriety. But, putting that aside, the panel again relied on historical practice. Here its evidence was better as it did not rely on the absence of practice but rather on affirmative practice. The court astutely noted that President George Washington seemed to understand the clause to require that the vacancy itself arise during a recess: If not enough time remained in the session to ask a person to serve in an office, President Washington would nominate a person without the nominee's consent, and the Senate would confirm the individual before recessing ... Then, if the person declined to serve during the recess, thereby creating a new vacancy during the recess, President Washington would fill the position using his recess appointment power. The court provided additional historical evidence from the writings of Edmund Randolph and Alexander Hamilton.</p>

<p>In short, this kind of historical evidence of affirmative actions is much superior to relying on the absence of the exercise of a particular power, which may result from many non-constitutional reasons political conditions that demand a refusal to exercise the power (as in commandeering), or the absence of a condition necessary for the exercise of such power (arguably the case with intrasession recess appointments). It is interesting to note in conclusion, however, that even these affirmative pieces of historical evidence were somewhat controversial in the <em>Noel Canning</em> decision. It was precisely on this point that Circuit Judge Thomas Griffith dissented in his concurring opinion. He first noted that the question of whether a vacancy must "happen" during a recess was unnecessary to resolve the case; he then added that the view that a vacancy need only "happen to exist" during a recess is a "position [that] dates back to at least the 1820s..., making it more venerable than the much more recent practice of intrasession recess appointments." </p>

<p>To conclude, whether correctly decided or not, <em>Noel Canning</em> reveals persistent problems with the use of history to answer originalist questions. While history is undeniably a valuable tool in discerning original meaning, some methodological fine-tuning appears necessary to strengthen it.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.avemarialaw.edu/faculty/profile/Kevin.Govern">Kevin Govern</a> of the Ave Maria School of Law says says the US must pursue a full spectrum of "smart power" capabilities in Africa, to include but not be limited to the use of drones for surveillance or targeted killing strikes...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/kgovern2.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he ongoing crises in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=algeria">Algeria</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mali">Mali</a> have been commented about in recent Senate confirmation hearings for Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director nominee John Brennan and Department of Defense (DOD) Secretary nominee Chuck Hagel, as well as former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2013/01/203158.htm">congressional testimony</a>. Both crises have involved unmanned drones in the war against terror. Also known as "unmanned aerial vehicles" or "unmanned combat air vehicles," drones are but one weapon of choice where host-nation, regional or UN authority exists to employ use of force by ground, sea or air to counter terrorist threats. The US <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iTQn7pNHDSzjYNxKj5WNDFYOrhbA?docId=a3998b2e5b294740b9ed623c49869b49">conducted</a> unarmed drone surveillance of the Algerian In Amenas gas plant where Algerian forces led an operation to free European and American hostages, and to <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/algeria/9813651/Algeria-hostage-crisis-drones-and-special-forces-to-hunt-for-Mokhtar-Belmokhtar-one-eyed-mastermind.html">hunt</a> for Mokhtar Belmokhtar, Algeria's link to al Qaeda, who has <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21137114">claimed</a> responsibility for the crisis. Both the US and France used drone surveillance for airstrikes in Mali &#8212; and possibly <a href="http://www.magharebia.com/cocoon/awi/xhtml1/en_GB/features/awi/features/2012/06/22/feature-01">launched</a> drone strikes against al Qaeda-backed insurgents. Neither the administrations of US Presidents George Bush or Barack Obama received blanket permission to transit Algerian airspace &#8212; owing to strained relations over counterterrorism &#8212; but may, at best, have received <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/algerian-reticence-spoils-us-strategy-for-region/2013/01/18/7af23fbe-617c-11e2-89a2-2eabfad24542_story.html">case-by-case</a> authorization with advance notice to the Algerian government for surveillance of potential terrorist targets. The Mali operation, at the request of the host-nation government, <a href="http://www.rttnews.com/2040784/french-malian-forces-recapture-two-towns-from-islamist-militants.aspx">aimed ostensibly</a> at restoring "the sovereignty of Mali on its territory" and prevent northern Mali from becoming a "terrorist sanctuary in the heart of Africa." </p>

<p>Both Algeria and Mali are beset by al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) terrorist threats. Algeria is the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/04/AR2006100402006.html">birthplace</a> of AQIM, which is al-Qaeda's affiliate in North Africa. It has produced most of AQIM's leadership and allies and is the nucleus from which terrorism has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/algerian-reticence-spoils-us-strategy-for-region/2013/01/18/7af23fbe-617c-11e2-89a2-2eabfad24542_story.html">orbited beyond Algeria</a> to Mali, Mauritania and Niger. African officials estimate AQIM <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/29/us-mali-crisis-un-idUSBRE8AS02U20121129">consists</a> of 2,500 - 3,000 Islamist fighters coming from Africa, Europe and Asia, while US officials estimate there are between 800 - 1,200 Islamist fighters. Regardless of their composition and strength, the conflict has forced 400,000 Malians to flee their homes, and <a href="http://www.cfr.org/north-africa/al-qaeda-islamic-maghreb-aqim/p12717#p5">wrought terror</a> in North Africa's Sahara and Sahel, with the potential to expand well beyond those regions as a global threat. </p>

<p>Currently, the US has about <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/u/unmanned_aerial_vehicles/index.html">7,000</a> aerial drones of various nomenclature and capability compared with fewer than 50 a decade ago. That number is set to expand further under the administration's 2012 <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/R41861.pdf">budget request</a> [PDF] of $4.8 billion for drones. Drone strikes <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/l/releases/remarks/139119.htm">are legal</a> according to Obama administration lawyers under the 2001 <a href="http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.uscongress/legislation.107sjres23">Authorization for the Use of Military Force</a>, which gives the president authority to capture or kill anyone suspected of having planned, executed or assisted in the attacks of <a href="/feature/featured/911/">September 11, 2001</a>. Since 2008 alone, <a href="http://www.longwarjournal.org/pakistan-strikes.php">more than 300</a> drone strikes deliberately killed 2,500 or more people in Yemen, Pakistan, Somalia and elsewhere around the globe as part of CIA and military <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=targeted+killings">targeted killing</a> operations. The Obama administration accelerated work in the weeks before the 2012 election on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/world/white-house-presses-for-drone-rule-book.html?hp&_r=1&">explicit rules</a> for the targeted killing of terrorists by unmanned drones. This policy-making process comes in the wake of an <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-expert-announces-investigation-into-use-of-drone-strikes-by-us-and-other-nations.php">international investigation</a>, reportage on a <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/doj-drone-strike-memo-publicly-released-in-nbc-exclusive.php">leaked</a> 2010 Department of Justice targeted killing legal opinion "white paper," and continued <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/doj-drone-strike-memo-publicly-released-in-nbc-exclusive.php">domestic criticism</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/us-government-responds-to-targeted-killings-lawsuit.php">litigation</a> regarding the US targeted killing process. These yet-to-be identified or disclosed policy standards and procedures will pertain to "personality strikes" against named terrorists, and "signature strikes" against groups of suspected, unknown militants.</p>

<p>Where are the US drones operating from in Africa? A former French Foreign Legion post referred to as Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti is <a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/10/secret-drone-base/">reportedly</a> the center of a "constellation of hush-hush [US] drone, commando or intelligence facilities in East Africa [including] Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and the island nation of the Seychelles." The DOD will neither confirm nor deny those locations, , but Niger's ambassador to the US, Maman Sidikou, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/29/us/niger">told CNN</a> that his government has agreed to let US drones operate from its territory, a largely desert nation on the eastern border of Mali. Included among the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/remote-us-base-at-core-of-secret-operations/2012/10/25/a26a9392-197a-11e2-bd10-5ff056538b7c_print.html">3,200</a> or so troops at Lemonnier are approximately 300 Special Operations personnel working on organizing raids and strategizing the drone strikes of eight or more Predator drones "flown" by pilots from thousands of miles away and eight F-15E fighter-bombers for other strike operations. </p>

<p>The US can and does operate more than drones as counterterrorism tools in Africa in the pursuit of a so-called "<a href="/forum/2009/01/smart-power-and-rule-of-law.php">smart power</a>" strategy: employing the "soft power" tools of diplomacy, economic assistance and communications to supplement or augment the traditional "hard power" capabilities of the military to <a href="http://www.law.uconn.edu/files/Govern.pdf">defend and advance</a> [PDF] US interests in Africa. The US and Algeria have concluded numerous <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/8005.htm">treaties and bilateral agreements</a> to increase near and long-term military, political and economic cooperation. Both nations reportedly consult closely on key international and regional issues such as law enforcement cooperation, have a <a href="http://algiers.usembassy.gov/assistance_agreement2.html">customs mutual assistance agreement</a> and signed a <a href="http://www.mainjustice.com/2010/04/07/u-s-algeria-sign-first-legal-assistance-treaty/">mutual legal assistance treaty</a>. Both have conducted bilateral military exercises &#8212; as well as frequent military exchanges &#8212; and the US hosted an Algerian port visit for the first time in 2012. Algerians have granted overflight permission to French fighter jets, and perhaps also to US drone overflights as well. Algeria <a href="http://world.time.com/2013/01/17/algeria-intervenes-in-hostage-crisis-as-malis-war-spreads-regional-chaos/">sealed</a> their southern border with Mali, cutting off essential fuel supplies to the terrorists in northern Mali, but Algeria may be <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/algerian-reticence-spoils-us-strategy-for-region/2013/01/18/7af23fbe-617c-11e2-89a2-2eabfad24542_story.html">reluctant</a> to support the fight against AQIM outside its borders. At present there is no unclassified US troop presence in Algeria to combat AQIM. Drone flights over Algeria, based from other African nations, and <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323468604578245310036330882.html">Special Operations support</a>, keeps the US profile low in the ongoing "smart power" approach to combating AQIM in Algeria.</p>

<p>As a result of the March 2012 military coup, the US terminated all assistance to the government of Mali and <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2828.htm">suspended</a> all assistance to Mali with the exception of humanitarian assistance, food security, health and elections support, on a case-by-case basis. The US has looked to act unilaterally, and in conjunction with other nations to intervene in Mali under the auspices of <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2012/sc10698.doc.htm">UN Security Council Resolution 2056</a>, cosponsored by the US, which <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2012/12/202350.htm">supports</a> a comprehensive approach to overlapping governance, security and humanitarian crises affecting Mali. </p>

<p>In January 2013, the DOD started <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2013/01/203134.htm#MALI">airlifting</a> French equipment into Mali in support of 700 - 800 African Union (AU) troops from Benin, Nigeria, Togo, Burkina Faso and in anticipation of Senegalese troops en route. The US also <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2013/01/202828.htm#MALI">encouraged</a> the Economic Community Of West African States member nations to support a peace enforcement mission in Mali consistent with <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter7.shtml">Chapter VII</a> of the UN Charter, albeit in advance of <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/29/us-mali-crisis-un-idUSBRE8AS02U20121129">UN authorization</a> of offensive operations in Mali.</p>

<p>Another key regional player in the North African counterterrorism operations is the AU. The US has a strong partnership with the AU in areas of mutual interest spanning a variety of sectors, formalized in August 2010 by a $5.8 million assistance <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2011/04/161212.htm">agreement</a> that supports AU projects in peace and security, democracy and governance, agriculture, health, trade and other fields, as well as general capacity-building. The US Department of State established the US Mission to the African Union (USAU) in 2006, the US dedicated significant resources to supporting the AU's peace and security programs, building capability for the AU to fulfill its aspirational defense goals under the 2009 <a href="http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/documents/treaties/text/Non%20Aggression%20Common%20Defence%20Pact.pdf">AU Non-Aggression and Common Defence Pact</a> [PDF].<br />
 <br />
The US assists the African Standby Force &#8212; a pan-African military corps &#8212; not just for counterterrorism but full-spectrum operational capability. Towards those ends, the US has provided training and equipment to develop and enhance the AU's Peace Support Operations Division, strategic communications, conflict monitoring and analysis and military planning capabilities which are critical to on-going and future AU peace support operations. </p>

<p>The newest regional unified combatant command formed by the DOD, US Africa Command (AFRICOM), leads this combined and interagency "smart power" promotion of US and African interests. Established under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/161">10 USC &#167; 161</a> and operating on a continent that has changed much since the independence movement, <a href="http://www.africom.mil/NEWSROOM/Article/6042/us-africa-command-reaches-initial-operating-capabi">AFRICOM</a> works closely with the AU, other regional African institutions and individual nations to "provide unique 'value-added' capabilities enhancing existing U.S. and international programs." On repercussions of troops with "boots on the ground," AFRICOM Senior Strategy Adviser J. Peter Pham <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/drone-strikes-in-mali-2013-1#ixzz2Iuht85w">said</a>: "Drone strikes or airstrikes will not restore Mali's territorial integrity or defeat the Islamists, but they may be the least bad option." In hindsight, the outgoing deputy commander for military operations, retired Vice Admiral Robert Moeller, <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/07/21/the_truth_about_africom">reflected</a> on the challenges of civil-military operations in Africa and AFRICOM's "lessons learned" on the US approach to ongoing and future civil-military operations in Africa:<br />
<ul><li>Lesson 1: AFRICOM does not create policy.</li><li>Lesson 2: AFRICOM must work hand in hand with the diplomatic corps.</li><li>Lesson 3: Keep our footprint in Africa limited.</li><li>Lesson 4: AFRICOM is most effective when it listens to the concerns of its African partners.</li><li>Lesson 5: Don't expect instant results. </li></ul><br />
As military and diplomatic initiatives challenge AQIM and other threats to internal and regional security in North Africa and beyond, the US must pursue a full spectrum of "smart power" capabilities, to include but not be limited to the use of drones for surveillance or targeted killing strikes. In every possible instance, the US should partner with African host nations and allied forces. In that manner, the US can fulfill ambitious policy goals to "add value" while advancing US and African economic, security and development policies. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Robert+Marcelis">Robert Marcelis</a>, <a href="http://www.law.ucdavis.edu/">University of California, Davis School of Law</a> Class of 2013, discusses the US Supreme Court's effort to make lower courts enforce arbitration agreements...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="Robert_Picture.png" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Robert_Picture.png" width="125" height="200" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he Consumer Attorneys of California, a group whose members represent individuals with personal injury claims, call arbitration agreements "viruses" &#8212; "hard to spot, but spreading fast." Numerous businesses include arbitration agreements in their contracts &#8212; from cell phone and automobile purchases and bank accounts to employment and attorney agreements. Generally, parties enter into these agreements before a dispute arises. When disputes do arise, plaintiff claims are often so small that attorneys will only take their cases if they can aggregate small claims into a class action, thereby rendering their legal services compensable. Defendants, on the other hand, prefer each dispute be resolved on a case-by-case basis. As Sun Tzu observed about the art of war: "If double his strength, divide him." Not surprisingly, arbitration agreements, because they are usually tendered by defendants to plaintiffs as <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/adhesion_contract_contract_of_adhesion">adhesion contracts</a>, require plaintiffs to forego class action lawsuits decided by judges and juries and submit their individual grievances before a neutral, third-party arbitrator. When the arbitrator renders a decision, it is binding on all parties and is subject, if at all, to limited appellate review.</p>

<p>Arbitration has its modern roots in the labor movement and the process has been touted as providing advantages over litigation for defendants. Arbitration limits the discovery and pretrial motion process, which means less time and money spent by attorneys. Plaintiffs' attorneys generally recover lower fees in arbitration. In full-blown litigation, attorneys might be entitled to fees under federal statutes or state laws. While this is a point of much contention, many plaintiffs' attorneys and scholars have argued that defendants would rather take their chances with arbitrators. There is a perception, they argue, that arbitrators return lower damage awards compared to their counterparts in litigation &#8212; juries &#8212; who might be more sympathetic to injured plaintiffs. For these reasons, defendants generally prefer to enforce arbitration agreements, while plaintiffs and their attorneys prefer to invalidate arbitration agreements. While plaintiffs in years past could use state laws to invalidate arbitration agreements, the US Supreme Court recently restricted the viability of these challenges. </p>

<p>Three years ago the Supreme Court decided <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17088816341526709934">AT&#38;T v. Concepcion</a>, which is described as the <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/supreme-court-rules-federal-arbitration-law-preempts-state-law.php">watershed case</a> in the Court's repudiation of state laws that work to invalidate arbitration agreements. Some commentators describe the case as a death knell for class action lawsuits and class arbitration. In <em>Concepcion</em>, the Court directed lower courts to enforce arbitration agreements with class action waivers based on its authority to interpret the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/9/chapter-1">Federal Arbitration Act</a> (FAA). The FAA was adopted by Congress in 1925 in an environment of judicial hostility to the enforcement of arbitration agreements. While the FAA preempts state law, Section 2 &#8212; "<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/9/2">the savings clause</a>" &#8212; allows plaintiffs to challenge arbitration agreements based on common law contract defenses such as duress, fraud, contract formation and unconscionability. Parties may also repudiate the FAA if they decide to do so explicitly in their arbitration agreements. Many states, including California, have enacted their own arbitration acts and rules which govern these particular arbitration agreements. However, parties benefit (or do not benefit, depending on their perspective) from the following cases as long as their agreement falls within the scope of the FAA. </p>

<p>In <em>Concepcion</em>, AT&#38;T challenged California's common law rule developed by the California Supreme Court in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4200537222360864555">Discover Bank v. Superior Court</a>.  In <em>Concepcion</em>, Vincent and Liza Concepcion purchased phone service from AT&#38;T, which included phones advertised as free. Predictably, they signed an arbitration agreement in which they agreed to arbitrate individually and not to file a class action. The Concepcions were charged sales tax on their phones. They filed suit alleging that AT&#38;T had "engaged in false advertising and fraud by charging sales tax on phones it advertised as free." In response, AT&#38;T moved to compel arbitration pursuant to its agreement. The Concepcions opposed the motion arguing that the agreement was unconscionable based on the <em>Discover Bank</em> rule. </p>

<p>The common law rule established in <em>Discover Bank</em> had allowed California lower courts to invalidate arbitration agreements with class waivers in consumer contracts of adhesion: (1) if the claims were relatively small, and (2) when it was alleged that the corporate defendant deliberately engaged in a scheme to cheat consumers out of small sums of money. To the dismay of state defendants, California courts regularly applied this rule to invalidate arbitration agreements. The US District Court for the Southern District of California and the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed with the Concepcions and invalidated the agreement. The Ninth Circuit referred to the <em>Discover Bank</em> rule as a "refinement of the unconscionability analysis applicable to contracts generally in California." According to Section 2 of the FAA, plaintiffs may use common law defenses such as unconscionability to challenge arbitration agreements governed by the FAA. This remains unchanged today and, therefore, would seem to control the case in favor of the Concepcions. </p>

<p>However, the US Supreme Court took a closer look at California's <em>Discover Bank</em> rule. The Court first noted that the policy goals of the FAA are twofold: "enforcement of private agreements and encouragement of efficient and speedy dispute resolution." California's <em>Discover Bank</em> rule allowed plaintiffs to demand class arbitration <em>ex post facto</em>. This switch, the Court reasoned, from "bilateral to class arbitration" sacrificed the advantages of arbitration by making "the process slower, more costly and more likely to generate procedural morass than final judgment." Because class arbitration "interfered with fundamental attributes of arbitration and thus create[d] a scheme inconsistent with the FAA," the Court held that the FAA preempted California's <em>Discover Bank</em> rule. As arbitration agreements with class action waivers become ubiquitous in the business world, courts will be forced to enforce these agreements &#8212; which will require plaintiff's attorneys to arbitrate each claim on a case-by-case basis. </p>

<p>Shortly before <em>Concepcion</em>, the Court <a href = "/paperchase/2010/04/supreme-court-rules-class-arbitration.php">faced another class arbitration question</a> in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7084067900530012192">Stolt-Nielsen v. Animalfeeds</a>. In <em>Stolt-Nielsen</em>, two sophisticated commercial entities entered into an agreement with an arbitration clause, but the clause was entirely silent on whether class arbitration was permitted. The parties agreed to delegate authority to a panel of arbitrators to decide the issue. The arbitrators interpreted the clause to allow class arbitration. The Supreme Court was critical of the decision and chided the arbitration panel for imposing "its own policy choice." The Court explained that arbitrators cannot find implicit agreements to allow class arbitration, because of the fundamental differences between bilateral arbitration and class arbitration. Bilateral arbitration provides all the benefits of "private dispute resolution: lower costs, greater efficiency and speed," while class arbitration diminishes these benefits because it involves "disputes between hundreds or perhaps thousands of parties." Accordingly, the Supreme Court reversed and remanded the case. These two cases &#8212; major obstacles for plaintiffs and their attorneys &#8212; stand for the proposition that defendants will arbitrate on a case-by-case basis, unless they consent to class arbitration. </p>

<p>Outside of the class action context, the Court recently <a href = "/paperchase/2012/02/supreme-court-to-rule-on-university-of-texas-affirmative-action-policy.php">restricted challenges</a> to arbitration agreements based on state common law. Last year in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5525967867212873447">Marmet Health Care Center v. Brown</a>, the Court repudiated West Virginia's categorical bar invalidating arbitration agreements that involve personal injury or wrongful death in nursing homes. In <em>Marmet</em>, three family members of patients that required care in nursing homes signed pre-dispute arbitration agreements on behalf of the patients. After these patients died, the three family members filed wrongful death suits against the nursing home in state court alleging negligence. The cases were consolidated. The Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia held that "as a matter of public policy under West Virginia law, an arbitration clause in a nursing home admission agreement adopted prior to an occurrence of negligence that results in a person injury or wrongful death, shall not be enforced to compel arbitration." The Supreme Court vacated and remanded the case, citing the legal framework from <em>Concepcion</em>: "[W]hen state law prohibits outright the arbitration of a particular type of claim, the analysis is straightforward: [t]he conflicting rule is displaced by the FAA." The Supreme Court went on to state that the FAA does not include any exceptions for personal injury or wrongful death and that West Virginia's common law categorical bar was inconsistent with the FAA's strong policy of enforcing arbitration agreements &#8212; a victory for defendants. <br />
 <br />
The Supreme Court also resolved the question of whether state legislatures can enact statutes to invalidate arbitration agreements. Last year the Court granted <em>certiorari</em>, vacated and remanded the California Supreme Court's decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4171341554876789468">Sonic-Calabasas v. Moreno</a> in light of <em>Concepcion</em>. In <em>Sonic-Calabasas</em>, an employer signed an arbitration agreement as a condition of employment. Under the <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/.html/lab_table_of_contents.html">California Labor Code</a>, employees with claims for unpaid wages are entitled to an administrative hearing with the California Division of Labor Standards pursuant to <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=lab&group=00001-01000&file=79-107">Section 98</a> <em>et seq</em>. After the employee left his position, he filed a claim with the labor commissioner for unpaid vacation pay. In response, the defendant moved to compel arbitration pursuant to its agreement with the employee. The California Supreme Court held as a matter of public policy that arbitration agreements "cannot be made to serve as a vehicle for the waiver of [state] statutory rights." The Supreme Court remanded the case to the California Supreme Court for reconsideration. </p>

<p>The remand of <em>Sonic-Calabasas</em> the decision in <em>Marmet</em> sent a strong message to the states and plaintiff's attorneys &#8212; only Congress may create exceptions to the FAA.</p>

<p>The last bastions for plaintiffs are common law contract defenses including unconscionability &#8212; a defense plaintiffs use fairly regularly to invalidate arbitration agreements. But who decides this important issue: the judge or the arbitrator? The law treats the arbitration agreement and the rest of the contract as separate agreements. Courts generally determine whether an arbitration agreement and its terms are unconscionable and, if so, it is unenforceable. The doctrine of unconscionability allows courts to invalidate adhesive arbitration agreements with unfair terms. For example, a defendant cannot require plaintiffs to arbitrate in another state, to shoulder exorbitant upfront arbitration fees or pay all arbitration costs if the plaintiff loses arbitration. On the other hand, once a court determines an arbitration agreement is enforceable, it compels arbitration and the arbitrator decides all other issues under the contract. For example, an arbitrator would determine whether a non-compete agreement was lawful or whether an employment contract stipulated at-will employment or for-cause employment. </p>

<p>Even if the doctrine of unconscionability leaves the door slightly ajar for plaintiffs to challenge agreements, the Supreme Court appears to have <a href = "/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-limits-judicial-authority-over-arbitration-agreements.php">foreclosed</a> the possibility in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10589677176860191748">Rent-A-Center v. Jackson</a>. In <em>Rent-A-Center</em>, the Court held that defendants may delegate authority to an arbitrator to determine whether an arbitration agreement is unconscionable. In other words: can courts determine whether the terms of arbitration agreement are unconscionable when defendants assign that responsibility to an arbitrator? The answer is "no" &#8212; the arbitrator will decide. In essence, the Court treats delegation clauses and the rest of an arbitration agreement as entirely separate agreements. In these cases, plaintiffs must challenge the delegation clause itself. That means courts may only decide whether the delegation clause itself is unconscionable, even if the terms of the arbitration agreement containing the delegation clause are blatantly unconscionable. </p>

<p>As a practical matter, plaintiffs' attorneys should be careful to identify delegation clauses in arbitration agreements. Once identified, plaintiffs must draft their pleadings carefully and direct any challenge to the delegation clause. If they challenge the terms of the arbitration agreement &#8212; the fateful misstep taken by the employee's attorney in <em>Rent-A-Center</em> &#8212; courts will ignore the challenge and enforce the agreement. Unfortunately, the Court did not provide a standard to guide lower courts when a delegation clause is substantively unconscionable. But the Court did leave the window open for plaintiffs to challenge delegation clauses based on the bias of an arbitrator, prohibitive arbitration fees or lack of discovery.  </p>

<p>After <em>Rent-A-Center</em>, it is <a href="http://www.mwe.com/info/pubs/rentacenter3.pdf">advisable</a> [PDF] that defendants include delegation clauses in their arbitration agreements to limit jurisdiction of courts. "In the end, <em>Rent-A-Center</em> may be most important for what it says about the US judicial view of arbitration itself. It is simply getting harder and harder for litigants to argue their way out of [] arbitration agreement[s]."  </p>

This rapid transfer from one fossil fuel source to another, spurred by the explosion of horizontal hydraulic fracturing, or "<a href="/feature/2013/02/fracking.php">fracking</a>," fails to account for the life-cycle and vast externalities of a natural gas energy system.</p>

                <p>When most people think of fracking, they think about wells and tainted water. However, natural gas infrastructure is a complicated and often vast network containing pipelines that move natural gas from wells to compressor stations that pressurize the gas and processing plants that separate the gas from water and other components. Greenhouse gases and other air pollutants are emitted during every step, including extraction, transport and processing. This article focuses on examining the attempts of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate greenhouse gases produced during the process of hydraulic fracturing.</p>

                <p>Greenhouse gas emissions from natural gas operations result from vented emissions, fugitive emissions and combustion emissions that are released during the extraction process. Natural gas is primarily composed of methane. Therefore, methane is released throughout natural gas systems during normal venting as well as through fugitive &#8212; or unintentional &#8212; emissions. Fugitive emissions are particularly difficult to quantify because they are invisible, odorless and inaudible. Methane emissions are problematic from a climate change perspective because their global warming potential is <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch2s2-10-2.html">72 times</a> that of carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. Finally, incomplete combustion of fuel within engines associated with natural gas facilities results in carbon dioxide and methane emissions.</p>

                <p>Recent studies indicate that, on average, between 1 percent and 3.3 percent of the natural gas extracted by fracking is emitted into the air. One <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/326/5953/716.full">study</a> found that if these rates rise above 2.6 percent, the climate impact of natural gas would be greater than coal. Another recent <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-011-0217-3/fulltext.html">study</a> found global warming will actually increase as we approach 2050 and the country is transitioning towards 50 percent natural gas power generation. Yet another <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/7/1/014019/article">study</a> found that the transition to natural gas power generation would require 100 years or more to achieve a 25 percent reduction in global warming.</p>

                <p>Despite the results of these studies, there has been little progress made to curb or regulate the emissions produced by the natural gas extraction process. However, the EPA has many regulatory tools which, if properly implemented, could lead to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from fracking and other natural gas operations. These tools include the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-07-12/pdf/2012-16704.pdf">Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule</a> [PDF], the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/">Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule</a> and <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2011-title40-vol6/xml/CFR-2011-title40-vol6-part60.xml">New Source Performance Standards</a>.</p>

                <p>In May 2010, the EPA finalized the Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule. Previously, a source of air pollution was considered a "major source" if it generated 100 tons per year (TPY) or more of a criteria pollutant. Due to the prevalence of greenhouse gases, the EPA "tailored" this rule. Beginning in January 2011, only those sources already considered major sources, with subsequent modifications to their facility increasing  the emission of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) by 75,000 TPY or more, would be required to adopt <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7479">best available control technology</a> (BACT) for greenhouse gases. Beginning in July 2011, a facility could trigger major source status just by virtue of its greenhouse gas emissions. Any facility that emits 100,000 TPY or more of CO2e is required to obtain a <a href="http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/title5.html">Title V permit</a>. A new facility emitting 100,000 TPY of CO2e or more must adopt BACT for greenhouse gases. An existing facility, even if it was not considered a major source, which undertakes a modification that increases greenhouse gas emissions by 75,000 TPY of CO2e and collectively emits over 100,000 TPY of CO2e &3151; including the modification &#8212; would also have to adopt BACT for greenhouse gases.</p>

                <p>While most natural gas facilities in Pennsylvania, for example, have historically been considered minor sources of air pollution, the Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule has led to many qualifying for "major source status" due to their CO2e emissions. These early BACT determinations are critical in setting a strong precedent for tight greenhouse gas controls. The <a href="http://www.epa.gov/gasstar/">Natural Gas STAR Program</a>, a voluntary EPA partnership which encourages natural gas companies to adopt technologies that improve efficiency and reduce methane emissions, provides a baseline for greenhouse gas BACT determinations. Initial greenhouse gas BACT determinations in Pennsylvania have called for proper operation and maintenance of natural gas-fired turbines for maximization of thermal efficiency, capture of dehydrator emissions and leak detection and repair programs. </p>

                <p>In accordance with <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/98/subpart-W">40 CFR 98 subpart W</a>, owners and operators of natural gas facilities emitting 25,000 tpy CO2e or more must report emissions to the EPA. Facilities began monitoring GHG emissions on January 1, 2011, and the first report was due September 28, 2012. Beginning in 2013, reports must be submitted to the EPA by March 31 each year.</p>

                <p>In an effort to combat the recent controversy regarding the climate impacts of natural gas operations, the industry is pushing the EPA to include the data submitted in September 2012 in the annual greenhouse gas inventory report to the UN. While the EPA wants to have the most up-to-date information, the data must undergo review and quality assurance before its release.</p>

                <p>In response to a lawsuit over missing several deadlines, the EPA issued oil and gas air pollution <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-08-16/pdf/2012-16806.pdf">standards</a> [PDF] on April 17, 2012. The standards, however, failed to set standards for methane. Environmental groups and a coalition of eastern states submitted notices of intent to sue the EPA for its failure to set new source performance standards for new sources of methane under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7411">&#167; 111</a> of the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/regulations/laws/caa.html">Clean Air Act</a> (CAA). Section 111(b)(1)(B) requires the EPA to establish standards of performance governing the emission of air pollutants from new sources in the oil and gas sector, and if appropriate, revise those standards at least every eight years. The EPA has a mandatory duty to: (1) make a determination whether standards covering methane emissions are "appropriate" and (2) if so, to promulgate standards.</p>

                <p>In the most recently released oil and gas air pollution standards the EPA stated that it "intends to continue to evaluate the appropriateness of regulating methane with an eye toward taking additional steps if appropriate." Making the appropriateness determination is not discretionary, and it is <a href="http://newsandinsight.thomsonreuters.com/Legal/News/2012/12_-_December/States_threaten_lawsuit_against_EPA_over_regulations/">expected</a> that the environmental groups and states will file a suit to force a determination shortly.</p>

                <p>While natural gas has been billed as a bridge to a renewable energy future, it may just be a delay with minimal, if any, climate benefits. Although US President Barack Obama re-committed himself to climate legislation during his second inaugural address, it is crucial that the EPA use all of the tools at its disposal to ensure that natural gas operations do not continue the climate change legacy of coal.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.ryanwhaley.com/matthew-c-kane">Matthew C. Kane</a> of the University of Oklahoma College of Law and the Oklahoma City University School of Law says that, while the Ugandan Amnesty Act may have granted amnesty to Thomas Kwoyelo, his future is far from settled . . .<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/matthewkane.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n September 23, 2011, JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/uganda-court-grants-ex-lra-rebel-amnesty.php">reported</a> the controversial ruling by the Ugandan Constitutional Court, finding that former Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) rebel Thomas Kwoyelo was entitled to amnesty under the <a href="http://www.ulii.org/ug/legislation/consolidated-act/294">Ugandan Amnesty Act of 2000</a>. The Act, like several similar grants of amnesty made by Ugandan authorities to resolve earlier conflicts, was broadly supported by civil and religious leaders and implemented in an effort to peacefully end the fighting in northern Uganda. Essentially, the Act affords amnesty to any rebel who renounces the war and surrenders their arms, regardless of what crimes that person may have committed. </p>

<p>Since passage of the Act, more than 26,000 individuals, including members of the LRA who held significantly higher positions within the organization than Kwoyelo, have received amnesty. While the policy of amnesty is subject to much scrutiny and debate, principles of equality and fairness supported the conclusion that Kwoyelo receive the same treatment as others similarly situated. The Constitutional Court's ruling, however, did not resolve Kwoyelo's legal status. To the contrary, he has remained in confinement as his personal situation embodies national and international struggles in applying the rule of law, human rights and political and economic realities.</p>

<p>Following the Constitutional Court's ruling (and a subsequent denial of the government's appeal), the International Criminal Division of the High Court of Uganda formally <a href="http://justiceandreconciliation.com/2011/11/kwoyelo-icd-trial-cessation-11-nov-11/">ceased</a> Kwoyelo's trial on November 11, 2011. Nonetheless, the government refused to release Kwoyelo.</p>

<p>On January 25, 2012, Kwoyelo sought and obtained relief in the form of an <a href="http://justiceandreconciliation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/JRP-Updates-on-Kwoyelo-27Jan20121.pdf">order of mandamus</a> [PDF] from the High Court of Uganda, compelling the Chairman of the Amnesty Commission and the Director of Public Prosecutions to grant a certificate of amnesty and immediately release Kwoyelo. Again, the government ignored the court order and <a href="http://www.newvision.co.ug/article/fullstory.aspx?story_id=628800&catid=1&mid=53">refused</a> to release Kwoyelo.</p>

<p>Three months later, on March 30, 2012, the Ugandan Supreme Court <a href="http://ugandaradionetwork.com/a/story.php?s=41364">stayed</a> the orders of the Constitutional Court. However, there are several significant problems with the Supreme Court's order. First, the Supreme Court &#8212; which has been plagued with multiple vacancies for years &#8212; currently seats only four (five at the time of the stay) of the seven-justice quorum necessary to rule on constitutional issues. Second, the Supreme Court offered no rationale for its ruling, making the continued detention seemingly <em>de facto</em> arbitrary. Third, the case has already been dismissed by the International Criminal Division and, thus, there are no legal grounds for continuing to hold Kwoyelo. No new or renewed charges have been issued since the Supreme Court stay, and there is no time table for appointment of new Supreme Court justices to constitute the constitutional quorum, thus Kwoyelo remains in indefinite detention.</p>

<p>Beyond the unexplained stay, the broader motivation for Kwoyelo's continued detention is unclear. Aspects of the government's legal contentions regarding the scope of the amnesty statute retain some appeal &#8212; on one end of the spectrum, the government has suggested that the act should not trump the application of stand-alone, non-war crimes charges of murder and kidnapping under the <a href="http://www.ulii.org/ug/legislation/consolidated-act/120">Ugandan Penal Code</a> provisions. Alternatively, the government is also contending that a domestic statute should not apply to grave breaches of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/war-and-law/treaties-customary-law/geneva-conventions/index.jsp">Geneva Conventions</a>, given their international character (a theory previously recognized in cases before various international tribunals). The same arguments, however, could be made for many of the thousands who had been granted amnesty, which is the reason Kwoyelo's position is grounded in principles of equal protection.</p>

<p>While there is some local sentiment that Kwoyelo should be held accountable, many suspect that officials believe his trial is necessary to placate international organizations and countries funding post-conflict recovery efforts. Despite having passed legislation specifically addressing war crimes violations and the creation of a war crimes division in the judicial system, there have been no prosecutions. As a result, Radhika Coomaraswamy, the UN special envoy for children and armed conflict, has <a href="http://childrenandarmedconflict.un.org/press-releases/senior-lra-commander-responsible-for-grave-violations-against-children-captured/">recently argued</a> for prosecution over amnesty in a similar case. Perhaps the greatest motivation is the ever-present risk of increased involvement by the <a href="/feature/featured/icc/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC), which, pursuant to Article 17 of the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a>, could make a finding that Uganda is unwilling or unable to carry out the prosecution and institute its own proceedings. ICC intervention into domestic war crimes prosecutions is not an empty threat &#8212; on February 7, 2013, the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/jurist-the-international-criminal-court.php">ordered</a> Libya to hand over Abdullah al-Senoussi, Muammar Gaddafi's former intelligence chief, for prosecution before the tribunal (an outcome his attorneys contend is necessary to afford him a fair trial), despite the Libyan government's stated desire to try him locally. Yet, lack of war crimes prosecutions is far from the only issue Uganda must address in the international community concerning its attempts to restore order in the north, as allegations of corruption (some $16 million in recovery funds were <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20368182">recently found</a> in private accounts of aides to the Ugandan prime minister) have led to suspension of many national and international contributions.</p>

<p>John Francis Onyango, Kwoyelo's attorney, has a history of taking on controversial cases and has demonstrated a willingness to advocate for unpopular clients. In addition to defending accused war criminals and terrorist suspects, Onyango recently secured a <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gCF7XAsQskeXAs6aK-c294LnCTtA?docId=CNG.44fa09ade0fc8c0e2c8a3d0887dad8a8.2a1">dismissal</a> of all counts against the British expatriate David Cecil, widely reviled by many Ugandans for producing a play with homosexual content. Having exhausted available domestic options, Onyango filed a complaint on Kwoyelo's behalf with the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (ACHPR) on October 19, 2012, which is <a href="http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Rights-body-to-assist-Kwoyelo/-/688334/1655688/-/wjve18z/-/index.html">scheduled</a> for consideration by the ACHPR this week.</p>

<p>The ACHPR was created in 1986 as part of the African (Banjul) <a href="http://www.achpr.org/instruments/achpr/">Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights</a>. Among other rights, the Charter expressly provides in Article 7 for "the right of liberty and to the security of the person ... [and that] no one may be arbitrarily arrested or detained." The Charter allows non-state actors to petition the ACHPR, provided certain conditions are met including timely submission and exhaustion of state remedies. It appears that, on occasion, the ACHPR has utilized these procedural requirements to avoid taking up matters otherwise within the commission's jurisdiction, which might be considered overly politicized or otherwise unsavory. The decisions &#8212; officially termed "recommendations" &#8212; of the ACHPR, as one might expect from the use of the selected wording, are not legally binding on the states, nor is there any clear procedure for implementation of the recommendations. In the instant case involving a single detainee, Uganda would essentially have to agree to comport with the ACHPR recommendation. The only potential alternative would be for the ACHPR to refer the matter to its sister institution, the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights, which, in light of Uganda's adoption of the <a href="http://www.achpr.org/instruments/court-establishment/">Protocol to the African Charter</a>, can issue a binding order on Uganda. However, it will be interesting to see if an institution in its infancy will willingly put its legitimacy at risk for an accused war criminal.</p>

<p>The ACHPR includes one member from Uganda: Med S.K. Kaggwa, a well-known human rights attorney. Interestingly, Kaggwa is the ACHPR's special rapporteur on prisons and conditions of detention. As such, he is <a href="http://www.achpr.org/mechanisms/prisons-and-conditions-of-detention/about/">tasked</a> with "conduct[ing] studies into conditions or situations contributing to human rights violations of persons deprived of their liberty and recommend preventive measures." His view of Kwoyelo's detention seems likely to have significant influence on any action taken by the ACHPR and the Ugandan response to that recommendation.</p>

<p>Kwoyelo is not the only detainee whose future is uncertain. Caesar Acellam, a top LRA commander, was <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/05/13/uk-uganda-lra-idUKBRE84C07820120513">taken into custody</a> in May 2012. There has been virtually no activity in his case. Beyond those accused of war crimes, there have been a number of notable arrests and detentions, often of journalists or political dissidents, without charges being brought. Hundreds of children have been held without trial for years on end as a result of judicial backlog. Significant efforts made by Bob Goff, an American lawyer so respected by Ugandan authorities that he has been designated as an <a href="http://www.ugandaembassy.com/honoraryconsuls.htm">honorary consul</a>, have resulted in the trial or release of many of these juveniles. Such a positive step could foreshadow broader willingness to address indefinite detentions, yet political will and economic realities leave the ACHPR as Kwoyelo's best and, perhaps, only remaining option.</p>

<p>Kwoyelo has been accused of horrific crimes, yet many similarly situated were granted amnesty based on a policy that is favorably viewed by a majority of Ugandan citizens and which has helped bring the conflict in northern Uganda to an end. While Coomaraswamy argues that prosecution would "send a strong message to the LRA leadership that they will be held accountable for their actions," such a message could clearly lead to the continuation and extension of hostilities. Similar concerns arise regarding the ICC's potential intervention, with some Ugandans suggesting that the ICC is the reason that a complete resolution has not come to fruition. Indeed, Kwoyelo's year-long <em>incommunicado</em> detention and continued indefinite confinement, now approaching the four-year mark, would seemingly discourage rebels from surrendering to authorities. Regardless of political considerations, if Kwoyelo is denied amnesty the determination must be grounded in reason and based on applicable Ugandan law &#8212; not the desire to appease outsiders. Under such circumstances, Kwoyelo should be afforded his right to a fair and reasonably speedy trial. Judicial vacancies and docket backlogs simply cannot justify years of pretrial detention. </p>

<p>The ACHPR's consideration of Kwoyelo's case (including its initial decision on whether to hear the case on its merits) and Uganda's response to any ACHPR recommendation regarding Kwoyelo, as well as its future policy and practice regarding indefinite detentions, are important steps in the continued development of regional human rights policies as well as the rule of law in Uganda.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.earthworksaction.org/about/staff">Aaron Mintzes</a> of <a href="http://www.earthworksaction.org/">EARTHWORKS</a> examines the ways the federal government actually regulates fracking and discusses two case studies in states where industry advocates turn federalism on its head...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/aaron_mintzes.jpg" width="120" height="170" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he 113th Congress, especially the US House of Representatives, will use their oversight responsibilities this term to conduct hearings on many issues related to hydraulic fracturing or "<a href="/feature/2013/02/fracking.php">fracking</a>." Hydraulic fracturing involves the underground, high-pressure injection of millions of gallons of water, silicates and chemicals into ancient cracks in shale formations deep below the ground to release natural gas. The main question considered by these legislative committees boils down to who's the best regulator: cities, states or the federal government?<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Federal Regulation</strong><br />
                <br />
                In the corridors and committee rooms of Washington, DC, the oil and gas industry argues for state control instead of federal regulation. Two of the major legislative vehicles supporting this policy in the 112th Congress were the <a href="http://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/FRESH-Act.pdf">FRESH Act</a> [PDF] and the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/s3573/text">Empower States Act of 2012</a>. To drilling proponents, the states (especially those with histories of oil and gas development) have grand traditions regulating drilling within their borders. Regional geological differences require a localized approach and a federal "one size fits all" policy will ill-serve job creation and efficient energy development. Local regulators have familiarity not only with the area geology, but also with institutional memory needed to effectively handle inspections, enforcement and violations.<br />
                <br />
                To put it mildly, the ability of state regulators to enforce their own rules has generated considerable dispute. Recent <a href="http://www.earthworksaction.org/issues/detail/oil_gas_enforcement#.URlzQI6nUct">studies</a> suggest that state agencies by and large simply cannot handle the stunning increase in the number of wells in their jurisdictions. Even in states like Colorado and Pennsylvania &#8212; where drilling has occurred for a long time &#8212; the recent explosion in the number of gas wells near homes, schools and other populated areas has led some to question whether the limited resources appropriated to state regulators can keep up with the new demands of the shale gas boom.<br />
                <br />
                Thus, just as a practical matter, it appears that the states would greatly benefit simply from some extra help. The federal government has much to offer states in terms of staff, resources, and expertise. For the most part, the federal government has primarily conducted studies and supplied research and development dollars. The current technology used in high-volume hydraulic fracturing owes much of its origin to studies over the last 30 years funded by federal tax dollars and led by the <a href="http://energy.gov/">US Department of Energy</a>. Other federal agencies, including the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA), continue to <a href="http://www.epa.gov/hfstudy/">study</a> hydraulic fracturing.<br />
                <br />
                From a regulatory perspective, it's important to understand that the federal government <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/epa-announces-plan-to-develop-standards-for-fracking-wastewater-discharge.php">has virtually no authority over hydraulic fracturing</a>. The reason is that natural gas drilling enjoys broad <a href="http://www.earthworksaction.org/library/detail/the_oil_and_gas_industrys_exclusions_and_exemptions_to_major_environmental_#.URl0bI6nUct">exemptions</a> from seven of our nation's bedrock environmental laws. For example, the <a href="http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/rulesregs/sdwa/index.cfm">Safe Drinking Water Act</a> (SDWA) has, at its core, a program designed to control fluids injected underground &#8212; an essential process of hydraulic fracturing. However, the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-109publ58/pdf/PLAW-109publ58.pdf">Energy Policy Act of 2005</a> [PDF] specifically exempted it from the SDWA's Underground Injection Control program.<br />
                <br />
                Another critical exemption involves the aggregation of emission sources under the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/">Clean Air Act</a> (CAA). The CAA allows the EPA to set National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) from major sources. The law can also regulate individual, small sources in the same manner as major sources as long as the same operator controls similar sources positioned closely together. Just not oil and gas wells. In response to a lawsuit forcing action, the EPA in 2012 did issue <a href="http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/d0cf6618525a9efb85257359003fb69d/c742df7944b37c50852579e400594f8f!OpenDocument">new air rules</a> for gas wells under Section 111 &#8212; the New Source Performance Standard &#8212; to capture volatile organic compounds and other airborne toxic pollutants.<br />
                <br />
                Besides last year's air rule, the only other important arena where the federal government will do some regulating is where drilling occurs on federal lands. The <a href="http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en.html">Bureau of Land Management</a> (BLM) appears ready to issue <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2012/05/11/2012-11304/oil-and-gas-well-stimulation-including-hydraulic-fracturing-on-federal-and-indian-lands">rules</a> analogous to those in some states concerning disclosure, waste disposal, and well integrity. At the time of this writing, the degree to which the BLM proposals will set a better or worse standard than their state counterparts remains an open question.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Act 13</strong><br />
                <br />
                The industry's argument that the more local the regulator, the better the regulation, breaks down once disputes arise between states and municipalities. Rather than taking the position that the locals know best, the oil and gas industry instead argues that an in-state one size fits all approach provides regulatory certainty and best promotes efficient resource development. The best two examples of this have occurred recently in Pennsylvania and Colorado.<br />
                <br />
                In the Keystone State, Harrisburg legislators passed a series of sweeping reforms to the state's oil and gas law known collectively as <a href="http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/act_13/20789">Act 13</a>. The effect of this legislation was to seize powers traditionally reserved for municipalities and concentrate them in the state government. Perhaps the most controversial aspect of Act 13 included provisions preempting the power of municipalities to issue zoning rules for oil and gas facilities. For instance, 58 Pa.C.S. &#167; 3303 reads:<blockquote>Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, environmental acts are of Statewide concern, and to the extent they regulate oil and gas operations, occupy the entire field of regulation, to the exclusion of all local ordinances. The Commonwealth by this section, preempts and supersedes the local regulation of oil and gas operations regulated by the environmental acts, as provided in this chapter.</blockquote>On March 29, 2012, seven municipalities filed a complaint against the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania seeking a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief. The suit challenges the constitutionality of Act 13 on grounds that the state's power grab of local zoning control violates, among other things, the 14th amendment's guarantee of substantive due process. The Commonwealth countered that municipalities' powers to zone are delegated to them by state statute &#8212; the Municipal Planning Code (MPC), P.L. 805, as amended, 53 P.S. &#167;&#167; 10101-11202. As a result, since the state grants towns the power to zone, it also has the right to limit it.<br />
                <br />
                President Judge Dan Pellegrini's 4-3 majority <a href="http://www.mwe.com/files/Uploads/Documents/News/Robinson_Township_v_PA.PDF">decision</a> [PDF] sides with the municipalities. Quoting from the US Supreme Court's zoning discussion in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5243725146119658821&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">City of Edmonds v. Oxford House, Inc.</a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8376015914752485063&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr"> Village OF Euclid et al. v. Amber Realty Company</a>, the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania reminds us that the purpose of zoning is to avoid the problem of the "pig in the parlor instead of the barnyard." As demonstrated in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Village+of+Belle+Terre+v.+Borass&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=11716984369929543442&scilh=0">Village of Belle Terre v. Boraas</a>, land use restrictions help secure "zones where ... the blessings of quiet seclusion and clean air make the area a sanctuary for people." In short, the long history of local control over land use decisions recognizes that while individual parcels pay in terms of reasonable regulation, they also benefit from protections for their quiet use and enjoyment.<br />
                <br />
                The Court's substantive due process analysis involved a careful balancing of the rights of property owners subject to zoning against the state's police powers to protect the public interest. Here, the public interest seeking protection is the promotion of oil and gas development. The Court's decision, however, distinguishes this interest from the broader scope of interests protected by zoning requirements. The process the MPC prescribes for zoning requires municipalities to adopt comprehensive plans for land use.<br />
                <br />
                The Court concludes that Act 13 (specifically, <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/LI/CT/HTM/58/00.033..HTM">58 Pa.C.S. &#167; 3304</a>) requires municipalities to violate their own comprehensive plans and allow oil and gas drilling in residential neighborhoods. And that such a requirement is simply not rationally related to the purposes served by zoning. If the Commonwealth were allowed to force municipalities to ignore their comprehensive plans, the legislature could similarly require the same for any sources of industrial pollution, effectively inviting the "pig in the parlor."<br />
                <br />
                Part of the purpose of zoning is, of course, to protect public health and the environment &#8212; to keep industrial activity away from residential neighborhoods where the dangers of pollutants can create a substantial risk of harm. The reason municipalities traditionally have zoning power is that most policymakers accept that local folks simply know best. The litigation over Act 13 <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/pennsylvania-agencies-submit-brief-in-shale-drilling-law-appeal.php">continues</a> in the <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/courts/supreme-court/">Supreme Court of Pennsylvania</a>, with a decision expected soon.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Longmont</strong><br />
                <br />
                A similar debate surfaced in the Boulder County town of Longmont, Colorado. Just as in Pennsylvania, the oil and gas industry sided with the larger government entity rather than the smaller, local one. Also like Pennsylvania, this question of "who's the better regulator?" has resulted in litigation. The remarkable thing about the Longmont suit is that the challenge implicates not only government action, but also a democratic vote by the people.<br />
                <br />
                In July 2012, the Longmont City Council passed an ordinance that prevents drilling in residential areas, requires a 750-foot setback from homes or other occupied structures and implements some additional groundwater monitoring procedures. The state regulator, the <a href="http://cogcc.state.co.us/">Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission</a> (COGCC), has a 350-foot setback requirement. Later that month, the COGCC sued the city over the setback provision as well as additional items, including a restriction on surface drilling in residential areas and a requirement to disclose any hazardous materials transported on the city's roadways.<br />
                <br />
                On November 6, 2012, nearly 60 percent of Longmont voters approved Ballot Question 300 &#8212; amending the Longmont city charter to ban fracking and the storage of fracking waste within city limits. On December 17, 2012, the <a href="http://www.coga.org/">Colorado Oil and Gas Association</a> &#8212; an industry trade association &#8212; filed suit against the city of Longmont, contending the ban is illegal because it denies mineral owners the right to develop their property and blocks operations that state laws allow.<br />
                <br />
                Various local elected officials have suggested it will take changes in state laws and regulations for local governments to be able to use their land use authority to ban drilling within their boundaries. In 1992, the Colorado Supreme Court <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4919168349573350757">overturned</a> the City of Greeley's ban on drilling. That ban was put in place by a city council decision, though, not by a vote of city residents.<br />
                <br />
                Legal defense of the ban will make two sets of arguments. First, times have changed since 1992. Impacts from drilling have increased and the state's ability to regulate and enforce them has decreased. Second, the Colorado state constitution guarantees the right of citizens to vote on matters of local impact &#8212; and that the statutory oil and gas act cannot deny that right. As of this writing, the parties have submitted preliminary change of venue motions and motions to dismiss.<br />
                <br />
                Each level of government must play its part in protecting public health and the environment by regulating the fracking industry. Despite enjoying broad exemptions from crucial federal environmental laws, the federal government has two important roles in this arena. First, it should set a regulatory floor below which no other regulator should fall. Second, the federal government is uniquely well-positioned to tackle environmental problems. Not only does it have a monopoly on resources &#8212; both human and monetary &#8212; but, also, pollution does not respect geopolitical boundaries.<br />
                <br />
                The states also have a critical role to play in oil and gas regulation, often by state agencies dedicated exclusively to that mission. Local governments also enjoy an understanding of energy resources within their borders. Their zoning powers traditionally come from a policy sentiment that locals know best where industry belongs and where it does not.<br />
                <br />
                The oil and gas industry argues in our nation's capitol that agencies closest to drilling regulate best. They oppose federal preemption of state authority. They also support exemptions to our federal environmental laws. But in state capitols, the industry supports laws that allow states to preempt municipal power. They sue local governments over zoning ordinances and attempt to overturn resolutions passed by a democratic vote of the people. </p>

                <p>Either the locals know best, or they don't.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Samantha Peaslee, <a href="http://www.law.du.edu/">University of Denver Strum College of Law</a> Class of 2015, explores the recent lawsuits surrounding fracking in the state of Colorado and how the outcome could impact the oil industry throughout the entire state...<hr height='1'><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size='3'><strong>H</strong></font>ydraulic fracturing, or <a href="/feature/featured/fracking/">fracking</a>, has gained significant media attention over the last few years. Now, it is beginning to gain legal attention as well because of a city called Longmont, Colorado.</p>

<p>Fracking is a <a href="http://www.propublica.org/special/hydraulic-fracturing-national">process</a> use for extracting oil and gas from tight rock formations. A mixture of water, sand and chemicals is pumped thousands of feet underground then pressurized to fracture rock formations &#8212; allowing the release of fossil fuels contained within the rocks. Recently, <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/vermont-becomes-first-state-to-outlaw-fracking.php">detractors</a> have brought fracking into the spotlight, fearing the process may be unsafe by causing air and water pollution. <br />
 	<br />
Colorado citizens are among those concerned about fracking. According to the Colorado Oil and Gas Association (COGA), <a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/news/ci_22215695/longmont-wants-fracking-fight-moved-boulder-county">95% of Colorado's extraction sites have been fracked</a>. Fracking has gone fairly unnoticed in Longmont <a href="http://www.csindy.com/coloradosprings/fracking-questions-bubble-to-surface/Content?oid=2616010">until recently</a> when a company wanted to "put a series of wells next to some homes, a middle school and a reservoir." Now, this city of just 80,000 people is entangled in two lawsuits and is the subject of national scrutiny because of a ban on fracking within the city's limits.  </p>

<p><strong>Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission v. Longmont</strong></p>

<p>The case against Longmont's ban on fracking is preceded by a lesser-known lawsuit that began a few months earlier. In July of 2012, the Longmont city council passed an ordinance that updated its regulations on oil and gas within city limits. <a href="http://www.ci.longmont.co.us/city_council/agendas/2012/documents/071712_8A.pdf">Ordinance O-2012-25</a> [PDF] ("the Ordinance") included a minimum set of standards based on state requirements and recommended <a href="http://rlch.org/blog/2012/16/8/longmont-fracking-regulations-bring-state-vs-local-government-power-debate-surface">tougher standards</a> for companies wishing to operate in Longmont. The Ordinance's tougher standards include an increased setback from occupied structures, more stringent wildlife protections, a drilling ban in existing and planned residential neighborhoods and increased requirements for water-quality testing.  </p>

<p>Almost immediately after the city passed the Ordinance the state's regulating commission for oil and gas, Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC), filed a <a href="http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2012/0730/20120730_051916_Longmont%20Oil%20&%20Gas%20Complaint%207-30-12.pdf">complaint</a> [PDF] against Longmont. COGA, an association of oil and gas companies, soon <a href="http://www.timescall.com/news/longmont-local-news/ci_21762151/newstip">joined the suit</a> as well. In its complaint, COGCC claimed that Longmont had no authority to enforce the Ordinance's rules because the COGCC's authority to regulate oil and gas statewide preempts any local authority.</p>

<p><strong>Colorado Oil and Gas Association v. Longmont</strong></p>

<p>In November 2012, Longmont citizens passed a <a href="http://www.timescall.com/news/election2012/ci_21943036/longmont-fracking-ban-holds-early-lead">voter-initiated fracking ban</a> called <a href="http://www.ci.longmont.co.us/city_council/agendas/2012/documents/082812_9F.pdf">Resolution R-2012-67</a> [PDF] ("the Resolution"). The Resolution originated due to safety concerns over fracking in residential areas and worries that the Ordinance did not sufficiently protect against the dangers of the process.</p>

<p>This time, a lawsuit was not filed immediately after the new restriction passed. Instead, the state debated for nearly a month before publicly announcing that it would not file suit against Longmont regarding the ban. However, Colorado offered to support any private entities that chose to do so. COGA filed its <a href="http://ourlongmont.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/20121218_010338_COGAfiling.pdf">complaint</a> [PDF] almost immediately after the state's announcement. The complaint argued that: (1) the Resolution, like the Ordinance, attempts to regulate technical aspects of oil and gas operations reserved to the state through COGCC and (2) the prohibition on fracking operates as both an illegal <em>de facto</em> ban on oil and gas drilling and an unconstitutional taking of private property without compensation. </p>

<p><strong>State Authority: Should Cities Be Allowed to Ban Fracking?</strong></p>

<p>These cases raise a key question: can Longmont create a ban on fracking using its authority as a "home-rule city" or are city rules for oil and gas preempted by state regulations? Answering this question raises a policy concern about whether a city's ability to ensure the welfare of its citizens trumps a state's interest in creating uniform regulations.</p>

<p>Part of the reason that the local versus state government question is such a heated issue in Colorado in particular is that Colorado is <a href="http://www.mountainlawfirm.com/2012/05/home-rule-municipalities-in-colorado/">home to a number of home-rule cities</a>, including Longmont. Under the <a href="http://www.colorado.gov/dpa/doit/archives/constitution/index.html">Colorado Constitution</a>, home-rule cities are self-governing entities with few exceptions. Longmont argues that fracking regulations do not qualify as one of these exceptions. According to Longmont, a community should be able to <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/dnc/ci_21182917/state-suit-against-longmont-would-be-uncharted-territory">balance</a> the right of mineral rights holders to extract natural resources with the health and safety of other residents. The state, Longmont claims, is too far-removed to appropriately balance these interests.</p>

<p>The state <a href="http://rlch.org/blog/2012/16/8/longmont-fracking-regulations-bring-state-vs-local-government-power-debate-surface">argues</a> that, when natural resources are involved, the state legislature gave COGCC the ultimate right to regulate so that consistent rules exist throughout the state. If each individual city could regulate its oil and gas independently, the state would be fraught with varying and inconsistent guidelines.    </p>

<p>Unfortunately for Longmont, precedent from the Colorado Supreme Court supports the position that COGCC regulations preempt Longmont's opposing position. Two cases were decided by the court on the same day in 1992: <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1656485490155728976">Bd. of County Comm'r, La Plata County v. Bowen/Edwards Assoc., Inc.</a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4919168349573350757">Voss v. Lundvall Bros., Inc.</a> These cases stated that, although legislative intent does not support the COGCC preempting all aspects of local authority, cities cannot ban drilling within their territorial boundaries. COGA claims that fracking bans are effectively bans on drilling because the process is such a crucial part of mineral extraction and, without it, drilling is useless.</p>

<p>Even if the court decides that fracking bans are not <em>de facto</em> bans on drilling, both the COGCC and COGA argue that the bans are still preempted by state regulations. The case of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1068342528203184152">Town of Frederick v. North American Res. Co</a> decided that measures relating to setbacks, noise abatement and visual impacts that go beyond state regulations operationally conflict with the COGCC and are, therefore, preempted by state law. The COGCC and COGA allege that fracking should be considered a preempted aspect of Colorado's oil and gas industry regulations because the city's regulations regarding fracking go beyond state requirements &#8212; similar to the measures above that were previously reserved to states. </p>

<p>Regardless of what happens in court, the Ordinance and the Resolution have done some good; the COGCC is currently looking at <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/09/colorado-to-study-oil-and_n_2441865.html">stricter water quality</a> and setback standards based on those adopted in the Ordinance. However, if the Court rules for the COGCC and COGA, more key concerns are raised for Colorado's other home-rule cities. For example, if <em>Frederick</em> is upheld, cities will have no direct power over the oil and natural gas operations within their boundaries. They would not be able to set standards lower than those imposed by the states, but they would be equally incapable of enforcing regulations stricter than those set by the COGCC. Despite <em>La Plata</em> clearly stating that this was not the legislature's intent, wouldn't such a ruling allow all state oil and gas regulations to preempt local ones? Wouldn't such a result preclude cities from being able to protect the welfare of their citizens, whether it was regarding fracking next to their schools or the protection of local water sources? </p>

<p>But, if cities have the last word, could this case spell the end of fracking in Colorado? Colorado waits with bated breath to learn Longmont's fate &#8212; and possibly that of whole state's oil industry.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Charles Kels of the <a href="http://afreserve.com/">US Air Force Reserve</a> and the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/">Department of Homeland Security</a> argues that legal experts should think twice before diluting the clarity of international armed conflicts...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/charleskels.jpg" width="120" height="200" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he law of armed conflict (LOAC) applies when the threshold of armed conflict is met. Since the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/CONVPRES?OpenView">1949 Geneva Conventions</a>, this triggering mechanism has been relatively straightforward in the case of discord among states, but considerably murkier when it comes to violence that involves non-state entities.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>International v. Non-International Armed Conflicts</strong></p>

                <p><a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebART/365-570005?OpenDocument">Common Article 2</a> of the Geneva Conventions establishes their application to both "cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict" between state parties, regardless of formal recognition by the governments involved. <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/365-570005?OpenDocument">The Commentaries</a> to the Conventions make clear that the general nature of this language was intended to deprive belligerent nations "of the pretexts they might in theory invoke for evasion of their obligations." Indeed, the omnibus term "armed conflict" was deliberately inserted to prevent the endless legal wrangling over the meaning of "war" from excusing noncompliance with the treaties.</p>

                <p><a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebART/365-570006?OpenDocument">Common Article 3</a> also employs the phrase "armed conflict," but does so in the negative, as pertaining to "armed conflict not of an international character." Jean Pictet <a href="https://www.jagcnet.army.mil/DOCLIBS/MILITARYLAWREVIEW.NSF/20a66345129fe3d885256e5b00571830/1cd84e295a7241db85256fdc006b8233/$FILE/Volume183Cullen.pdf">noted</a> [PDF] that the drafters "deliberately refrained from defining" such non-international armed conflicts (NIACs), at least in part due to a lack of consensus. Common Article 3 was <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2029989">revolutionary</a> in making inroads into state sovereignty, necessitating sensitivity to the historical reluctance of governments "to impose international obligations on states in connection with their internal affairs." In order to allay fears that Geneva law would thenceforth regulate "any form of anarchy, rebellion, or even plain banditry," the Commentaries offered some "convenient criteria" for recognizing a NIAC, while also cautioning that they were "in no way obligatory."</p>

                <p>Contemporary observers seemed unconcerned about any resulting ambiguity, given that the "<a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/war-and-law/treaties-customary-law/geneva-conventions/overview-geneva-conventions.htm">mini-Convention</a>" of Common Article 3 merely encapsulates the basic "rules of humanity which are recognized as essential by civilized nations." In this view, there was no incentive for responsible parties not to comply with Common Article 3, since its precepts actually derived their moral and legal force from standards of conduct long predating the Conventions.<br />
                    <br />
                    However, this sense of confidence overlooked two subsequent developments. First, although the triggering provisions of the Geneva Conventions technically applied to those specific treaties alone, they have grown over the decades to define the threshold for the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/LOW-Deskbook-2011.pdf">application of LOAC</a> [PDF] more generally. If anything, this trend has been exacerbated as the customary international law of NIACs has come to <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/612">approximate</a> the rules governing interstate conflicts (IACs). Second, pinning down a definition for NIACs &#8212; although studiously avoided during the Conventions' negotiations &#8212; later became a matter of justiciability before international courts.<br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>The Jurisprudence of NIACs</strong><br />
                    <br />
                    Rejecting a jurisdictional challenge in its inaugural <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/tadic/acdec/en/51002.htm">Tadic</a> case, the appeals chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) famously determined that "an armed conflict exists whenever there is a resort to armed force between states or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a state." This decision simultaneously reiterated the bright line rule for recognizing an IAC and set criteria for classifying a NIAC.<br />
                    <br />
                    Building on this definition, the ICTY <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/tadic/tjug/en/tad-tsj70507JT2-e.pdf">trial chamber</a> [PDF] developed a two-part test for NIACs, based upon "the intensity of the conflict and the organization of the parties to the conflict." The <em>Tadic</em> formulation was then codified in the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a> establishing the jurisdiction of the <a href="/feature/2012/07/international-criminal-court.php">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC). The purpose of these definitional exercises was to delineate the parameters under which international judicial bodies could impose criminal liability on bad actors, but they have taken on a life of their own as the definitive statements on what "armed conflict" means. In so doing, the jurisprudence on NIACs has arguably frustrated the Geneva commentators' <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/365-570006?OpenDocument">premise</a> that Common Article 3 "should be applied as widely as possible."<br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>NIAC Goes Global</strong><br />
                    <br />
                    The debate over NIACs took on heightened importance after 2001, when the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/l/2006/98861.htm">claimed</a> to be engaged in a "global war on terrorism," and then <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/l/releases/remarks/139119.htm">later</a> in an "armed conflict with al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces." Whereas the traditional challenge to international law has been states' steadfast resistance to perceived erosion of their sovereignty &#8212; as manifested by the refusal of besieged governments to acknowledge the existence of a civil war &#8212; the world's lone superpower today <a href="http://www.lawfareblog.com/2012/11/jeh-johnson-speech-at-the-oxford-union/">invokes</a> a transnational NIAC to justify an extensive architecture of targeted killings and indefinite detention.</p>

                <p>Well-meaning scholars and advocates have responded to this claim by emphasizing the dual <em>Tadic</em> elements and <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/14session/A.HRC.14.24.Add6.pdf">insisting</a> [PDF] that outside of "hot" conflict zones, the hostilities with al Qaeda and its associates do not rise to the level of armed conflict. For example, a committee of the International Law Association (ILA), comprised of a veritable all-star cast of legal experts from across the globe, produced a <a href="http://www.ila-hq.org/download.cfm/docid/2176DC63-D268-4133-8989A664754F9F87">report</a> on the "meaning of armed conflict" intended specifically to counter the US narrative of a "global war on terror." The upshot of this view is that the applicable legal regime governing US counter-terrorism activities is not LOAC but human rights law (HRL) &#151 <em>i.e.</em>, the law enforcement paradigm.<br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>An Intensity Test for IACs?</strong></p>

                <p>In explicating the <em>Tadic</em> criteria of intensity and organization, the ILA report downplayed the distinction between IACs and NIACs, citing state practice that ostensibly exhibited an intensity threshold for armed conflict regardless of type. In the same way that NIACs are <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/opinion-paper-armed-conflict.pdf">distinguished</a> [PDF] "from less serious forms of violence, such as internal disturbances and tensions, riots, or acts of banditry," some scholars now seek to <a href="http://www.ila-hq.org/download.cfm/docid/2176DC63-D268-4133-8989A664754F9F87">exclude</a> "incidents, border clashes, and skirmishes" from the purview of IACs.</p>

                <p>This approach contradicts the hard-and-fast rule advocated by Pictet that "any difference arising between two states and leading to the intervention of armed forces" constitutes an IAC, regardless of "how long the conflict lasts, or how much slaughter takes place." Indeed, it runs counter to a close reading of the <em>Tadic</em> appellate decision, which used the word "protracted" only in reference to internal conflicts.</p>

                <p>Applying a NIAC-like intensity evaluation to IACs &#151 beyond the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/irrc-873-vite.pdf">"very low"</a> [PDF] common sense bar that the interstate violence at issue be a function of hostility rather than simple mistake &#8212; deliberately erodes the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/14session/A.HRC.14.24.Add6.pdf">"categorical" test</a> [PDF] that now exists. By exchanging such clarity for the muddle of NIAC classification, the current trend risks encouraging precisely what the Geneva commentators hoped to avoid by divorcing the treaties' application from state pronouncements. The 1949 negotiators knew from whence they spoke: just a decade earlier, imperial Japan had <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=U1UOG-jXs2QC&pg=PT48&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=3#v=onepage&q&f=false">termed</a> its invasion of China a mere "incident" so as to eschew international law.</p>

                <p>The movement to restrict the scope of IACs is symptomatic of an increasing discomfort among some international law circles with the legal framework of war. Such commentators tend to focus on the belligerent privileges afforded by LOAC to "kill without warning" and "detain without trial," rather than its concomitant responsibilities to mitigate <a href="http://lgdata.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/docs/905/472190/St_Petersburg_Declaration.pdf">suffering</a> [PDF] to the extent practicable under circumstances unfathomable in peacetime. They understandably prefer the more humane regime afforded by HRL, whereby lethality is only <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/firearms.htm">condoned</a> "when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life."</p>

                <p>What this approach overlooks is the essential nature of LOAC, which was crafted not to legitimize violence but to regulate it once it broke out. It is undoubtedly a positive sign for humanity if the world is progressively more wary of the types of force authorized in war, but international law also cannot wish such violence away by neglecting to regulate it in practical terms. Doing so would be the equivalent of seeing an assailant coming towards you and putting your head down to disregard the impending disaster.</p>

                <p>Hindering the reach of LOAC in the quintessential case of interstate strife turns Geneva law on its head and courts the <a href="http://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/171554c7-c0e2-40a0-b2b5-101cd4827af5/Concluding-Remarks--LOAC-and-Attempts-to-Abuse-or-">lawlessness</a> [PDF] inherent in a vacuum where the rules for everyday life are neither practicable nor enforceable. The perfect should not be permitted to act as the enemy of the good.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnists Eric Delio and George Thompson, <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu">University of Pittsburgh School of Law</a> Class of 2013, analyze Los Angeles County Flood Control District v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. and its potential impact...<hr height='1'><br /><font size='3'><strong>T</strong></font>he recent US Supreme Court case, <a href="http://www.bloomberglaw.com/document/public/subdoc/1572285719?imagename=OPN92531.PDF">Los Angeles County Flood Control District v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</a> [PDF], presented an issue that stemmed from a factual misunderstanding by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and was not addressed at length in oral argument. However, some of the underlying issues in this case could have important ramifications for the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) in its future legal efforts, as it gained a significant legal victory in the rejection of the "good faith compliance" argument advanced by the Los Angeles County Flood Control District ("the District").</p>

<p>The issue presented in the case was whether water moving from one portion of a river to another, through a man-made channel, could constitute a discharge under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/clean_water_act_cwa">Clean Water Act</a> (CWA). Both the District and NRDC agreed that the answer was "no" based on the holding of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2885126139617306748">S. Florida Water Mgmt. Dist. v. Miccosukee Tribe of Indians</a>. <em>Miccosukee</em> held that there is not an addition, and therefore not a discharge under the CWA, when water is transferred between "two hydrologically indistinguishable parts of a single water body."</p>

<p>Instead, the parties argued about whether pollutant concentrations detected by in-stream mass monitoring stations in the Santa Clara River, the Los Angeles River, the San Gabriel River and Malibu Creek &#8212; which exceeded the water quality standards established in a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit &#8212; could result in liability imposed on the District and whether the District must actually comply with the permit's water quality standards.</p>

<p>The District operates a <a href="http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/munic.cfm">Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System</a> (MS4), which is a network of storm drains and pipes that conveys stormwater runoff to local water bodies. MS4s are owned and operated by public entities, such as cities or counties. MS4s do not transport sewage; however, stormwater runoff can pick up pollutants before entering a storm drain.</p>

<p>MS4s require specialized NPDES permits under section 402(p) of the CWA. Because MS4s can have hundreds of outfalls discharging into various parts of a water body across miles, they are granted area permits. MS4 permittees are subject to the water quality standards of the receiving waters, meaning the terms of the permit establish certain pollutant levels that are not to be exceeded. Exceedances of these standards are generally considered a violation of the CWA.</p>

<p>In the Los Angeles County MS4, monitoring stations are located in concrete-channeled sections of the rivers. NRDC produced data taken from these monitoring stations that indicated that the receiving waters have exceeded their designated water quality standards 140 times over a five year period. NRDC argued that these exceedances should impose liability on the District to correct the violations. However, the District argued that it can't be established that water moving through the MS4 added pollutants to the water bodies. Further, the District argued that its compliance with certain sections of the permit absolved it from complying with water quality standards and instead the District only had to make a good faith effort to comply with the standards.</p>

<p>The district court agreed with NRDC that the District violated the terms of the permit. However, the district court wanted specific evidence "showing that discharges from the District portions of the MS4 are contributing to the exceedances at the mass emissions stations." On appeal, the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/desktop/public/document/Natural_Resources_Defense_Council_Inc_v_County_of_Los_Angeles_No_">agreed</a> with the district court that the exceedances of water quality standards constituted violations of the CWA. Importantly, the Ninth Circuit flatly rejected the District's "good faith" argument. Further, the Ninth Circuit found the District liable, holding that water flowing by the monitoring stations constituted a discharge under the CWA.</p>

<p>However, as the US <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/11-460-CVSG-Brief.pdf">amicus brief</a> [PDF] suggests, the Ninth Circuit's holding reflects a factual misunderstanding of the relationship of the MS4 to the rivers. The brief posits that "the court mistakenly believed that the monitoring stations at issue were sampling water from a portion of the MS4 distinct from the rivers themselves," and not from inside the rivers.</p>

<p>Although the Ninth Circuit's holding was likely the result of its factual misunderstanding, the US Supreme Court granted <em>certiorari</em> to decide whether water moving from one portion of a river to another, through a man-made channel, could constitute a discharge under the CWA. The Court reversed the Ninth Circuit and reaffirmed its holding in <em>Miccosukee</em> that transferring "polluted water between 'two parts of the same water body' does not constitute a discharge of pollutants under the CWA." Accordingly, the District could not be liable for the exceedances detected at the monitoring stations.</p>

<p>The Court's opinion did not resolve the plaintiff's contention that "exceedances detected at the instream monitoring states are by themselves sufficient to establish the District's liability under the CWA for its upstream discharges." However, it remanded that question to the Ninth Circuit, which already decided this question against the NRDC. </p>

<p>Accordingly, at <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-460.pdf">oral argument</a> [PDF], Justice Antonin Scalia asked NRDC's attorney, Aaron Colangelo, to articulate reasons why the Ninth Circuit would answer that question differently on remand. Colangelo suggested that the Ninth Circuit might answer the question differently because "a permit is interpreted like a contract, and it is a cardinal rule of contract interpretation that a contract should be read ... where possible to be both lawful and enforceable." And if the Ninth Circuit does not change its answer, then it "would render [the permit] unenforceable because none of the permittees can be held liable."</p>

<p>Colangelo's answer was apparently persuasive to the Court because it remanded the case to the Ninth Circuit. However, it seems unlikely that the Ninth Circuit will be persuaded by this theory for two reasons. </p>

<p>First, the NRDC is assuming that if the exceedances detected at the mass monitoring stations do not establish a permit violation, then the only other way to prove that the District violated its permit in the pollutant amounts alleged by the NRDC would be to "engage in the Sisyphean task of testing particular storm drains in the County for the source of each pollution." However, the Ninth Circuit previously rejected this assumption, stating: "Contrary to the Plaintiff's contention, [establishing the District's liability] would not require independent sampling of the District's outfalls. Indeed, simply ruling out other contributors of stormwater," or sampling from "'at least one outflow that included a standards-exceeding pollutant'" could satisfy the NRDC's evidentiary burden. Therefore, the Ninth Circuit is unlikely to agree that the permit is unenforceable unless the mass monitoring stations are sufficient to establish the District's liability.</p>

<p>Second, the Ninth Circuit is likely to reject the NRDC's argument because the District is now subject to an updated MS4 permit, which, according to Attorney Colangelo, "adequate[ly]" fixes the alleged defect by requiring new monitoring stations to be placed next to outfalls rather than in the rivers. Accordingly, the Ninth Circuit should be hesitant to hold the District in violation of the old permit based on general contract interpretation principles.</p>

<p>If the Ninth Circuit rules against the NRDC, then it is unclear whether the NRDC will appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. The NRDC has a significant legal victory in the Ninth Circuit's rejection of the District's argument that MS4 permittees only need to make a good faith effort at compliance rather than strictly comply with the water quality standards. So, even though the District would prevail, the NRDC could use the precedent to establish violations under the new permit. The NRDC could also possibly wield the decision to allege violations against other MS4 permittees throughout the US.</p>

<p>However, if the Ninth Circuit agrees with the NRDC, the District will likely appeal the decision. This would finally give the Supreme Court the opportunity to decide whether the CWA requires MS4 permittees to comply with the water quality standards contained in the permits, or whether the permittees only need to make a good faith effort at compliance with its terms.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Miano Maina, an LL.M. candidate from the <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/">University of Pittsburgh School of Law</a> Class of 2013, argues that the High Court of Kenya exceeded its jurisdiction when adjudicating an integrity suit against International Criminal Court indictees Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto...<hr height='1'><br /><font size='3'><strong>O</strong></font>n February 15, 2013, the High Court of Kenya dismissed a <a href="http://kenyalaw.org/CaseSearch/view_preview1.php?link=11903065891756192934559">lawsuit</a> challenging the eligibility of Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto to seek the offices of president and deputy president, respectively, during the upcoming March 4 <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/kenya-presidential-candidates-facing-icc-trial-announce-joint-election-campaign.php">elections</a>. The two are currently facing charges for alleged crimes against humanity at the <a href="/feature/featured/icc/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC).  </p>

<p>The judgment has been hailed by the two major protagonists in the Kenyan elections as politically correct. From the outset, it is important to note that the final outcome of the case was appropriate to the extent that barring Kenyatta and Ruto from running for office at this point in time would amount to disenfranchisement of the electorate. However, the approach of the court in relation to the issues canvassed is wanting and very confusing. In particular, the approach of the court towards the question of jurisdiction and the political question doctrine is hazy. This commentary analyzes the key issues arising from the decision and the approach taken by the High Court of Kenya. </p>

<p>The five-judge bench ultimately ruled that it does not have jurisdiction to deal with the nomination and election of presidential candidates. The High Court ruled that the jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute is vested in the Supreme Court of Kenya. Specifically, <a href="http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=207673#LinkTarget_18814">Article 163(3)</a> of the <a href="http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=207673">Constitution of Kenya</a> vests the Supreme Court with the exclusive, original jurisdiction to hear and determine disputes relating to elections to the office of president:<blockquote>[The] declarations sought boils down to asking the court to make declarations whose ultimate aim would result in the determination of the question, whether Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto are qualified to offer their candidature for the office of President and Deputy President respectively.</blockquote>The court acknowledged the essence of jurisdiction in adjudication of disputes and cited the decision of <a href="http://www.kenyalaw.org/CaseSearch/case_download.php?go=59404408412226646277113&link=">Owners of Motor Vessel "Lillian S" v. Caltex Oil Kenya, Ltd.</a> [PDF] from the Kenyan Court of Appeals:<blockquote>Jurisdiction is everything. Without it, a court has no power to make one step, where a court has no Jurisdiction there would be no basis for a continuation of proceedings pending other evidence and a court of law downs its tools in respect of the matter before it, the moment it holds the opinion that it is without jurisdiction.</blockquote>At this point, one would expect the court to decline to proceed on the substantive merits of the issues. Despite indicating the lack of adjudicatory jurisdiction, the court proceeded to carry out an interesting legal analysis of the substantive merits of the issues &#8212; purportedly exercising its powers under <a href="http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=207673#LinkTarget_18742">Article 165(3)</a>, which vests the High Court with the authority to interpret the constitution. There is a problem with the way the court exercises these powers for two reasons. Initially, in the course of exercising the powers, the court tangentially usurped the powers of the Supreme Court under Article 163(3) &#8212; the very powers it sought not to usurp. Second, in light of the dispute  the court was not the right forum to interpret the constitution. Is the High Court of Kenya the only court with the powers to interpret the constitution? No, the Supreme Court of Kenya <a href="http://kenyalaw.org/CaseSearch/view_preview1.php?link=37641090684212937784064">held</a> that it may take its position as guided by its own interpretation of the constitution. The Supreme Court held that it may, while rendering an advisory opinion under Article 163(6) of the constitution, undertake any necessary constitutional interpretation. By logical analogy and in light of this dispute, the Supreme Court would have been the right forum to interpret <a href="http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=207673#LinkTarget_20982">Chapter Six</a> of the constitution while exercising its powers under Article 163(3).</p>

<p>Postulating a standard of integrity is not an easy venture. The court acknowledged this fact and stated that the public sector is not like the private sector. The enforcement of general standards of ethical conduct or professional responsibilities in the private sector are, by their nature, generally collegial exercises wherein peers must judge the conduct of those within their own group, profession or organization. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, the court embarked on a "journey" to interpret Chapter Six of the constitution. At the beginning of this zealous journey, one imagines that Kenya would get a clear standard on the threshold of integrity; a threshold clothed with predictability and certainty. The court embraced the standard articulated in <a href="http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2012/24.html">Democratic Alliance vs. The President of the Republic of South Africa & Three Others</a>:<blockquote>[F]or purposes of the integrity test in our Constitution, there is no requirement that the behaviour, attribute or conduct in question has to rise to the threshold of criminality. It therefore follows that the fact that a person has not been convicted of a criminal offence is not dispositive of the inquiry whether they lack integrity or not.</blockquote>One gets the impression that the applicable threshold under Chapter Six is lower than that of criminality or, rather, proof beyond reasonable doubt. The court observed that even those aspiring to a state office should be like Caesar's wife: beyond reproach. Conversely, the court later sought to find out the interplay between the <a href="http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=207673#LinkTarget_22280">Bill of Rights</a> and Chapter Six of the constitution. This is quite in order as the constitution should be interpreted as a whole document. Competing interests have to be balanced. The court cited <a href="http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=207673#LinkTarget_21348">Article 50(2)(a)</a> of the constitution which provides that an accused person is presumed innocent until proved guilty. It also cited <a href="http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=207673#LinkTarget_21242">Article 25</a> which provides that the right to a fair hearing cannot be limited or derogated from. So, is proof of guilt the threshold? The court then stated that no evidence was placed before it to show that Kenyatta and Ruto had been imprisoned for more than six months. Is imprisonment for six months the threshold? By carrying out this analysis, isn't the High Court usurping the powers of the Supreme Court and tangentially determining the eligibility of Kenyatta and Ruto to run for the offices of the president and the deputy president, respectively?</p>

<p>The court's approach in characterizing the dispute as justiciable is narrow. A fundamental principle of constitutional law is that a political question is not justiciable. The characterization of a dispute as political or justiciable is, therefore, imperative. An issue whose determination rests with a political department is political in nature and the judiciary should defer the issue to the political department. After citing numerous precedents, the court characterized the dispute as justiciable. However, the court later retracted that determination and held that it should not descend into the arena of inquiring into a candidate's integrity. The court thus held that the institutions tasked with the duty of inquiring in to the integrity of a candidate are the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC). In essence, the court agreed that the issue should be deferred to a political department of the state and is not justiciable. The decision to defer the matter to the IEBC and EACC is legally accurate, but the characterization of the dispute as justiciable is wanting. </p>

<p>The only coherent legal theory the High Court has advanced is the centrality of people in governance. The court acknowledged that the constitution is a living instrument that has a soul and consciousness of its own. The court acknowledged that issues touching on political integrity cannot be considered outside the context of the elections. The Constitution of Kenya makes numerous references to the people of Kenya. <a href="http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=207673#LinkTarget_14057">Article 1</a> provides that all sovereign power belongs to the people of Kenya. This power is exercised through universal suffrage. To bar Kenyatta and Ruto from running for public office two weeks before the election would amount to disenfranchisement of the electorate. </p>

<p>Judges sometimes find themselves in precarious positions. Their decisions may have serious political ramifications. However, they must not allow their analysis to be informed by a disjointed concoction of inconsistent theories. A good lawyer preparing for a case will have a theory for every stage while prosecuting his claim. Such theories may not be consistent and lawyers sometimes postulate theories on a "without prejudice" basis. Judges should not adopt these theories without carrying out an adequate legal analysis. Judges must not rush to be efficient at the expense of developing the law. The tumultuous "journey" of the High Court in this case only operates to crowd the competing jurisprudence between the High Court and the Supreme Court of Kenya in the exercise of the powers conferred to them by the Constitution of Kenya. <br />

The best exams, I think, test students' understanding not just of the governing rules, but the legal rationales that drive them. And it's no secret that in devising hypothetical questions for exams, professors often turn to potential scenarios that they've otherwise been mulling: scenarios that present tricky issues forcing the better students to dig beneath the surface. Often, these exam issues are drawn from pending or recent cases.<br />
 <br />
And sometimes, the cases &#8212; like the Supreme Court's <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/supreme-court-to-rule-on-campaign-finance-case.php">decision</a> last week to hear <em>McCutcheon v. FEC</em> &#8212; are drawn from the exams.</p>

<p>In May 2011, I asked the following question on my election law exam:<blockquote>Federal law imposes aggregate limits on individual campaign contributions over a two-year period. Individuals may not contribute more than $46,200 (total) to federal candidates, with no more than $2,500 to any single candidate. (These limits pertain to contributions to federal candidates only, and do not include separate limits on the aggregate amounts that individuals may give to PACs and political parties.)<br />
 <br />
Clark Tuckerberg is a social media entrepreneur and multi-billionaire. He has "friended" more than 200 members of Congress and more than 30 US Senators on Facebook &#8212; and he would like to demonstrate that, to him, "friending" is a real commitment. He acknowledges that he may not give more than $2,500 to any single candidate. However, he would like to give $2,500 to each of the candidates that he has "friended," which would put him well over the aggregate limit.<br />
 <br />
Tuckerberg files suit, challenging the aggregate $46,200 limit on contributions to federal candidates, under the First Amendment. He does not challenge either the $2,500 limit on contributions to any individual candidate or any limits on contributions to parties or PACs.<br />
 <br />
You are clerking for the judge assigned to hear the case.<br />
 <br />
The judge acknowledges that the Supreme Court addressed the issue of aggregate contribution limits in six short sentences of <a href="/feature/2012/12/us-campaign-finance.php#buckley">Buckley v. Valeo</a>. Yet with a twinkle in her eye, she suggests that the Court's recent stance toward campaign finance precedent suggests that it may be unwise to rely solely on six cursory sentences of a thirty-year-old opinion. She cautions that she has no view on whether the limit is constitutional or not. But she would like you to analyze the issue as an original matter, without relying on the cursory treatment of the issue in Buckley.<br />
 <br />
Evaluate whether Tuckerberg's challenge to the aggregate $46,200 contribution limit is likely to succeed, and why.</blockquote>On August 31, 2012, real-live Virginia James stepped into the shoes of my entirely fictional Clark Tuckerberg. In her complaint, captioned as <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15158621931791430699">James v. FEC</a>, she challenged the same aggregate contribution limit that Tuckerberg resented. <br />
 <br />
On Halloween last year, the US District Court for the District of Columbia rejected James' challenge, in an opinion with far more meat than the limited treatment that the issue received in <em>Buckley</em>. The court's opinion turned largely on the role of the aggregate limit in stemming corruption arising out of candidates' transfers to each other. That same issue was at the heart of a companion case, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11141749683757049381">McCutcheon v. FEC</a>, challenging the aggregate limit on giving not only to candidates, but also to political action committees (PACs) and parties; <em>McCutcheon</em> was filed two months before <em>James</em> and was decided &#8212; upholding the limit &#8212; at the end of September. <br />
 <br />
Under an unusual procedure <a href="http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&handle=hein.journals/umijlr30&div=9&id=&page=">largely reserved</a> at this point for election-related cases, <em>McCutcheon</em> was heard by a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2284">three-judge federal trial court</a>, the decisions of which are appealed directly to the Supreme Court. This appeal is an appeal by right, not a request for <em>certiorari</em>: the decision can be summarily affirmed or summarily reversed, or the court may hear argument and write more extensively. But, much like my students, the Court cannot chose to avoid the issue entirely.<br />
 <br />
On Tuesday, the Court agreed to hear more from the parties on <em>McCutcheon</em>, which likely means a more extensive decision. Professor Rick Hasen <a href="http://electionlawblog.org/?p=47428">rightly notes</a> that this is a significant step &#8212; and the blogosphere is <a href="http://electionlawblog.org/?p=47461">on</a> <a href="http://electionlawblog.org/?p=47432">fire</a> with predictable predictions that the Court is poised to upend campaign finance law once again. But I think the real significance may be different than the primary chatter indicates. And I think much will depend on the other shoe, yet to drop: what happens to <em>James</em>.<br />
 <br />
Hasen, and plenty of others, have correctly noted that in reviewing <em>McCutcheon</em>, it is possible that the Court will revisit its approach to the constitutionality of contribution limits more generally: a wholesale change to the basic rules of the game. Certainly, the Court has, in the past, taken small cases and turned them into big ones. But not every tremor portends a Vesuvius.<br />
 <br />
Revising the overall approach to contributions is in no way necessary to deal with the issue in <em>McCutcheon</em>. Currently, the Court looks much more closely at limits on expenditures (which involve direct payments for expression) than at limits on contributions (which involve expression only by proxy). But even though looking at the justification for contribution limits involves reading glasses and not an electron microscope, a review with reading glasses is still meaningful. It is entirely possible for the Court to take a firm look at the contribution limits in <em>McCutcheon</em> without upping the general prescription.</p>

<p>Similarly, Hasen notes that reviewing <em>McCutcheon</em> involves a review of part of the landmark <em>Buckley v. Valeo</em> case. But as I suggested in my exam, the aggregate limits are a part of the case that got little attention from the Court at the time: six sentences of 294 total pages. There are many ways in which the Court could address the constitutionality of the aggregate limits, including the justification for those limits, that leave intact the essential <em>Buckley</em> "settlement": a harder look at limits on expenditures than contributions and ample reasons to limit contributions in order to prevent corruption. Even though the issue in <em>McCutcheon</em> was addressed by the <em>Buckley</em> Court, there is no reason that a finding for the plaintiffs has to amount to an unraveling of <em>Buckley</em> more broadly.<br />
 <br />
Instead, the real significance of the case may come with a decision whether to hear <em>James</em> at the same time. <em>James</em> is about contributions to candidates, and the potential for one donor to corrupt candidate X by contributing amounts that are individually unsuspicious to 20 other candidates, all of whom give chunks of that cash over to X. <em>McCutcheon</em> concerns candidates as well, but adds the complicating factors of party committees and PACs &#8212; artificial entities that can be formed at will, each of which can receive more money per person, and for whom there may be significantly more reason to act as a conduit. There are far more reasons for Congress to be concerned about contributions to parties and PACs &#8212; and for the Court to credit those concerns &#8212; than for it to regulate Tuckerberg's contributions to his "friends." But it is easier to lose sight of the most significant elements in <em>McCutcheon</em> if <em>James</em> is not also before the Court to focus attention on the distinct roles that PACs and parties play.<br />
 <br />
The Court has not yet decided what to do with <em>James</em>: whether to hold it, address it summarily or hear it with <em>McCutcheon</em>. Its decision could well signal what aspects of the case have drawn the Court's attention.<br />
 <br />
It's one exam answer that should be particularly interesting to grade. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.independent.org/aboutus/person_detail.asp?id=739">Don Kates</a> of The Independent Institute says that empirical evidence has shown that gun bans are not only ineffective at reducing violent crime, but may even be counterproductive...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/donkates.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3">I</font>n 2004, the National Academy of Sciences reviewed 253 journal articles, 99 books, 43 government publications and some empirical research of its own about guns. The Academy <a href="http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309091241">could not identify</a> any gun restriction that had reduced violent crime, suicide or gun accidents.</p>

<p>Why don't gun bans work? Because they rely on voluntary compliance by gun-using criminals. Prohibitionists never see this absurdity because they deceive themselves into thinking that, as Katherine Christoffel has <a href="http://www.pediatricsdigest.mobi/content/88/2/294.abstract">said</a>: "[M]ost shootings are not committed by felons or mentally ill people, but are acts of passion that are committed using a handgun that is owned for home protection." </p>

<p>Christoffel, <em>et al</em>., are utterly wrong. The whole corpus of criminological research dating back to the 1890's <a href="http://www.saf.org/LawReviews/Elliott1.htm">shows</a> murderers "almost uniformly have a long history of involvement in criminal behavior," and that "[v]irtually all" murderers and other gun criminals have prior felony records &#8212; generally long ones.</p>

<p>While only 15 percent of Americans have criminal records, roughly <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=onazHNIEopEC&pg=PA20">90 percent</a> of adult murderers have prior adult records &#8212; exclusive of their often extensive juvenile records &#8212; with crime careers of six or more adult years including four major felonies. Gerald D. Robin, writing for the Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=RN4PAQAAMAAJ&q=%22the+average+murderer%22#search_anchor">notes</a> that, unlike ordinary gun owners, "the average murderer turns out to be no less hardened a criminal than the average robber or burglar."</p>

<p>Throughout this essay I highlight dramatic recantations by criminologists who previously endorsed stringent gun control. For example, Professor David Mustard has stated in an <a href="http://www.terry.uga.edu/~mustard/culture-data.pdf">article</a> [PDF] for the <em>University of Pennsylvania Law Review</em>:<blockquote>When I started my research on guns [at the University of Chicago] in 1995, I passionately disliked firearms and fully accepted the conventional wisdom that increasing the gun-ownership rate would necessarily raise violent crime and accidental deaths. My views on this subject were formed primarily by media accounts of firearms, which unknowingly to me systematically emphasized the costs of firearms while virtually ignoring their benefits. I thought it obvious that passing laws that permitted law-abiding citizens to carry concealed weapons would create many problems. It is now over six years since I became convinced otherwise and concluded that shall issue laws &#8212; laws that require [gun carry permits] to be granted unless the applicant has a criminal record or a history of significant mental illness &#8212; reduce violent crime and have no impact on accidental deaths.</blockquote>Actual research results &#8212; as opposed to unsupported opinions &#8212; pose a question embarrassed gun prohibitionists invariably try to evade: why ban guns to ordinary owners, <em>i.e.</em>, people who never commit gun crimes? (This query does not at all impugn our laws against previously convicted felons having guns).</p>

<p><strong>How About Police Protection?</strong></p>

<p>Misinformed people oppose self-defense objections to gun ban laws, urging victims to instead rely on police. This misunderstands what policing is and does. Accordingly, when criminals rob or injure them, misinformed victims try to sue the police for not protecting them. Whereupon the police send forth lawyers invoking the universal US rule that the police duty is to discourage crime only indirectly by patrolling the streets and by apprehending criminals after their crimes.</p>

<p>While police should stop crimes they observe, criminals take care to strike when police are not present. In fact, police almost never (less than 3 percent of cases) arrive in time to help victims. For that reason, the statutory or common law of every state exonerates police from suit for non-protection, e.g. California Government Code &#167;&#167; <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&group=00001-01000&file=820-823">821</a>, <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&group=00001-01000&file=844-846">845</a> and <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&group=00001-01000&file=844-846">846</a>: "[A police department and its officers are] not liable for an injury caused by ... failure to enforce an enactment [nor for] failure to provide police protection service or ... provide sufficient police protection service [nor for] the failure to make an arrest or [the] failure to retain an arrested person in custody."</p>

<p>Misinformed persons also urge victims to depend on restraining orders instead of self-defense. But restraining orders are just pieces of paper. A five-year <a href="http://njiai.org/homicide.pdf">study</a> [PDF] in Massachusetts found that almost 25 percent of domestic murderers were under a restraining order when they killed.<br />
 <br />
<strong>Armed Self-Defense</strong></p>

<p>Firearms are unique among weapons: only they allow weaker persons to resist predation by stronger ones. Analyst Linda Gorman <a href="http://forum.ra.utk.edu/Archives/PDF/15.4.pdf">writes</a> [PDF]: <blockquote>Reliable, durable, and easy to operate, modern firearms are the most effective means of self-defense ever devised. They require minimal maintenance and, unlike knives and other weapons, do not depend on an individual's physical strength for their effectiveness. <em>Only a gun can allow a 110 pound woman to defend herself against a 200 pound man</em>. (emphasis added)</blockquote>Empirical evidence <a href="http://www.davekopel.com/2A/LawRev/The-Human-Right-of-Self-Defense.pdf">establishes</a> [PDF]: (1) "[F]irearms are used over half a million times a year against home invasion burglars; usually the burglar flees as soon as he finds out that the victim is armed, and no shot is ever fired[;]" (2) Annually, three to six times as many victims <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=onazHNIEopEC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA215#v=onepage&q&f=false">successfully defend</a> themselves with handguns as criminals misuse handguns (thus handguns do up to six times more good than harm); and (3) "Resistance with a gun appears to be the most effective [response to criminal attack] in preventing serious injury [to victims, and] for preventing property loss[.]" (The above statements are shown in an <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-9125.2004.tb00539.x/abstract">article</a> by Jongyeon Tark and Gary Kleck, and further supported in <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235200000519">another study</a> by Lawrence Southwick).</p>

<p>Evaluating such studies prompted a <a href="http://www.saf.org/LawReviews/Wolfgang1.html">dramatic recantation</a> from Professor Marvin Wolfgang, the <em>doyen</em> of American criminologists:<blockquote>I am as strong a gun control advocate as can be found among the criminologists in this country. If I [had the power] ... I would eliminate all guns from the civilian population and maybe even from the police. <em>I hate guns</em>. ... [But] I cannot further debate it. ... I do not like their conclusions that having a gun can be useful, but I cannot fault [the study's] methodology. They have tried earnestly to meet all objections in advance and have done exceedingly well. (emphasis added)</blockquote><strong>Blind Faith in Lieu of Facts</strong></p>

<p>The idea of confiscating all guns gained spurious credence in the 1960's. But as Frank Zimring, the nation's preeminent academic gun control advocate, has admitted, the controversy began:<blockquote>[I]n a factual vaccuum [in which] neither side felt any great need for factual support to buttress foregone conclusions. <em>In the 1960's, there was literally no scholarship on the relationship between guns and the incidence or consequences of interpersonal violence and no work in progress</em>. (emphasis added)</blockquote> Zimring has nevertheless remained a firm advocate of gun bans. But actual research has produced an unbroken record of recantations by criminologists who once agreed with Zimring. In the late 1970's the US Department of Justice (DOJ) funded and tasked the University of Massachusetts' Social and Demographic Research Institute to review and evaluate the entire extant literature on gun control in the US and elsewhere. The Institute's resulting <a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/AbstractDB/AbstractDBDetails.aspx?id=80455">report</a> observed: "It is commonly hypothesized that much criminal violence, especially homicide, occurs simply because the means of lethal violence (firearms) are readily at hand, and, thus, that much homicide would not occur were firearms generally less available. <em>There is no persuasive evidence that supports this view</em>." (emphasis added)</p>

<p>That evaluation's authors &#8212; Professors James Wright, Peter Rossi and Kathleen Daly &#8212; subsequently published a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=GfCMJgliyugC">commercial version</a> of their report to which they added their personal recantation:<blockquote>The progressive's indictment of American firearms policy is well known and is one that both the senior authors of this study once shared. This indictment includes the following particulars: (1) Guns are involved in an astonishing number of crimes in this country. (2) In other countries with stricter firearms laws and fewer guns in private hands, gun crime is rare ... (4) Many families acquire a gun because they feel the need to protect themselves; eventually, they end up shooting one another. (5) If there were fewer guns around, there would obviously be less crime ... <em>The more deeply we explored the empirical implications of this indictment, the less plausible it has become</em>. (emphasis, parentheses added)</blockquote> </p>

<p>For Wright's later thoughts on the subject, see his <a href="http://www.nationalaffairs.com/public_interest/detail/second-thoughts-about-gun-control">article</a> titled "Second Thoughts About Gun Control."</p>

Aichele</a> talks about a "dangerous precedent which permits the government too much freedom to hide their activities from the public's view," it means the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit's decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5239262368785218017">Beacon Journal Publishing Co., Inc. v. Blackwell</a>. The Sixth Circuit permits the press inside Ohio polling places. The Third Circuit, on the other hand, shuts the door on the press, permitting the government to hold the press at bay ten feet from Pennsylvania polling places. In the process, the Third Circuit also slams the door on logic. It is the Third Circuit that sets a "dangerous precedent which permits the government too much freedom to hide their activities from the public's view," not the Sixth Circuit!</p>

<p>On January 15, 2013, the Third Circuit upheld dismissal of the <em>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</em>'s lawsuit challenging the <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/LI/CT/HTM/25/25.HTM">Pennsylvania Election Code</a>, which reads:<blockquote>All persons, except election officers, clerks, machine inspectors, overseers, watchers, persons in the course of voting, persons lawfully giving assistance to voters, and peace and police officers ... must remain at least ten (10) feet distant from the polling place during the progress of the voting.</blockquote></p>

<p>The newspaper argued that reporting from inside polling places was particularly important on November 6, 2012, because that was the first time for use of <a href="/feature/2012/10/us-voting-rights.php#voterid">Pennsylvania's "Voter ID Law."</a> The election, however, was a "soft test" of the law, with election officials requesting but not requiring photo ID. What could possibly go wrong with the first-time use of the "Voter ID Law"? The <em>Post-Gazette</em> wanted to know, from inside polling places.</p>

<p>The newspaper brought a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/First_amendment">First Amendment</a> claim that the law infringed its "right to access and gather news at polling places." Relying on <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12745677593961169991">Burson v. Freeman</a>, which upheld Tennessee's law to restrict campaigning within 100 feet of polling places, the district court <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13111703107931065617">ruled</a> the 10-foot rule was a "[content]-neutral law of general application seeking to protect an individual's 'right to cast a ballot in an election free from the taint of intimidation and fraud.'"</p>

<p>The newspaper ran headlong into well-established law that the First Amendment gives no "special access" to the press (<em>e.g.</em>, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4925628464386229970">Pell v. Procunier</a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11598860258825518787">Branzburg v. Hayes</a>). The Third Circuit applied a two-prong "experience and logic" test, saying that "[b]y applying the experience and logic test, we ensure that the government cannot shroud its activities behind a veil of secrecy merely by banning everyone from a nonpublic forum."</p>

<p>For the "experience prong," the court considers "whether a tradition of openness exists for the polling place and the process of voting occurring inside." Recapitulating <em>Burson</em>'s historical analysis, the Third Circuit notes the evolution from voice voting to secret voting. For 75 years, <a href="http://sites.state.pa.us/PA_Constitution.html">Pennsylvania's Constitution</a> has mandated that "secrecy in voting be preserved." History thus demonstrates a "long-standing trend away from openness, toward a closed electoral process." Here the Third Circuit appears to go off the tracks: Secrecy of voting must be secure, but that is different from secrecy of the screening process for getting to vote. Arguably, the court makes a categorical mistake, conflating the act of voting with the government's screening of those who want to vote. The Pennsylvania Election Code provides for "watchers," and they apparently do not violate the secrecy provision of the Pennsylvania Constitution.</p>

<p>Under the "logic" prong of the test, the Third Circuit looks at both the "broad 'values'" that openness serves as well as the "negative effects of openness[.]" The Third Circuit says something that sounds promising for access, quoting from <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10183527771703896207">N.Y. Times Co. v. Sullivan</a>: "[W]e begin by noting the rather obvious fact that openness of the voting process helps prevent election fraud, voter intimidation, and various other kinds of electoral evils. '[S]unlight... is the most powerful of all disinfectants.'" However, the court continues:<blockquote>Of course, in situations where the press is not geographically far removed from the proceedings anyway, the benefits of additional oversight are inversely proportional to the distance of the press. The situation in Pennsylvania is a fine example: The press (like the general public) is only ten feet away from the polling place, and we have no tangible or discernible evidence of how the public good would benefit so much more from the press being inside the room, rather than several paces away.</blockquote>What? Does the court really perceive no difference between being inside a room and being "several paces away" and outside that room?</p>

<p>In a footnote, the court says: "At oral argument it became apparent that the press could simply stand at the 10-foot mark, point their cameras inside the polling place, which we note again is just the room designated for voting, and begin to record the activity." According to the court, the newspaper "had no satisfactory response as to how or why this procedure would not serve [its] interest."</p>

<p>How does this recording from ten feet away, pointing cameras "inside" work? Is the door kept open in November? Here is the problem: Although the press is not "geographically far removed," there is a wall between the press and the persons checking the photo ID, even if there is an open door. Unless the reporters get to arrange the furniture, the photo ID checking might very well be out of the line of vision from ten feet outside the polling place. </p>

<p>The flawed logic could be called "separated but equal." The press has been separated from the activity, but being close by is equal to being there, the Third Circuit seems to be saying.</p>

<p>The empirical question is this: Is that sign-in table visible at ten feet from the polling place? No requirement on table placement appears in the law. </p>

<p>Looking at the negative side of openness, the court fears opening the floodgates: "The experience and logic test requires that we also examine the potential dangers inherent in openness. Of greatest concern to us is that access for one is access for all." The court asks: "Who is a member of the press? ... [T]he class of persons to whom such a right is applicable is almost boundless." The court notes: "Access to blogs, smartphones, and an extensive network of social media sites (not the least of which are Twitter and Facebook) have transformed all of us into potential members of the media." The court also worries about "the confusion and chaos that would result from a potentially limitless number of reporters in a polling place." </p>

<p>And then there is the privacy concern: "[A] very real possibility that the presence of reporters during the sign-in period, when individuals are necessarily exchanging personal information..., could concern, intimidate or even turn away potential voters."</p>

<p>Bottom line: the Third Circuit found that both prongs of the "experience and logic" test militated against a right of press access to polling places.</p>

<p>The Third Circuit refused to adopt the Sixth Circuit decision in <em>Beacon Journal</em>, giving reporters access to polling places so long as they did not interfere with poll workers or voters. Mistakenly, according to the Third Circuit, the Sixth Circuit had applied a forum analysis, but polling places are not public forums:<blockquote>As we have just held: a polling place is a nonpublic forum, requiring the government to satisfy only a reasonableness analysis. Therein lies our discord with the <em>Beacon Journal</em> ruling.... [A]dopting a traditional forum analysis for cases such as the one at bar sets a dangerous precedent which permits the government too much freedom to hide their activities from the public's view. We cannot accept this result. <em>Beacon Journal</em> is a precedent we cannot follow.</blockquote><a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/strict_scrutiny">Strict scrutiny</a> requires a compelling interest and narrow tailoring. It is a hard test to meet. It is the test the Sixth Circuit required. The "reasonableness analysis" the Third Circuit uses is a much weaker standard. So the Sixth Circuit demands a rigorous standard, the Third Circuit demands a weak standard. Then the Third Circuit says that the Sixth Circuit "permits the government too much freedom to hide their activities from the public's view." What? It is the Sixth Circuit that opens up the process and the Third Circuit that closes the door on press access. Yet the Third Circuit opines that the Sixth Circuit is setting a "dangerous precedent which permits the government too much freedom to hide their activities from the public's view."</p>

<p>Whether the Sixth Circuit should have treated a polling place as a public forum is not the issue here. The Third Circuit analysis appears correct that polling places are not public forums. The issue is the Third Circuit's statement that the Sixth Circuit is setting a "dangerous precedent" by applying a public forum analysis because that gives government "too much freedom to hide their activities."</p>

<p>Does keeping the press outside prevent the government from hiding its activities?</p>

<p>Look at the results. Where is the dangerous precedent? The Sixth Circuit does not let the government have its freedom. It opens polling places. The Third Circuit gives the government its freedom and deprives the press of freedom to observe election sign-ins.</p>

<p>As Humpty Dumpty said: "It means just what I choose it to mean." </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Nicolas Parke, <a href="http://www.law.ttu.edu/">Texas Tech University School of Law</a> Class of 2013, discusses the ongoing debate about hydraulic fracturing...<hr height='1'><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size='3'><strong>F</strong></font>racking, fracing, or fraccing? Regardless of how you spell it, "<a href="/feature/2013/02/fracking.php">fracking</a>" is a word that more and more Americans are adding to their vocabulary. While many have heard of fracking, few truly understand the actual process of fracking: the scientific process of actually injecting fluids at high pressure into rock formations for the purpose of extracting fossil fuels. The negative perceptions of fracking, including the consequence of <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/12/tap-water-catches-fire-methane-debby-jason-kline_n_2462981.html">tap water catching on fire</a> when a match is lit near the faucet, have caused many opponents to call for an all-out ban on fracking operations across the country. Instead of advocating for polar stances on the issue of fracking, both sides should pursue efficient regulations that target where fracking has the potential to adversely affect the environment. </p>

<p>Before anyone can argue for or against hydraulic fracturing, it is crucial to understand the process of fracking. Fracking is the process of putting extreme pressure on a rock formation with the intent of cracking it. Fracking is not a new technology. Drilling companies utilized fracking as early as the 1940's and the crudest form of fracking &#8212; sticking explosives down a well to increase rock permeability &#8212; was a prevalent practice much earlier. Typically, fracking jobs consist of combining large amounts of water with sand and chemicals &#8212; also known as fracking fluid &#8212; that are pumped down the well and pressurized to cause fissures in the rock. The fracking fluid is then pumped into these fissures in order to lodge sand in the fissures to hold them open once the pumping stops and the water flows back up the well. Fracking transforms otherwise impermeable rock into permeable rock capable of allowing oil and natural gas to flow freely towards the well.  </p>

<p>The image of a man lighting a match and igniting the running faucet in his kitchen makes for good television and should be a cause for concern for any person watching. When people attack fracking for its potential to contaminate groundwater, many point to such scenes in documentaries like <em>Gasland</em> as proof of the harm caused by fracking. The theory advanced by documentaries such as <em>Gasland</em> is that the fissures caused by fracking allow natural gas and chemicals in the fracking fluid to flow naturally up into the groundwater aquifer thousands of feet above the drilling formation. These documentaries, however fail to discuss that natural gas was present in the water before any drilling company began fracking. Many groundwater aquifers naturally contain some levels of natural gases, specifically methane. Thus, it is likely that even if fracking had never occurred in the area where <em>Gasland</em> was filmed, the tap water in the region could still be flammable. The real perplexing question is why oil companies have failed to educate people about this fact. What makes it worse is that a solution is readily available. The logical thing for oil companies to do is taking steps to ensure that local groundwater wells are properly vented before they begin any fracking operations in the area. This would not only reduce the perceived danger associated with fracking, but would also generate good publicity for an industry still recovering from recent catastrophes, such as the <a href="http://response.restoration.noaa.gov/deepwaterhorizon">Deepwater Horizon</a>.  </p>

<p>While dramatic scenes of water catching on fire probably score opponents of fracking cheap points with the public, it detracts attention away from where the actual concern with fracking should rest. The biggest threat fracking poses to groundwater comes not from the actual fracking of a rock formation thousands of feet underground, but, instead, from drilling companies improperly casing and sealing wells. Specifically, casing refers to inserting a large-diameter pipe into a recently dug well and typically involves anchoring the pipe in cement. This process provides extra protection to prevent fracking fluid and fossil fuels from escaping into an aquifer as it travels up and down the well. If this process is done correctly, the threat to groundwater is minimal. However, like any booming industry, the desire to drill and start producing quickly presents the opportunity for drilling companies to take ill-advised short cuts, including not ensuring that groundwater aquifers are sufficiently sealed off from the well. While this is no doubt a serious concern, negligent operations are hardly a new phenomenon for any industry experiencing a historic boom. The key is not banning fracking altogether &#8212; as some environmental groups suggest &#8212; but, rather, enacting effective regulations that will deter oil companies from taking advantage of any short cuts. Recently, these issues of casing and sealing wells have been finding their way into the US legal system. In <a href="http://dockets.justia.com/docket/pennsylvania/pamdce/3:2012cv00898/89377/">Roth v. Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.</a>, the plaintiffs in the case are alleging that improper casing of a well led to natural gas migrating up the well and into the local groundwater. </p>

<p>Governmental agencies and officials have been searching for a solution to these allegations of fracking operations contaminating groundwater. One promising <a href="http://water.epa.gov/type/groundwater/uic/class2/hydraulicfracturing/upload/designandrationaleforafieldexperimentusingtracersinhffluid.pdf">regulation</a> [PDF] involves the inclusion of tracers in fracking fluids. Tracers are non-toxic, magnetic compounds that scientists can uniquely identify even in large quantities of water. The promising potential of including tracers is that it has the potential to solve the problem of accountability. Currently, lawsuits against an oil company alleging that fracking caused groundwater contamination are typically dismissed because they cannot prove a link showing that fracking operations caused the contamination. The addition of a unique tracer compound would allow those filing suit to prove that the contamination came from a particular drilling company. Consequently, drilling companies would be more inclined to make sure that proper casing and cementing rules were followed to protect groundwater aquifers. Further, the costs associated with including a tracer are minimal, and thus, ensuring that oil companies are not burdened with onerous and ineffective regulations. Therefore, tracers provide an example of a way to regulate fracking in a safe manner while still allowing oil companies and the public to realize the many benefits provided by fracking.</p>

<p>Another positive regulation involves requiring drilling companies to disclose the chemical proppants that they use in their fracking fluid. Texas recently enacted <a href="http://info.sos.state.tx.us/pls/pub/readtac$ext.TacPage?sl=T&app=9&p_dir=P&p_rloc=155935&p_tloc=14603&p_ploc=1&pg=4&p_tac=&ti=16&pt=&ch=3&rl=30">Statewide Rule 29</a>, which requires companies utilizing hydraulic fracturing to disclose the chemicals they add to their fracking fluid online at <a href="http://fracfocus.org/">fracfocus.org</a>. Like the use of tracers, disclosing these chemicals allow interested parties to have knowledge of what they should watch out for in groundwater should it ever become contaminated. Furthermore, the cost associated with disclosing such information is minimal. </p>

<p>While environmental concerns are always present when oil and gas operations occur, fracking has received an unwarranted bad reputation. Neither proponents nor opponents of fracking have focused on educating the public on what fracking actually entails. It is true that fracking does pose some environmental risks, but smart governmental regulation can mitigate the harms while still allowing everyone to benefit from the increased domestic energy supply provided by fracking operations. </p>

		<title>Challenges to Michigan&amp;apos;s Right-to-Work Laws</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.umich.edu/FacultyBio/Pages/FacultyBio.aspx?FacID=tstanton">Theodore J. St. Antoine</a> of the University of Michigan Law School says that although Michigan's right-to-work laws raise several constitutional issues and were adopted under unusual circumstances, the courts will likely uphold the core provisions prohibiting the union shop....<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/theodore_st_antoine.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>ne may believe, as I do, that so-called "right-to-work" laws have little to do with protecting workers' claims to jobs and almost everything to do with impeding a union's capacity to represent working people effectively. Even so, it is an entirely different question whether the new Michigan right-to-work legislation is legally vulnerable to the various court actions that have been filed to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/michigan-labor-groups-file-federal-lawsuit-against-right-to-work-law.php">challenge</a> it.<br />
	<br />
A right-to-work law prohibits a union and an employer from entering into a "union shop" agreement that requires employees to join the union or pay dues or fees to the union as a condition for keeping a job. Under federal law, which governs most private businesses of any significant size, only a union that has the majority support of the employees in a plant or other bargaining unit can lawfully obtain such a "union shop" agreement. </p>

<p>Federal law only permits a union to enforce the payment of what union supporters call the individual worker's "fair share" of the union's costs of representing all the employees in the bargaining unit, members and nonmembers alike.  Employees cannot be required to become union members and subject themselves to union rules like, for example, having to honor a picket line during a strike. As a practical matter, state right-to-work laws are primarily concerned with the payment of dues and fees, not union membership as such. </p>

<p>Under the doctrine of federal preemption, the regulation of labor relations by federal law would ordinarily preclude most state intrusions. But a compromise was reached when Congress adopted the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/141">Taft-Hartley Act</a> in 1947, which amended the <a href="http://www.nlrb.gov/national-labor-relations-act">National Labor Relations Act</a> (NLRA). <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/164">Section 14(b)</a> of the NLRA expressly authorizes the states to prohibit agreements requiring union "membership" as a condition of employment. "Membership" here has been interpreted to include the payments of dues and fees, and states are allowed to prohibit that requirement as well.</p>

<p>Labor relations in the public sector dealing with state or municipal employees are generally not covered by federal law. They are subject to state law, limited by certain federal constitutional limitations like <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment">freedom of speech and assembly</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">equal protection of the law</a>.</p>

<p>Michigan's new right-to-work legislation consists of two different statutes, <a href="http://legislature.mi.gov/doc.aspx?2011-SB-0116">Act 348</a> dealing with the private sector and <a href="http://legislature.mi.gov/doc.aspx?2011-HB-4003">Act 349</a> dealing with the public sector. The Michigan State AFL-CIO and the Michigan State Building Trades Council have challenged the validity of Act 348 in federal district court. The ACLU, the State AFL-CIO, the State Building Trades Council and other union representatives have <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/aclu-files-lawsuit-challenging-michigan-right-to-work-law.php">challenged</a> both Acts in state court. </p>

<p>Neither court action contests the capacity of the state legislature to enact traditional right-to-work legislation prohibiting the standard union-shop agreement requiring union membership or the payment of dues and fees to a union as a condition of employment. The state court complaint did underline the "highly controversial" nature of the legislation, but the emphasis was on the procedures followed and the unusual circumstances on the day the two statutes were adopted.</p>

<p>Contrary to normal practice, the Michigan Senate and House of Representative took up the right-to-work bills in a "lame-duck" session in early December 2012 without the usual preliminary committee hearings and an opportunity for public comment. On the day the bills were debated and voted on, large crowds <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/11/us-usa-unions-michigan-idUSBRE8B91AJ20121211">descended</a> upon the Michigan State Capitol. Rightly or wrongly, legislative authorities considered the situation dangerous and ordered the building closed and locked &#8212; preventing access by members of the public who wished to enter. The building was reopened pursuant to a court order more than four hours later. In the meantime debates and voting had proceeded, although final votes on the legislation may not have been taken until after public access was restored.</p>

<p>The state court action alleged that the two right-to-work acts are invalid because they were adopted in violation of the Michigan <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/publications/openmtgsfreedom.pdf">Open Meetings Act's</a> [PDF] requirement that "all deliberations" and "all decisions" of a public body be made "at a meeting open to the public." In addition, violations were charged of the Michigan Constitution's guarantee of the <a href="http://legislature.mi.gov/doc.aspx?mcl-Article-I-3">right to assemble</a> and petition the government, and of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/">US Constitution's</a> First Amendment parallel rights of free speech and assembly and the right to petition the government.</p>

<p>The outcome would seem to turn on a judicial assessment of the reasonableness of closing the Capitol and of the legislature's continuing to operate in the face of that closing. Even if the closing itself was justified on the grounds that a large number of enraged protesters presented a substantial risk of bodily injury or property damage, that does not necessarily justify the legislature's failure to adjourn until such time as order was restored and the risk eliminated. In fact, the legislature was able to proceed with its business when the Capitol building was reopened under court order. But there is a traditional presumption of legislative validity that the conservative majority of Michigan's Supreme Court is likely to find persuasive.</p>

<p>The federal court action focuses on Act 348, which covers private employment. The plaintiffs contend that the law is unlawful in its entirety because some of its provisions are contrary to federal law and these unconstitutional provisions cannot be separated from its other provisions. The anti-preemption Section 14(b) of the NLRA limits state action regarding matters otherwise regulated by the NLRA to the actual "execution or application" of agreements requiring union membership (including the payment of dues and fees). The plaintiffs complain that Act 348 exceeds these limits by purporting to regulate other concerted activity governed by federal law, including conduct aimed at causing individuals to refrain from union membership or financial support and including union-administered job referral and "hiring hall" arrangements. The latter would clearly appear beyond the scope of Section 14(b)'s authorization as applied to the larger business firms subject to federal law. To that extent Act 348 would be invalid. But it would also seem that the section dealing with the "union shop" prohibition could be severed and sustained.</p>

<p>In addition to the two court actions that have been brought, Governor Rick Snyder has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/29/usa-unions-michigan-idUSL1N0AYC3720130129">asked</a> the Michigan Supreme Court to rule directly on several constitutional questions. For example, does Act 349 interfere with the authority of the Civil Service Commission (CSC) over the classified state civil service under the Michigan Constitution? Do the Acts violate equal protection of the law under either the State or US Constitution because the legislation does not apply to all employees in public or private sector bargaining units? Leaving the CSC issue to the experts in that area, one can safely predict that the exclusion of certain groups of employees from statutory coverage will satisfy the modest "rational basis" test applicable to equal protection issues when there are no "suspect classifications" like race or religion.</p>

<p>In my judgment, the courts will uphold the core provisions in both new statutes, prohibiting the union shop. How Michigan citizens will react is a story for another day. </p>

		<title>Georgia&#039;s Cruel and Unusual Standard for Proving Mental Retardation</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.schr.org/about/who">Terrica Ganzy</a>, Staff Attorney for the <a href="http://www.schr.org/">Southern Center for Human Rights</a>, argues that Georgia's "beyond a reasonable doubt standard" for finding mental retardation in capital offenses is a nearly insurmountable standard...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/terriciaganzy.jpg" width="120" height="200" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he US Supreme Court has held that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendment's</a> prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment bans the execution of persons who suffer from mental retardation in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2043469055777796288">Atkins v. Virginia</a>. Yet, Warren Lee Hill, a Georgia death row inmate who has twice proven to Georgia courts by a preponderance of the evidence that he suffers from mental retardation, was scheduled to be executed on Tuesday, February 19, 2013. However, the execution was <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/federal-and-state-courts-each-order-stay-of-execution-of-georgia-death-row-inmate.php">stayed</a> pending further review.</p>

                <p>Georgia, unlike any other state in the nation, requires proof of mental retardation beyond a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/reasonable_doubt">reasonable doubt</a>. Beyond a reasonable doubt is an impossible standard to meet in the context of mental retardation. Mental retardation is generally defined as: (1) significant subaverage general intellectual functioning and (2) significant adaptive behavior deficits that (3) manifested before age 18. <strong>All three prongs must be met</strong>. </p>

                <p>A problem arises when one considers that the measurement of IQ is subject to challenge based on "practice effect" (how many times the test has been administered to a particular person), "Flynn effect" (the age of the particular test being administered), the test's "standard error of measurement" (estimate of error used to interpret a test score), the effort put forth by the person taking the test and the qualifications of the person administering the test. All of these factors can obviously lead to doubt in the mind of a trier of fact. </p>

                <p>Adaptive behavior assessment, perhaps even more so than IQ determination, also leaves plenty of room for doubt in the mind of an average trier of fact, because communication, social, and practical functioning ability, particularly in the context of mild mental retardation, does not neatly fit into black and white, either/or analysis. Persons who suffer from mild mental retardation (typically IQ scores of 55-70 according to the <a href="http://www.psychiatry.org/practice/dsm/dsm-iv-tr">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a>) are often capable of some basic, real world functioning. The concept that a person can suffer from mental retardation and still lead a seemingly "normal" life confounds the average lay person, because it cuts against what people think they know about persons who suffer from mental retardation. Many people do not know that there are levels of severity of mental retardation and often have stereotypical views of what persons who suffer from mental retardation can (or cannot) do and even how they look. </p>

                <p>A 2008 <a href="http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&handle=hein.journals/deplr57&div=35&id=&page=">study</a> of juror decision-making in a capital case by Heather Pruss, Maria Sandys and Adam Trahan involving a defendant who claimed to suffer from mental retardation found that jurors often believe that persons who suffer from mental retardation are easy to detect because they look like they have an intellectual disability and exhibit child-like behavior. Jurors think: "Hill can drive a car, so he must not be mentally retarded," "Hill served in the military, so he must not be mentally retarded," "Hill committed murder, so he must not be mentally retarded," and so on. These stereotypical attitudes are deadly in Georgia, because inherent in them is <strong>doubt</strong> that a particular defendant suffers from mental retardation, and this doubt is based on a lack of understanding of the disability. </p>

                <p>Assuming that a person who suffers from mental retardation would perform every task poorly is dangerous because persons who suffer from mental retardation may have strengths as well as weaknesses. For example, in clinical assessment of adaptive behavior deficits, the standard measurement is whether a person suffers from significant deficits in one of three categories of functioning: conceptual (<em>e.g.</em>, language, reading, writing, money concepts, self-direction), social (<em>e.g.</em>, interpersonal relationships, responsibility, self-esteem, gullibility, naivet&#233;, following rules, obeying laws, avoiding victimization) and practical (<em>e.g.</em>, cooking, cleaning, personal grooming, occupational skills). For example, a person could have deficits in conceptual functioning and exhibit few or no deficits in practical skills and social skills &#8212; and be clinically diagnosed as suffering from mental retardation.     </p>

                <p>Hill fits into this category of persons who suffer from mental retardation but have strengths that would lead the average person to doubt the existence of such disability. Hill has been determined to have an IQ of 70 and deficits in adaptive functioning that manifested before he turned 18 years old. His IQ of 70 is undisputed. School records, standardized test scores and testimony from his teachers indicate that Hill exhibited mental retardation throughout school and was socially promoted because there was no special education program at his school. Hill, however, served honorably in the United States Navy, drove a car, and, unfortunately, committed murder. Because of the things Hill was capable of doing, he was unable to prove his mental retardation by Georgia's "beyond a reasonable doubt" standard of proof. Certainly, evidence presented of his sub-average intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior deficits was repeatedly sufficient to prove his mental retardation by a preponderance of evidence. His abilities, however, created doubt not only in the minds of the triers of fact but also in the minds of testifying experts. That doubt is steadily marching Hill to the execution chamber.</p>

                <p>However, in a dramatic turn of events in this case, the three experts who testified in 2000 on behalf of the state that Hill did not suffer from mental retardation &#8212; but, rather, borderline intellectual functioning &#8212; <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/HillPRFeb14.pdf">have now changed their opinions</a> [PDF]. After re-evaluating the evidence in Hill's case, Dr. Thomas Sachy, Dr. Donald Harris and Dr. James Gary Carter now conclude that Hill suffers from <a href="http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Mild+mental+retardation">mild mental retardation</a>. They now conclude that Hill suffers from mental retardation specifically because they now better understand that strengths can co-occur with weaknesses in persons who suffer from mild mental retardation. In his recent affidavit, Harris attests: <blockquote>We in the clinical community now better understand that persons with mild mental retardation are capable of such things as holding a job, working under close supervision, buying and driving a car, and so forth. It is precisely because significant deficits in cognition, judgment and impulse control can be masked by superficial functionality in cases of mild mental retardation that such persons may sometimes not be identified in court proceedings as being intellectually disabled. I believe this has happened in Hill's case.</blockquote>Harris cites Hill's military service as an example of one of the reasons why he misdiagnosed Hill. Harris recalls initially viewing Hill's military service as evidence of high functioning that would be inconsistent with mental retardation. After recently reviewing Hill's record more fully &#8212; and in light of what he now knows about mental retardation &#8212; he now notes that the structured environment of the military allowed Hill to perform well at lower classifications. Although Hill was recommended for promotion within the military, he was never <em>actually</em> promoted because Hill's performance plummeted as the tasks became more challenging. </p>

                <p>Hill's case is a prime example of why Georgia's beyond a reasonable doubt standard is cruel and unusual and must be eliminated. Three experts in the field of mental retardation diagnosis admit to giving too much weight to Hill's perceived abilities in determining that he did not meet the criteria for mental retardation. Based on the doubt of these three experts, who now admit that their doubts were based on a lack of sufficient time to review records in Hill's case and lack of understanding how certain of Hill's abilities were not inconsistent with a diagnosis of mental retardation, a man who clearly meets the definition of mental retardation is scheduled to be executed. In light of this new evidence, there can be no reasonable doubt that Hill is mentally retarded.</p>

                <p>If Georgia decision-makers cannot make that finding, however, the Supreme Court of Georgia should uphold the intent of its 2002 decision in <em>Atkins</em> and strike down Georgia's requirement of proof of mental retardation beyond a reasonable doubt. Failing to do so will lead to the execution of Hill and other capital defendants who, in the words of former Georgia Supreme Court Justice Leah Ward Sears dissenting in the 2003 decision of <em>Head v. Hill</em>, are "in all probability mentally retarded ... more than likely mentally retarded ... and almost certainly mentally retarded."      </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Lara Wharton, <a href="http://www.law.emory.edu">Emory University School of Law</a> Class of  2013, discusses the human rights abuses in the Philippines...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/dateline/lara_wharton.jpg" width="119" height="200" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n February 25, 2013, Philippines President Benigno Aquino III signed the <a href="http://www.congress.gov.ph/download/billtext_15/hbt5990.pdf">Human Rights Victims Reparation and Recognition Act</a> [PDF] into law. The act addresses the widespread human rights abuses that took place under former President Ferdinand Marcos' government during the imposition of martial law from 1972 to 1986. The act recognizes and provides <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/philippines-president-signs-law-to-compensate-victims-of-martial-law-abuses.php">reparation</a> to the thousands of victims who were subjected to summary execution, torture, forced disappearance and other gross human rights violations under Marcos' leadership. </p>

<p>Under the new legislation, ten billion pesos (USD $246 million) will be set aside to provide compensation to the victims and their families. The act creates an independent Human Rights Victims' Compensation Board, which will allocate the funds according to a point system based on the type, frequency and duration of the human rights violations committed against each victim. Although the act is a step in the right direction, it does not come close to fulfilling the Philippines' legal and moral obligations of restitution, reparation and compensation for victims of human rights abuses that exist under international law. </p>

<p>The Philippines is currently a party to the majority of international human rights <a href="http://www.geneva-academy.ch/RULAC/international_treaties.php?id_state=171">instruments and treaties<a/> with no reservations. The <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/avl/ha/iccpr/iccpr.html">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR) requires state parties to ensure that every person whose rights or freedoms are violated has the right to an effective remedy determined by a competent authority.  It also provides victims of unlawful arrest or detention with an "enforceable right to compensation." Similarly, the <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cat.html">Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</a> ("Convention Against Torture") obligates state parties to ensure that victims of torture have an "enforceable right to fair and adequate compensation including the means for as full rehabilitation as possible." </p>

<p>The Philippines was not a party to either the ICCPR or the Convention Against Torture during the Marcos administration. However, the right to a remedy by a competent authority for victims of human rights violations is enshrined in Article Eight of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> (UDHR), and is considered a norm of international customary law to which nations are legally bound. Under <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/0/e1b5e2c6a294f7bec1256a5b00361173/$FILE/G9314158.pdf">customary international law</a>, governments must also take reasonable steps to investigate and record human rights abuses committed by former administrations in order to identify those responsible and provide victims with adequate compensation. </p>

<p>In this regard, the Philippines has been extremely lax in its obligations to provide both reparations and an effective remedy to victims of human rights abuses perpetrated by the Marcos' government. After Marcos fled his country and took refuge in Hawaii in 1986, no steps were taken by any successive governments to investigate the abuses that took place under his administration. <em>De facto</em> impunity for police and military forces was, and still is, the rule &#8212; <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/06/27/philippines-two-years-under-aquino-abuses-go-unpunished">effectively barring victims</a> from seeking redress and reparation. Although the act provides compensation to the victims, it is neither fair nor adequate considering the severity of the human rights abuses the victims suffered and the decades they waited for reparation and recognition.</p>

<p>As the victims were denied their right to an effective remedy by a competent authority in the Philippines, they turned to the US court system as a last resort. Plaintiffs were required to sue Marcos in his individual capacity, as <a href="http://archive.usun.state.gov/hc_docs/hc_law_94_583.html">US foreign sovereign immunity law</a> did not allow them to name the Philippines as a defendant. A number of civil lawsuits, including a <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1738004104253731849">class action</a> involving approximately 10,000 victims, were brought against Marcos. These lawsuits sought the recognition of personal liability for the human rights abuses committed under his reign, compensation for the victims and their families and punitive damages. The cases were brought under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1350?quicktabs_8=0#quicktabs-8">Alien Tort Claims Act</a>, which gives US district courts original jurisdiction of civil actions by aliens for torts committed in violation of international law. </p>

<p>In 1992, a six-member jury sitting in the US District Court for the District of Hawaii <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17481043478432389258">found</a> Marcos personally liable for the human rights abuses committed under his leadership. The court awarded the victims $2 billion in damages, sourced from funds that Marcos had embezzled from his country and hidden during his reign. In 1997, the victims <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/2b64d3c0499e38fdc12572ce0049fb3b?Opendocument">filed a suit</a> in the Philippines to obtain enforcement of the US judgment. Initially, the regional court dismissed the suit, stating that the victims were required to pay a filing fee of $8.4 million, based on the $2 billion in dispute. </p>

<p>On appeal, the Supreme Court of the Philippines took 8 years to consider the issue, and eventually delivered its <a href="http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2005/apr2005/139325.htm">opinion</a> requiring a filing fee of only $7.20. The court offered no explanation for its delay. In 2007, the Human Rights Committee of the UN (HRC) published a communication in which it concluded that the Philippines government had violated the victim's rights under the ICCPR due to the unreasonable amount of time it had taken to consider "a matter of minor complexity." The HRC requested that the government compensate the victims, promptly resolve the case on the enforcement of the US judgment and ensure that similar violations do not occur in the future. To this day, only a small portion of the US judgment has been distributed to the victims due to <a href="http://claimants1081.org/2012/06/28/government-again-frustrates-the-recovery-of-marcos-assets-by-victims-of-human-rights-violations-6/">continuous opposition</a> by the Philippines government. </p>

<p>The passage of the act may seem like the first indication that the sun is rising over the Philippines. However, the horizon remains dim. The Philippines government has continuously violated its duties under international law by refusing to respect the rights of its citizens to an effective remedy and to fair and adequate compensation for human rights abuses committed by the state. Although compensation is on its way, the act will be of no avail to many of the victims and their families who seek to know the truth surrounding the circumstances of the abuses, to have the perpetrators of the crimes brought to justice and to be guaranteed that the rights of Philippine citizens will be respected in the future.</p>

<p>As it has not violated another state's rights such that it could be taken to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) &#8212; and since there are no regional human rights courts that have jurisdiction over the controversy &#8212; the international community is not left with many options to hold the Philippines responsible for its violations of international law. However, the international community can use political pressure to urge the Philippines to comply with its human rights obligations by encouraging the government to take the following actions:</p>

<p>The government must conduct independent investigations into all of the human rights violations that have occurred during and since the Marcos regime and publish its findings. The government must prosecute the individuals who committed the crimes and must erase all reliance on impunity from prosecution so as to stop further abuses from occurring. The government must allow the victims of the past human rights abuses to collect on the US judgment immediately. Finally, the government must adhere to President Aquino's <a href="http://claimants1081.org/2012/06/28/government-again-frustrates-the-recovery-of-marcos-assets-by-victims-of-human-rights-violations-6/">promise</a> that "the State will protect, with unflagging commitment, the rights of all its citizens." </p>

Particular attention has been paid by media, activists and policy makers to the use of sexual violence by armed forces in the DRC as a "tactic of conflict." This form of violence has been associated with the government as well as those fighting against the regime of President Joseph Kabila.</p>

                <p>A population-based study conducted in conflict-affected areas in eastern DRC in 2010 (North and South Kivu Provinces and Ituri district) documented nearly two decades of violations committed by all parties to the conflict against civilians. Many of the reported abuses, including widespread sexual violence, likely constitute international crimes that fall under the remit of the <a href="/feature/featured/icc/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC).</p>

                <p>Sexual violence as a "tactic of conflict" has gained attention in a number of key international fora and initiatives, with a particular focus on ending impunity for these crimes. In 2012, the UK <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-secretary-announces-uk-initiative-on-preventing-sexual-violence-in-conflict">announced</a> a major initiative aimed at prevention of sexual violence in conflict.  One particular focus of the initiative aims to improve investigations of sexual offenses in order to promote prosecutions. This <a href="http://ukinusa.fco.gov.uk/en/news/?view=News&id=840132182">topic of focus</a> for Britain's presidency includes deployment of expert teams for investigation and evidence collection, as well as plans for new international protocols on the investigation and documentation of sexual violence in conflict. </p>

                <p>The <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher/SRSG_SVC.html">UN Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary General on Sexual Violence in Conflict</a> (SRSG), now on its second mandate holder, has included a focus on ending impunity in its agenda as of its inception in 2010.</p>

                <p>The <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> (UNSC) has issued a number of resolutions specifically focused on sexual violence as part of their <a href="http://www.un.org/womenwatch/feature/wps/">Women Peace and Security</a> agenda, most recently establishing a monitoring and reporting mechanism to enable the naming and shaming of state and non-state armed forces found to be using sexual violence as a tactic of conflict. Lists of forces that use sexual violence as a tactic of armed conflict are issued in annual reports by the SRSG.</p>

                <p>The ICC is also considered a critical forum for ending impunity for sexual violence. Most of the cases before the ICC include sexual violence crimes in the indictment (crimes against humanity and/or war crimes). These cases relate to violence in Uganda, DRC, Darfur, Central African Republic (CAR), Kenya and Cote d'Ivoire. The jurisprudence of the court is still to be established, however, as the only two decisions handed down thus far are in the cases of <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200104/related%20cases/icc%200104%200107/Pages/democratic%20republic%20of%20the%20congo.aspx">The Prosecutor v. Germain Katanga</a> and <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200104/related%20cases/icc%200104%200106/Pages/democratic%20republic%20of%20the%20congo.aspx">The Prosecutor v. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo</a>. The ICC has also not yet proven itself to be particularly well suited for trying cases of sexual violence. </p>

                <p>The NGO <a href="http://www.iccwomen.org/">Women's Initiatives for Gender Justice</a> has written extensively about crimes of sexual violence and the ICC, and has issued annual "report cards" for the Court's handling of these crimes since 2005. In particular, they have <a href="http://www.iccwomen.org/documents/Gender-Report-Card-on-the-ICC-2012.pdf">documented</a> [PDF] the difference between how gender-based crimes are treated by the ICC, in comparison to other crimes. When charges for gender-based crimes are actually brought, they are often dropped or re-characterized as other crimes. This occurs most often with charges that seek an arrest or a summons to appear.  </p>

                <p>One major challenge concerns the lack of clarity as to what constitutes linkage evidence proving a connection between rapes committed by members of various combatant groups and the high level individuals who are the target of ICC indictments. </p>

                <p>Over the last six years, evidence for cases involving crimes against humanity relating to sexual violence brought before the ICC has been approached in new ways. The ICC is considering moving away from testimony evidence, and instead looking at other sources of data to clarify relevant details about these crimes. Working groups, expert panels and conferences have slowly defined what types of data may be useful for prosecutors and judges in these cases, and other international criminal tribunals have utilized this data successfully.</p>

                <p>However, given the lack of clarity as to what the ICC judges will consider as linkage evidence for sexual violence, the development of investigation protocol aimed at international prosecutions may be premature. There are costs and risks for survivors associated with traditional evidence collection, especially in settings where access to services is limited. More support in the national systems is needed, as the ICC neither has the jurisdiction or capacity to handle all of these cases. <a href="http://womenpeacesecurity.org/media/pdf-scr1820.pdf">UNSC Resolution 1820</a> [PDF] explicitly recognizes the need for various parties, such as UN member states and financial institutions, to assist in the development and strengthening of national judicial systems. This support will enable nations to provide sustainable assistance to victims of sexual violence in armed conflict and post-conflict situations, and must be done while simultaneously supporting international criminal processes.  </p>

		<title>Closing the Loophole on Corporate Liability and the ATS</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Senior Editor <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sarah+posner">Sarah Posner</a>, <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/">University of Pittsburgh School of Law</a></a> Class of 2013, is a member of JURIST's Editorial Board. Here, Posner discusses the loophole on corporate liability and US Supreme Court's possible holding in <em>Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co.</em> based on the Alien Tort Statute...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/dateline/sarah_posner.jpg" width="120" height="200" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he US Supreme Court granted <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/kiobel-v-royal-dutch-petroleum/">certiorari</a> on October 2011 to hear <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17590512216294512273">Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co.</a> and determine whether corporations can be held liable under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1350">Alien Tort Statute</a> (ATS). In February 2012, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-corporate-liability-for-torture-overseas.php">heard</a> oral arguments and began deliberating on this issue. The Court is poised to determine whether the jurisdiction granted by the ATS extends to civil actions brought against corporations under the law of nations.</p>

<p>The ATS was drafted as part of the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/judiciary.html">Judiciary Act of 1789</a> to provide jurisdiction over civil claims brought by aliens for violations of international law. The ATS states: "[T]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States." This statute provides US courts with jurisdiction to hear tort actions filed by aliens for either violations of a US treaty or a violation of customary international law. Since the ATS does not specify which offenses give rise to a cause of action under the statue, for a tort to be included under the ATS, it must be a <a href="http://org.law.rutgers.edu/publications/lawjournal/issues/40_1/03SwansonVol.40.1.r_1.pdf">violation of a well-established principle of international law</a> [PDF]. Because the ATS is focused on the nature of the offense, rather than the perpetrator, it follows that corporations can and should be held liable for torts committed in violation of the law of nations. This is exemplified by existing case law on the ATS, such as the inclusion of piracy and liability for pirates under the statute. Although pirates are non-state actors, torts committed by pirates have fallen under the ATS based on the categorization of piracy as a crime against humanity, thus giving rise to universal jurisdiction. In addition to piracy, focusing on the nature of the offense rather than the perpetrator was also present in the aftermath of World War II when German corporations were held liable for Nazi activity. Corporate liability for offenses falling under universal jurisdiction was further evidenced by the Nuremburg trials. Since non-state actors have already been held liable for crimes falling under universal jurisdiction and the ATS does not state any exception for corporations, the Supreme Court should follow the history and purpose of the ATS, as well as existing case law, and hold Dutch Petroleum liable for the offenses alleged in <em>Kiobel</em>. </p>

<p>US courts have published only nine significant decisions on the ATS since 1980, and the Supreme Court in its entire history has decided only <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6103279683071618777">one ATS case</a> with a second case now on the Court's docket. Keeping in mind the factors that originally influenced Congress to include crimes under the ATS, violations of the law of nations generally include war crimes and crimes against humanity &#8212; crimes in which the perpetrator can be called <em>hostis humani generis</em>, or, "an enemy of all mankind." The evolution of the ATS through the courts began in 1980 when, after nearly 200 years of laying dormant, the court <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17038181689969568294">recognized</a> that the ATS provides jurisdiction for US courts to adjudicate claims under the statute. </p>

<p>Congress does not directly address private actions under the ATS; decisions on this issue have been based on international and domestic treatment of non-natural persons under the law. One concern is that corporations will be reluctant to expand their business operations into countries that have poor human rights records, fearing that the corporations could be held liable for aiding and abetting oppressive governments in human rights violations. Although common among those opposing corporate liability under the ATS, these fears gloss over the safeguards in place to shield corporations who are not actively violating international law. Corporations will only be held liable for purposefully aiding and abetting violations of the law of nations. Therefore, even if a corporation knowingly does business that is arguably "aiding and abetting" state actors that violate international law, that corporation cannot be held liable if their actions are not purposeful. This distinction between "purposeful actions" versus "mere knowledge" shields corporations from liability unless their actions are purposefully aiding and abetting perpetrators of international law violations. Furthermore, failing to include corporate liability under the auspices of the ATS means that victims may not be compensated for the gravest of offenses (<em>e.g.</em> genocide, torture, slavery, <em>etc.</em>) simply because the perpetrators of such offenses are non-natural persons. The Court would incentivize human rights perpetrators to incorporate before carrying out crimes against the law of nations to escape liability. </p>

<p>During <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/supreme-court-rehears-arguments-in-corporate-liability-case-from-last-term.php">oral arguments</a> before the Supreme Court the plaintiff's attorney <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-1491rearg.pdf">pointed out</a> [PDF] that the ATS identifies who the plaintiff must be (an alien) but does not identify who the defendant may be. Justice Elena Kagan stated that the question of corporate responsibility for a tort "seems to be a question of enforcement, of remedy; not of substantive international law." Thus, the method for bringing a claim against a defendant under the ATS would be determined by federal common law in the US, rather than international law. International law takes no official position on corporate liability but leaves the question up to the determination of individual states. Even if international law were applied as controlling, there is substantial evidence of corporate liability under international law. In fact, there is evidence of other countries holding corporations both criminally and civilly liable. In oral arguments, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg pointed out that the law of the place where corporations are headquartered typically has <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/respondeat_superior">respondeat superior</a> liability which holds corporations liable for the actions of their agents. The petitioner's lawyer further reasoned that the UK and the Netherlands have passed legislation imposing criminal liability on corporation for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The respondent's lawyer concedes "the ATS allows a civil remedy where the world would impose only criminal liability." This undermines the crux of the majority's argument that corporate liability is not an established principle of international law. </p>

<p>Therefore, even if the Court decided that the type of defendant that could be prosecuted under the ATS is a question of international law, customary international law today demonstrates acceptance of corporate liability for violations of the law of nations. This view is supported by the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/NTs_war-criminals.html">Nuremberg trials</a> holding German corporations liable for Nazi activity during the Holocaust. The <em>Kiobel</em> majority's view that corporations are not liable under international law is refuted by the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/Law-Reports_Vol-10.pdf">I.G. Farben case</a> [PDF] during the Nuremberg trials, which held that under international law, corporations are liable for committing violations of international law. In addition to German companies facing liability during the Nuremberg trials, the court in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4610835644669817272">Boimah Flomo</a> pointed to the use of <em>in rem</em> judgments against pirate ships to further support the precedent on holding non-natural persons liable for violations of the law of nations. The US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit and various other case precedents on the ATS have been in line with US law categorizing corporations as legal persons, as exemplified by recent Supreme Court decisions such as <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6233137937069871624">Citizens United</a>. </p>

<p>There is nothing in the text, history or purpose of the ATS that precludes corporations from liability for violations of the law of nations. The precedent set by other circuit courts (such as <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17256439279308837564">Sinaltrainal v. Coca-Cola Co.</a>, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16628283638041959457">Doe VII v. Exxon Mobil Corporation</a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=258321003365321549">Aldana v. Del Monte Fresh Produce</a>) holding that corporations can be held liable under the ATS further supports the principle of corporate liability in international law. By holding corporations liable for violations of the law of nations, the Court would also be acting in accordance with the history and purpose of the ATS. The ATS was passed by Congress to ensure that perpetrators of the gravest human rights violations, including torture, slavery and genocide, would have to compensate victims for the injuries they suffered. By carving out a separate exception, and immunizing corporations from liability under the ATS, the Supreme Court would frustrate the purpose of the ATS. Even worse, the Court would encourage perpetrators of the gravest human rights violations to simply incorporate in order to escape liability. Therefore, the Supreme Court should recognize corporate liability under the ATS, and adhere to the history and purpose of the ATS.</p>

As with previous investigations regarding <a href="http://www.nsvrc.org/calendar/3051">chronic failures</a> to investigate and prosecute sexual offenses, the HRW report documents widespread non-compliance by detectives with respect to internal procedures and a lack of systematic supervisory review within the MPD.</p>

<p>The 196-page report reveals a culture of incompetence within the MPD's Sexual Assault Unit (although abbreviated "SAU" the unit is internally referred to as the "Sex Squad"). Based upon evidence gathered from the FBI's Uniform Crime Report (UCR) &#8212; specifically, documents produced by the Washington DC Mayor's Office of Victim Services and the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) program at the Washington Hospital Services (WHS), information provided pursuant to a lawsuit filed under the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oip/amended-foia-redlined.pdf">Freedom of Information Act</a> [PDF] (FOIA) against the MPD, deposition testimony from a 2008 lawsuit filed by a sexual assault survivor against the MPD, and over 150 interviews of stakeholders &#8212; HRW carefully documented the failure of the MPD to investigate and report rape cases between October 2008 and September 2011.  </p>

<p>The report's main findings include:<ul class="disc" style="list-style-position:inside"><li>MPD officers failed to document many reported sexual assaults, instead choosing to "unfound" cases without even filing a police report;</li><li>MPD officers failed to investigate several cases of reported serious sexual assault, instead classifying the reports as for "office information only" or "miscellaneous" cases, thereby ending any investigation;</li><li>MPD officers misclassified some cases of reported serious sexual assault as misdemeanors or non-sexual offenses;</li><li>MPD officers presented arrest warrant requests to prosecutors prior to undertaking a thorough investigation, resulting in the cases being rejected for prosecution based on evidential insufficiency.</li></ul><br />
This brief comment will focus on the first finding: the failure of MPD to document reported sexual assaults. First, I will recount the basis upon which HRW reached its conclusion that there was, indeed, widespread failure to document such cases. I will then discuss the problem of police failing to document and disclose information regarding sexual offenses generally and highlight the significant threat to the rule of law posed by these failures.</p>

<p>While the official MPD policy required police to file an incident report for <em>all</em> reported sexual assaults, the HRW investigation revealed that, indeed, a vast number of sexual assault reports were not documented. HRW identified MPD's failure to document many reported sexual assaults by comparing the number of cases reported by victims to the Washington Hospital Center (WHC) &#8212; the hospital where forensic "rape kit" tests are performed &#8212; to the number of cases in which the MPD opened an incident report or recorded the case in its internal database. HRW investigators determined that there was no corresponding incident report (and thus, no police follow-up) in 35.4 percent of cases in which victims reported their assault while at the hospital undergoing a forensic exam. Given that 41 percent of victims who report sexual assaults to the police do not undergo a forensic exam, the data uncovered by the HRW investigation supports the conclusion that the percentage of undocumented cases overall is likely much greater than 35.4 percent.</p>

<p>Without documentation to track a case from the time of reporting by the victim through to final disposition, it is impossible to evaluate how police departments and prosecutors are handling sexual assault cases. Are feminist groups correct to complain that they are prosecuting too few cases? Are men's rights groups correct to complain that they are prosecuting too many? Without the relevant data to evaluate precisely what is happening with reported cases, it is impossible even to begin this conversation.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, such data is not available in any US jurisdiction. While the best estimates in the social science <a href="http://vaw.sagepub.com/content/18/2/145.full.pdf+html">literature</a> conclude that seven percent to 27 percent of reported rape cases are prosecuted, this estimate is based on incomplete, piecemeal data.  </p>

<p>The primary reason the data is incomplete is that police departments typically fail to track this information. Once a decision is made not to file an incident report, the matter is simply dropped &#8212; there is no "paper trail" in existence to document the reasons why the case was not investigated. The failure to document cases, of course, is not unique to MPD. As a 2010 <em>Baltimore Sun</em> <a href="http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-06-27/news/bs-md-ci-rapes-20100519_1_fbi-data-mayor-orders-review-detectives/4">investigation</a> uncovered, the Baltimore police "[d]epartment statistics show that about 40 percent of the 911 calls involving rape allegations each year ... result in reports not being taken at the scene. For most of those calls, there is no documentation of why they were handled in that way." </p>

<p>Moreover, even when allegations of sexual assault are documented and investigated by the police, it is common for the departments to refuse to provide the information to researchers. As was the case in the HRW investigation of MPD, researchers often must file lawsuits to compel disclosure under FOIA. Yet, even FOIA will not guarantee transparency in state and local jurisdictions where FOIA or open-access laws either do not exist or exempt criminal police reports from the disclosure requirements.</p>

<p>Finally, even where the information exists and is legally discoverable, it is often the case that such disclosures are delayed and incomplete. Indeed, the continuing fallout from the HRW report illustrates this point well. Despite having been provided numerous opportunities to disclose all relevant information to the HRW researchers &#8212; and despite having agreed (pursuant to settlement of the FOIA case) that HRW was entitled to review all sexual assault cases from the relevant timeframe &#8212; the MPD <a href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-02-04/local/36744927_1_sexual-assault-police-files-197-page-report">now claims</a> to have identified additional documentation regarding many cases reported at WHC for which HRW was unable to locate either a corresponding incident report or an entry into the MPD's internal database.</p>

<p>The chronic failure of police to investigate sexual offenses is a crisis for our communities and signals a massive failure of public safety. Moreover, the failure to <em>document</em> and <em>disclose</em> such information is <em>also</em> a crisis: it is a threat to the fundamental principles of transparency in the rule of law and signals a massive failure of political legitimacy in our criminal justice systems. HRW is to be commended for having pursued this investigation so thoroughly, and MPD is to be condemned not only for its mishandling of sexual assault cases, but for its persistent failure to be transparent and accountable to the citizens it is meant to protect and serve. One can only hope that HRW's report will encourage other police departments to improve their investigation and reporting of sexual offenses and follow <a href="http://www.evawintl.org/Best-Practices">best practices</a> in <a href="http://www.officer.com/news/10859221/report-philly-police-rape-squad-a-national-model">transparent</a> policing of sexual offenses.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist M. Patrick Yingling, formerly of Kenya's Moi University School of Law, says that the fear of corruption and violence raises the stakes in Kenya's upcoming election higher than ever...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/patrick_yingling.jpg" width="120" height="143" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n March 4, 2013, Kenyans will go to the polls to elect the country's fourth president. The election is widely seen as Kenya's most important to date. The importance of the election, however, is not necessarily tied to which candidate wins the most votes. Rather, the importance of the election is tied to whether voting will lead to violence, and whether democracy will lead to anarchy.</p>

                <p>This fear of violence is really the fear that history will repeat itself. The <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/kenya-protesters-allege-fraud-in.php">violence following the 2007 election</a> was devastating for Africa's bellwether. In the lead-up to the presidential election, the opposition candidate, <a href="http://softkenya.com/railaodinga/">Raila Odinga</a>, seemed destined to defeat the incumbent, <a href="http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/presidents/kibaki/profile.htm">Mwai Kibaki</a>. As the regional constituency votes were tallied, this expectation appeared to become a reality. However, when the constituency votes were finally added to the national total, Kibaki had won by a narrow margin. In one district, the vote for the incumbent was first announced as 50,145 before being entered as 75,261 in the <a href="http://www.communication.go.ke/elections/default.asp">final tally</a>. In another district, turnout was first shown at 115 percent, but was later changed to 85 percent. </p>

                <p>Obvious <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7175694.stm">electoral impropriety</a> triggered the violence. Targeted ethnic violence escalated initially against the Kikuyu people, the community of which Kibaki is a member. The violence peaked with the killing of over 30 people in a church near the Rift Valley town of Eldoret on New Year's Day 2008. Some Kikuyu coalitions also engaged in retaliatory attacks against individuals supportive of Odinga &#8212; largely members of the Luo and Kalenjin communities &#8212; in the towns of Naivasha and Nakuru. After more than 1,000 deaths, peace was finally brokered in an agreement negotiated by former UN Secretary-General <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1411047.stm">Kofi Annan</a>. Odinga became Kenya's first prime minister, allowing Kibaki to stay in power as president.</p>

                <p>As a result of the post-election violence, four Kenyans will stand trial before the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague on charges of crimes against humanity. Two of those charged, <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200109/related%20cases/icc01090211/Pages/icc01090111.aspx">Uhuru Kenyatta</a> and <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200109/related%20cases/icc01090111/Pages/icc01090111.aspx">William Ruto</a>, are former political rivals who recently joined forces to run on the same ticket for president and vice-president, respectively. The latest polling data shows Kenyatta and Ruto in a close race with Odinga and his running-mate, <a href="http://www.africa-confidential.com/whos-who-profile/id/365/">Kalonzo Musyoka</a>. Kibaki is barred from running for a third term under the <a href="http://kenya.rcbowen.com/constitution/">Constitution of Kenya</a>.</p>

                <p>The post-election violence in 2007 and 2008 was fueled by tribalism, but it was also closely tied to government corruption. Since <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1963/54">independence</a> in 1963, Kenya has fought (and lost) many battles with corruption. Government officials have been able to divert public funds for private purposes with impunity, distributing resources discriminately based on tribal affiliation. Due to a lack of checks on government power, the election of 2007 was seen as a matter of life and death. The potential beneficiaries of power were driven to extremes.</p>

                <p>In the aftermath of the post-election violence, Kenyans <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/kenya-attorney-general-calls-for-probe.php">made real efforts to combat corruption</a>. These efforts culminated in 2010 with the adoption of a new constitution. The revised Constitution of Kenya provides for greater checks on power, especially between the branches of government. Checks and balances are necessary to achieve reduced levels of corruption. However, they are not always sufficient. The effects of new restraints are not always immediate. According to Transparency International's <a href="http://www.transparency.org/cpi2012/results">Corruption Perceptions Index of 2012</a>, Kenya is still perceived to be a highly corrupt country, occupying a rank of 139 out of 176, only a slight improvement from its rank of 154 in 2010.</p>

                <p>Thus, Kenyans still have reason to believe those in government will abuse power. This means that the stakes for this election are high, as is the likelihood of violence. However, a repeat of 2007 is not a foregone conclusion. Although the potential for violence is real, peace may still prevail. In 2007, violence was triggered by the perception of electoral misconduct by the incumbent administration. In 2013, however, the incumbent is barred from seeking re-election. The president has also declined to endorse a candidate. Therefore, there is less of an incentive for electoral misconduct. The trigger for violence could remain un-pulled.</p>

                <p>Another factor to take into account is that the post-election violence of 2007 and 2008 was a source of embarrassment for many Kenyans. The violence erased the country's status as a stable democracy in a conflict-prone neighborhood. The awareness of the set-back was obvious during country's first ever presidential debate last week, as the candidates spent a significant amount of time condemning tribalism, corruption, and violence.</p>

                <p>Let us hope that the candidates mean what they say. The next few days will tell all.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Karla Swift of the <a href="http://www.miaflcio.org/">Michigan State AFL-CIO</a> argues that the "right to work" laws enacted by the Michigan Legislature in 2012 are unconstitutional and were enacted in violation of Michigan's Open Meeting Act...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/karlaswift.jpg" width="120" height="200" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he Michigan State AFL-CIO is currently pursuing two separate litigation paths challenging the so-called "right to work" laws, which were <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/michigan-lawmakers-approve-freedom-to-work-bill.php">rushed</a> through the Michigan Legislature and hastily signed by Governor Rick Snyder in December 2012. We firmly believe that, one way or another, these unjust laws will be overturned.</p>

                <p>As JURIST previously <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/michigan-labor-groups-file-federal-lawsuit-against-right-to-work-law.php">reported</a>, the Michigan State AFL-CIO, together with the <a href="http://www.changetowin.org/">Change to Win Coalition</a> and the <a href="http://michiganbuildingtrades.org/">Michigan State Building and Construction Trades Council</a>, filed a lawsuit in US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan challenging the constitutionality of <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2011-2012/publicact/pdf/2012-PA-0348.pdf">Public Act 348</a> (PA 348) [PDF], the new right to work law covering private sector employers and workers.</p>

                <p>PA 348 violates the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/Supremacy_Clause">Supremacy Clause</a> of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/">US Constitution</a> by imposing state regulation in an area that is preempted exclusively by the <a href="http://www.nlrb.gov/national-labor-relations-act">National Labor Relations Act</a> (NLRA). Specifically, PA 348 violates the Supremacy Clause by invading federally preempted regulation of private sector labor management relations it at least the following respects:<ul class="disc" style="list-style-position:inside"><li>It imposes penalties for violation, such as civil fines, criminal penalties, and a private right of action, which are not provided for under the NLRA;</li><li>It regulates an employee's right to "refrain from" organizing, bargaining and other concerted workplace activities;</li><li>It regulates conduct aimed at causing individuals to refrain or resign from union membership and union financial support;</li><li>It restricts union-administered employment referral and "hiring hall" arrangements;</li><li>It invalidates an entire collective bargaining agreement between an employer and workers if any provision violates 2012 PA 348.</li></ul></p>

                <p>These unconstitutional provisions are not severable from the rest of the law and, therefore, our lawsuit calls on the court to permanently enjoin Michigan from enforcing right to work in the private sector.</p>

                <p>Our state's newly adopted right to work laws are also subject to challenge based on the unprecedented way in which they were enacted. The Michigan State AFL-CIO has joined with other union organizations, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), legislators and journalists as plaintiffs in an <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/aclu-files-lawsuit-challenging-michigan-right-to-work-law.php">action</a> to challenge the new right to work laws on the grounds that they were passed in violation of <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/documents/mcl-act-267-of-1976_158990_7.pdf">Michigan's Open Meetings Act</a> [PDF].<br />
                    <br />
                    The case was filed in Ingham County Circuit Court and charges that government officials, in an unprecedented assault on democracy, deprived the public of their right to participate in and observe the legislative process, by locking citizens out of the Michigan State Capitol while crucial legislative action was taking place. Under Michigan's Open Meetings Act, citizens have a stake in seeing that our government conducts business in a democratic and transparent way. No laws should be passed while citizens are locked out of their Capitol building.<br />
                    <br />
                    In addition to being illegal, the secretive conduct of the legislature was shameful. It's particularly disturbing that journalists were prevented from providing complete coverage of this historic lame duck session. The public has a right to know what their government is doing. These are the facts alleged in the complaint:<ul class="disc" style="list-style-position:inside"><li>On Dec. 6, 2012, the Michigan Capitol doors were locked to prevent additional people from coming to witness or engage their legislators while the controversial right to work bills were being debated on the House and Senate floors.</li><li>The public, including some journalists, were locked out for more than four hours while legislators debated and voted on the bills.</li><li>While individuals already in the Capitol could stay, people waiting outside were not allowed to enter.</li><li>The galleries overlooking the House floor were intentionally packed with legislative staffers so that the public would not be allowed in.</li><li>The lockout at the Capitol merely added to the legislators' attempts to swiftly pass these bills with little public input. The bills were abruptly introduced during the last days of the lame-duck legislative session, already a period of diminished public accountability.</li><li>Rather than allowing the bills to go through the standard committee hearing process where the public would have been invited to comment, the right to work language was introduced for the first time on the House and Senate floors on the same day the bills were passed.</li><li>As further evidence of the desire to prevent the public from holding their government accountable, the lawsuit also notes the appropriations provision that was added to make the legislation referendum-proof under the <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(vh41sdnrqtorryir4qa4wwjc))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectname=mcl-Constitution">Constitution of Michigan</a>.</li></ul></p>

                <p>Like its private-sector counterpart, <a href="http://legislature.mi.gov/doc.aspx?2011-HB-4003">Public Act 349</a> (PA 349) &#8212; the so-called right-to-work amendment to the <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/mcl/pdf/mcl-act-336-of-1947.pdf">Public Employee Relations Act</a> (PERA) [PDF] &#8212; was hastily enacted in a few days during the lame duck session in December 2012. Snyder and Attorney General Bill Schuette assert that PA 349 applies to Michigan's classified civil service, despite decades of case law reaffirming that the exclusive and plenary jurisdiction of the Michigan Supreme Court takes precedence over attempts by the legislature to regulate employment in the civil service. The application of PA 349 to the civil service not only would violate the Constitution of Michigan, it would exceed the legislature's powers and conflict with PERA itself.</p>

                <p>In an attempt to short-circuit the normal judicial process for deciding such questions, the governor has <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/michigan-governor-seeks-advisory-opinion-on-right-to-work-law.php">requested</a> an advisory opinion from the Michigan Supreme Court as to whether the application of PA 349 is constitutional. We believe that the question should be given full due process in the lower courts and, therefore, the Michigan State AFL-CIO has filed an <em>amicus</em> brief urging the court to reject the governor's request.</p>

                <p>At the time this article was submitted, the Ingham County Circuit Court had dismissed the case against PA 349 on jurisdictional grounds; a similar suit was subsequently filed with the Michigan Court of Appeals. The Michigan Supreme Court has yet to respond to the governor's request for an advisory opinion.</p>

                <p>Without intervention, right to work laws for both public and private sector workers will go into effect on March 27, 2013. In the event that these policies are enacted temporarily, the Michigan State AFL-CIO will continue to pursue all legal and political avenues available to have these unreasonable collective bargaining restrictions reversed. Working people will continue to organize, and the labor movement will overcome this obstacle.   </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.utah.edu/faculty/faculty-profile/?id=amos-guiora">Amos Guiora</a> of the University of Utah SJ Quinney College of Law says that the US executive branch's practice of using drones to engage in the targeted killing of suspected terrorists should be subjected to some form of judicial review...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/amosguiora.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>argeted killing sits at the intersection of law, morality, strategy and policy. I am a proponent of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=targeted+killing">targeted killing</a> because it enables the state to protect its innocent civilian population. However, my support for targeted killing is conditioned on the process being subject to rigorous standards, criteria and guidelines.</p>

<p>My advocacy of both targeted killing and criteria-based decision-making rests largely on 20 years of experience with a "seat at the table" of operational counterterrorism. The dangers inherent in the use of state power are enormous. On the opposite side of the equation, however, is the terrible cost of terrorism; after all, terrorists deliberately target innocent civilians.</p>

<p>However, broad definitions of imminence combined with new technological capabilities drastically affect the implementation of targeted killing predicated on legal and moral principles. The recently <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/doj-drone-strike-memo-publicly-released-in-nbc-exclusive.php">released</a> US Department of Justice (DOJ) "white paper" regarding the Obama administration's drone policy defines "imminence" so expansively there need not be clear evidence of a specific attack to justify the killing of an individual, including US citizens. This extraordinary broadness creates a targeted killing paradigm akin to interrogation excesses under the Bush administration that followed in the wake of the <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/doj-memo-advised-military-that.php">Bybee Memo</a>.</p>

<p>The solution to this search for an actionable guideline is adoption of a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/strict_scrutiny">strict scrutiny</a> standard which would enable operational engagement of a non-state actor predicated on intelligence information subject to admissibility standards akin to a court of law. Such intelligence would have to be reliable, material and probative.</p>

<p>To re-phrase, this strict scrutiny test seeks to strike a balance by enabling the state to act sooner but subjecting that action to significant restrictions. This paradigm would be predicated on narrow definitions of imminence and legitimate targets. Rather than enabling the consequences of the DOJ memo, the strict scrutiny test would ensure implementation of person-specific operational counterterrorism. That is the essence of targeted killing conducted in accordance with the rule of law and morality in armed conflict.</p>

<p>This proposal is predicated on the understanding that, while nation states need to engage in operational counterterrorism, mistakes regarding the correct interpretation and analysis of intelligence information can lead to tragic mistakes. Adopting admissibility standards akin to criminal law minimizes operational error.</p>

<p>Rather than relying on the executive branch to make decisions in a "closed world" devoid of oversight and review, the intelligence information justifying the proposed action must be submitted to a court that would ascertain the information's admissibility. The discussion before the court would necessarily be conducted <em>ex parte</em>; however, the process of preparing and submitting available intelligence information to a court would significantly contribute to minimizing operational error that otherwise would occur.</p>

<p>The logistics of this proposal are far less daunting than might seem &#8212; the court before which the executive would submit the evidence is the US Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA Court), established by the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d095:S1566:">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act</a>. Presently, FISA Court judges weigh the reliability of intelligence information in determining whether to grant government <em>ex parte</em> requests for wire-tapping warrants. Under this proposal, judicial approval is necessary prior to undertaking a counterterrorism operation predicated solely on intelligence information. The standard the court would adopt in determining the information's reliability is the same applied in the traditional criminal law paradigm.</p>

<p>The court would cross-examine the representative of the executive branch and subsequently rule as to the information's admissibility. While some may suggest that the FISA Court is largely an exercise in "rubber-stamping," the importance of this proposal is in requiring the government to present the available information to an independent judiciary as a precursor to engaging in operational counterterrorism.</p>

<p>While this proposal explicitly calls for changing the nature of the relationship between the executive and the judicial branches of the government, it would serve to minimize collateral damage in drone attacks predicated on narrow definitions of legitimate target.</p>

<p>This proposal does not limit the state's fundamental right to self-defense. Rather, it creates a process seeking to objectify counterterrorism by seeking to establish standards for determining the reliability of intelligence information that is the backbone of targeted killing decision-making.</p>

<p>The practical impact? A drone policy predicated on the rule of law and morality rather than the deeply troubling paradigm established by the Obama administration in the DOJ white paper.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.usask.ca/find-people/faculty/norman-ken.php">Ken E. Norman</a> of the University of Saskatchewan Faculty of Law draws a comparison between the notion of free speech in the United States with the Supreme Court of Canada's recent ruling upholding a prohibition on hate speech ... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/kennorman.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he last two days in February witnessed stories of differing bedrock constitutional values north and south of the 49th parallel&#8212;the latitudinal border between Canada and the US. First, Secretary of State John Kerry <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2013/02/205218.htm">told</a> students in Berlin:<blockquote>As a country, as a society, we live and breathe the idea of religious freedom and religious tolerance, whatever the religion, and political freedom and political tolerance, whatever the point of view[.] People have sometimes wondered about why our Supreme Court allows one group or another to march in a parade even though it's the most provocative thing in the world and they carry signs that are an insult to one group or another. The reason is, that's freedom, freedom of speech. In America you have a right to be stupid, if you want to be.</blockquote>A day later, the Supreme Court of Canada, speaking with one voice in <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/canada-supreme-court-upholds-hate-speech-laws.php">Saskatchewan v. Whatcott</a>, said otherwise: north of the 49th parallel, "words matter." Along with sticks and stones, they too can do harm. Such harms are suffered both by targeted vulnerable minorities and society as a whole in the Canadian democratic project with its bedrock values of inclusiveness, diversity and equality. As the court put it:<blockquote>[P]olitical expression contributes to our democracy by encouraging the exchange of opposing ideas. Hate speech is antithetical to this objective in that it shuts down dialogue by making it difficult or impossible for members of the vulnerable group to respond ... Section 14 of the <a href="http://www.qp.gov.sk.ca/documents/English/Statutes/Statutes/S24-1.pdf">Saskatchewan Human Rights Code</a> [PDF] provides an appropriate means by which to protect almost the entirety of political discourse as a vital part of freedom of expression. It extricates only an extreme and marginal type of expression that contributes little to the values underlying freedom of expression[.] [It] represents a choice by the legislature to discourage hate speech and its harmful effects on both the vulnerable group and on society as a whole, in a manner that is conciliatory and remedial. In cases such as the present, the process under the legislation can provide guidance to individuals ... so that they can continue expressing their views in a way that avoids falling within the narrow scope of expression captured by the statutory prohibition. The protection of vulnerable groups from the harmful effects emanating from hate speech is of such importance as to justify the minimal infringement of expression that results from the restriction of materials of this kind.</blockquote>The harms done by contemptuous, hateful speech that vilifies marginalized groups to the level of signaling that they are to be detested are clear. The Court explained:<blockquote>If a group of people are considered inferior, sub-human, or lawless, it is easier to justify denying the group and its members equal rights or status[.] Hate speech lays the groundwork for later, broad attacks on vulnerable groups. These attacks can range from discrimination, to ostracism, segregation, deportation, violence and, in the most extreme cases, to genocide[.]</blockquote><em>Whatcott</em> involved homophobic pamphlets (some more virulent than others) distributed by William Whatcott in two cities. Two such diatribes, "Sodomites in our Schools" and "Keep Homosexuality out of Saskatoon's Public Schools," were determined to be hate speech in violation of the human rights code by a decision of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal (finally upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada in <em>Whatcott</em>). Readers of these pamphlets were treated to the following vilifications of homosexuals:</p>

<ul class="disc" style="list-style-position:inside"><li>"[C]hildren ... learning how wonderful it is for two men to sodomize each other";</li><li>"Now the homosexuals want to share their filth and propaganda with Saskatchewan's children";</li><li>"[D]egenerated into a filthy session where gay and lesbian teachers used dirty language to describe lesbian sex and sodomy to their teenage audience";</li><li>"[S]odomites and lesbians who want to remain in their lifestyle and proselytize vulnerable young people that civil law should discriminate against them";</li><li>"Our children will pay the price in disease, death, abuse ... if we do not say no to the sodomite desire to socialize your children into accepting something that is clearly wrong";</li><li>"Sodomites are 430 times more likely to acquire [AIDS] and 3 times more likely to sexually abuse children!";</li><li>"Born Gay? No Way! Homosexual sex is about risky and addictive behaviour!";</li><li>"If Saskatchewan's sodomites have their way, your school board will be celebrating buggery too!";</li><li>"The Bible is clear that homosexuality is an abomination";</li><li>"Sodom and Gomorrah was given over completely to homosexual perversion and as a result destroyed by God's wrath"; and</li><li>"Our acceptance of homosexuality and our toleration of its promotion in our school system will lead to the early death and morbidity of many children."</li></ul>

<p>In sum: "Sodomites in our schools ... [meaning as a consequence] ... [o]ur children will pay the price in disease, death and abuse!" This is too much, especially&#8212;as the US stereotype would have it&#8212;in a "nice" country like Canada. So said our Supreme Court. I applaud the court for speaking with one voice on a matter so central to Canada's foundational constitutional values of inclusiveness, diversity and equality. </p>

<p>Further, <em>Whatcott</em> confirms a test for limiting hate speech that is consistent with Canada's obligations under the <a href="http://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=IV-4&chapter=4&lang=en">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> and, in terms of racist hate speech, our commitments to the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3ae6b3940.html">International Convention to Eliminate All Forms of Racial Discrimination</a>, which was part of the foundation of the Supreme Court's first hate speech case a generation ago. </p>

<p>Only in Canada you say? Is the concept that "words matter" antithetical to everyone south of the 49th parallel? Well, for our US friends, I note that Stanley Fish famously heralded the case of <a href="http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1990/1990canlii24/1990canlii24.pdf">Her Majesty v. Keegstra</a> [PDF]&#8212;the Canadian Supreme Court's first case curbing hate speech&#8212;in "<a href="http://www.english.upenn.edu/~cavitch/pdf-library/Fish_FreeSpeech.pdf">There's No Such Thing as Free Speech and It's a Good Thing, Too</a>" [PDF]. From there, I suggest fast forwarding to Jeremy Waldron's recent book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Speech-Oliver-Wendell-Holmes-Lectures/dp/0674065891">The Harm in Hate Speech</a>.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Columnist <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/people/full-time-faculty/haider-ala-hamoudi">Haider Ala Hamoudi</a> of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law says that Iraq must not push blindly forward in its goal of de-Ba'athification, but rather consider the harm that such absolute changes pose to fairness and process ...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/hamoudi_edited.jpg" width="120" height="200" align="LEFT" hspace="L" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>L</strong></font>ast month, a special panel of Iraq's highest appellate court of general jurisdiction &#8212; the <a href="http://countrystudies.us/iraq/117.htm">Court of Cassation</a> &#8212; reversed an important determination of Iraq's Accountability and Justice Commission (AJC), the body responsible of purging Ba'ath party members from government office. This latest AJC determination concerned the former chief justice of Iraq's Federal Supreme Court, Medhat al-Mahmoud. Specifically, it determined that Medhat was not eligible for public office because of positions he had held during the Saddam era, going so far as to characterize the highly respected judge as being a "Saddamist" who "taught [other judges] to commit offenses against the Iraqi people." The welcome reversal of that determination is not only an object lesson in the value of judicial review, it is also a deep indictment of the entire means by which the "de-Ba'athification" process is conducted. More than any other case, the Medhat saga demonstrates the failures of the de-Ba'athification processes as they are currently conducted.</p>

<p>By way of background, in 2008, Iraq's legislature, the Council of Representatives, enacted the <a href="http://ictj.org/sites/default/files/IraqGovt-Iraq-Translation-Law-2008-English.pdf">Accountability and Justice Law</a>, [PDF] meant to address the highly divisive issue of de-Ba'athification after the damage initially done by L. Paul Bremer, the head of the US-administered <a href="/feature/2011/12/iraq-war.php#politics">Coalition Provisional Authority</a>. In his first order in 2003, Bremer not only disbanded the entire Iraqi army, but also issued draconian anti-Ba'ath provisions that resulted in large numbers of government employees losing their jobs. As such, de-Ba'athification was long a source of Sunni resentment, and the Accountability and Justice Law sought to curb some of the more obvious excesses of the previous de-Ba'athification processes.</p>

<p>As with much compromise legislation, it was maligned by those on both fringes as being either a plainly insufficient measure or a sellout to Ba'athism, as the case may be. Yet despite suggestions to the contrary, its provisions respecting disqualification of former members of the party are rather clear, limited and set forth in ten separate subsections under Article 6 of the law. Government employees who belonged to the fourth or higher rank of the multi-tiered Ba'ath party hierarchy were to be forcibly retired. Those who were at the third tier or higher could not serve in specified security ministries: the Higher Judicial Council, the presidency or other sensitive positions. Those who stole from the public coffers were disqualified from public employment. Anyone who had been a member of the paramilitary "Saddam Fedayeen" and anyone who was a member of the "persecuting security services" was likely to be stripped of government employment. (This latter provision caused some confusion, as some seemed to think it meant that no Ba'athists could serve in the current security services. In fact the provision prevents all members, not Ba'athists, of the "persecuting security services" from having government employment. The only way that such a provision makes any sense at all is if it refers not to the current security agencies, but rather members of the "persecuting" security services under the Ba'ath, in particular the dreaded "Mukhabarat" responsible for identifying and eliminating regime opponents.)</p>

<p>In addition to narrowing and specifying the grounds on which de-Ba'athification was to proceed, the Law of Accountability and Justice also contained a second, quite important concession. It mandated judicial review of the determinations of the Accountability and Justice Commission, which was created by and until then answerable effectively only to the Council of Representatives. This addition, heavily negotiated by Sunni representatives, was meant to add a measure of due process to the disqualification determinations. By requiring the review of an independent, judicial body, the theory went, witch hunts could be avoided.</p>

<p>Despite the best intentions of the law, the processes have still seemed to show significant failings. Most notably, hundreds of candidates seeking office in the 2010 national elections were removed on the grounds of ties to the Ba'ath party in a process that could only be described as opaque, convoluted and obviously politicized. The candidates initially removed by the AJC were all <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/iraq-government-denounces-ruling.php">reinstated on appeal</a>, on the sensible grounds that the evidence against them could not be reviewed in such a short time frame, prior to an election. An uproar among vigorous anti-Ba'athists ensued, a meeting between Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and (ironically) Medhat was held, and the panel swiftly <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/iraq-appeals-panel-reverses-ruling-on.php">reversed itself</a>, upholding many &#8212; though not all &#8212; of the disqualification decisions initially made by the AJC.</p>

<p>Still, it is one thing for the AJC to target potential candidates for office, many of whom were quite obscure. It is another to target the powerful chief justice of the Federal Supreme Court, with his international allies and with his strong domestic backing both within the judiciary and beyond it. If the AJC were to seek to remove Medhat, opacity would not do. It would need to convince a skeptical appellate panel that one of the ten grounds for disqualification set forth in Article 6 was applicable, and it would need to show how it was applicable. For example, documentation showing that Medhat was a member of the third rank of the Ba'ath party would certainly have sufficed.</p>

<p>The AJC did not even attempt to do this, engaging instead in innuendo and name calling more suggestive of McCarthyism than anything resembling a proper judicial process. The AJC thus only indicated that it rendered its decision in accordance with Article 6 "as guided by Section 1(9)." Section 1(9) is merely a definition of "supporters of the regime" and it does not constitute an independent ground for disqualification. The argument was, thus, quite easy for the appellate panel to disregard. As for Section 6, the AJC did not specify a subsection, nor did it point to anything that would seem to fit under any of the applicable subsections. Its "evidence" was: (1) that the chief justice had helped appoint members of the judiciary to high positions who turned out to be strong supporters of the regime, (2) that the chief justice had been promoted with some rapidity through the ranks of the judiciary (including being appointed to the Court of Cassation in an unusual process that involved the intervention of Saddam) and (3) that the chief justice was given various awards and honors during that period. In a particularly farcical exercise, the AJC located newspaper articles from Ba'ath-era papers in which Medhat is quoted as saying something relatively benign, yet broadly supportive, of the ruling Ba'ath regime, and Saddam in particular. If one is disqualified as a Ba'athist for saying nice things about Saddam during Saddam's rule, then virtually every person who lived in Iraq during the Saddam era is a Ba'athist, given the demands made by the totalitarian regime that its citizenry show its support at every opportunity.</p>

<p>Respecting legal process, there is simply not a thing in Article 6 that authorizes the AJC to disqualify a person from a governmental post on the grounds set forth by the AJC &#8212; a point the panel of the Court of Cassation did not hesitate to make, correctly, and with some force. While some deservedly well-respected Iraq commentators, including <a href="http://www.iraq-businessnews.com/2013/02/17/political-dynamics-behind-the-downfall-court-chief/">Reidar Visser</a>, suggest that the decision was not controversial because it was "widely agreed" that the Chief Justice was a high-ranking Ba'athist, the point of judicial process is not to act on the basis of that which is "widely agreed", but only that which is conclusively proven. That the AJC in this instance, when it surely knew that its decision would be scrutinized, would rely on such highly specious material as its "proof" only causes one to wonder as to the extent to which it has done so in many other instances, in which the proof was not so carefully considered.</p>

<p>In any event, despite a well-meaning law that appears clear, specific and offers a fair measure of due process, it is obvious that the de-Ba'athification processes are beginning to metastasize once again. Even if the correct result was reached in this instance, with a striking reversal of the AJC determination, no body which would even submit charges on such a thin evidentiary basis can be permitted to continue. Though I have not always believed it to be so, this incident has convinced me of this much: de-Ba'athification must end. The sooner, the better.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://coe.lehigh.edu/faculty/pzirkel">Perry A. Zirkel</a> of Lehigh University says the US Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights' latest "Dear Colleague" letter, like its predecessor concerning bullying, serves primarily as a public reminder and reinforcement of a current priority rather than an expansion of legal requirements....<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/perryzirkel.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n January 25, 2013, the US Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) issued a designated "<a href="http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201301-504.pdf">significant guidance document</a>" [PDF] specific to students with disabilities in extracurricular athletics. On the one hand, Chief Executive Terri Lakowski of Active Policy Solutions <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/sports/education-department-clarifies-law-on-disabled-athletes-access-to-school-sports.html">touted</a> this "Dear Colleague" letter &#8212; which OCR addressed to school districts across the country &#8212; as representing "a landmark moment for students with disabilities" on par with what <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/chapter-38">Title IX</a> did for females in relation to interscholastic athletics and providing a "level of clarity [that] has been missing for years." On the other hand, some school district representatives engaged in noisy hand-wringing about OCR's message about supposed fiscal and administrative hardships, especially with regard to the avowed requirement for separate teams for students with disabilities.<br />
	<br />
The import of this latest OCR letter, as with many legal pronouncements, differs widely depending on the multiple perspectives in our national community. I offer here a brief analysis that fits within the intermediate range of neutral perspectives, with the understanding that acceptance as truly impartial defies the impassioned and adversarial views that such legal developments stimulate.<br />
	<br />
The OCR letter consists of three substantive parts after a brief introduction. The first part reminds districts that their programs and activities may not operate "based on generalizations, assumptions, prejudices, or stereotypes about disability generally, or specific disabilities in particular." Although <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/794">Section 504</a> of the <a href="http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.uscongress/legislation.93hr8070">Rehabilitation Act of 1973</a>, which is very brief, and the few pages of regulations for preschool, elementary and secondary education do not specifically address this point, it certainly squares with the purposes of the law. Indeed, Section 504's sister statute, the <a href="http://www.ada.gov/pubs/ada.htm">Americans with Disabilities Act</a> (ADA), includes countering stereotypical assumptions as one of its stated purposes. Moreover, the single example that OCR provides in this part, which concerns a member of high school lacrosse team with a learning disability (LD) who does not get to play in any of the games solely because of the coach's knee-jerk perception about LD is cogent, albeit rather obvious.<br />
	<br />
The second substantive section emphasizes equal opportunities for participation in extracurricular activities, including making reasonable modifications and providing necessary aids and services. The cited judicial support is <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=659122674909970890">limited</a> to <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15117215513508737370">two</a> of the Supreme Court's Section 504 decisions, and the cited Section 504 regulations provide only indirect and incomplete support. Nevertheless, the specified systematic steps for an individualized inquiry &#8212; including whether the modifications and related aids/services are necessary and, if so, reasonable as compared with fundamental alterations &#8212; largely fits with the applicable litigation to date. The absence of the Supreme Court's decision in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-24.ZS.html">PGA Tour, Inc. v. Martin</a> and the minimization of the alternative defense of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/undue_hardship">undue hardship</a> are likely due to OCR's enforcement posture. Similarly, the three examples that OCR provided in this part have partial, albeit uncited support in the Section 504 case law.<br />
	<br />
The final part of the letter discusses providing and arranging for separate or different opportunities for students with disabilities. The controversy concerning this section is largely ill-founded. First, OCR purposefully used language of recommendation, not requirement. The cited relevant federal policy for "significant guidance documents" prohibits the use of mandatory language where not describing a statutory or regulatory requirement. Second, OCR made clear that this encouraged option only applies as a last resort &#8212; specifically, only after exhausting the preceding equal opportunities steps. Thus, it only applies to students with disabilities for whom the district cannot fully and effectively meet their interests and abilities.<br />
	<br />
As an overall matter, certain concluding observations are in order. First, OCR's interpretations here and elsewhere are based largely on the Section 504 regulations with the relatively affirmative stance of a civil rights administering agency. In contrast, the courts have relied much more on the Section 504 and ADA legislation and prior pertinent case law, with generally less plaintiff-friendly outcomes. Second, this document only gives peripheral attention to interscholastic athletic associations, whereas these associations have been the defendants in most of the relevant court decisions to date. Third, this OCR document, like other such policy interpretations, signals the priorities and perspectives of the agency but is not binding on the courts. To the extent that its interpretations do not square with judicial precedents, they are not likely to have a significant effect on future litigation outcomes, but they will have a significant effect on OCR's complaint resolution and compliance review process.<br />
	<br />
In sum, OCR's latest "Dear Colleague" letter, like its <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201010.html">predecessor concerning bullying</a>, serves primarily as a public reminder and reinforcement of a current priority. It represents a positive and proactive use of the bully pulpit to stimulate reform in a normative direction, not as a dramatic expansion of legal requirements. Its characterization as a model of clarity only applies with careful qualifications. In addition to the aforementioned distinctions, the necessary qualifiers include the understanding that an individualized inquiry, the determination of essential eligibility requirements and the boundary between reasonable modifications, fundamental alterations or undue hardship are all clearly applicable and inevitably unclear. Similarly, the analogy to Title IX can only be limited, because (1) disability and gender do not present the same situation for extracurricular athletics or other educational opportunities; (2) concepts of reasonable modifications, related services/aids, and integrated v. separate teams apply differentially to them; and (3) Title IX has extensive regulations concerning this issue, whereas Section 504 does not. OCR's latest letter may purport to offer "significant guidance," but not as either of the two sides of the issue have characterized it.</p>

		<title>United States v. DiCristina: The Interaction of Federal and State Law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Ren&#232; DuBois, <a href="http://www.nyls.edu/">New York Law School</a> Class of 2013, analyzes the <em>United States v. DiCristina</em> opinion and points out its flaws and limitations...<hr height='1'><br /><font size='3'><strong>I</strong></font>f anyone has ever watched the movie <em>Rounders</em>, they will vividly <a href="http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/r/rounders-script-transcript-poker-damon.html">remember</a> Matt Damon playing the Dean's poker hand without once looking at his cards:<blockquote>You were lookin' for that third three, but you forgot that Professor Green folded it on Fourth Street and now you're representing that you have it. The D.A. made his two pair, but he knows they're no good. Judge Kaplan was trying to squeeze out a diamond flush but he came up short and Mr. Eisen is futilely hoping that his queens are going to stand up. So like I said, the Dean's bet is $20.</blockquote>Although probably leaving a lasting impression on non-poker players, Matt Damon did not have any magical, see-through-the-cards vision; ostensibly he just used his poker skills. That's right &#8212; poker is a game of skills.</p>

<p>At least that is what Judge Jack Weinstein <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-court-rules-poker-not-gambling-under-federal-law.php">concluded</a> in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11268493774958366402">United States v. DiCristina</a>, expressly rejecting the notion that an organized game of poker is considered illegal gambling under federal law. The central issue in the case was a narrow one: whether an organized poker game violates the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1955">Illegal Gambling Business Act</a> (IGBA) &#8212; a federal statute that prohibits certain gambling operations for profit. Specifically, under subsection (b)(1) of the IGBA, an "illegal gambling business" is a gambling business that violates state law (there are two additional elements discussed below). Notably, it also provides a non-exhaustive list of "gambling" activities, many of which are traditional casino and sports betting activities such as roulette, bookmaking and slot machines under a separate definition found in subsection (b)(2). Poker, of course, is not one of the activities listed.  </p>

<p>However, many states &#8212; including New York &#8212; have either expressly included poker in their definition of gambling or have concluded that poker is a <a href="http://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1114&context=grrj">game predominated by chance</a> and, accordingly, an illegal gambling activity. In the same manner, state courts have had various opportunities to decide whether poker is considered gambling under different state gambling laws. Federal courts, in contrast, have had less opportunity to do so. In <em>DiCristina</em>, however, Weinstein was presented with this opportunity and took the challenge head-on. Notwithstanding the breadth of Weinstein's opinion in <em>DiCristina</em>, there remain a few legal and policy questions unanswered. </p>

<p>As an initial matter, much of the recent <a href="/dateline/2012/09/gerard-dondero-gambling-law.php">commentary</a> on <em>DiCristina</em> has rightly focused on the glaring conclusion that poker is a game predominated by skill. However, it is important to note that the court had to jump over a few preliminary hurdles before getting to the heart of the case. The court first had to find that the IGBA contained a prerequisite of meeting its own definition of "gambling" &#8212; regardless of whether state law definitively answered that inquiry. Further, it had to conclude that "gambling" under the IGBA only included games predominated by chance. Whether this newly defined prerequisite is legally sound raises some doubts. </p>

<p>Tellingly, the court in <em>DiCristina</em> began its analysis of the statutory text and legislative history of the IGBA by citing <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16815868411499575488">United States v. Turley</a> for the proposition that "[u]nless Congress manifests an 'intent to incorporate diverse state laws into a federal statute, the meaning of [a] federal statute should not be dependent on state law." The court then reasoned that, although subsection (b)(1) unambiguously incorporates state law, subsection (b)(2), which defines "gambling," does not. Instead, the court highlighted that, just like the definition of "State" under the statute, the definition of "gambling" under subsection (b)(2) is a separate and distinct provision from elements under (b)(1). On highlighting this distinction, the court suggests that, under the IGBA and as a matter of sound interpretation, both definitions of "gambling" under subsection (b)(1) and (b)(2) must be met in order to trigger liability under the IGBA. The fundamental flaw in this reasoning is two-fold. </p>

<p>First, the IGBA &#8212; in its entirety &#8212; was undoubtedly meant to rely exclusively on state law in determining whether a particular gambling activity, like poker, was illegal. The court itself recognized that the overriding purpose of the IGBA was to address the rampant increase in organized crime during the 1970's, which involved various gambling activities across the US that were unreachable without the resources of the federal government. But the IGBA was not meant to supplant states from prosecuting the same crimes under state law. The court even noted that "[t]he IGBA was not designed to 'define discrete acts of gambling as independent federal offenses.'" Indeed, the US Congress chose to specifically rely on state law to provide the basis for jurisdiction by requiring that the alleged illegal gambling activity be prohibited under state law. Presumably, if Congress wanted to preempt state law as to what constituted gambling or create a distinct federal crime prohibiting particular gambling activities, it could have done so.  Yet the court posits that if the IGBA was designed to "federalize all state gambling offenses it need not have included any definition of gambling." That logic, however, fails to consider that by including a list of non-exhaustive gambling activities, Congress has done nothing more than provide an example of which illegal gambling business activities concerned it. In so doing, Congress was focused on targeting particular "business operations" not individual gambling activities. Thus, including a definition of gambling does not provide any <a href="http://www.coxsmith.com/portalresource/lookup/wosid/intelliun-104-1802/media.name=/Huffman_pc08_paper%20(gambling).PDF">independent</a> [PDF] significance because the IGBA entirely relies on state law.  </p>

<p>Certainly, it would be difficult to argue that Congress had a substantial federal interest in prosecuting certain gambling activities over others &#8212; if the basis for enacting the IGBA was to focus on criminals that engaged in big scale gambling operations that posed harm to US citizens. To construe the IGBA, as the <em>DiCristina</em> court urges, would not further Congress' purpose in dealing with illegal gambling businesses of major proportions. Rather, it would preclude a class of gambling business activities that violate state law but are not listed in the "gambling" definition found in subsection (b)(2). Indeed, the only other court to expressly address this issue in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6148646581085586928">United States v. Atiyeh</a> supports this conclusion. In <em>Atieyh</em>, the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit concluded that a violation of state law alone was sufficient to trigger liability under the IGBA. Yet <em>DiCristina</em> could do nothing more than distinguish <em>Atiyeh</em> on the basis that it failed to resolve the ambiguities in the text and history of the IGBA. On some level, the <em>DiCristina</em> court equally failed to resolve the same ambiguities; it just reached a divergent conclusion. </p>

<p>Additionally, the IGBA was designed to do precisely what a striking amount of federal laws that have <a href="http://law.asu.edu/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=DfDOr_3KeJ4%3D&tabid=1122">criminalized</a> state statutes have done: use a jurisdictional hook to provide federal prosecutors with a means of achieving their own specific agenda. Under the IGBA, the jurisdictional hook is the two additional elements under (b)(1), which requires that the "illegal gambling business" (1) involve five or more persons who own or manage the business and (2) either remains in business for more than 30 days or has a gross revenue of $2,000 in any single day. While these may be characterized as separate federal elements, they are nothing more than the jurisdictional hook that provides federal prosecutor with the ability to address concerns of those that have historically been state issues. But the jurisdictional hook goes no further. Although Congress may have included examples of specific gambling businesses under subsection (b)(2), nothing in the structure of the statute, the legislative history or the law's purpose suggests that the list was meant to be part of the jurisdictional hook. From a textual and logical perspective, had Congress intended subsection (b)(2) to be a prerequisite to jurisdiction it could have included it as an element under (b)(1). </p>

<p>While Weinstein concluded that poker is a game predominated by skill and not chance, the <em>DiCristina</em> opinion carries limited precedential value on future cases prosecuted under the IGBA because most illegal gambling prosecutions are <a href="http://ipmall.info/hosted_resources/crs/97-619_120124.pdf">primarily</a> [PDF] handled under state prosecutorial authority. More importantly, the court in <em>DiCristina</em> was only able to conclude that poker was not actionable under the IGBA because it created this new prerequisite of meeting the purported federal definition of "gambling" under subsection (b)(2). This begs the question: how far does <em>DiCristina</em> advance the cause that poker is truly a game predominated by skills and not chance? Even if <em>DiCristina</em> becomes authoritative or perhaps persuasive on the issue of whether poker is a game predominated by skill, it seems less apparent whether other federal courts will jump through the same interpretive hurdles to reach that conclusion.  </p>

<p>In sum, even if <em>DiCristina</em> lends support to a normative approach of legalizing poker in the federal arena, its fails to address the IGBA's reliance on the multitude of state law statutes and state law decisions that have unequivocally deemed poker an illegal gambling activity. </p>

The program required all applicants for <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/recovery/programs/tanf/index.html">Temporary Assistance for Needy Families</a> (TANF) to pay for a urinalysis. If the results were positive, applicants would become ineligible to receive TANF benefits for one year.</p>

<p>In a <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id-2212509">forthcoming note</a> in the <em>Stanford Law Review</em>, I argue that, under current Fourth Amendment doctrine, drug testing welfare recipients is indeed unconstitutional. The doctrine of unconstitutional conditions, however, requires a different analysis under which conditioning welfare on consent to such testing may very well be a constitutional condition. No court until the Eleventh Circuit panel has addressed this doctrine in this context; and, unfortunately, the Eleventh Circuit misunderstood and misapplied the doctrine. This doctrine arises when the government offers a benefit that it is "permitted but not compelled to provide" &#8212; such as direct subsidies or exemptions from regulation or taxation &#8212; conditioned on the recipient of the benefit performing or foregoing an activity which he has autonomous choice to participate in and which "a preferred constitutional right normally protects from government interference." There must be a connection, however, between the condition and the benefit; this requirement is usually described as "germaneness." </p>

<p>The germaneness inquiry is intuitive: is the reason the government attaches the condition a reason for which it might refuse to offer the benefit altogether? For example, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10841693014473793601">Nollan v. California Coastal Commission</a>, California informed the owners of a beachfront property that the state would only grant their building permit on "the condition that they allow the public an easement to pass across a portion of their property," which "would make it easier for the public to get to [neighboring areas]." The question was whether this was a constitutional condition. The Court answered that if the state had desired to seize a portion of the property for the purpose of protecting the public's right to view the ocean &#8212; the same reason for which it could legitimately deny the building permit altogether &#8212; then the condition would pass constitutional muster:<blockquote>[T]he Commission's assumed power to forbid construction of the house in order to protect the public's view of the beach must surely include the power to condition construction upon some concession by the owner, even a concession of property rights, that serves the same end.</blockquote>But if the purpose was unrelated, the condition was merely extortion. </p>

<p>A key case in the welfare area is <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7337730325433172859">Lyng v. International Union, UAW</a> in which the Court upheld a 1981 amendment to the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/food_stamps">Food Stamp Act</a> that denied eligibility to anyone engaged in a strike and denied increased allotments if a decrease in income resulted from striking. Striking is a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> right, but the Court held that the law did not have a "substantial impact on any fundamental interest" and thus did not unduly coerce individuals to forgo exercising their rights. Rather, the law "merely declines to extend additional food stamp assistance to striking individuals simply because the decision to strike inevitably leads to a decline in their income." Though the Court did not use the language of germaneness, the conclusion must be that the condition on benefits is germane: because the government could deny benefits on the ground that a recipient willfully reduces his income, it can grant the benefit on the specific condition that the recipient not take such actions, even if that means forgoing a constitutional right. </p>

<p>We are now in a position to understand the Eleventh Circuit's discussion of unconstitutional conditions in <em>Lebron</em>. The panel restated the district court's holding that the government "may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected interests." This proposition is not, however, the thrust of the doctrine, which permits <em>some</em> denying of benefits even when constitutionally protected interests are at stake. Indeed, the panel quoted a US Supreme Court case, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8551511773686011796">Dolan v. City of Tigard</a>, that should have provided better guidance:<blockquote>Under the well-settled doctrine of 'unconstitutional conditions,' the government may not require a person to give up a constitutional right ... in exchange for a discretionary benefit conferred by the government where the benefit sought has little or no relationship to [the right].</blockquote>This is precisely right: the government may not do so <em>where the benefit sought has little or no relationship to the right</em>. When the benefit does have a relationship to the right, the government may, perhaps, withhold the benefit.</p>

<p>The panel cites some decisions to buttress its initial statement that the government simply may not condition the benefit on forgoing a constitutional right; but in all of the cited cases, the issue was either that the germaneness requirement was not met or that the right at issue was too significantly burdened. It is insufficient to determine the outcome of the unconstitutional conditions analysis by citing only to those cases in which the condition was, in fact, found to be unconstitutional and ignoring those in which a condition was upheld.</p>

<p>The concurring opinion in <em>Lebron</em> was more forthright in concluding that the unconstitutional conditions doctrine is muddled and unclear, and hence emphasizes that the panel's holding is no more than that the district court did not abuse its discretion by finding a likely violation of the unconstitutional conditions doctrine. The Supreme Court's holding in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4415013413682250783">Perry v. Sindermann</a>, seems to be particularly determinative for the concurring judge&#8212;and for the majority, which also quoted it&#8212;which made the blanket statement that the government "may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected interests[.]" Yet <em>Perry</em> is hardly the only case on unconstitutional conditions. </p>

<p><em>Perry</em> can stand for nothing more than the proposition that in the context of public employment of college professors, requiring that the employee accept an infringement on his rights to free speech is an unconstitutional condition. In an article titled <a href="http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1341337?uid=3739896&uid=2&uid=4&uid=3739256&sid=21101817065471">Unconstitutional Conditions</a>, former Stanford Law Dean Kathleen Sullivan surveys <em>Perry</em> and other public employment cases, and concludes that the government may sometimes deny First Amendment rights to public employees as a condition of employment, even if it could not do so in <em>Perry</em>:<blockquote>Other conditions on public employee speech also may be upheld because some overriding government purpose justifies them, not because they do not pressure rights. Although the Court has held that the first amendment bars the state from firing public employees for speaking out on matters of public concern, and to bar dismissal from nonpolicymaking government jobs based on political affiliation, it has upheld restrictions on speech or political association that would destroy workplace electoral neutrality, or would impair 'the efficiency of the public services the state performs through its employees,' by, for example, exacerbating labor grievances ... [S]uch conditions [in the latter decisions] should be treated as infringing speech and thus in need of strong justification, but as arguably justified by the need for an efficient or depoliticized bureaucracy.</blockquote>Early cases did, in fact, permit the government to infringe upon the first amendment rights of public employees. As Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes said in perhaps the most famous of the earlier cases, <a href="http://masscases.com/cases/sjc/155/155mass216.html">McAuliffe v. Mayor of New Bedford</a>, that a policeman "may have a constitutional right to talk politics but he has no constitutional right to be a policeman." Sullivan writes that <em>Perry</em> and a long line of other cases have held "that government may not sanction employees for speech on matters of public concern," and thus tempered Holmes' notion "that government may condition employment on silence that it could not constitutionally require of ordinary citizens." But while it is an unconstitutional condition to deny <em>political</em> speech rights to public employees, it does not follow that any condition that infringes upon constitutional rights is an unconstitutional condition.</p>

<p>My forthcoming <em>Stanford Law Review</em> note explains how these cases &#8212; when applied in the drug testing context &#8212; are better explained and certain contradictions in Fourth Amendment doctrine are resolved. For present purposes, it is sufficient to point out how the doctrine examined above would apply to drug testing welfare recipients: for what purposes may the government deny welfare benefits generally? Does conditioning the receipt of these benefits on drug testing further this purpose? It seems that there are only two coherent positions one can adopt. Either drugs do have an impact on productivity, unemployment and absenteeism, and the condition of a drug search is germane, or they do not have such impacts and are not germane. But if one adopts the latter position, one must also question why drug use is illegal at all. The entire premise of criminalizing drug use is that there is some societal harm in that use. The most common arguments for criminalization are either that drug users harm others (and themselves) or they become less productive members of society. </p>

<p>If the aim of public welfare is to help the poor become self-sufficient and productive members of society, then, it seems to this author, all of the stated reasons why drugs should be illegal suggest that the drug search condition might be germane and, thus, constitutional. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.northwestern.edu/faculty/profiles/anthonydamato/">Anthony D'Amato</a> of the Northwestern University School of Law says that <em>habeas corpus</em> rights are too important for the executive branch to ignore, even in a time of war...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/anthonydamato.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>U</strong></font>S President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/holder-drone-strikes-on-us-soil-legal-in-extraordinary-circumstances.php">asserts</a> that he has the constitutional privilege and power to order the killing of any US citizen and then cover it up. This is a sickening and dangerous attack on <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/habeas_corpus">habeas corpus</a>.</p>

<p>The writ of <em>habeas corpus</em>, <a href="http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_9_2s2.html">established</a> by the UK Parliament in 1679, is rightly considered the cornerstone of our liberty in the US. The late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=yfxsQ0zqyc4C&pg=PA153&lpg=PA153#v=onepage&q&f=false">said</a> that if he had to choose between living in a country with the right to vote but no <em>habeas corpus</em>, or a country that had <em>habeas corpus</em> but no right to vote, he'd choose the latter every time. </p>

<p>The "Great Writ" is a judicial order to bring before a court a person in unlawful detention. In some cases the whereabouts of the detainee is known only to the executive. Nevertheless, if a court issues the writ, the detainee must be brought before the court from wherever he may be hidden. The court then examines whether his detention is lawful. <br />
	<br />
It is clearly an <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/a_fortiori">a fortiori</a> violation of <em>habeas corpus</em> if the government, instead of detaining a citizen, murders him. The idea is frighteningly reminiscent of the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/argentina.htm">"disappeared persons"</a> &#8212; the 10,000 to 30,000 citizens of Argentina (the number can only be estimated) who between 1976 and 1983 were <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=argentina+dirty+war">murdered and their bodies hidden or destroyed</a> by a government that was itself a terrorist organization. <br />
	<br />
The US Department of Justice (DOJ) does not discuss <em>habeas corpus</em>, probably because the constitutional language regarding the writ is constraining. The US Constitution <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/art1frag8_user.html#art1_sec9cl2">provides</a> that <em>habeas corpus</em> "shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it." Even though the executive maintains that the "war on terror" is a real war &#8212; continuous and global in scope &#8212; war is not one of the exceptions listed in the Suspension Clause.</p>

<p>The DOJ's recent <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/doj-drone-strike-memo-publicly-released-in-nbc-exclusive.php">white paper</a> goes through legal contortions to justify the lawfulness of government killing &#8212; perhaps with drones &#8212; of a US citizen believed to be a "senior operational leader [of] a terrorist organization engaged in constant plotting against the United States." The targeted individual must be identified by "an informed, high-level official of the U.S. government." Invoking <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6066081450900314197">Baker v. Carr</a>, the white paper excludes the judiciary from the identification of putative terrorists. It claims that matters of foreign policy and national security frequently "involve the exercise of a discretion demonstrably committed to the executive or legislature."<br />
	<br />
Except for the participation of US citizens in al Qaeda or other terrorist groups, there would be no need for legal justification. We are at war with terrorist organizations and have every right under international and constitutional law to use deadly force against their members. We can expect the executive branch to continue its war against terrorist groups despite the participation of US citizens in those groups.</p>

<p>Thus it may be a simple side-effect of our war against terrorists that seems to be leading to the erosion of <em>habeas corpus</em>. It's like saying that this pill will relieve your headache but the side effect is death.</p>

<p>The "Great Writ" must be protected without compromising the war against terrorists.</p>

<p>Let's start with the core scenario: a US national is participating in a terrorist organization that is plotting to use force against the US and its people. I argue that such a person, by voluntarily taking up arms against the US, has impliedly and conclusively renounced his American nationality.</p>

<p>The trio of Supreme Court cases on loss of nationality leave open the possibility of implied renunciation. <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11801725995310713642">Perez v. Brownell</a>, where the petitioner lost his American nationality by voting in a foreign election, was reversed by <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2521246303796542623">Afroyim v. Rusk</a>. <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8267310144688717588">Trop v. Dulles</a> held that a statute stripping a wartime deserter of his US nationality was unconstitutional. The constitutional gravamen of all three cases was the extent of executive power in the field of foreign affairs and national security. Implied renunciation was not and could not have been a holding in any of the cases: voting in a foreign election would be appropriate for a dual national, and the act of military desertion is logically unrelated to the retention or renunciation of nationality. <br />
	<br />
To satisfy due process, the executive should present a motion in open court to any federal district court judge containing the name or names of all US nationals who the government believes are participants in terrorist organizations. The judge can order that the named persons, by taking up arms against the US, have renounced by implication their US nationality. However, if a named person personally appears before the judge within six months and convinces the judge that he was mistakenly identified, the judge will reverse his prior decision and reinstate the applicant's US nationality. </p>

<p>With such a procedure in place, it would be a high crime and an impeachable offense for the president to order the killing of any US citizen.</p>

		<title>Technological and Administrative Doubt: Kenya&#039;s 2013 Elections in Perspective</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist George Kegoro of the <a href="http://www.icj.org/">International Commission of Jurists</a> argues that the results of the 2013 presidential election in Kenya are unavoidably marred by technological failures and the shortcomings of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commissions...<br><hr height="1"><br><font size="3"><strong>N</strong></font>ow that Kenya has completed the general elections for 2013, which ended with the <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/uhuru-kenyatta-declared-winner-of-kenya-presidential-election.php">declaration</a> of Uhuru Kenyatta as the fourth president of Kenya, it is useful to reflect on the whole electoral process in perspective. </p>

                <p>The country must be relieved that large-scale violence &#8212; a <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/kenya-protesters-allege-fraud-in.php">hallmark</a> of the elections in 2007 and about which there was much fear &#8212; did not materialize this time round. However, there was still serious violence, most notably in the coastal regions of Kenya where alleged members of the Mombasa Republican Council (MRC) <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/04/kenyan-elections-marred-mombasa-violence">staged</a> a series of daring attacks aimed at preventing voting. To their credit, the people of the coast bore the threat of violence with great stoicism and still voted in numbers. There is fear, however, that those numbers would have been larger if the violence had not happened.</p>

                <p>In retrospect, the government must review its approach in tackling this group. It should be remembered that in July 2012, the High Court of Kenya gave a <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/kenya-court-lifts-ban-on-independence-group.php">breath of legality</a> to the MRC by lifting a ban that had been imposed on the group by the Kenyan government, which regarded it as an "organized criminal group." At the time, the MRC was not known to espouse violence as a means of achieving its secessionist agenda. The attacks last week have changed all that and it will now be difficult for the MRC to justify their continued right to legal protection. The attacks last week must lead to a re-appraisal of the group with a view towards bringing about an end to its activities.</p>

                <p>The elections gave the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) its first chance to run an election. Formed only in 2010 in the place of the now-defunct Electoral Commission of Kenya, the IEBC has not had the opportunity to run elections before. While acknowledging that these elections were novel in many ways &#8212; as they gave rise to a situation in which the electorate was required to elect six offices in the place of the three traditional offices in Kenya &#8212; the IEBC did not meet the challenges particularly well. Two issues are worth noting in this regard.</p>

                <p>Not unexpectedly, voting was very slow as there were many elections in one. This led to massive queues around the country, the worst of which were in urban centers, particularly Nairobi. The violent attacks in Mombasa also led to a delayed start of polling in the affected areas. The effect of these delays was that the IEBC had completed the voting and started the announcement of results in some areas, while Kenyans in other areas were still standing in slow-moving queues, waiting to vote. This is highly undesirable, as the announcements probably affected the electoral choices of those that were involved. Not surprisingly, one of the participating political parties <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21723488">complained</a> about this reporting problem in the immediate aftermath of the election. With better planning, the IEBC could have minimized these delays. In the future there should be a reporting deadline before which the transmission of election results cannot begin so as to allow those that are still waiting to vote to do so without the influence of rolling results.  </p>

                <p>In these elections, the IEBC embraced technology to promote accountability. Without exception, all of that technology failed. Specifically, the biometric voter registration system (BVR) aimed at identifying voters and preventing ballot stuffing were <a href="http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/?articleID=2000078640&story_title=Kenya-IEBC-to-use-printed-voter-list-after-electronic-register-fails">scrapped</a> by the IEBC in the run-up to the election. In most places, the failure of these systems were the result of the batteries of laptop computers running out of electricity &#8212; often within one hour of the start of the voting. Surely, it was foreseeable that computer batteries would need to be charged. IEBC's failure to prepare for this after the organization acquired the expensive BVR kits smacks of monumental incompetence. The IEBC must be held accountable.</p>

                <p>As a result of this technological failure, there will always be a difficult-to-dispel suspicion surrounding the election results. The Kriegler Commission, which identified the problem of the 2007 elections, dealt with the issue of improbably high voter turnouts and <a href="http://www.ncck.org/index.php/information/publications/115-krieglerreport.pdf">recommended</a> [PDF] reforms. Based on the performance of the IEBC, Kenya is still far from achieving reforms against ballot stuffing and related malpractices. </p>

                <p>There was also a failure of the electronic results transmission system. In the face of this failure, the IEBC <a href="http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/IEBC-turns-to-manual-vote-tallying-after-glitch/-/539546/1713440/-/b2yfk0/-/index.html">resorted</a> to a manual tallying of results which has been criticized for its lack of transparency. In particular, the failure of the transmission system resulted in an inability on the part of the IEBC to declare results as and when they were available. Delayed declaration is regarded as prone to fraud. As part of this manual tabulation system, the IEBC used <a href="http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/?articleID=2000078894&story_title=Kenya-Observers-call-for-scrutiny-of-Form-36">Form 36</a>, which was used to collate polling-station-level election results. As a direct result of this failure, there will always be inherent doubt as to the integrity of these election results.</p>

                <p>Throughout these elections the media and other sectors of society &#8212; perhaps nervous about the failed elections of 2007 &#8212; shunned stories portraying problems with the management of the elections, in general, and the shortcomings of the IEBC in particular. In truth, the presidential elections of 2013, like those of 2007, have been a failure. The similarity is that, like Mwai Kibaki in 2007, Kenyatta has acquired a massive mandate without a commensurate amount of popular legitimacy. The difference is that the failure in 2007 produced violence. Fresh memories of such post-election violence no doubt helped this time around.<br />
                    The overall lesson from the 2013 elections is that Kenya is still a long way from carrying out credible national elections. In the coming months, these problems must be addressed; starting with an audit of the affairs of the IEBC including the expensive, but ultimately useless, gadgets acquired to run the elections. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnists <a href="http://www.law.pace.edu/faculty/randolph-m-mclaughlin">Randolph M. McLaughlin</a> (pictured) and Jonathan A. Jarrell of Pace Law School say stop-and-frisk tactics contribute to a distrust of police and a lack of cooperation in criminal investigations...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/randymclaughlin.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>F</strong></font>or years, New York City police officers have practiced a crime prevention method in which they stop, question and frisk individuals they suspect of engaging in criminal activity. This tactic is commonly known as "<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/stop_and_frisk">stop-and-frisk</a>." Particularly in the Bronx, police officers are allowed to implement this method inside and around certain residential buildings. The practice has led to several lawsuits challenging its constitutionality. </p>

<p>The stop-and-frisk practice of the New York City Police Department (NYPD) has proven to be a discriminatory tool that targets racial minorities and has led to the violation of constitutional rights of thousands of African-Americans and Hispanics in New York City. In 2012, Jacqueline Yates, Letitia Ledan, Roshea Johnson, Kieron Johnson, Jovan Jefferson, Abdullah Turner, Fernando Moronta and Charles Bradley ("plaintiffs") commenced a class action lawsuit, <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/federal-judge-grants-class-action-status-to-challenge-of-nypd-stop-and-frisk-policy.php">Ligon v. City of New York</a>, and moved for a preliminary injunction on behalf of themselves and all similarly situated individuals who are (or could become) victims of NYPD stop-and-frisk practice in the Bronx.</p>

<p>The plaintiffs are African-American or Hispanic residents of New York and alleged that the NYPD's widespread practice of stopping individuals outside buildings that are enrolled in the Trespass Affidavit Program (TAP) is not merely unlawful but unconstitutional. The plaintiffs seek new policies, training and monitoring that will prevent the problems the stop-and-frisk practice presents. TAP was previously known as Operation Clean Halls, and allows the NYPD to stop and frisk individuals they encountered while patrolling inside and around private residential apartment buildings throughout New York City. Property owners must consent to the NYPD officers searching their buildings.</p>

<p>US District Court Judge Shira A. Scheindlin initially <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-judge-declares-nypd-stop-and-frish-policy-unconstitutional.php">granted</a> a preliminary injunction against the NYPD to restrain them from using the stop-and-frisk method while the matter was pending. The court found it likely that the plaintiffs' claims would be successful on the merits, and that building residents would likely suffer irreparable harm without the issuance of an injunction. Among other factors, the court found that the testimony of plaintiffs concerning their allegations and the failure of hundreds of NYPD forms to support any reasonable suspicion of stops made supported the conclusion of a widespread, abusive practice that was a custom of the NYPD and in violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> that protects individuals from unreasonable search and seizure. After balancing the equities and public interest in favor of the plaintiffs, the US District Court for the Southern District of New York ordered the NYPD to immediately "cease performing trespass stops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx without reasonable suspicion of trespass."</p>

<p>Scheindlin also presides over a stop-and-frisk class action, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11961454681378002252">Floyd v. City of New York</a>, that commenced in 2008. Although both cases focus on racial profiling, in <em>Ligon</em> the plaintiffs are specifically challenging the practice of stop and frisk in Bronx residences enrolled in TAP. The plaintiffs in <em>Floyd</em> are addressing problems of the practice throughout all New York City boroughs.</p>

<p>On appeal by the NYPD, Scheindlin <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/jurist-a-judge-for-the-1.php">stayed</a> the preliminary injunction, in <em>Ligon</em>, reasoning that immediate reform that may later require alteration would be inefficient and burdensome to the NYPD, and that it would be a relatively short period of time before a final decision is rendered on the scope of relief. However, the court made it clear that the stop-and-frisk practice as implemented was unconstitutional and must be discontinued. The court maintained that many of the stops made under the stop-and-frisk method violated the Fourth Amendment. Because of the similarities between <em>Ligon</em> and <em>Floyd</em>, the court consolidated the hearings that will determine the appropriate relief. After the consolidated remedies hearing, the court will issue a final decision on the scope of the preliminary injunction. </p>

<p>Each of these cases raises the specter of discriminatory policing. The data collected in support of <em>Floyd</em> clearly showed that 87 percent of persons stopped in the first quarter of 2012 by the NYPD were African-American or Hispanic. Of those stops only 1.3 percent resulted in the seizure of a firearm. The high proportion of minority group members stopped by the police was the same whether the neighborhood was predominantly minority or predominantly white. This type of policing has been called being stopped for "walking while black." There is absolutely no evidence that such tactics contribute to a decrease in crime. There can be no question that such tactics contribute to a distrust of police and a lack of cooperation in criminal investigations. While no one can question the need for the police to use tactics that will ferret out criminal activity, the use of discriminatory practices does not contribute to that goal.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.lls.edu/aboutus/facultyadministration/faculty/facultylistl-r/manheimkarl/">Karl M. Manheim</a> of Loyola Law School in Los Angeles says Twitter should comply with French law, but only within that jurisdiction....<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/karlmanheim.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>A</strong></font> French court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/jurist-a-french-court-on.php">recently ordered</a> Twitter to hand over the account information of users who had posted anti-Semitic and racist tweets. The court order came in a lawsuit brought by the French Union of Jewish Students and SOS Racisme after a slew of anti-Semitic postings on Twitter in late 2012. The postings at issue circulated around the hashtag (topical theme) &#35;AGoodJew which was then followed by tweets like "&#35;AGoodJew is a dead Jew." Twitter removed the posts at issue, consistent with its new "country-withheld content" policy of removing posts which violate local law. However, Twitter has yet to identify the users, as demanded by the French court, because company policy is to respond only to US court orders.</p>

<p>This French case raises the broad question of which country's law has jurisdiction over content on the Internet. Should Twitter comply with French law even though its servers are physically located in the US and it maintains no offices in France? And, as goes France, so goes the rest of Europe. Both <a href="http://jilp.law.ucdavis.edu/blog/posts/twitter-bans-neo-nazi-account-in-germany-a-controversial-step.html">Germany</a> and the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-20545125">UK</a> have also sought to block the activity and accounts of neo-Nazi and gay-bashing users on Twitter.</p>

<p>The fluidity of accessibility to the "cloud" over the Internet, anywhere and anytime, creates complex issues for social media giants such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube (recall the explosive <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-confirms-death-sentences-for-amateur-anti-muslim-film.php">reaction</a> to <em>Innocence of Muslims</em>). Jurisdiction over online activity is a particularly thorny issue, in part because the Internet is ubiquitous and does not respect national boundaries. We even refer to this realm as "cyberspace," as if it were a place unto itself; immune to national and physical laws.</p>

<p>But nations are loath to surrender their sovereignty to a bunch of Internet engineers and social media giants. Nor should they. National laws apply to actions and harms occurring within a country's borders, whether delivered in person, by mail or by tweet. It is a long-standing rule that anyone availing herself of access to a country is subject to its jurisdiction. Delivering tweets into France, or otherwise doing business there, subjects both Twitter and its relevant users to French law.</p>

<p>The US does not like the fact that its citizens and corporations are subject to other nation's laws when doing business there. In 2010, Congress enacted the <a href="http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.uscongress/legislation.111hr2765">Securing the Protection of our Enduring and Established Constitutional Heritage Act</a> (SPEECH), which makes foreign judgments unenforceable in US courts unless they are consistent with the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a>. "Hate speech," including racist and anti-Semitic slurs, is fully protected in the US but not in France. Thus, the French order to disclose certain account information would likely not be enforceable in the US. But, does that mean Twitter can simply ignore it?</p>

<p>Just as wealthy corporations and individuals shelter their assets offshore &#8212; in countries with low or no taxes &#8212; global communications networks may seek to shelter their servers in countries where offensive speech is protected and they are otherwise immunized. If Twitter can defy French law simply because the hate speech circulating on its global network originates or is stored in the US, then France has lost control of its own laws. We may not like those laws, but I think we'd like even less the prospect of France surrendering its sovereignty to Twitter.</p>

<p>What is a fine, upstanding company like Twitter to do when faced with various and inconsistent speech regulations? We live in a networked world and we surely don't want the most repressive or "enlightened" regimes to dictate the content of speech for the rest of us. Even if we were confident in the quality of our own speech laws, exporting them to other countries is a matter for diplomats to negotiate, not corporate managers.</p>

<p>Still, free speech on the internet is one of the most liberating and democratizing features of the information age.  Whether that was their goal or not, Twitter has become an indispensible player in the march toward freedom, as we've seen recently in the "Arab Spring." How can Twitter now surrender to the "thought police," whether in France or elsewhere?</p>

<p>I think there is a simple answer. First, to paraphrase Google's legendary motto: "Don't be evil."  By that I mean that Twitter should not itself become a censor. It should not take down or block tweets which it believes are offensive. As Justice John Marshall Harlan wisely <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7398433541275578772">observed</a>: "One man's vulgarity is another's lyric." If Twitter ever employs a "chief censor," or develops such a policy, it will quickly lose its stature as a conduit for speech and become the speaker itself. Among other things, that could result in the loss of Twitter's "safe harbor" protection under <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d105:h.r.02281:">various US laws</a>.</p>

<p>Equally important, however, Twitter should not resist the laws of countries in which it does business, even if that means shutting down users or blocking messages. We may not like those laws &#8212; and I would hope that Twitter would use its enormous influence to campaign against them &#8212; but it cannot set itself up as above the law.</p>

<p>Twitter may have made a commitment to its users, on privacy and other policies, but as those of us surveilled in US know, sometimes privacy has to yield to law. If Twitter thinks the only law that matters is US law, including SPEECH, it may find itself out of favor and irrelevant in other countries. Indeed, Twitter now faces a € 38 million fine for ignoring the French court. A tough choice for sure, but Twitter, like other companies doing business across borders, either complies with local law or goes home. Personally, I hope Twitter will continue to fight for user privacy and free speech in the French courts, and everywhere, but defying valid court orders is another matter.</p>

<p>Yes, there is a place for civil disobedience and at some point Twitter may want to make a corporate commitment to do just that, but it is a tactic that must be used judiciously; such as where lives or personal safety are at risk. I'm not sure the greater good is served when Twitter is shut down completely in a country simply because the company's executive officers dislike local law.</p>

<p>Bottom line: Twitter should comply with national laws, but only within the jurisdictions to which those laws apply. It has the technical means of doing so, as demonstrated by its new "country-withheld content" policy. However, Twitter cannot export US law to France or elsewhere by the expedient of housing its servers in California and Texas. We can all tweet our disapproval of French law, but we cannot unilaterally repeal it. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.fordham.edu/faculty/nicholasjohnson.htm">Nicholas Johnson</a> of the Fordham University School of Law examines the parallels between gun and abortion rights within the context of the proposed assault weapons ban legislation...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/nicholasjohnson.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n my previous <a href="/forum/2013/02/nicholas-johnson-gun-control.php">piece</a> for JURIST, I demonstrated the inadequacy of the current constitutional analysis used by courts when evaluating restrictions on gun ownership. In two earlier separate assessments in the <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1495925">Rutgers Law Review</a> and the <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1494634">Hastings Law Journal</a>, I have demonstrated the parallels between abortion rights claims and the right to armed self-defense that highlight how both situations pit the right-claimant against substantial competing life-interests.</p>

<p>Within the <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">abortion</a>/gun rights paradigm, there is a particularly salient comparison between the issues raised by a ban on the AR-15 rifle and the analysis in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1902129435857948493">Stenberg v. Carhart</a> overturning Nebraska's "partial birth abortion" ban. (<em>Stenberg</em> was weakened by Court conservatives in <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/supreme-court-upholds-partial-birth.php">Gonzales v. Carhart</a>, but the intriguing question is rooted in Justice Stephen Breyer's opinion).</p>

<p>The comparison between the banned dilation and extraction (D&#38;X) abortion procedure in <em>Stenberg</em> and the AR-15 ban discussed in <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-appeals-court-upholds-dc-gun-laws.php">Heller v. District of Columbia</a> (<em>Heller II</em>) is fitting, both analytically and politically. From the view of the opposition, both "assault weapons" and "partial-birth abortions" (both loaded political terms to which supporters of the rights object) are extreme manifestations of the contested right. As a quantitative matter, both manifestations represent a fraction of what opponents of the associated right object to. Relatedly, both are contrasted to other, less-controversial manifestations of the broader right and those alternatives feed arguments that the right can be respected without permitting especially aggressive, unnecessary or unjustifiable renditions. Both are vigorously defended by supporters on the basis that constitutional protections are fragile and that defeat in a limited context would not end controversy but simply embolden opponents who absolutely oppose the contested right. Both prompt analysis that many people find repugnant &#8212; <em>e.g.</em>, graphic depictions of late-term abortion procedures or discussions of firearms' comparative lethality. </p>

<p>Moreover, abortion rights commentators have repeatedly and aggressively used self-defense themes to construct or sustain the abortion right (<em>e.g.</em>, Judith Thomson's classic <a href="http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2265091?uid=3739840&uid=2&uid=4&uid=3739256&sid=21101771736251">self-defense analogy</a> equates the fetus to a rapidly growing trespasser who threatens to crush the mother against the walls of her own house). Both rights also present a tragedy of competing interests; neither the mother nor the armed self-defender wishes to destroy another "life interest" but is pushed to by exigency.</p>

<p>In <em>Stenberg</em>, Breyer wrote to affirm a woman's right to the abortion methodology best suited to protect life and health, even when lesser but still-safe alternatives are available. This, in principle, is the same question presented by a ban on the AR-15: can the state ban commonly owned guns that in some circumstances represent the best available self-defense option on the rationale that other, less-effective guns remain available? Throughout the <em>Stenberg</em> decision, court liberals answer the parallel abortion question in ways that seem to render substantive principles that transfer readily to the gun context. Here are some examples:</p>

<p><strong>Availability of Alternatives</strong></p>

<p>Breyer flatly rejects the assertion that the constitutional right to abortion is adequately respected by the availability of safe alternatives to the disputed D&#38;X procedure. Where a woman's life or health is at stake, says Breyer, she is entitled to the superior abortion procedure. Even post-viability, the state's interest in the fetus must give way to judgments that the procedure is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother. This protection of better methodologies for exercising a core constitutional right speaks squarely to the armed self-defender's parallel interest in the best commonly owned firearms for particular categories of self-defense. These categories might vary by the nature of the threat or the status of the victim. </p>

<p>Thus, for people who cannot manage the weight or recoil of a heavier, more powerful shotgun, or the hand strength and dexterity demands of the handgun, the AR-15 (or the more prosaic M-1 carbine) may always be the better alternative. (For those unfamiliar with the technology being discussed, operating the slide on a semi-automatic or pulling the double-action trigger on a revolver are more difficult than operating the charging handle on a carbine like the AR-15 or M-1, and long guns braced by two hands and a shoulder are easier to shoot accurately than handguns, which are typically braced only by one or two hands.)</p>

<p><strong>Rarity</strong></p>

<p>The state argued in <em>Stenberg</em> that the D&#38;X procedure was not a protected methodology because it was very rarely used. Rarity of the procedure, said Breyer, "is not highly relevant." The deciding focus is those occasions that "could strike anyone" where D&#38;X is the best methodology. "The State cannot prohibit a person from obtaining treatment simply by pointing out that most people do not need it." In the gun context, this answers the criticism that circumstances where the AR-15 would be optimal may be rare &#8212; <em>e.g.</em>, disorder following a natural disaster, a rural self-defender facing multiple attackers. Under Breyer's "rarity" analysis, the deciding factor is that the AR-15 has special utilities in particular scenarios. </p>

<p>Thus, the state cannot deny right-bearers who might require the distinct utilities of the AR-15 on the argument that "most people do not need" them. Breyer takes the point a step further, acknowledging that rarity might reflect that D&#38;X truly has no special utility. Empirically there was strong evidence to support this, but the Court resolved to err in favor of the right-bearer. Extending that presumption to the gun context, even if there is a dispute as to whether the AR-15 is a better choice for people who cannot be proficient with other guns, <em>Stenberg</em> principles dictate that plausible claims that the AR-15 is sometimes optimal should trump gun bans.</p>

<p><strong>Is the Disputed Methodology Never the Best Option?</strong></p>

<p>The empirical debate over whether D&#38;X is ever the best alternative for saving the life or health of the mother sharpens the core message of <em>Stenberg</em>: if the state can show that the contested methodology is never the best option for protecting life or health, then the partial-birth abortion ban is permissible. The <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment">Second Amendment</a> claimant's burden is comparatively easier because firearms utility is easier to quantify. Partial-birth abortion utility is controversial because of disputes between doctors that are in part subjective &#8212; a function of what method particular doctors prefer. Assertions of AR-15 utility &#8212; lower recoil and intermediate ballistics (less lethal than standard deer rifles) &#8212; are grounded on objectively measurable physical characteristics.</p>

<p><strong>Dismissing Irrational Distinctions</strong></p>

<p>Breyer claimed that the Nebraska statute banning D&#38;X abortions did not really further the state's asserted interest in the "potentiality" of human life. Specifically, Breyer argued that the Nebraska statute was not actually aimed at saving any particular fetus from destruction because the statute's scope only affected a rare abortion procedure while other abortion methods remained freely available. Thus, the rationale for banning partial-birth abortion was illusory because abortion is a broadly protected constitutional right that unquestionably could be exercised through alternative means. Justice John Paul Stevens' concurrence put the point more bluntly, arguing that the Nebraska statute was not even rational because there is no reason to believe that the banned procedure was any "more brutal, more gruesome, or less respectful of potential life'" than the permitted procedures. </p>

<p>Here, Stevens and Breyer echo almost exactly Circuit Judge Brett Kavanaugh's dissent in <em>Heller II</em>. Kavanaugh argued that it was incoherent for the District of Columbia to ban semi-automatic rifles but not semi-automatic handguns that accounted for the bulk of gun crime. His assessment tracks criticisms that I and others leveled at aspects of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d103:H.R.3355:">Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994</a> &#8212; <em>e.g.</em>, that banning the AR-15 and exempting a large residual category of visually distinct but functionally indistinguishable guns was incoherent as a crime-control or safety measure; that the "assault weapons" distinction is incoherent because other types of similarly deadly guns remain readily available; and the core category of explicitly constitutionally protected guns (handguns) account for the vast majority of gun crime. Tracking Stevens' <em>Stenberg</em> argument, how does a ban on semi-automatic rifles with pistol grips and folding stocks serve the state interest in limiting firearms externalities when functionally identical and far more destructive guns are explicitly permitted in the same legislation and are otherwise constitutionally protected?</p>

<p>My recent <a href="http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/pdf/2-27-13JohnsonTestimony.pdf">testimony</a> [PDF] before the Senate Judiciary Committee expanded this point with a comparison between the "assault weapons" defined in the <a href="http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.uscongress/legislation.113s150">Assault Weapons Ban of 2013</a>, sponsored by US Sen. Dianne Feinstein, and the US Army <a href="http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/armylaw1997&g_sent=1&collection=journals&id=813">study</a> of the combat shotgun, which shows that even on the criteria of multishot capability the guns on the ban list are inferior to tens of millions of "good guns" that the Feinstein bill would anoint as acceptable and lawful to own. The comparison shows that not only is the rhetoric used to define the assault weapon technically dubious (<em>e.g.</em>, spray fire weapons designed to shoot from the hip without aiming), but these descriptions actually more accurately capture a broad category of guns on the good gun list. It is a textbook irrational distinction.</p>

<p><strong>Common Use, Levels of Scrutiny, Undue Burden</strong></p>

<p>Those filters capture the basic range of analytical options the Court might deploy in evaluating an assault weapons case. But, ultimately, the question may turn on practical politics.</p>

<p>When <em>Heller</em> first came down, Cass Sunstein <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1204942">speculated</a> that the Court was in some sense just affirming a US norm that most people think you should be able to have a handgun in the home for self-defense. Polling shows that people in the US are more divided on the question of assault weapons. This is exacerbated by the difficulty of defining precisely what "assault weapons" are (consider the AR-15 described above) and the erroneous impression that many have that they are machine guns or otherwise exceptional compared to other repeating technology. If that picture remains murky and Sunstien's assessment is correct, I query whether the Court would even take an assault weapons case &#8212; no matter how much the lower courts have mangled or defied its guidance in <em>Heller</em>. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://lapa.princeton.edu/peopledetail.php?ID=528">Gabor Halmai</a> of E&#246;tv&#246;s L&#243;r&#225;nd University, Budapest says that the Fourth Amendment to the Fundamental Law of Hungary undermines several constitutional rights and implicates the entire scheme of constitutionalism in Hungary...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/gabor_halmai.jpg" width="120" height="200" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n February 26, 2013, Hungary's Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/hungary-constitutional-court-strikes-down-church-law.php">issued</a> a <a href="http://public.mkab.hu/dev/dontesek.nsf/0/B139EF59DD213D0BC1257ADA00524EC0?OpenDocument">ruling </a> striking down the law granting official designation to churches in Hungary. Specifically, the court repealed parts of the law as unconstitutional, arguing that the registration of churches by the National Assembly of Hungary does not provide a fair procedure for the applicants. In addition, the court also prescribed the conditions of fair procedure for future legislation. But on March 11, a new amendment to the <a href="http://www.kormany.hu/download/4/c3/30000/THE%20FUNDAMENTAL%20LAW%20OF%20HUNGARY.pdf">Fundamental Law of Hungary</a> [PDF] was <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/hungary-lawmakers-approve-controversial-constitutional-amendments.php">adopted</a>, which put the same provisions that were found unconstitutional by the court into the text of the constitution. This amendment also prohibits the Constitutional Court from reviewing the constitutionality of amendments to the Fundamental Law. The amendment, which entered into force on April 1, 2013, was proposed by the governing Fidesz party which has the two-thirds majority in parliament that was needed for a constitutional amendment to be accepted. </p>

<p>So, this is the end of the short version of the story &#8212; it is also the end of the freedom to establish new churches in Hungary.</p>

<p>According to Hungarian law on the status of the churches, as well as a separate law on the <a href="http://lapa.princeton.edu/hosteddocs/hungary/The%20Act%20on%20the%20Transitional%20Provisions%20of%20the%20Fundamental%20Law.pdf">Transitional Provisions of the Fundamental Law</a> [PDF] ("Transitional Provisions"), the power to designate legally recognized churches is vested in the parliament itself. The law has listed 14 legally recognized churches and required all other previously registered churches (some 330 religious organizations in total) to either re-register under considerably more demanding criteria, or continue to operate as religious associations without the legal benefits offered to the recognized churches (<em>e.g.</em>, tax exemptions and the ability to operate state-subsidized religious schools). As a result, only 18 have been able to re-register, so the vast majority of previously registered churches have been deprived of their status as legal-entities. Because registration requires an internal democratic decision-making structure, the majority of previously registered churches were not able to continue to operate with any legal recognition under the new regime. Non-traditional and non-mainstream religious communities &#8212; which had not encountered legal obstacles between 1989 and 2011 &#8212; are now facing increasing hardships and discrimination as a result.</p>

<p>Seventeen of the deregistered churches filed a constitutional complaint to the Constitutional Court, arguing that deregistration by a political body violated the requirements of access to court and the right to a legal remedy granted in the Fundamental Law. Moreover, they argued that the criteria churches must meet to regain their legal entity status are not transparent, and the procedure specified in the law is incomplete. As a result, the provision that gives parliament the power to designate legally recognized churches confers an essentially discretionary power. </p>

<p>When the petition was submitted, there was little chance of victory because the text of the Transitional Provisions &#8212; which also contained the new system of registration &#8212; claimed that every provision is part of the Fundamental Law. But at the very end of 2012, the Constitutional Court declared that those parts of the Transitional Provisions which are not transitory in nature (including re-registration of the churches) cannot be construed as part of the constitution and are, therefore, invalid. This ruling made it possible for the court to review the very substance of the law on the status of the churches and find it unconstitutional.</p>

<p>Besides entrenching the unconstitutional procedure of church recognition, the <a href="http://lapa.princeton.edu/hosteddocs/hungary/Fourth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20FL%20-Eng%20Corrected.pdf">Fourth Amendment</a> [PDF] seems to exclude the possibility of constitutional complaint against a negative decision of the parliament. The new text of the constitution says that churches may appeal to the Constitutional Court from amendments made to the law on the status of churches. But this law will only be amended when the parliament agrees to include the petitioning church in the set of officially recognized churches. In case of refusal of the church's application, the parliament issues an order declining the petition. There is no amendment to the law in this case. Therefore, only those churches that succeed in their petition to parliament can appeal to the Constitutional Court, while the churches that fail to persuade the legislature cannot.</p>

<p>By elevating the annulled non-transitory provisions of the Transitional Provisions into the main text of the Fundamental Law, the intention of the Fourth Amendment is to exclude further constitutional review. Besides the procedure regarding the recognition of the churches, there are many other issues lifted to constitutional rank. Among them is the authorization of the head of the National Judicial Office to select another court, if they think that the competent one is overloaded with cases. Similarly, provisions annulled earlier by the Constitutional Court, besides the ones that were part of the Transitional Provisions, have become part of the amendment and, consequently, part of the constitution after its promulgation on March 25. One of them is an authorization of the legislature to set conditions for state support in higher education, such as mandating that graduates of state universities remain in the country for a certain period of time after graduation. Another revenge for the previous declaration of unconstitutionality is the authorization of both the legislature and local governments to <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/04/06/149526299/homelessness-becomes-a-crime-in-hungary">make homelessness unlawful</a>. </p>

<p>At the end of 2012, the court had annulled the very definition of the family in the law on the protection of families. Now the Fundamental Law defines marriage and the parent-child relationship as the basis of a family relationship, excluding non-marital partnerships. Likewise, the Constitutional Court had expressed concerns about private law limitations on hate speech. The new amendment was made to allow such limitations, not only to protect racial and other minorities, but also to protect the dignity of the members of the Hungarian nation. Finally there is a set of amendments related to the power of the Constitutional Court itself, as a direct reaction to recent unwelcome decisions of the judges. The most alarming one annuls all Court decisions, including the decisions on freedom of religion, prior to when the Fundamental Law was entered into force. </p>

<p>Therefore, the Fourth Amendment intensifies the outcome of the Fundamental Law, killing off not only freedom of religion, and many other fundamental rights, but the entire scheme of constitutionalism in Hungary.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/faculty/elrod-linda.php">Linda D. Elrod</a> of the Washburn University School of Law evaluates the Kansas Supreme Court's ruling that non-biological, same-sex parents can have parental rights....<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/lindaelrod.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he Kansas Supreme Court recently <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/kansas-high-court-rules-non-biological-same-sex-parent-can-have-parental-rights.php">applied</a> the <a href="http://www.kansasjudicialcouncil.org/Documents/Legislation/2010 Legislation/Domestic Code_Final_.pdf">Kansas Parentage Act</a> [PDF] to same-sex couples. The court stated that it was in the best interests of the children and that the children had a constitutional right to the opportunity for two parents, including families headed by same-sex parents.  In upholding co-parenting agreements signed by the two women before and after the births of two daughters, the court opened the door for the use of contracts regarding parental rights so long as the contracts do not violate public policy, i.e. are not injurious to the public or in contravention of some established interest of society. Specifically, courts can enforce co-parenting contracts that promote the best interests, rights and welfare of children. Such contracts are essential to assure that children born with assisted reproductive technologies (who have same-sex parents) can benefit from the resources of both parents. </p>

<p>In 1995, two women began living together and decided to start a family using artificial insemination. While the original intent had been for each to carry one pregnancy, for health reasons one woman gave birth to both children. In 2002 and again in 2004, the women executed co-parenting agreements before and after the births of their daughters. The parties agreed to "jointly and equally share parental responsibility." The contracts gave both mothers powers of attorney for healthcare decisions and named each other as co-parents. The women and children lived as a family for several years until the biological mother moved out with the children. When she decided to move to Texas, the non-biological mother filed to enforce the parenting agreement and for an equitable partition of property. The Johnson County District Court, finding subject matter jurisdiction via "highly unusual or extraordinary circumstances" and the Kansas Parentage Act, applied the best interests of the child and awarded joint legal custody and granted parenting time. The court also divided their property. The biological mother appealed.</p>

<p>In enforcing the parties' contracts regarding both the children and property issues, the Kansas Supreme Court broke new ground. The court <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12714118549928449854">held</a> that the co-parenting contract was not "baby-selling," which would be automatically unenforceable as against public policy. There is no violation of the parental preference doctrine. The biological mother is not abdicating her duties and responsibilities as a parent; she is sharing them. She is actually exercising her <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">due process</a> right to make decisions regarding the care, custody and control of her children by entering into the co-parenting agreement. She could contract to share parental rights without government interference by nullifying the agreement, so long as the agreement is in the best interests of the children. The court ruled that "[a] parent may knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive his or her rights under the Kansas parental preference doctrine" under certain circumstances, including when there is another person ready and willing to be the child's second parent. Here, the contract named the nonbiological parent as a <em>de facto</em> parent. The Kansas Parentage Act permits the creation of presumptive motherhood through written acknowledgment. The contract was such an acknowledgment.</p>

<p>The Kansas Supreme Court found the children were third-party beneficiaries of the co-parenting agreement. Specifically, the court cited the US Supreme Court's holding in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3943884308230077577">Gomez v. Perez</a> to support the proposition that the Equal Protection Clause of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> requires equal protection for all children regardless of the status or sex of their parents:</p>

<blockquote>Denying a child conceived by artificial insemination the opportunity to have two parents through a co-parenting agreement does not comport with the constitutional mandate to provide substantive legal equality for all children regardless of the marital status of their parents.</blockquote>

<p>The agreement was not injurious to the public because it provided children with the resources of two parents. Because one of the children showed evidence of emotional issues, the court remanded with instructions to further explore the best interests of the children.</p>

<p>On the property issue, it is now clear that same-sex couples, even though they <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">cannot marry in Kansas</a>, may have their property divided under the same principles of heterosexual cohabitating couples. The key is whether the property was jointly acquired or intended to be jointly acquired during the relationship.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Serge Diaz, <a href="http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/">University of Edinburgh School of Law</a> Class of 2015, discusses the effects of a recent ruling by the UK Court of Appeal on UK criminal record disclosures laws...<hr height='1'><br /><font size='3'><strong>O</strong></font>n January 29, 2013, the UK Court of Appeal handed down a disappointing <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/uk-appeals-court-rules-disclosure-law-violates-human-rights.php">judgment</a> for the UK government in the case of <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2013/25.html">R v. Chief Constable of Greater Manchester</a>, declaring that the current statutory regime governing criminal record disclosures in the context of employment is incompatible with Article 8 of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/Convention_ENG.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [PDF]. The court criticized the system for being too harsh and disproportionate on job seekers, whose entire criminal record is laid before the employer when the latter elects to obtain a criminal record certificate on the applicant. Albeit the court ruling does not automatically invalidate the concerned legislation &#8212; namely the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1997/50/contents">Police Act 1997</a> ("the 1997 Act") and the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1975/1023/contents/made">Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (Exceptions) Order 1975/1023</a> ("the ROA Order") &#8212; and its legal implications are limited to monetary damages payable to the triumphant plaintiffs by the government, its political consequences are far-reaching given the current political climate in Europe, where courts often countermand democratically elected legislatures under the ethos of vindicating human rights of minorities. The UK government has to act fast, and it has already chosen the legal avenue of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21245308">appealing</a> the decision to the UK Supreme Court. So while the final say in the case belongs to the justices of the UK Supreme Court, curious academics cannot abstain from making multifarious forecasts as to what party will eventually come out victorious.</p>

<p>The ECHR became transposed into the domestic law of the UK in 1998 when the UK Parliament passed the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/contents">Human Rights Act 1998</a> (HRA). Section 1(1) of the HRA enumerates which articles of the ECHR are incorporated under the heading of "Convention rights" while Section 1(2) provides that those rights "are to have effect." This is not to say that before 1998, the UK was a despotic regime devoid of such notion as human rights. Many of those rights were already entrenched at common law, such as the <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/KB/1765/J98.html">right</a> not to have your house searched without a warrant. However, the ECHR did add clarity and certainty to the UK legal system by codifying human rights.<br />
	<br />
Article 8 of the ECHR, which is included in the definition of "Convention rights" under Section 1(1)(a) of the HRA, guarantees our right to "private and family life." The issue in <em>Chief Constable of Greater Manchester</em> was whether the 1997 Act and the ROA Order contained provisions contravening Article 8. Section 5(2) of the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/53">Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974</a> (ROA) provides that after the passage of relevant time (from three to ten years, depending on the circumstances), certain convictions become spent and no longer have to be disclosed under Section 4(2) of the act. Paragraph 3(3) of Schedule 2 to the act extends the same provision to cautions given by the police, which are spent either at the time they are given or at the end of the relevant time if the caution contains special conditions with which the offender must comply. However, Article 3 of the ROA Order excludes the protection given by the ROA if a person seeks employment in a field listed in Part II of Schedule 1 to the order, which includes "any work ... relating to vulnerable adults" and "any work ... relating to children." For the purposes of these exempted questions, a criminal record certificate may be obtained by the employer under Section 113A of the 1997 Act, or under Section 113B of the 1997 Act if it is an enhanced criminal record certificate, which will disclose all of the applicant's convictions or cautions.<br />
	<br />
The case featured three plaintiffs, who applied to the court under Section 4(2) of the HRA for a declaration of incompatibility. The first plaintiff (T) was warned twice by the police at the age of 11 for stealing bicycles. The second plaintiff (JB) was cautioned by the police as an adult because she forgot to pay for a packet of fake nails before leaving a store. The third plaintiff (AW) was convicted of manslaughter and robbery at the age of 16. T sought employment in the childcare sector. JB wanted to work with vulnerable adults. AW applied to join the army. Their poor criminal records rendered their career choices nonviable.</p>

<p>The court recognized that criminal record checks could interfere with Article 8 of the ECHR since they disclosed private information that the targeted individual may have wanted to keep to himself to third parties and affected the individual's employment prospects, thus restricting his ability to develop relationships with others. In ruling in favor of the first and second plaintiffs, the court relied on the <a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100418065544/http:/police.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/about-us/ind-review-crim/index1f8d.html?view=Standard&pubID=691590">report</a> of the Independent Advisor for Criminality Information Management, which suggested that employers often misinterpret information printed on criminal record certificates and prefer to err on the safe side by rejecting such applications. It was also suggested that there was a blanket requirement of disclosure, and the courts in the UK have <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldjudgmt/jd021125/ander-1.htm">demonstrated</a> their general contempt for rules of a blanket nature, wherein the government confines itself to one extremely inflexible policy. It is also evident that the court sympathized with the first plaintiff, characterizing him as a "man of good character," qualifying his offense as "trivial" and emphasizing that he was only 11 years of age when he was cautioned.<br />
	<br />
However, there were some considerations that the court failed to take into account when handing down the judgment. First and foremost is the fact that some of the exempt occupations include positions in the police, military, air force, etc., which inevitably have a bearing on national security. The courts normally prefer to abstain from regulating those matters for <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1983/6.html">obvious reasons</a>. Are we sure we want to run the risk of employing ex-offenders in these sectors, given that according to <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Criminology.html?id=ZLvOPAAACAAJ">Criminology</a> approximately 70 percent of offenders aged 16 to 18 subsequently reoffend? Secondly, the suggestion that many employers misinterpret criminal record certificate is not entirely accurate. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-code-of-practice">Disclosure and Barring Service Code of Practice</a> states that those employers who seek a criminal record disclosure "must have a written policy on the suitability of ex-offenders that is available upon request to potential applicants." Thus, the absence of a clean rap sheet does not automatically lead to the applicant being rejected. Finally, how about the counterbalancing Article 8 right of children and parents in this country, who are surely entitled to make choices pertaining to education, in case they are not entirely in favor of ex-convicts teaching at public schools?<br />
	<br />
Perhaps, many of us are under the impression that cautions, warnings or reprimands are given by the police in cases where the offense is trivial and/or solid evidence is lacking. Such impressions are a delusion. Conditional cautions are administered under Section 22 of the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/44/contents">Criminal Justice Act 2003</a>, with additional criteria laid out in Section 23. Thus, there must be evidence that the person has committed the offense, the person must admit to having committed the offense and the public prosecutor must be satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to charge the person with the offense. If conditions attached to the caution are not complied with by the offender, he must be arrested and prosecuted for the same offense under Sections 24(1), 24A(1) and 24A(2). A <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2000/1139/contents/made">caution will not be recorded</a> on the Police National Computer unless it is given for an offense punishable by imprisonment. For offenders under the age of 18, reprimands and warnings are issued instead of cautions under Section 65 of the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/37/contents">Crime and Disorder Act 1998</a>, which carry similar legal effects to adult cautions. Cautions, warnings and reprimands must be viewed as a form of mercy from the police (or in some cases the result of lack of funds to institute criminal proceedings), rather than the innocence of suspects. Statistical evidence <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/363457/Child-rapists-let-off-with-police-cautions">suggests</a> that "25 [percent] of offenders who abuse children were let off with a caution," which is already a "betrayal of our justice system," according to MP Priti Patel. It is unclear why the court considered the myriad of these filtering mechanisms to be insufficient.<br />
	<br />
The legal basis for the court decision was the ratio in the case of <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/fra/pages/search.aspx?i=001-114517#{"itemid":["001-114517"]}">M.M. v. United Kingdom</a>. <em>M.M.</em> concerned a woman cautioned for abducting her grandson in 2000. She disclosed her caution to the prospective employer in 2006 and had her offer of employment in the childcare sector revoked. The case climbed all the way up to the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), which held that the applicant's Article 8 rights had been breached. The court said that "indiscriminate and open-ended collection of criminal record data is unlikely to comply with the requirements of Article 8 in the absence of clear and detailed statutory regulations clarifying the safeguards applicable." The court in <em>Chief Constable of Greater Manchester</em> found such guidance sound.<br />
	<br />
However, <em>M.M.</em> could, in theory, be distinguished on its facts. The case took place in Northern Ireland, which has a different statutory framework for disclosing convictions and cautions. ROA is not in force in Northern Ireland. Instead, there is an analogous piece of legislation, <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/1978/1908/article/6">Rehabilitation of Offenders (Northern Ireland) Order 1978</a>, which fails to provide a time frame of expunging cautions from criminal records. In other words, cautions are weeded out at the discretion of the police. In light of the murder of two school girls in Soham, England, the police in Northern Ireland adopted a policy whereby all convictions and cautions wherein the injured party is a child were kept on the record of the offender for life. Contrast this approach with the laws of England and Scotland, where, unless you apply for an employment of an exempted nature, the ROA will kick in, and you will not be obliged to answer any questions about your spent convictions or cautions. No such framework exists in Northern Ireland with respect to cautions, and, of course, the ECtHR would be highly critical of the situation. Its reasoning in <em>M.M.</em> obviously pertained to the specific legislative regime in Northern Ireland. If it had not, then why make a contrasting reference to English and Scottish statutes in the first place? It seems that the UK Court of Appeal took the judgment in <em>M.M.</em> out of its legal context and erroneously extrapolated it to <em>Chief Constable of Greater Manchester</em>.<br />
	<br />
Having said that, it is true that the case of T specifically deserves sympathy. The legislation punished him too harshly for his misconduct as a child. A sound option was suggested by the secretary of state to read down the legislation, in accordance with Section 3(1) of the HRA, which requires the courts, "so far as it is possible to do so," to read and give effect to legislation in a way which is compatible with the convention rights. Thus, the provisions of the ROA Order would apply, save for cases where this would breach the convention rights. This proposition did not appeal to the court in <em>Chief Constable of Greater Manchester</em>, since it constituted a major change to the legislation and placed too much burden on the employers in respect of identifying the exact scope of these convention rights. But why not place such burden on the police? Aren't they in the best position to decide what should be included on the criminal record certificate with a view to safeguarding the public and what should be expunged so as not to breach the applicant's human rights? They are a law enforcement agency after all. </p>

<p>Judges have already demonstrated their preparedness to alter the legislation so as to render it compatible with the ECHR, even if the alterations are somewhat drastic. In <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2001/25.html">R v. A</a>, the plaintiff sought a declaration of incompatibility concerning Section 41 of the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1999/23/contents">Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999</a> since it did not allow to adduce any evidence about complainant's sexual behavior in cases of sexual offenses, except in very limited circumstances. The House of Lords read down the act insofar as to render it applicable only where the accused's right to a fair trial was not breached. Thus, the courts have demonstrated their willingness to travel elaborate distances to interpret legislation in line with the convention rights, recognizing that declaration of incompatibility should be viewed as a last resort. It is unclear why the court in <em>Chief Constable of Greater Manchester</em> did not employ this convenient balancing tool, but it could be because it considered that the current statutory regime should be thoroughly revised. The consequences of such revision from the ground up can be dangerous.<br />
	<br />
There is a good legal and empirical case to retain the current legislative framework surrounding criminal record checks. The filtering mechanism has a degree of sophistication, the legal authorities on its incompatibility are at best inconclusive and, in deciding the case of <em>Chief Constable of Great Manchester</em>, the court had the common law authority to adopt a more permissive interpretation of current legislation. It is unclear why the UK Court of Appeal urged Parliament to make drastic amendments to the concerned statues. The UK government could succeed in their appeal to the UK Supreme Court if it raises the relevant concerns, or at least we might be given more persuasive reasons as to why the ROA Order and the 1997 Act are incompatible with the ECHR.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/about-us/staff-board/kadidal,-shayana">Shane Kadidal</a> of the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> argues that even if the government's petition for <em>en banc</em> review of <em>al Bahlul v. US</em> fails, it will nonetheless succeed in maintaining the political status quo of the Obama administration...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/shanekadidal.jpg" width="120" height="200" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>here are, basically, only two ways to leave Guantanamo today: in a coffin, or by pleading guilty in a military commission and serving out your sentence. Since this gives most detainees a shared incentive with the military prosecutors to arrange for plea-bargained convictions, it might surprise readers to hear that hardly any cases are moving forward in the commissions today. That is largely because of two rulings from the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=hamdan+v+us&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&case=15648526132006268678&scilh=0">Hamdan v. US</a> (<em>Hamdan II</em>) and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=bahlul+v+united+states&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=10679230458541546109&scilh=0">al Bahlul v. US</a>. Those opinions reversed convictions for providing material support for terrorism (<em>Hamdan II</em>) and conspiracy (<em>Bahlul</em>) in the military commissions created by Congress in the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-109publ366/pdf/PLAW-109publ366.pdf">Military Commissions Act of 2006</a> [PDF] (MCA).</p>

                <p>The <em>Hamdan II</em> court held that a material support prosecution under the 2006 statute for conduct that took place before 2006 would raise serious constitutional questions under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#section9">ex post facto clause</a> prohibiting the government from retroactively criminalizing actions. Hamdan was detained, like nearly every Guantanamo detainee, well before 2006. Rather than deciding the constitutional question, the <em>Hamdan II</em> panel avoided the issue by basing their ruling on statutory grounds: Congress, the Court said, did not intend to retroactively criminalize anything that was not already a crime under the customary international law of war. Since material support was not an acknowledged crime under the international law of war (something even the government conceded), Hamdan's conviction had to be overturned. </p>

                <p>The government did not appeal, perhaps in part because Hamdan had already been released, having served out his sentence. Eventually, though, stories surfaced claiming a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/08/us/us-lawyers-divided-over-prosecuting-terrorism-cases.html?ref=world&_r=1&">deep rift</a> between the US Department of Justice (DOJ) (which supposedly wanted to appeal) and the military prosecutors (who, apparently, thought the DC Circuit was correct).</p>

                <p>A second opportunity arose when Ali al Bahlul's appeal came to the circuit court. Al Bahlul had been sentenced to life on conspiracy charges related to his role as a propagandist for al Qaeda. The government filed a curious <a href="http://www.lawfareblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Government-Supplemental-Brief-Al-Bahlul.pdf">brief</a> [PDF] on appeal, noting that if <em>Hamdan II</em> were correct, then al Bahlul's conspiracy conviction must fall as well, since the <em>Hamdan II</em> panel decision was precedent binding all subsequent panels in the DC Circuit. Conspiracy, like material support, was also concededly not a violation of the international law of war. However, the government reserved the right to seek reconsideration of whether the <em>Hamdan II</em> panel was correct before the full DC Circuit, sitting <em>en banc</em>, and, perhaps, subsequently before the US Supreme Court as well.</p>

                <p>The panel in al Bahlul's appeal ultimately vacated his conviction. The impact of the decisions in <em>Hamdan II</em> and <em>al Bahlul</em>, should they stand, will be great: according to my informal count, material support or conspiracy have been included as charges in 28 of the 30 charge sheets filed in the military commissions since the MCA passed. Remove those generic offenses and it becomes increasingly difficult for the relatively non-culpable mass of detainees, not cleared for release by the Obama administration, to find something plausible to plead guilty to. Without something to plead guilty to, these detainees will simply sit indefinitely in detention, as it has become <a href="http://www.lawfareblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Seton-Hall.pdf">practically impossible</a> [PDF] to win release through <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/habeas_corpus">habeas corpus</a>. Furthermore, the politics of bringing detainees to the US for trial have foreclosed federal criminal courts as a possible option.</p>

                <p>What is the government seeking to appeal in its <a href="http://www.lawfareblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Bahlul-En-Banc.pdf">petition</a> [PDF] for <em>en banc</em> review in <em>al Bahlul</em>? Curiously, it's not the notion that conspiracy was a recognized war crime under international law. As with material support, the government does not even argue that conspiracy is an international war crime. Instead, the <em>en banc</em> petition argues that the <em>Hamdan II</em> panel was wrong to look exclusively to the <em>international</em> law of war. Instead, the DOJ claims there are <em>domestic</em> precedents for prosecuting conspiracy in military commissions, mostly during the US Civil War. While the petition states this "traditional practice is especially clear regarding conspiracy," one imagines there is no such early precedent for the relatively recent concept of material support. Perhaps, this provides intellectual consistency to the DOJ's decision to pursue <em>en banc</em> review in <em>al Bahlul</em> but not in <em>Hamdan II</em>.</p>

                <p>The question at issue is whether the courts should decide whether conspiracy was an established war crime under the customary international law of war, or whether it is enough to simply find that conspiracy was established as a war crime under the "domestic common law" of war &#8212; the past practices of only American military commissions. The <em>Hamdan II</em> panel gave only the briefest treatment to this question of international and domestic law because it thought the question conclusively decided in favor of international law by the Supreme Court in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=hamdan+v+rumsefld&hl=en&as_sdt=3,39&case=1251834070131661299&scilh=0">Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</a> (<em>Hamdan I</em>). </p>

                <p>The issue certainly appeals to those in Congress who oppose all attempts by American courts to apply anything calling itself "international" law. Will it appeal to anyone in a black robe? For insight we need to turn to the distasteful business of counting votes. On the DC Circuit, we know that Judges <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf/content/VL+-+Judges+-+BMK">Kavanaugh</a>, <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf/content/VL+-+Judges+-+DHG">Ginsburg</a> and <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf/content/VL+-+Judges+-+DBS">Sentelle</a> &#8212; the panelists in <em>Hamdan II</em> &#8212; will not agree with the government. Justice Douglas Ginsburg was a senior judge when the panel sat and Sentelle has since taken senior status, removing him from the <em>en banc</em> voting pool. Their opinion will certainly carry weight with their colleagues. Judges <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf/content/VL+-+Judges+-+ARR">Randolph</a> and <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf/content/VL+-+Judges+-+LHS">Silberman</a>, who have written many vituperative opinions in Guantanamo cases since <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2483936489630436485&q=boumediene&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">Boumediene</a>, also have senior status and will not vote. Of the six remaining active-duty judges, two are liberals (<a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf/content/VL+-+Judges+-+DST">Tatel</a>, <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf/content/VL+-+Judges+-+JWR+">Rogers</a>) and one a moderate Democrat (<a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf/content/VL+-+Judges+-+MBG">Garland</a>). The DOJ would need to win one of their votes to get to an <em>en banc</em> hearing. This seems unlikely. </p>

                <p>It is worth noting that there are four vacancies on the court at the current time. However, all four are likely to remain open for some time. President Barack Obama has made only two nominations, one of whom (<a href="http://www.afj.org/judicial-selection/nominees/caitlin-halligan.html?templateName=template-30435193">Caitlin Halligan</a>) was successfully <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/07/us/politics/republicans-again-block-confirmation-of-judicial-nominee-halligan.html?_r=0">filibustered</a> earlier this month. The Democrats are apparently unwilling to push back against the stonewalling, content to see what happens with the other nominee, <a href="http://www.afj.org/judicial-selection/nominees/sri-srinivasan.html?templateName=template-30435193">Sri Srinivasan</a> &#8212; a lawyer in President George W. Bush's solicitor general's office who appeared in many national security cases &#8212; rather than pushing a full complement of four nominees before the Senate. Even if Srinivasan could make it onto the bench in time, a 4-4 split would not be enough to give the government <em>en banc</em> review &#8212; a flat-out majority is required. </p>

                <p>What about the Supreme Court? Hamdan had an appeal go there already, in a case challenging the military commissions Bush created by <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/11/20011113-27.html">executive order</a>. In that 2006 decision, <em>Hamdan I</em>, the Court overturned the commissions system because it was not authorized by statute. Congress responded by passing the MCA which created the current commissions system. There was an additional issue that the Court almost decided &#8212; whether conspiracy was a traditional war crime triable by commission. Four of the eight justices voting in <em>Hamdan I</em> (there was one recusal, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/justices/roberts.bio.html">Chief Justice John Roberts</a>) held that conspiracy was not a crime recognized under the relevant common law of war: common law of war offenses needed to have "clear and unequivocal" precedent and the international precedent was not there &#8212; most pointedly at Nuremburg. Even as to domestic past practice, the Court said that "[t]he crime of 'conspiracy' has rarely if ever been tried as such in this country by any law-of-war military commission not exercising some other form of jurisdiction" such as that originating with military governance of an area under martial law. </p>

                <p>Why, then, try to push the same issue before the Court now? Well, those four justices were Justices <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/justices/stevens.bio.html">John Paul Stevens</a>, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/justices/souter.bio.html">David Souter</a>, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/justices/breyer.bio.html">Stephen Breyer</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/justices/ginsburg.bio.html">Ginsburg</a> and the former two are no longer on the Court. Their replacements &#8212; like every new justice since Stevens joined the court in 1975, except Ginsburg &#8212; have been more conservative than those they replaced. Nonetheless, it still seems unlikely that Justices <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/justices/sotomayor.bio.html">Sonia Sotomayor</a> or <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/justices/kagan.bio.html">Elena Kagan</a> will endorse the DOJ's position. </p>

                <p>That leaves Justice <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/justices/kennedy.bio.html">Anthony Kennedy</a>. His concurrence in <em>Hamdan I</em>, the deciding fifth vote, found it premature to reach the issue of whether conspiracy was an offense under the common law of war. Writing only for himself in Part III of his concurrence in <em>Hamdan I</em>, he reserved the issue. Earlier in his opinion, Kennedy noted that the "law of war ... derives from 'rules and precepts of the law of nations'; it is the body of international law governing armed conflict."  That's hardly hopeful language for the government on the one issue on appeal in <em>al Bahlul</em>: whether international or domestic common law is the touchstone for determining whether conspiracy was a recognized war crime.</p>

                <p>The only grounds for optimism for the government is that Kennedy, in refusing to reach the conspiracy issue, noted that "Congress may choose to provide further guidance" regarding the "validity of the conspiracy charge," and that "Congress, not the Court, is the branch in the better position" to make that determination. Perhaps the government is thinking Kennedy will find Congress' codification of conspiracy as an offense in the MCA (passed four months after the <em>Hamdan I</em> decision) adds weight to the government's position. Kennedy also said the task of establishing offenses left to Congress was a "sensitive task of establishing a principle not inconsistent with the national interest <em>or international justice</em>[,]" (emphasis added). Again, that hardly seems grounds to think Kennedy will find the "domestic common law of war" argument persuasive.</p>

                <p>The government's appellate strategy is a long shot. It was certainly not forced by the need to keep al Bahlul in custody. Al Bahlul has shown <a href="http://www.lawfareblog.com/2011/11/more-on-the-governments-challenge-to-bahluls-counsel/">no inclination</a> to work with lawyers so far. Nothing in the public record would lead observers to expect that he would pursue a <em>habeas</em> petition. He seems to be facing life detention at Guantanamo whether or not his conviction stands.</p>

                <p>The political status quo is furthered by taking such a long-shot appeal. By drawing this issue out through the appellate process, the administration will be able to continue asserting that commissions are a viable forum for trying Guantanamo detainees. Instead of bringing the political fight to the demagogues in Congress &#8212; and elsewhere &#8212; who opposed civilian court trials for Guantanamo detainees, the president can claim that he is waiting for the Supreme Court to change the <em>Hamdan II</em> ruling so that he can move cases forward offshore. Meanwhile, only the existing prosecutions of the 9/11 and Cole plotters will move forward &#8212; both cases involve charges other than material support and unadorned conspiracy &#8212; distracting from the fact that nothing is happening for the other 28 remaining detainees designated for prosecution. Maintaining the status quo has been the central principle of Obama's counterterrorism strategy. Unlikely as it is to succeed, the <em>en banc</em> petition in <em>al Bahlul</em> would fit that pattern.</p>

		<title>Judicial Review of Targeted Killing: A Bad Idea by a Good Person</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.utah.edu/faculty/faculty-profile/?id=wayne-mccormack">Wayne McCormack</a> of the University of Utah SJ Quinney College of Law says that proposals to subject the executive branch's proposed targeted killings to a process of judicial review misunderstand the nature of the judiciary and the rule of law...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/waynemccormack.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font> most respectfully but vociferously disagree with my friend, colleague and office neighbor, <a href="/forum/2013/03/amos-guiora-drone-policy.php">Professor Amos Guiora</a>, over the prospect of judicial review in advance of a decision to kill a US citizen &#8212; or anyone else for that matter. My objections are not to his criteria for the use of lethal force but to the process by which he would involve <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii">Article III</a> judges in a most injudicious activity. With his usual balance and sensitivity to the problems, here is what Guiora proposes:<blockquote>The dangers inherent in the use of state power are enormous. On the opposite side of the equation, however, is the terrible cost of terrorism; after all, terrorists deliberately target innocent civilians[.] Rather than relying on the executive branch to make decisions in a "closed world" devoid of oversight and review, the intelligence information justifying the proposed action must be submitted to a court that would ascertain the information's admissibility.</blockquote>I have written <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/opinion/55817445-82/armed-conflict-war-law.html.csp">elsewhere</a> that the US Department of Justice's (DOJ) "<a href="/paperchase/2013/02/doj-drone-strike-memo-publicly-released-in-nbc-exclusive.php">White Paper on Lethal Operations</a>" (the current euphemism for killing individuals) is wrong-headed in its reliance on the law of armed conflict as the justification for targeting a person who is supposedly an "imminent threat." The policy "does not require the [US] to have clear evidence that a specific attack on [US] persons and interests will take place in the immediate future." The fuzziness of this notion of "imminent threat" stems directly from the proposition that the US is in a "state of armed conflict with al-Qaida."</p>

<p>The problems with declaring an "armed conflict against al-Qaida" are several. Certainly, an insurgent group fighting for control of an occupied territory &#8212; such as the US faced in <a href="/feature/featured/iraq-war/">Iraq</a> for several years and now faces in Afghanistan &#8212; qualifies as a party to an "armed conflict." But a loosely aligned number of groups, perhaps communicating across the internet and perhaps sharing money and weapons provided by rogue regimes or criminal activities, hardly qualify as identifiable entities fighting for political objectives.</p>

<p>This notion of "armed conflict" could now draw the judiciary into a posture utterly incompatible with its role as the independent arbiter of the law. The function of a court is to decide disputes on the basis of principle, not preference. If the courts were to become enmeshed in deciding who is to be preferred over whom, they would lose the critical function of credibility upon which the rule of law depends. As the "<a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/home/histdox/fed_78.html">least dangerous branch</a>," the judiciary has no power over either purse or sword but is absolutely essential to preserving the rights of the minority from the potential tyranny of the majority.</p>

<p>Guiora proposes that a court hear the "intelligence" &#8212; not "evidence" &#8212; against a person in secret before deciding whether that person is to die. This contravenes not just all of our constitutional safeguards of due process and confrontation of witnesses, but it enlists the judiciary into the service of the executive. If there are to be executions of persons who cannot be captured, which I am willing to admit may be justifiable in extreme cases of imminent threat, please do not damage the impartiality and credibility of the judiciary in the process. It is a fragile enough institution as it is.</p>

<p>The state must have a monopoly over the legitimate use of force. For force to be exercised legitimately it must comply with the rule of law, and the essence of the rule of law is visibility and uniformity in application of rules. It took me a while to figure out why the statue of Lady Justice is presented blindfolded &#8212; who wants a decision maker who doesn't know what's going on around her? But I finally realized that the blindfold is so that she doesn't know who the parties are. She applies the law according to the book in her hand, not according to the persons before her or even her own preferences. For all these reasons, clandestine executions are necessarily extralegal necessary perhaps but not legitimate.</p>

<p>Despite the rule of law, we have recognized since the dawn of the republic, indeed since the dawn of civilization, that some executive action must be taken clandestinely for the safety of the nation. In my view, it is better that such action be left in the shadows rather than given a patina of legitimacy by judicial authority. The concept of a "license to kill" cannot be entirely fictitious for the simple reason that some threats are not capable of being met by the rule of law.</p>

<p>Threats that could justify clandestine executions, however, must be rare. I would certainly demand a much higher degree of "imminent threat" than the DOJ white paper envisions. And, like the <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Politics/sctassass.html">Israeli High Court of Justice</a>, I would insist on some reasonably independent after-action review to be sure that such extraordinary power is being used advisedly. I would much prefer to see a sharply curtailed number of instances than what we have seen lately, if for no other reason than that such indiscriminate use of violence fuels the jihadist fervor against us.</p>

<p>Although it is a good idea that there be a relatively independent review board over clandestine executions, the judiciary is not the place to put such an obligation. Let us preserve the judiciary for the function it does well, the evaluation of arguments on the basis of principle rather than guesswork over secret intelligence.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.msu.edu/faculty_staff/profile.php?prof=8">Susan H. Bitensky</a> of the Michigan State University College of Law says that the International Labor Organization's recent report addressing gaps in the current legal regime erected against forced labor is commendable but unsatisfying, arguing that it only superficially touches upon forced labor's root causes: poverty and profit...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/betinsky.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>magine that you are coerced into drudgery that you do not want to do, all day long, day after miserable day, without end. Such is <a href="http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/subjects-covered-by-international-labour-standards/forced-labour/lang--en/index.htm">forced labor</a>, an utter negation of personal autonomy and human dignity. It should, therefore, come as no surprise that this brutal form of "employment" has been directly or indirectly prohibited by at least 24 international human rights law instruments, many of which originated with the International Labor Organization (ILO).</p>

<p>One of the ILO's foundational prohibitory treaties on the subject is the <a href="http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C029">Forced Labor Convention of 1930 (No. 29)</a> ("Convention No. 29"). It provides a legal definition of forced labor as "all work or service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily." Authoritative interpretation holds that the phrase "all work or service" means that Convention No. 29's provisions apply to all types of work, service and employment, regardless of the industry or sector where it occurs; the phrase is also said to cover trafficking in persons for forced labor purposes.</p>

<p>The ILO has <a href="http://www.ilo.org/sapfl/lang--en/index.htm">set</a> itself the ambitious goal of abolishing forced labor by 2015. There is no mission more urgent, for forced labor exists in the twenty-first century on a truly epic scale:<ul class="disc" style="list-style-position:inside"><li>Internationally, at least 20.9 million men, women and children are victims of forced labor and, of these, 26 percent are under 18 years of age.</li><li>Out of the total 20.9 million victims, 90 percent (18.7 million) are subjected to forced labor by private individuals or enterprises, while the remaining 10 percent (2.2 million) are compelled to work by governments or rebel military groups.</li><li>Among those people subjected to forced labor by the private sector, 68 percent (14.2 million) undergo "forced labor exploitation," in contradistinction to another 22 percent (4.5 million) who undergo forced sexual exploitation in particular.</li></ul><br />
These hardest and coldest of facts reveal not only the overwhelming presence of forced labor, but also that private enterprise is overwhelmingly its perpetrator. Consequently, the latter revelation should figure prominently in any ILO calculations respecting where best to aim its regulatory and programmatic firepower.</p>

<p>In February 2013, the ILO <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-urges-greater-effort-to-end-forced-labor.php">issued</a> its "Report for discussion at the Tripartite Meeting of Experts concerning the possible adoption of an ILO instrument to supplement the Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No.29)" ("2013 report" or "report"). One of the report's major conclusions is that forced labor's continuing robustness largely results from gaps in the current international legal regime that has been erected against the practice, as well as from various nations' flawed domestic integration of the regime's human rights standards. The report's authors find the most worrisome gaps with respect to prevention, victim protection and trafficking in persons (as these matters relate to forced labor specifically).</p>

<p>To deal with the law-gap problem, the report calls for a protocol to amend Convention No. 29 or for the adoption a new convention. The report advises that the instrument should embrace comprehensive and/or integrated approaches, including guidelines for frameworks to fill the identified lacunae, compensation for victims and punishment of perpetrators. The report especially urges that such a protocol or convention should "be complemented by detailed provisions [for implementation] that could be contained in a Recommendation adopted at the same time." Though the details of implementation are supposed to be discretionary for those states party to the instrument, the burden would be on a state party to justify any deviation from them.</p>

<p>The 2013 report is commendable. It highlights the scourge of forced labor, something we should never lose sight of. The report's call for a protocol or new convention, one that would make private perpetrators (and their public brethren) subject to damages and prosecution, is right on target. The proposed implementation scheme is equally praiseworthy. While it may be weak tea when compared to typical domestically prescribed criminal law penalties of fines or incarceration, the scheme can only be fairly evaluated in the context of international human rights law's less demanding enforcement measures.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there is something unsatisfying in an ILO narrative that is confined to remedying the vast, intractable problem of forced labor exclusively by filling law-gaps and with a treaty of this ilk. The trouble may be that the 2013 report only superficially touches upon forced labor's root causes of, on the one hand, pandemic and profound poverty, and, on the other hand, rapacious greed engendered by a profit motive gone haywire. (Incidentally, the report's downplaying of this linkage is apparently not aberrational. There is, for instance, no mention whatsoever of forced labor in that portion of the ILO <a href="http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/%20economic-and-social-development/lang--en/index.htm">website</a> devoted to the role of poverty in economic and social development.) These dual dynamics of poverty and profit are critically important inasmuch as they create the supply and demand &#8212; the very lifeblood &#8212; of forced labor.</p>

<p>It is no secret that poverty <a href="http://go.worldbank.org/9J44H01O51">afflicts</a> massive numbers of people around the world. In 2008, 1.29 billion people were living in extreme poverty (<em>i.e.</em>, subsisting on less than $1.25 a day) and another 1.18 billion people were struggling to eke out a living on $1.25 to $2.00 per day &#8212; a range <a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/EXTPA/0,,contentMDK:20040961~menuPK:435040~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:430367~isCURL:Y,00.html">described</a> by The World Bank as leaving this cohort "vulnerable and poor." It requires no great insight to realize that if so many were not so desperately poor, there would be far, far fewer falling into forced labor's toils.</p>

<p>On the other side of the forced labor relationship is the hunger for profits that undergirds most countries' economic systems to one degree or another. With some real restraints on business' frequently overactive appetite, there probably would be a much lower incidence of the profit motive carried to its ugliest extreme &#8212; forced labor, the <em>ne plus ultra</em> of cheap labor. It should be recalled in this connection that the private sector is responsible for 90 percent of all forced labor. The ILO further has opined that "[c]oncerns are ... increasing ... relating to forced labor in global supply chains." We are, it appears, awash in more private perpetrators than we ever conceived of. Indeed, the cotton in your clothing and the gold in your jewelry, sold by "reputable" retailors, may well have been <a href="http://www.dol.gov/ilab/programs/ocft/2012TVPRA.pdf">produced</a> [PDF] via forced labor at the bottom link of the chain.</p>

<p>Because the report gives short shrift to the operation of poverty and profit, it is hardly noticeable that the report issues no complementary call for reforms that, in tandem with curing law-gaps, could jump start the process of arresting these underlying causes. The report could have proposed, say, collaborative lawmaking and action between the ILO and other inter-governmental agencies with expertise in ameliorating poverty or reining in abusive business practices. The report's silence in this regard turns thunderous when one pauses to remember that forced labor is a widespread human rights transgression of the first magnitude and that the transgression will certainly persist as long as its first causes do.</p>

<p>These deficiencies in the 2013 report additionally put the ILO at cross-purposes with some of the very principles it has laid down for itself to follow. For example, the ILO has <a href="http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/leg/download/constitution.pdf">committed</a> [PDF] to judging unacceptable any national or international economic policies that impede the individual's right to pursue his or her material well-being "in conditions of freedom and dignity, of economic security and equal opportunity." Might not this principle be broad enough to induce ILO determinations about the unacceptability of policies permitting or encouraging the poverty-profit matrix? Moreover, should not the ILO collaboratively take on poverty and profit in accordance with its own constitutional requirement of cooperation "with public international organizations having specialized responsibilities in related fields"?</p>

<p>Unless and until the ILO seriously addresses forced labor's socio-economic <em>sine qua non</em>, the organization should at least assume and fulfill the moral duty of making its reports more forthright. That is, the ILO's future reports on forced labor should put poverty and injurious profit-making in the spotlight and thoroughly explain what these root causes are and how they inevitably lead to forced labor. Furthermore, future reports should candidly acknowledge any shortcomings in the ILO's efforts to extirpate these causes. Otherwise, the general public, including those unfortunates wearing their lives away in forced labor, may falsely think there is hope for abolition sometime soon.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Felipe Alberto Herrera, <a href="http://www.law.northwestern.edu/">Northwestern Law School</a> Class of 2013, discusses the effects of the recent educational reforms in Mexico...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/dateline/felipeherrera.jpg" width="120" height="200" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>ver the past several weeks, national education reform has become a sizzling topic of debate in Mexico. The debate climaxed with the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/mexico-president-signs-major-education-reform-law.php">February arrest</a> of Elba Esther Gordillo, former head of Mexico's national teachers' union, on allegations of embezzlement. Gordillo's arrest is like a <em>telenovela</em> and an irresistible spectacle: the sums of money she is accused of stealing are staggering, as is the gawdiness of the items she acquired with it. There are even websites that will show you the California mansions and retail credit card bills she allegedly acquired over the years at the expense of Mexican students.</p>

<p>It is no surprise that Gordillo's arrest has drawn cyber-gawkers from both sides of the border, many of whom wonder whether or not Mexico finally "means business" when it comes to fighting corruption. Whether or not Mexico means business is especially important in the education context, because education is Mexican President Enrique Pe&#241;a Nieto's first policy issue in his term after being <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/mexico-authorities-confirm-presidential-election-results.php">elected</a> last November. His victory also marks the return of the previously entrenched Institutional Revolutionary Party after a 12-year hiatus at the hands of the National Action Party. How Mexico reforms education can signal either a reversion to pre-2000 politics or, perhaps, a heartening stride away from corruption. </p>

<p>By looking at the law behind the reforms, it seems that the same politics that defined Mexico during the last century have returned. Specifically, a key piece of quasi-legislation called the <a href="http://pactopormexico.org/acuerdos/#sociedad-de-derechos">Pacto Por M&#233;xico</a> may give us a sense of the overall contours of education reform, and the seriousness of the new president's resolve. The <em>pacto</em> is important politically because it was Nieto's presidential platform. Its legal significance is even more important, considering that the document will form the legal basis and roadmap for changes to make reform. The drafters of the <em>pacto</em> moreover, assert that this document is itself a constitutional reform designed to bring equity and quality to Mexico's private and public schools.<br />
 <br />
The <em>pacto's</em> section on education calls for the following initiatives, among others:<ul class="disc" style="list-style-position:inside"><li>A centralized database of school, student and administrator information to "facilitate monitoring and communication" between education authorities schools. (<em>Compromiso</em> 7)</li><li>Plenary authority to the National Education Evaluation Institute, which will implement comprehensive criteria for evaluating school progress and teacher standards. (<em>Compromiso</em> 8)</li><li>Independent, decentralized (charter-like) governance over local schools. (<em>Compromiso</em> 9)</li><li>An increase in the hours of the school day to "full time" (rather than the reigning model of two half-day sessions). (<em>Compromiso</em> 10)</li><li>Laptops with wireless internet capability for all of the nation's fifth and sixth graders. (<em>Compromiso</em> 11)</li><li>A national scholarship program that will provide a work-study program for the nation's lowest 40 percent income range of students in middle and high school. (<em>Compromiso</em> 15)</li></ul></p>

<p><strong>Critique of Education Provision in Pact</strong></p>

<p>Just from this handful of provisions, it's apparent that education reform is unlikely in Mexico. For starters, the document sends mixed signals about the ultimate authority on education. On one hand, the provisions on governance signal a shift from micromanagement to one of independence and local discretion. At the same time, however, the <em>pacto</em> also contains conditions. These sorts of inconsistencies create confusion for the educator and the lawmaker alike. Another problem is the absence of any explanation as to the source or logic of these ideas. Borrowing language from constitutional and administrative law, it seems there is no <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/rational_basis">rational basis</a> to any of these provisions. This is an invitation for slow, arbitrary and capricious policy, and in the Mexican context, an open door for more corruption. </p>

<p>Perhaps most emblematic of this problem is the <em>pacto's</em> set of technology-heavy solutions. Why is it that fifth and sixth graders get these technologies, and yet no provisions of this type are made for students in other levels? Technology may be a good thing. In fact, Rupert Murdoch endorsed this approach in a recent editorial on the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203914304576631100415237430.html">Steve Jobs Approach to Education Reform</a>. The point is, however, that it's hard to ignore the attendant problems that can come with such an outsourcing of education to technology. Most problematic of all is how little the education provisions do in the way of prescribing how to create the critical infrastructure they prescribe. Where will the funds come from, for example, to endow the scholarship and work-study programs? How will it work? These sorts of questions will take many years and political battles to resolve, which will only stand in the way of a meaningful reform. </p>

<p><strong>General Critique of the Pact</strong></p>

<p>As a general matter, the <em>pacto</em> itself suffers from many of the same problems of scope, framing and vagueness as its education provisions. Its scope is overly ambitious. In addition to education, the document calls for sweeping reform in four other areas: employment and economic development, security and justice, transparency and corruption control and democratic governance. If successful then, this <em>pacto</em> would do just about as much as the New Deal, the Warren Court and Obama's second administration combined, in terms of changing the socio-legal and administrative landscape in Mexico. And this is all in a country with no real serious rule of law or toothy judiciary. Do we really believe in a document like this? Mexico's observers certainly do not. The <em>pacto's</em> education website attacks many valid critiques as "myths." </p>

<p>The <em>pacto's</em> overall framing is also troublesome for its reliance on malleable terms and conditions. Take for example, the <em>compromiso</em> language, which translates to a "promise," not a resolution or actual law. Sneaky framing negatively affects education in particular. For example, in section V of the <em>pacto</em>, which contains a table summary of all the education provisions, all but two of the <em>compromisos</em> are conditioned on the full implementation of the educational reforms on approval of the <a href="http://eleconomista.com.mx/taxonomy/term/12373">Reforma Hacendaria</a> a reform of Mexico's revenue law. Not only then are the <em>pacto's</em> ideas lofty, ill-defined and arguably unattainable, they are also presented as a rotten carrot to bait the passage of other reforms in unrelated fields such as revenue and telecom. </p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>All in all, it seems the <em>pacto</em> is a reform not of law, but rather of the use of social media and political theater. The <em>pacto</em> has also been touted as a roadmap for economic progress, and that it very well may be. A harbinger and roadmap for education reform however, it definitely is not.</p>

<p>As a budding lawyer of Mexican heritage, I truly want to believe that things like Gordillo's arrest and the <em>Pacto por M&#233;xico</em> signal Mexico's decided and long-awaited clamp-down on corruption. But the reality might be just the opposite. I will stay tuned &#8212; and so should you &#8212; for more from the legal drama unfolding in Mexico. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www1.su.edu/cf/faculty/_faculty_profiles1.cfm?uid=eleonard">Eric Leonard</a>, the Henkel Family Chair in International Affairs at <a href="http://www.su.edu/">Shenandoah University</a>, argues that the ongoing pursuit of justice 19 years after the Rwandan genocide is a positive step for international criminal justice that should be praised, not dismissed...<br><hr height="1"><br><font size="3"><strong>A</strong></font>round this time 19 years ago, two crucial events occurred in the tiny African nation-state of <a href="http://www.gov.rw/">Rwanda</a>. First, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) posted a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/RWANDA941.PDF">report</a> [PDF] that detailed the continued arming of militias in Rwanda. This document, "Arming Rwanda," paints a clear picture of the situation on the ground and the possible consequences of illegally importing arms to Rwanda. Second, the UN general overseeing the peacekeeping operation in Rwanda, Romeo Dallaire, had his request to raid the arms cache <a href="http://deltaprize.uga.edu/recipients/romeo_a._dallaire/">denied</a> by the UN. The result, as we are now well-aware, was a rapid decline into one of history's most horrific genocides. Beginning on April 6, 1994 and continuing for one hundred days after, <a href="http://www.unitedhumanrights.org/genocide/genocide_in_rwanda.htm">genocide</a> claimed the lives of at least 800,000 people in Rwanda. </p>

                <p>Today, Rwandans still cope with the aftermath of this egregious act. Recently, a Rwandan accused of complicity in the genocide was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/rwanda-genocide-suspect-arrested-in-france.php">arrested</a> in France, showing the conflict's continued effects. This also initiates discussion of how best to judicially cope with such situations, since the response to Rwanda was and remains multifaceted. Such an approach may represent the future of international criminal justice and the culmination in the battle to end impunity.</p>

                <p>On a globalized level, the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> (UNSC) established the <a href="http://www.unictr.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) in 1994. Having completed 72 cases, with one still in progress, the ICTR has been successful. However, it has not been void of criticism, as nine accused individuals remain at large. As the work of the court comes to a close, I am sure that a more detailed assessment of its work will occur. Presently, it appears that the court's mandate was fulfilled &#8212; albeit in a limited number of cases &#8212; and a piece of the "justice puzzle" has been put into place.</p>

                <p>Along with these international justice efforts, there was also a robust domestic response. Rwandans took justice into their own hands &#8212; a necessity given the sheer magnitude of the crimes and the number of alleged perpetrators. One of the more interesting methods in use are the <a href="http://www.asil.org/insights110623.cfm">gacaca courts</a>. These localized forums of justice are more communal and less judicial. Their purpose focuses more on restorative justice than retribution, with an emphasis on healing the community through the proceedings. They are seen as a necessary means of bringing realistic justice in the wake of the 1994 genocide.</p>

                <p>A third method of pursuing justice in Rwanda derives from universal jurisdiction: the concept of prosecution by a state that has no direct territorial or personal relation to a case. In other words, the crime being prosecuted under universal jurisdiction is not committed on the territory of the prosecuting state, nor is the perpetrator or victim a national of the state. One such prosecution was the 2001 trial of the "Butare Four" in Belgium. On June 8, 2001, the Assize Court of Brussels found Alphonse Higaniro, Vincent Ntezimana, Sister Gertrude (Consolata Mukangano) and Sister Maria Kisito (Julienne Mukabutera) guilty of crimes committed during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Although all of the accused were residing in Belgium at the time of their arrest, none of the <em>Butare Four</em> were Belgian citizens, none of the victims were Belgian citizens and none of the crimes were committed on Belgian soil. The trial and prosecution of the <em>Butare Four</em> appears to be a case of pure universal jurisdiction &#8212; one of the few in human rights' legal history. </p>

                <p>However, this is just one example of many cases in which universal jurisdiction has been cited as legal justification for prosecuting Rwandan citizens outside of Rwanda and the ICTR. The most recent occurred on February 14, 2013 in Norway, where the Oslo District Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/norway-court-convicts-rwandan-genocide-defendant.php">found</a> Sadi Bugingo guilty of complicity in the premeditated killings of at least 2,000 people &#8212; most of them Tutsi citizens. </p>

                <p>Enter the current case of France and its relationship to the 1994 genocide. The case under discussion involves the arrest and possible extradition of Rwandan citizen Innocent Musabyimana. Such extradition is not unprecedented; other cases pending in French courts indicate that the French government is willing to prosecute Rwandan citizens. However, Musabyimana would be the first Rwandan citizen that France actually prosecutes. Despite these developments, the <a href="http://www.collectifpartiescivilesrwanda.fr/">Collectif des Parties Civiles pour le Rwanda</a> (CPCR), an association that pursues genocide suspects living in France, insists that this marks only a small step in the effort to prosecute <em>genocidaires</em> living in France. </p>

                <p>Skepticism aside, these cases encapsulate the many means of achieving global justice and the necessary cooperation in the struggle to end impunity. France's arrest of these Rwandans, as well as their possible extradition, reinforces both the international nature of the crimes committed and France's increasing desire to assist Rwanda in its quest for justice. Given the somewhat cold relationship that these two countries have had since the 1994 genocide, this is a very positive diplomatic step. The situation also reveals the ever-evolving nature of addressing human rights violations on an international level, which should not be disregarded. International criminal justice is making strides in a variety of ways, and this should be applauded, rather than constantly criticized. </p>

		<title>&#039;Too Little Justice&#039;: Misdemeanor Defendants in the US</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.hrw.org/bios/alba-morales">Alba Morales</a>, a researcher with <a href"http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a>, argues that indigent defendants are not receiving proper instructions regarding their right to counsel, a problem leading to uneducated plea bargains...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he day's business in the Midland County Court Court-at-Law &#35;2 in Midland, Texas, begins promptly at 9 a.m. every day. <a href="http://www.co.midland.tx.us/departments/ccl/ccl2/Pages/Judge-Marvin-L.-Moore.aspx">Judge Marvin L. Moore</a> addresses the crowded courtroom, as well as some defendants who are "attending" via videoconference from jail. He rattles off the defendants' rights at what seems like an auctioneer's pace ("You have the right to a trial, to be represented by an attorney at trial, to cross-examine witnesses..."), dispenses a few admonitions ("a DUI can cost you your license if you are under 21," if you are not a citizen "a plea can result in deportation") and concludes with a quick primer on court procedure &#8212; all inside of four minutes. </p>

                <p>Moore calls the first case. A prosecutor informs the defendant of the charges against him. The defendant confers with one of the half-dozen prosecutors in the courtroom, then enters a plea of guilty. It's 9:05 a.m.</p>

                <p>This pace rarely lags as the day wears on, and the routine varies little: the judge delivers his rapid-fire recitation; charges are read; defendant huddles with prosecutors to negotiate a plea deal; defendant pleads guilty. In fact, of the 50 defendants who appeared before the judge on this particular Thursday in February on charges ranging from shoplifting to assault, 36 entered pleas of guilty or no contest.</p>

                <p>Not a single defendant received a single word of defense advice (there are no defense attorneys in the courtroom, only prosecutors). Nor does Moore explain to defendants that they have the right to be appointed an attorney if they cannot afford one. And yet, every defendant who entered a plea that day gave up fundamental rights, was exposed to a possible term of imprisonment and, in many instances, received a criminal conviction. A misdemeanor conviction, which can carry a sentence ranging from a fine to a year in jail, can have far-reaching consequences that range from making people ineligible to hold certain jobs to affecting eligibility for student loans, public housing and food stamps.</p>

                <p>Fifty years ago this month, the US Supreme Court ruled in the landmark case of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=694784363938594707">Gideon v. Wainwright</a> that defendants charged with a felony have a constitutional right to counsel in criminal trials, even if they cannot afford one themselves. Nine years after <em>Gideon</em>, the Supreme Court <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0407_0025_ZS.html">expanded</a> that right to misdemeanor cases in which defendants face possible jail time.</p>

                <p>I went to Midland because I had heard that poor people in this West Texas county, particularly those charged with misdemeanors, have a very difficult time enjoying their right to counsel. The numbers appear to bear this out: in Midland in 2012, defendants were appointed counsel in slightly more than 6 percent of misdemeanor cases, compared with almost 40 percent in the state of Texas as a whole. While nobody tracks nationwide data on the appointment of counsel, a <a href="http://bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/siljq.pdf">1996 survey of inmates in local jails</a> [PDF] around the country found that over a quarter of misdemeanor defendants did not have an attorney. Thus, Midland represents one of the worst cases of an already bad situation nationwide.</p>

                <p>It is unclear why so few Midland defendants receive any legal advice prior to pleading guilty. Like most criminal courts in the country, the Midland court seems to prize efficiency. One private defense attorney I spoke with said that this emphasis on efficiency was certainly part of the attitude in Midland. He said that a defendant really had to push to get assigned counsel, and it was not something that judges agreed to easily or took the time to explain. Also, like most counties in Texas, Midland lacks a public defender office (only 91 of Texas' 254 counties have public defenders).</p>

                <p>This failure to protect the right to counsel runs counter to both the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/">US Constitution</a> and international human rights law. In 1992, the US became party to the <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/b3ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR), which requires a defendant "to have legal assistance assigned to him, in any case where the interests of justice so require[.]"</p>

                <p>While the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/">UN Human Rights Committee</a> &#8212; the international expert body empowered to interpret this treaty &#8212; has mostly applied the ICCPR in the context of serious crimes, in one instance the committee <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/undocs/html/158-1983.htm">did address</a> the absence of counsel in a minor crime. It found that a defendant who had received ample due process protections, including access to his case file, and months to prepare his case, did not need assigned counsel. (It is relevant to note that the Committee described him as the operator of a "business firm" &#8212; perhaps indicating a lack of indigency).</p>

                <p>None of the defendants I met in Texas had similar due process protections. The<br />
                    <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> has <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-57420">recognized</a> the importance of the right to appointed counsel for the poor even in non-criminal cases, such as divorce proceedings. While the interests at stake during divorce are certainly important, the possibility of incarceration and criminal sanctions faced by misdemeanor defendants are at least as important.</p>

                <p>The process I saw in Midland did not comport with these international standards, sacrificing "the interests of justice" and fair procedure to efficiency. Indeed, many of the defendants I spoke to on my visit were so perplexed by the rapid-fire procedures they were subjected to that they seemed to have little-to-no understanding of what was going on.</p>

                <p>One defendant who had just pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault seemed baffled by what had just transpired. When I asked him why he did not insist on a lawyer, he told me that the prosecutor who had handled his plea agreement warned him that if he chose to retain legal representation, she would insist on the maximum penalty (a year in jail) rather than the $750 fine she was offering him under the plea agreement. "I can't do a year," he said. Another man told me from the county jail, where he had already spent a month incarcerated, that he entered a guilty plea to driving while intoxicated because he was afraid he would lose his job and be unable to pay child support if he were jailed any longer. He was unaware that he had a right to assigned counsel.</p>

                <p>Misdemeanor pleas are serious. They often result in defendants spending some time in jail and can have serious collateral consequences, such as deportation. Perhaps not every case requires appointment of counsel, but minimum improvements can be made in Texas and across the US, such as establishing clearer procedures to inform defendants of their rights and affirming a stronger commitment to increasing attorney appointment rates, including in misdemeanor cases.</p>

                <p>By some <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CDUQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nacdl.org%2FWorkArea%2Flinkit.aspx%3FLinkIdentifier%3Did%26ItemID%3D20808&ei=co9MUbT3N4rp0AHm04GwBA&usg=AFQjCNHx1PJUu07dRlD84g_3luIMr0s4nw&sig2=CbPseMQfK3B75duEJt1sYQ&bvm=bv.44158598,d.dmQto">estimates</a> [PDF], ten times as many misdemeanors as felonies are prosecuted in US courts. In 2012, Midland County prosecuted more than twice as many misdemeanor charges as felony charges. Texas as a whole has improved its indigent defense following the passage of the <a href="http://webbcounty.com/IndigentDefenseServices/TexasFairDefenseAct.pdf">Fair Defense Act in 2001</a> [PDF], which provided additional funding and oversight for indigent defense services, but the majority of Texans charged with misdemeanors still plead guilty without the benefit of the advice of counsel.</p>

                <p>Fifty years after <em>Gideon</em> and its progeny, and two decades after the US became party<br />
                    to the applicable international treaty, the failure to make better progress is glaring. A justice system that denies fundamental rights to most of the people who come before it is handing down too little justice.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.gsu.edu/directory/segall">Eric Segall</a> of Georgia State University says that, although several of the justices on the US Supreme Court interpret the US Constitution to require the government to essentially ignore race, such a requirement would significantly harm civil rights in the US...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/ericsegall.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>B</strong></font>etween now and the end of June, the US Supreme Court will likely hand down two landmark decisions on the most historically difficult and contentious of all social, economic and political questions facing the US: the relationship between whites and blacks. In <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/us-supreme-court-hears-oral-arguments-on-affirmative-action-challenge.php">Fisher v. University of Texas</a>, the Court will decide what role, if any, race can play in the admissions process of colleges and universities. In <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-voting-rights.php">Shelby County v. Holder</a>, the Court will decide whether the US Congress still has the power under <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/sec_5/about.php">Section 5</a> of the <a href="/feature/2012/10/us-voting-rights.php#vra">Voting Rights Act</a> (VRA) to require certain states and counties to obtain federal permission before changing their electoral systems. It is not an overstatement to say that how the Court rules in these two cases may slow down the progress towards racial equality for a generation. It is not an overstatement because the Court has made this mistake several times before.</p>

<p>Unlike the last landmark case decided by the Court (the <a href="/feature/featured/health-care-reform/">Affordable Care Act</a> litigation), there is no suspense as to how four of the conservative justices are going to vote in the affirmative action case because they have already told us. In 2007, Chief Justice Roberts, writing for Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito in <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/supreme-court-rules-on-race-conscious.php">Parents Involved v. Seattle School District</a>, displayed complete hostility towards racial preferences concluding that "the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race." To these justices, the Constitution requires us to act as if we live in a colorblind world, whether we do so or not. There is little doubt that all four justices wanted to end all affirmative action, and they likely would have done so but for the separate opinion of Justice Anthony Kennedy. Although agreeing that the specific racial balancing used in that case was unconstitutional, he wrote a more moderate opinion suggesting that some use of race in admissions may be permissible. His opinion, because it was the narrowest ground upon which five justices agreed, became the binding opinion of the Court. Assuming that the four moderate justices vote in favor of the limited use of racial preferences adopted by the University of Texas, the decision on the validity of affirmative action nationwide will come down to Kennedy.</p>

<p>The last time the VRA came before the Court, the justices (other than Thomas) <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/supreme-court-upholds-voting-rights-act.php">decided</a> the case on narrow grounds while avoiding the constitutional issues. Nevertheless, Roberts' opinion in that case suggested skepticism about Section 5, and at the recent oral argument the conservatives appeared poised to strike it down (though Thomas, of course, was silent). Again, Kennedy is likely to be the swing vote in the case.</p>

<p>The practical implications of these cases are extremely important. The Court may well decree the end of racial preferences in colleges and universities while at the same time allowing states and cities with long and sordid histories of voter discrimination to be free from federal supervision. But, equally importantly, should the Court rule against affirmative action and the VRA, the justices would be sending a strong message that the US has achieved enough racial progress to delegitimize aggressive legislative and other political action designed to remedy racial disparities in this country. Given that blacks are incarcerated at nearly six times the rate of whites, that on average whites have twenty times the wealth of blacks, and that blacks graduate college 20 percent less than whites, the argument that we have achieved significant racial equality in this country is frivolous. Moreover, the <a href="/feature/2012/10/us-voting-rights.php#voterid">2012 elections</a> involved numerous efforts by Republicans to dampen black voter turnout, some of which courts overruled under Section 5. Yes, we have made progress, but we have a long way to go.</p>

<p>If Kennedy were to examine history when making his decision, he would see that when the Court prevents Congress from enforcing laws designed to assist African-Americans or when the Court rubber stamps overtly discriminatory efforts by the states, the result in virtually every case has been a disaster. The judicial invalidation of congressional attempts to end slavery in the territories in the 1850's was a significant contributing factor to the Civil War. Many believe that the <a href="/thisday/2010/03/dred-scott-decided.php">Dred Scott case</a> is a permanent stain on the legacy of the Court.</p>

<p>The Court's overruling of Congress' attempt to eliminate racial discrimination in hotels and restaurants in 1875 coupled with the Court's affirmation in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16038751515555215717">Plessy v. Ferguson</a> of the "separate but equal" doctrine led to generations of Jim Crow and the further marginalization of blacks in the US. This damage lasted at least until the 1960's and both cases are also viewed as blots on the Court's reputation. And, although the laws at issue didn't directly affect race, the Court's <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1427345954995665703">early efforts</a> to block US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal programs (programs that would have helped the poor) led to a constitutional crisis and the infamous <a href="/thisday/2010/02/fdr-proposed-court-packing-plan.php">court-packing plan</a>. In all of these examples, the Court stopped Congress from using its legislative power to assist traditionally disadvantaged groups, and in each case the Court hurt its historical legacy.</p>

<p>It is not the Court's job to help white majorities with voting power and influence win battles they lost in other political arenas. If the people of Texas don't want its flagship university to use racial preferences in admissions, they can put people in power who won't adopt such preferences. If the people of the US think the VRA has outlived its usefulness, they can elect people to Congress who will repeal the law. The <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxv">Fifteenth</a> Amendments give Congress the power to enforce those provisions and were enacted to give Congress tools to move us closer to racial equality. For the Supreme Court to interpret those amendments to limit legislative efforts to help people of color is nothing short of perverse.</p>

<p>During the oral argument of the VRA, Scalia and Roberts gave the game away. Scalia made the preposterous argument that the Senate's 98-0 vote in favor of the act in 2006, rather than showing unanimous belief that the VRA was still needed, actually showed the Senate was too cowardly to take the problem seriously. Scalia made this claim despite congressional hearings and reports on the issue. He also called the VRA a "racial entitlement." Clearly, Scalia is opposed on policy grounds to the Act's attempt to further erase our sorry history of racial discrimination.</p>

<p>Roberts asked the lawyer for the government whether he thought the South is more racist than the North, as if that loaded question decided the case. His vote seems certain, and Thomas is already on record as saying that Section 5 is unconstitutional. No doubt Alito agrees. Hopefully, Kennedy will better understand that the Supreme Court should not second guess rational decisions of other public officials trying to remedy racial inequality, and like he did in the last affirmative action case, not join with the other four conservatives who want to pretend as if racial discrimination and racial inequity no longer exist. The march towards a true colorblind society will move far quicker if Kennedy does his job correctly.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Qiwei Chen, an LL.M. candidate from the <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/">University of Pittsburgh School of Law</a> Class of 2013, discusses China's new leaders election and the current disputes on <em>hukou</em>, the household registration system...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/dateline/qiwei_chen.jpeg" width="120" height="194" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n March 17, 2013, the National People's Congress (NPC), the highest state body and the unicameral legislative house in China, and the People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), whose members represent various defined groups of society, ended their annual meeting in Beijing, China. The NPC and the CPPCC are the two most important political and legal meetings in China. The NPC meets for about two weeks each year at the same time as the CPPCC, usually in the spring. The NPC meets annually in March and is attended by more than 3,000 local delegates elected by the people. The combined sessions have been known as the "two meetings" in China.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that the NPC is not only a legal meeting in China, but also the main legislative body of China (the unicameral parliament). The <a href="http://www.npc.gov.cn/englishnpc/Constitution/node_2825.htm">Constitution of People's Republic of China</a> has vested the NPC with great lawmaking powers. It has the power to revise the constitution and create major legal codes. Delegates of the NPC are from different fields and have different backgrounds. These delegates can make suggestions or give opinions on legislation. After the NPC meeting, the NPC Legislative Affairs Committee is the key group that is responsible for law drafting. Apart from this, the NPC also enacts laws and makes "decisions". Decisions may contain legal norms in the form of amendments or supplements to laws. <br />
	<br />
Furthermore, <a href="http://www.npc.gov.cn/englishnpc/Constitution/2007-11/15/content_1372966.htm">Article 79</a> of the PRC Constitution grants the NPC the power to elect the president and the vice president and to approve the appointment of the prime minister of the state council. This year's NPC was assigned a significant mission: to elect three of the new top leaders in China. Coincidentally, all of these leaders hold law-related degrees. President Xi Jinping earned a Ph.D. in laws from Tsinghua University. Premier Li Keqiang obtained his LL.B. from Peking University. Vice President Li Yuanchao obtained his doctoral degree in law from the Central Party School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. In the past, most of the top governmental officials were scientists. For example, former Chinese President Hu Jintao was a hydraulic engineer before he became a politician. Likewise, former prime minister, Wen Jiabao, was a geomechanical engineer. This trend shows China's past national policy to encourage young people to study science, mathematics or engineering in college. Great emphasis was placed on science and technology as fundamental parts of the socio-economic development of the country as well as for national prestige. Such a goal resulted in China's de-emphasizing other areas, including legal education and the legal profession. This resulted in many defects rooted in the Chinese legal system that were always neglected in the past. Now that top leaders have legal backgrounds, the Chinese legal system will undergo reform in the near future.<br />
	<br />
Another important feature of this year's NPC session was that the Chinese <em>hukou</em> system needs to be deeply reformed as soon as possible. The <em>hukou</em> system is basically a household registration system, employed by the Chinese government as the oldest tool of population control. The local government has the right to make local <em>hukou</em> policies. They can issue a <em>hukou</em> booklet per family, recording all the information of each family members, such as names, birth dates, permanent addresses, martial status, education, death dates and other essential details. Also, the <em>hukou</em> booklet identifies the village, town or city to which each family member belongs. A child's <em>hukou</em> is determined by his or her parents' <em>hukou</em> rather than the child's birthplace. For example, if both parents' <em>hukou</em> are in city X, then the child's <em>hukou</em> is in X even if he or she is born in Shanghai. If one of the parent's <em>hukou</em> is in Shanghai while the other is in X, then the child can choose between the two. The <em>hukou</em> system is critically important in China because of the large number of people engaged in rural-urban migration. The <a href="http://www.npc.gov.cn/wxzl/wxzl/2000-12/26/content_4264.htm">1954 PRC Constitution</a> guaranteed citizens' right of free residential choice and migration. However, in the <a href="http://www.npc.gov.cn/wxzl/wxzl/2000-12/06/content_4362.htm">1975 PRC Constitution</a>, this article was deleted and was never recovered in any other version of the PRC Constitutions or amendments.<br />
	<br />
Also, the Chinese government uses the <em>hukou</em> system to identify citizen's education, employment and social welfare rights by where people belong. People enjoy social benefit based on the address in your <em>hukou</em> booklet. For example, if your address in your <em>hukou</em> booklet is Shanghai, China, then you have a Shanghai citizenship. You may enjoy the social benefit given by Shanghai government. People from underdeveloped areas in China always want to move to the big cities like Shanghai. However, it is hard for them to transfer their <em>hukou</em> from their original place to Shanghai because the Shanghai government is concerned about the limited land, education and job resources. It made strict <em>hukou</em> policies to avoid overpopulation.<br />
	<br />
The <em>hukou</em> system not only restricts people's fundamental right of free migration, but also determines whether people have equally access to social services. It is notorious for creating a dual economic structure dividing people into urban and countryside status. Urban people and countryside people enjoy different social benefits even in the same province. For instance, children of countryside people cannot go to schools in urban areas. Even if countryside people domicile in city, they cannot enjoy the medical insurance, unemployment insurance or retirement pension as city people do because they lack a city <em>hukou</em>. The <em>hukou</em> system constructs a solid wall between the city and countryside in China. It prevents the free flow of population, impeding the economic and social development in the country. <br />
	<br />
As usual, the premier delivered <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2013-03/18/c_132242798.htm">Report on the Work of the Government</a> in the NPC session. This year's report was the last one in premier Wen's 10-year term. He <a href="http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2013-03/06/content_16283868.htm">called for efforts</a> to advance urbanization "actively yet prudently" by speeding up reform of the <em>hukou</em> system:<blockquote>Urbanization is a historic task in China's modernization drive, and urbanization and agricultural modernization complement each other. To advance urbanization, the government should register eligible rural workers as permanent urban residents in an orderly manner, and expand the coverage of basic public services in urban areas to migrant workers and other permanent residents.</blockquote>The Chinese government is trying to use the NPC's annual session as an opportunity to demonstrate the government's view on crucial legislative reforms to improve human rights protections. I truly hope that the new government leaders will deepen legal form and make people live better in China.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist, Daniel Perrone, <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/academics/graduate/law">St. John's University School of Law</a> Class of 2013, discusses the implications of the US Supreme Court decision insulating generic drug manufacturers from liability against failure to warn claims...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/dateline/Daniel_Perrone.jpeg" width="120" height="198" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n 2011, generic drugs <a href="http://www.imshealth.com/ims/Global/Content/Insights/IMS%20Institute%20for%20Healthcare%20Informatics/IHII_Medicines_in_U.S_Report_2011.pdf">accounted</a> [PDF] for nearly 80 percent of the 3.7 billion prescriptions filled in the US. This staggering figure should come as no surprise considering the cost of a generic drug is, on average, 80 to 85 percent lower than its brand-name equivalent. However, the decision to consume a drug's cheaper, generic equivalent does come at a price. Thanks to the US Supreme Court's ruling in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15669405712768599023">PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing</a>, consumers injured by generic drugs are being, and will continue to be, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-holds-federal-law-preempts-in-generic-drug-cases.php">denied recourse</a> against generic drug manufacturers for their failure to adequately and safely label their products.</p>

<p>In <em>Mensing</em>, two plaintiffs were prescribed the brand name drug Reglan. In its place, they both received and consumed metoclopramide, the generic equivalent of Reglan. Through the years, the warnings for the brand-name version of the drug, which were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), were strengthened and clarified several times. Nevertheless, the warnings for the generic version of the drug were, at all times, the same as those of the brand name. After taking the drug as prescribed for several years, both plaintiffs developed a severe neurological disorder called tardive dyskinesia. The plaintiffs sued the generic drug manufacturers, alleging that prolonged metoclopramide use caused their tardive dyskinesia. The plaintiffs concluded that the manufacturers were liable under state law for failing to provide adequate warning labels.</p>

<p>In a 5-4 decision, the Court found that state law conflicted with &#8212; and was pre-empted by &#8212; federal labeling requirements. The Court noted that while state law places an affirmative duty on <em>all</em> drug manufacturers to adequately and safely label their products, federal law places such a duty only on brand name drug manufacturers. That is, under federal law, generic drug manufacturers are not responsible for adequately and safely labeling their products. Instead, generic drug manufacturers are only responsible for ensuring that their products' warning labels are the same as their brand-name equivalent at all times. In other words, generic drug manufacturers are subject to an ongoing federal duty of "sameness." As a consequence, generic drug manufacturers cannot independently change their products' warning labels without violating federal law. This is true even if the generic drug's warning label is clearly inadequate and, thus, violates state law. Accordingly, the Court dismissed the case, noting that it was not lawful, under federal law, for the generic drug manufacturers to do what state law required of them; namely, to attach a safer label to their generic metoclopramide.</p>

<p>The <em>Mensing</em> rule, which essentially insulates generic drug manufacturers from liability against failure to warn claims, has its roots in the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/category/keywords/hatch-waxman_act">Hatch-Waxman Amendments</a> (HWA). The HWA enables generic drugs to gain FDA approval by showing equivalence &#8212; in substance and labeling &#8212; to a reference-listed drug that has already been approved by the FDA. This eliminates the need for costly and lengthy clinical testing, thereby allowing manufacturers to develop drugs inexpensively, resulting in a reduced price for consumers.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, the reduced price of generic drugs benefits numerous Americans each year, but at what cost? The individuals who rely on, and benefit from, the relatively affordable price of generic drugs the most &#8212; those who cannot afford expensive brand-name drugs &#8212; are the least capable to withstand an uncompensated injury suffered as a result of a manufacturer's failure to adequately and safely label its product. This leaves millions, if not billions, of Americans contemplating whether their decision, assuming they even have a choice, to save money now by purchasing generic drugs could lead to financial ruin down the line. All the while, generic drug manufacturers continue to reap endless monetary rewards without any fear of repercussion, as long as they comply with their ever so arduous duty of "sameness."  Not to mention the fact that the <em>Mensing</em> ruling eliminates any incentive whatsoever for generic drug manufacturers to ensure the adequacy of their products' warning labels.</p>

<p>Taking all of this into account, the <em>Mensing</em> ruling seems to make little sense. The Court notes:<blockquote>We recognize that from the perspective of <em>Mensing</em>, finding pre-emption here but not in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13613585210679693906">Wyeth v. Levine</a> makes little sense. Had Mensing and Demahy taken Reglan, the brand-name drug prescribed by their doctors, <em>Wyeth</em> would control and their lawsuits would not be pre-empted. But because pharmacists, acting in full accord with state law, substituted generic metoclopramide instead, federal law pre-empts these lawsuits.</blockquote>However, it makes even less sense when the brand-name and generic drug manufacturers are one and the same. To illustrate, in 2011, the FDA <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/ucm211766.htm">announced</a> that women who used the birth control pills Yaz and Yasmin, or their generic equivalents, were 74 percent more likely to experience a blood clot compared to women who were using other birth control pills.  Since that time, more than 12,000 lawsuits have been filed against Bayer &#8212; the manufacturer of both the brand-name and generic birth control pills &#8212; alleging that company failed to warn women of the enhanced risks associated with consuming its birth control pills. The <em>Mensing</em> ruling, under these circumstances, would ostensibly leave those women who consumed the generic versions of Bayer's Yaz and Yasmin without any recourse. Again, this makes little sense, especially since Bayer is the manufacturer of both the brand-name and generic birth control pills at issue.  </p>

<p>To address this injustice, courts should craft an exception to the <em>Mensing</em> ruling and hold generic drug manufacturers liable for their failure to adequately and safely label their products where the brand-name and generic drug manufacturers are one and the same. In <em>Mensing</em>, the Court reasoned that it was impossible for the generic drug manufacturers to comply with their state law duty, which required them to strengthen their warning labels, without violating their federal duty of "sameness."  That simply is not the case when the brand-name and generic drug manufacturers are the same entity.  Returning to the above example, Bayer could have simultaneously strengthened the warning labels of both its brand-name and generic birth controls pills to render their use reasonably safe. Had Bayer done so, it would have complied with both its state law duty to adequately and safely label its birth control pills and its federal law duty of "sameness."</p>

<p>There is no denying the vital role generic drugs play in American society.  They enable countless Americans, who cannot afford expensive brand-name drugs, to obtain the medication they so desperately need. Unfortunately, the <em>Mensing</em> ruling has dramatically increased the "cost" associated with generic drugs. The decision to insulate generic drug manufacturers from liability, despite their failure to adequately and safely label their products, is an injustice that disproportionately affects those who cannot afford to purchase expensive brand-name drugs just to preserve their right to receive compensation in the event they suffer a debilitating injury. That is why courts should craft an exception to the <em>Mensing</em> ruling that would hold generic drug manufacturers liable for their failure to adequately and safely label their products where the brand-name and generic drug manufacturers are one and the same.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Kim Brancato, <a href="http://www.law.depaul.edu/">DePaul University College of Law</a> Class of 2014, discusses the successes and failures of recent women's rights legislation in India...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/dateline/kim_brancato.jpg" width="120" height="200" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>A</strong></font>s an observer at the fifty-fourth session of the <a href="http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/cedaw.htm">Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women</a> (CEDAW) Committee hearing a few weeks ago in Geneva, I witnessed the importance of access to justice to the international community. As access to justice for women has been recognized as a major obstacle to the protection of women's human rights throughout the world, the committee began the preliminary stages for adopting a general recommendation on this topic by requesting information from the international community. On February 18, there was a discussion amongst the Committee, state parties, NGOs, experts and even a personal account from a young Filipino woman struggling her way through the justice system after being a victim of rape. The committee will use this discussion when formulating the general recommendation on access to justice. As a state party to CEDAW, India should be striving to achieve these international standards. </p>

<p>In the wake of the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/28/world/asia/india-rape-victim">gang-rape and death</a> of a young woman in New Delhi this past December, India reformed its colonial-era laws governing violence against women. On February 3, 2013, the President of India, Pranab Mukherjee, signed the <a href="http://mha.nic.in/pdfs/criminalLawAmndmt-040213.pdf">Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance</a> [PDF] (the Ordinance). The Ordinance acts as an amendment to the <a href="http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=201592">Indian Penal Code</a>, the <a href="http://mha.nic.in/pdfs/ccp1973.pdf">Code of Criminal Procedure of 1973</a> [PDF] and the <a href="http://www.vakilno1.com/bareacts/indianevidenceact/indianevidenceact.html">Indian Evidence Act of 1872</a>.</p>

<p>Prominent human rights groups such as <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/rights-groups-urge-india-to-reject-new-sexual-violence-law.php">Amnesty International (AI) and Human Rights Watch (HRW)</a> have criticized various aspects of the new law. These groups argue that India has only reformed the most archaic of its laws and has failed to meet international standards for women's rights. </p>

<p>Prior to amending the Ordinance, the Indian government established an advisory committee headed by former Indian Supreme Court Chief Justice J.S. Verma (the Verma Committee). Human rights NGOs argue that the government ignored the Verma Committee's key <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/india-panel-recommends-legal-reforms-in-response-to-rape-incident.php">recommendations</a> for strengthening the violence against women laws. For instance, one recommendation by the Verma Committee was to lower the age of sexual consent from 18 years old to 16. Just last year, India enacted the <a href="http://wcd.nic.in/act/protectionbill.pdf">Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act</a> [PDF] which increased the age of consent to 18. The Verma Committee urged the government to revert the age of consent back to 16 after public outcry, as the committee felt adolescents at age 18 were mature enough to consent. India should implement laws that help adolescents in the 16 to 18 year old age group to act in an informed and responsible manner rather than criminalizing and punishing their behavior.</p>

<p>In addition to criticizing the Indian government for failing to include the Verma Committee's key recommendations, human rights groups have also criticized various sections of the Ordinance. The major areas of concern include the act's failure to criminalize marital rape, imposing the same punishment for varying levels of crimes, immunity for police and armed services, conflating adult sex work with trafficking and criminalizing same-sex relations. </p>

<p>To begin, the Ordinance fails to recognize marital rape except in very limited cases where the spouses have been living separately. Section 375 of the Ordinance defines acts constituting sexual assault along with the manner and circumstances in which it may occur. There is only one exception to the entirety of section 375: "sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under sixteen years of age, is not sexual assault." Therefore, a man may commit a violent act of sexual assault without the consent or against the will of his wife and not face any repercussions. In fact, the wife does not have any legal remedies available to her. This is especially an issue in a culture where forced and arranged marriages are not uncommon. Human rights groups have also <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/02/11/india-reject-new-sexual-violence-Ordinance">framed this issue</a> as discriminatory in that "the Ordinance discriminates against women based on their marital status and denies them equal protection before the law."</p>

<p>Next, the language of the Ordinance makes it difficult to draw a distinction between consensual adult prostitution and human trafficking. Section 370 of the Penal Code defines the offense of trafficking as recruiting, transporting, harboring, transferring or receiving a person by use of threats, force, abduction, fraud, power or inducement "for the purpose of exploitation." Explanation 1 of section 370 provides that "the expression 'exploitation' shall include prostitution" and explanation 2 further continues that "the consent of the victim is immaterial in the determination of the offense of trafficking." By including these explanations, the Ordinance conflates consensual prostitution with human trafficking, two very different concepts. On a basic level, prostitution is generally understood as sex between a willing buyer and a willing seller, whereas <a href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/human-trafficking/what-is-human-trafficking.html">human trafficking</a> is not consensual for the seller, at least initially.</p>

<p>Another major concern is punishments. Human rights groups are generally opposed to the death penalty as they view capital punishment as inhuman, irreversible and a deprivation of the right to life. In order to comply with international standards for human rights, the groups urge India to eliminate capital punishment as a possible sentence for sexual assault, or any other crime for that matter. In addition the same standard is articulated for both penetrative and non-penetrative offenses. Section 376 states that "whoever ... commits sexual assault shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment of either description for a term which shall not be less than seven years but which may extend to imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine." Without a distinction drawn, perpetrators will face the same sentence for the act of inappropriate touching and acts of penetration. </p>

<p>Human rights groups are critical not only on what the Ordinance includes, but also what it omits. The Ordinance fails to mention Section 377 of the Penal Code, which criminalizes same-sex consensual adult relationships. Additionally, the Delhi High Court <a href="http://lobis.nic.in/dhc/APS/judgement/02-07-2009/APS02072009CW74552001.pdf">ruled</a> [PDF] in 2009 that criminalizing consensual sex-same relationships was a violation of numerous constitutional guarantees &#8212; a ruling parliament ignored when drafting the Ordinance. The Indian government had the opportunity to amend section 377 of the penal code through the Ordinance and chose not to. </p>

<p>It appears that India drafted the Ordinance hastily, as a reaction to public outcry after the December incident, rather than seeking consultation from human rights and women's rights organizations, thoughtfully engaging in dialogue within Parliament and fully considering the Verma Committee's recommendations.</p>

<p>The Indian government needs to address human rights organizations' concerns. In order to ensure real change, India should also address how this law will be implemented. With over half of India's population <a href="http://www.ophi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/India-2013.pdf?cda6c1">living in poverty</a> [PDF], access to justice for women also needs to be addressed. Simply updating India's violence against women laws on paper, especially in the manner that the government has, is likely not enough to see significant change. </p>

Wilkins</em>...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/dateline/john_mcavoy.jpg" width="120" height="185" align="LEFT" hspace="2" vspace="2"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong></strong></font></p>

<p><strong>The Power of Public Policy</strong></p>

<p>The notion of drug testing welfare recipients has recently become a highly publicized and debated issue. <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/story/2012-03-18/drug-testing-welfare-applicants/53620604/1">Newspapers and blogs</a> across the country have helped fuel this debate by examining the policy considerations, which lend either strong support or extreme opposition to the legislation. The American people have expressed strong opinions on the topic via social media outlets. Recently, a <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/06/09/983652/-Why-This-New-Facebook-Meme-of-Drug-Testing-Welfare-Recipients-is-100-Wrong">Facebook</a> "<a href="http://thedailymeme.com/what-is-a-meme/">chain meme</a>" has brought even more attention to the proposed legislation. The meme has helped turn legislation affecting a relatively small percentage of the American population into a hot-button issue. Legislators in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/11/us/states-adding-drug-test-as-hurdle-for-welfare.html?pagewanted=all&_r=2&">three dozen</a> states have responded in the past year by proposing drug testing for people receiving welfare benefits.</p>

<p>Supporters of such legislation believe it is nothing more than one additional <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/11/us/states-adding-drug-test-as-hurdle-for-welfare.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1&">eligibility requirement</a> for the receipt of public funds. For many Americans, it is impossible to understand why people who work for their money are required to take drug tests, while those getting handouts from the government are not. On the other hand, critics believe such laws not only single out but discriminate against the poor.</p>

<p><strong>Constitutional Framework: The Fourth Amendment and Drug Testing</strong> </p>

<p>Challengers to laws requiring all applicants for welfare benefits to submit to a suspicionless drug test believe that the legislation violates the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment's</a> prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures. The US Supreme Court has chiseled out specific exceptions to this once overbroad individual right against unreasonable searches and seizures. The specific exception relevant to suspicionless drug testing is based on the government's "special need" for the search or seizure. </p>

<p>Under the "<a href="http://www.lectlaw.com/def/f081.htm">special needs exception</a>," if a government proposal is able to satisfy a <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8655257031938182800">five-part standard</a> it falls within the Fourth Amendment's ambit and is therefore constitutional. Specifically, the exception requires that: (1) the government action in question must be considered a "search" within the context of the Fourth Amendment; (2) the search must be reasonable; (3) the extent of the invasion on the individual's privacy must be minimal; (4) the governmental interest served by the proposal must be legitimate; and (5) the privacy interest of the individual must be balanced against the government interest to ultimately decide whether the search is constitutional.</p>

<p><strong>How Public Policy is Framing the Constitutional Analysis</strong></p>

<p>In October 2011, the constitutionality of Florida's <a href="http://leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0400-0499/0414/Sections/0414.0652.html">legislation</a> mandating suspicionless drug testing was <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/federal-court-hears-challenge-to-drug-screening-welfare-recipients.php">examined</a> in federal district court. Florida is considered to be at the forefront of such legislation. Public policy was examined under the fourth prong of the special needs exception; namely, the government's asserted interest. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=454801404362323497">Lebron v. Wilkins</a>, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) brought suit hoping to block the implementation of Florida's new law. The plaintiff, who claimed to never have used illegal drugs, refused to submit to urinalysis because he believed that this requirement was unreasonable when there was no reason to believe that he used drugs. Judge Mary Scriven agreed and <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-florida-welfare-drug-testing-law.php">issued</a> a temporary injunction blocking the implementation of the law.</p>

<p><em>Lebron</em> turned on whether the governmental objectives advanced were "substantial." The state introduced five public interests closely tied to the federal welfare <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ193/html/PLAW-104publ193.htm">statute</a>, known as Temporary Cash Assistance for Needy Families (TANF): (1) ensuring that TANF funds are used for their dedicated purpose; (2) protecting children by ensuring that its funds are used to feed children and not feed parental drug habits; (3) ensuring that funds are used in accord with TANF's goal of getting beneficiaries back to work; (4) ensuring that children are kept off drugs; and (5) ensuring public policy. Despite the fact that each of these objectives standing alone could potentially be enough to meet the special needs standard, Scriven rejected the state's arguments, which she characterized as "laudable" but lacking presence in Florida's law.  </p>

<p>Florida's law has not only met but exceeded the requirements of the special needs exception. The first special need advocated by the state and harped on in Scriven's opinion involves the objective of combating drug use among people receiving governmental assistance. To support this objective, the state introduced a plethora of studies and statistics indicating that welfare recipients are more likely to abuse controlled substances. This "objective" amounts to little more than a policy argument to which Scriven happens to be <a href="http://www.aclufl.org/pdfs/2011-10-24-ACLUTanfOrder.pdf">opposed</a> [PDF]: "[T]hose welfare recipients who screened and tested positive for the use of illicit substances were found to be just as likely to work and just as likely to use social service benefits as those who screened and tested negative." Scriven's opinion dwelled on the first special need objective advanced by the state and ignored the remaining arguments offered for why states may wish to ensure that welfare recipients are drug free.</p>

<p>The four remaining special needs arguments are significantly less controversial, etched not in discussions of class bias or discrimination but in congressional intent. TANF reform focuses on two key concepts: protecting children and empowering parents to get back on their feet. It is well documented that drug abuse by parents contributes to <a href="http://www.nationalcenter.org/NPA627.html">child abuse and neglect</a>, as well as a propensity for their children to abuse drugs. If the government hands money over to a parent for a child's protection without first qualifying that the child is in the hands of a sober and suitable parent, then the government is ignoring the very purpose of TANF assistance. Moreover, the Florida law at issue is also consistent with the second major objective of TANF and the third special need offered by the state: getting parents back to work. The government does not hand out such money unconditionally; instead, in an effort to better their current situations, parents are required to seek employment. Given that roughly <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=HCvrhJuBuWAC&pg=PA46&lpg=PA46&dq=eighty-four+percent+of+employers+require+some+form+of+drug+testing&source=bl&ots=grMMiekwcF&sig=AZ_3i2XIVf5RAbbPnN_t69eJSa8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Jb9LUcbhHNip4AO_-4CwCg&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=eighty-four%20percent%20of%20employers%20require%20some%20form%20of%20drug%20testing&f=false">84 percent of employers</a> require some form of drug testing, the likelihood of a drug-using parent getting a job is poor. A mandatory suspicionless drug test is just another way the government assures that parents are holding up their end of the bargain. </p>

<p>Finally, the fourth and fifth interests asserted by the government are very closely related with TANF requirements which aim to keep children safe. <a href="http://www.nacoa.net/pdfs/addicted.pdf">Statistics</a> [PDF] show that children who grow up in homes with parents who are addicted to drugs are in the highest risk group to become future drug addicts. Collectively, the interests asserted by Florida are more than reasonable and substantial under the Fourth Amendment. Unfortunately, the fact that Scriven's opinion was grounded in public policy has created an <a href="http://www.nationalcenter.org/NPA627.html">unnecessary hurdle</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The Disconnect: Why Suspicionless Drug Testing Efforts Miss the Point</strong></p>

<p>Welfare benefits, especially given the current economic crisis, are a wonderful tool for helping applicants who are down on their luck get back on their feet. Nevertheless, more can and should be done to assure TANF is used for its intended purpose. The majority of government programs are focused on making poverty more comfortable, while helping the poor escape poverty is the only way to make them more self-sufficient. TANF objectives are much better served by educating the poor regarding birth control, the costs associated with child rearing and the importance of finishing school (or at the very least obtaining a GED).</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>When policy arguments on both sides of the spectrum are ignored the laws can be seen for what they truly are: an extension of the TANF reform initiated by US President Bill Clinton. That program was aimed at helping Americans get off drugs and empowering parents to improve their familial situation. When tax dollars are undoubtedly feeding children &#8212; not habits &#8212; the government can reinvest that money in helping those that are truly down on their luck in America.</p>

		<title>US v. Windsor: Rational Basis Review Should Not Preclude Unconstitutionality</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.ij.org/rmcnamara">Robert McNamara</a>, an attorney for the <a href="http://www.ij.org/">Institute for Justice</a>, argues that the standard of review that the US Supreme Court ultimately uses in deciding <em>US v. Windsor</em> should not be perceived as the determinative element in that case's eventual outcome...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/robert_mcnamara_new.jpg" width="120" height="200" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>W</strong></font>hen the US Supreme Court heard <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-307_jnt1.pdf">oral arguments</a> [PDF] on March 27, 2013, in <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-doma.php">US v. Windsor</a>, a challenge to the federal <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/104/hr3396/text/rh">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA), a substantial amount of energy was devoted not to the complex question of DOMA's constitutionality, but to the simple issue of what standard of review the Court would use in evaluating DOMA. Arguing for the administration of US President Barack Obama, Solicitor General Donald Verrilli urged the Court to apply "heightened" scrutiny. Arguing in defense of DOMA for the Bipartisan Legal Advocacy Group (BLAG), Paul Clement insisted the Court could only apply "rational basis" review. Then, Roberta Kaplan, who represents the actual plaintiffs in the case, noted that the Court could strike DOMA down under any standard of review. However, the unmistakable focus of her argument was the process by which the Court would conduct its analysis, rather than what that analysis would show.<br />
                <br />
                As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg observed near the end of the argument, though, this focus is based on an unspoken &#8212; and false &#8212; assumption: that the only way citizens can ever prevail against the government is if they benefit from heightened scrutiny. But we know this not to be true. We know that citizens <em>can</em> prevail against the government without heightened because citizens <em>do</em> prevail. Once we reject the false assumption that heightened scrutiny is the only path to victory against government litigants, the analysis in <em>Windsor</em> becomes dramatically simpler.</p>

                <p>Of course, this unspoken assumption about heightened scrutiny is unsurprising, if only because it is the same assumption held by a seemingly huge swath of lawyers. "<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/strict_scrutiny">Strict scrutiny</a>" is seen as code for "the government always loses," whereas "<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/rational_basis">rational basis review</a>" is seen as code for "the government always wins." Thus, the parties' approach is understandable: if the level of scrutiny determines the outcome, it makes sense to expend energy on arguing the level of scrutiny.</p>

                <p>The problem with this approach is that it does not accurately describe how the rational basis test works in fact. It is, of course, a truism that the rational basis test is extremely deferential to government, and any consitutional-law student worth her salt can point to sweeping <em>dicta</em> about how the test requires courts to avoid questioning "the wisdom, fairness, or logic of legislative choices" (as stated in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1233327823176781402">FCC v. Beach Communications</a>) and requires a plaintiff to "negative every conceivable basis" for a challenged law (as stated in as stated in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8521461168668272211">Heller v. Doe</a>). Such <em>dicta</em> undeniably exists; the problem with it is that it cannot be squared with the Court's actual decisions in rational basis cases.</p>

                <p>As described, the rational basis test embodied by this sweeping <em>dicta</em> imposes a literally impossible burden. A savvy attorney (or a savvy judge) will always be able to <em>conceive</em> of a rationale that isn't specifically "negative[d]" by a plaintiff's evidence. If that is how the test works, we should expect every single claim to fail, every single time.</p>

                <p>And yet they do not. In fact, rational basis plaintiffs have succeeded, again and again. They have succeeded in famous court decisions, like <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15714610278411834284&q">Lawrence v. Texas</a> or <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17758055891258118781&q">Romer v. Evans</a>, and they have succeeded in cases that many people have never heard of, like <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13374840569692790454&q">Williams v. Vermont</a> (which dealt with automobile taxes) and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12605442536558130412&q">Zobel v. Williams</a> (which dealt with how Alaska distributed the funds from the state's oil revenues). Of the more than 100 cases since 1970 in which the Supreme Court has applied the rational basis test to answer a question, the Court has answered that question in the plaintiffs' favor more than 20 times.</p>

                <p>This alone tells us that characterizing the rational basis test as one where "the government always wins" is false. The test described in this sweeping <em>dicta</em> simply can't be squared with the many cases in which the Court has applied the test and found the government wanting. If that description is false &#8212; and it is &#8212; only one question remains: <em>why</em> do plaintiffs win rational basis cases?</p>

                <p>The answer is clear: plaintiffs win these cases because, despite the sweeping commentary about how deferential the rational basis test is, the Court does not actually treat the test as a requirement that it abandon its basic judicial function. The Court looks to see whether a purported rational basis for a law can be squared with the real facts in the record. It looks to see whether there is a logical connection between what the government says its ends are and what the government is actually doing. It looks to see whether the government's ends are legitimate, and whether the government can actually be believed to be pursuing its stated ends (as opposed to other, illegitimate purposes). It is true, of course, that the Court is <em>deferential</em> when it applies the rational basis test, but it is not <em>absent</em>. It still demands both truth and logic from government litigants &#8212; and when one of the two does not support a challenged law, that law falls.</p>

                <p>This simple insight &#8212; that the rational basis test, in practice, is a test and not simply an excuse to rule in favor of the government &#8212; has significant implications for the Court's decision in <em>Windsor</em>. The crux of the plaintiff's argument in the case is that the government's stated objectives cannot be believed &#8212; that, as a matter of fact, it is implausible to believe that the federal government is achieving a legitimate federal purpose by refusing to recognize state-sanctioned same-sex marriages. This is a question that the Court can answer, and one it can answer without resort to abstract inquiries about the "level" of scrutiny it is allowed to apply. It can simply look at the facts and determine whether the government's asserted interests can be squared with the evidence of what the government is actually doing. It can, in a word, judge.</p>

                <p>The advantage to this approach is two-fold. First, it allows the Court to avoid the heightened-scrutiny question altogether. After decades of experimentation, the Court's attempt to fit the realities of American government into strict "tiers" of scrutiny has yielded a jurisprudence that is, at best, inconsistent and difficult to justify on principle. More through historical accident than consistent analysis, some characteristics (like whether one's parents were married) yield higher levels of judicial protection, while others (like one's level of educational attainment or simply one's level of political influence) do not. Delving back into the tiered-scrutiny thicket to decide whether one more subgroup of Americans is (or is not) entitled to meaningful judicial review is unlikely to improve matters.</p>

                <p>Second &#8212; and, for millions of Americans whose constitutional rights deserve equal protection, perhaps more importantly &#8212; this allows the Court to once and for all reject its most expansive <em>dicta</em> about the rational basis test and reaffirm a simple truth: the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/">US Constitution</a> requires judges to look at facts in all cases. There exists no standard of review under which the Court may simply disregard logic. There exists no standard under which the Court may disregard facts, nor one under which the Court will allow itself to be lied to about a law's real purposes or effects. Finally rejecting the aforementioned <em>dicta</em> and explicitly embracing an articulation of the rational basis test that accurately explains all of the Court's rational basis decisions (the ones where the government wins and the many where the government loses) will not just clarify the Court's jurisprudence. It will also be a bedrock victory for real judicial engagement by reassuring judges in lower courts that they are allowed to do their jobs &#8212; to look at evidence with their eyes open and their minds engaged &#8212; in all cases. </p>

                <p>Nothing could be simpler. But, for litigants across the country, nothing could be more important.</p>

		<title>An Analysis on Independent Reports: Uses, Reliability and Legality</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Kathryn Young, <a href="http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/index.htm">University of Virginia School of Law</a> Class of 2013, analyzes the uses, reliability and legality of independent reports in light of their increased uses in collegiate sports...<hr height='1'><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size='3'><strong>W</strong></font>hen sports scandals break, a common tool used by universities is the "independent report." To understand how these reports function, two recent examples can be illustrative: the Freeh report and the Martin report.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://progress.psu.edu/assets/content/REPORT_FINAL_071212.pdf">Freeh report</a> [PDF] was commissioned by Pennsylvania State University ("Penn State") after the Jerry Sandusky child abuse allegations. Former FBI Director Louis Freeh and his law firm compiled the report with the help of a special investigative counsel. Freeh investigated four Penn State administrators: University President Graham Spanier, Athletic Director Timothy Curley, late Head Football Coach Joseph Paterno and Senior Vice-President Gary Shultz. The report's goal was to determine what knowledge these individuals had of the alleged child abuse and what steps they took to prevent future abuse.  </p>

<p>The report concluded:<blockquote>The most saddening finding by the Special Investigative Counsel is the total and consistent disregard by the most senior leaders at Penn State for the safety and welfare of Sandusky's child victims ... These men concealed Sandusky's activities from the Board of Trustees, the University community and authorities.</blockquote>The report cited emails between the leaders regarding these allegations and their continued acceptance of Sandusky as a Penn State figure, including his use of university facilities. The latter charge is important because multiple victims alleged that their assaults occurred in the locker room showers on campus. Criminal charges resulted out of this conduct. The school also received strict sanctions from the National Collegiate Athletic Administration (NCAA). Public backlash occurred almost immediately against both the University and the individuals involved, particularly the previously-respected Paterno. The whole scandal <a href="http://www.realclearsports.com/2013/03/12/freeh_report_cost_penn_state_over_8_million_110230.html">cost</a> Penn State $41 million, including the $8.1 million that generating the Freeh report cost.    </p>

<p>The <a href="http://academicreview.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/UNC-Governor-Martin-Report-12-19-2012-FINAL.pdf">Martin report</a> [PDF] was commissioned by the University of North Carolina after questions were raised about the integrity of certain classes. Some courses in the African American studies department (AFAM) were "no-show" classes, because they did not require attendance or had unauthorized grade changes. The school was concerned because of previous athletic scandals, and wanted to ensure that these AFAM classes did not contain disproportionate amounts of athletes. Former North Carolina Governor Jim Martin and consulting firm Baker Tilly compiled the report. The report concluded that the problems were isolated within the AFAM department, and specifically in the unethical behavior of two administrators. The report <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/2013/03/09/2738277/martin-report-cost-unc-490000.html">cost</a> the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Foundation $490,000.  </p>

<p><strong>What Makes These Reports Independent?</strong> </p>

<p>The report investigators in both of these cases stress their independence. For the Freeh report, this meant that &#8212; although the school sponsored the report &#8212; none of the Special Investigative Council (SIC) members either attended or had a professional relationship with Penn State and that the SIC consisted of diverse members with extensive investigative backgrounds. It also stressed that "no one is above scrutiny...[the SIC had] complete rein to follow any lead, to look into every corner of the University to get to the bottom of what happened."    </p>

<p>The Martin report contained similar language, stating that the review team worked "independently from University leadership and staff but with their full cooperation." It explained, "we did not accept any evidence or viewpoints at face value and performed procedures to corroborate the accounts given and assess the completeness of the information provided."</p>

<p><strong>Who Uses These Reports?</strong></p>

<p>Once these reports are public, there are a number of bodies that may use the information provided in the report. Since the Sandusky allegations had many affected parties, the Freeh report was widely used as proof of the Penn State administrators' liability. Most notably, the NCAA <a href="http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/NCAA/Resources/Latest+News/2012/July/21207231">cited</a> the report in support of the extensive sanctions the organization levied on the University.  </p>

<p>In court, the obvious cases have cited the report: the <a href="http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/NCAA/Resources/Latest+News/2012/July/21207231">civil cases</a> on behalf of Sandusky's victims raised against Sandusky and Penn State; the case of <a href="http://www.blackshoediaries.com/2013/1/2/3828222/full-text-of-commonwealth-of-pennsylvania-v-ncaa">Pennsylvania v. NCAA</a>, in which both sides cite the report in their motions; and the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10522402567110339054&hl=en&as_sdt=2,47">Pennsylvania Manufacturer's Association Insurance Company's</a> motion in support of their refusal to fund Penn State's Sandusky-related expenses.</p>

<p>There are more surprising cases that cite the report as well. In <a href="http://legaltimes.typepad.com/files/michael-mann-complaint.pdf">Mann v. National Review</a> [PDF], a meteorologist cites the report in a defamation case. Michael Mann alleges that climate change detractors used the report as an excuse to impugn Mann's name further, "evidently on the theory that a different investigative panel of the university had cleared Dr. Mann of misconduct." In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14867567098129030086">Ochoa v. Rubin</a>, the writ for <em>certiorari</em> claims the pattern of cover up in that case mirrors the Penn State cover up, and uses the Freeh report to prove as much.</p>

<p>The Freeh report prompted discussion on related topics, including <a href="http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2012/10/jerry_sandusky_case_could_dela.html">child abuse law changes</a>, athletic departments sexual harassment policies and <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2135786">wrongful obedience in employment contexts</a>.</p>

<p>The Martin report was less frequently utilized in other areas, particularly because it found no athletic-specific violations. The school <a href="http://espn.go.com/college-sports/story/_/id/8765672/north-carolina-tar-heels-investigation-reveals-academic-scandal-african-american-studies-department">announced</a> that it sent the report to the NCAA, but no further sanctions were imposed by that organization.</p>

<p><strong>How Reliable Are These Reports?</strong></p>

<p>Both the Martin and the Freeh reports have been the subject of public allegations of untruthfulness. The Paterno family, in response to the Freeh report, most notably compiled their own <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/10/us/paterno-family-report">report</a> with the help of former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh. Thornburgh commented on the Freeh report: "The experts determined that the conclusions of the (university) report are based on raw speculation and unsupported opinion &#8212; not facts and evidence." Freeh, in response, criticized the self-serving nature of the Paterno family's analysis.  </p>

<p>The Martin report mainly received criticism from local news media, in addition to a few faculty members. <em>The Raleigh News &#38; Observer</em> published numerous pieces questioning the report. These were published as recently as March 12, 2013, in an editorial titled "<a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/2013/03/12/2744803/unc-ch-paid-heavily-to-review.html">UNC-CH paid heavily to review and spin the scandal</a>." Martin was vigilant in responding to critics on <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/2013/01/02/2579556/jim-martin-we-found-what-we-could.html">an individual basis</a>, attempting to debunk incorrect interpretations. No official counter-report was conducted.  </p>

<p>Whether or not these reports are more accurate than their detractors, there are a certain number of considerations in determining a report's reliability, including methodology, bias and uncooperative witnesses.</p>

<p>While these reports are aimed to be independent, it is possible that some bias still remains. Some investigators may try to increase their own fame by finding notable results, or may be biased toward another involved party, if not the school. It is important to consider all possibilities before choosing an independent reporter.</p>

<p>A school may also want to review the independent report's methodology to ensure a wide scope. To avoid criticism, schools should ensure they are revealing and encouraging the review of all pertinent documents. The Freeh report used "over 430 interviews of key University personnel and other knowledgeable individuals...[and] over 3.5 million pieces of pertinent electronic data and documents." They also set up a hotline and an email address for any individuals to share relevant information, and cooperated with law enforcement and government agencies. The Martin report had a similar methodology, but focused on meeting minutes to determine at what depth the issue of the AFAM classes was discussed. </p>

<p>Finally, there may be uncooperative witnesses. Although schools and investigators cannot do much on this front, it is an important aspect to consider. Many times, key witnesses may be unwilling to speak, probably due to a lawyer's advice. As long as the investigators are aware of this possibility and notify the report's readers, they should not receive excessive criticism on this front.</p>

<p><strong>What Are Other Legal Issues Surrounding Independent Reports?</strong></p>

<p>Schools and investigators should be aware of three further potential liabilities regarding independent reports. They should watch out that they do no not violate attorney-client privilege, employee privacy or confidentiality or leave the investigator open to <a href="http://www.taftlaw.com/news/publications/detail/1024-take-proper-precautions-legal-malpractice-claims-resulting-from-internal-investigations">legal malpractice</a>.  </p>

<p>These independent reports are sure to be a permanent fixture in the sports compliance world. With schools and the NCAA lacking the necessary resources and impartiality, independent investigations will be necessary in many potential rule violations. With these keys in mind, hopefully they will be successful at detecting, punishing, and deterring future rule breakers.</p>

		<title>One Statute for Two Spirits: Same-Sex Marriage in Indian Country</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.ku.edu/kronk">Elizabeth Ann Kronk</a> of the University of Kansas School of Law evaluates the recent approval of a measure to permit same-sex marriages in the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/elizabethkronk.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n March 15, 2013, the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians (LTBB) <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/jurist-the-little-traverse-bay.php">became</a> the third tribal nation to recognize <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriages</a>. The LTBB statute, <a href="http://www.ltbbodawa-nsn.gov/OdawaRegister/Legislative/Statutes/2013/WOS%202013-003%20Marriage.pdf">Waganakising Odawak Statute 2013-003</a> [PDF], defines marriage as "the legal and voluntary union of two persons to the exclusion of all others." The Coquille Tribe, in 2009, and Suquamish Tribe, in 2011, both previously recognized same-sex marriages. Unlike the Coquille Tribe, located within Oregon, and the Suquamish Tribe, located within Washington, LTBB's tribal territory is located within Michigan, a state that does not currently recognize same-sex marriages. Accordingly, some may question the authority of LTBB and similarly situated tribal nations to enact provisions, such as the Waganakising Odawak Statute 2013-003, that conflict with state policy.</p>

<p>As separate sovereigns pre-existing the formation of the US, Native American tribes possess the authority to enact laws governing their internal affairs. Tribal nations existed as separate sovereign nations for centuries before the arrival of non-natives, and, as such, tribal law is separate from either US state or federal law. The sovereignty and separateness of tribal nations was first recognized by the US Supreme Court in 1831 when Chief Justice John Marshall wrote in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6481524100903611909">Cherokee Nation v. Georgia</a> that tribal nations were separate political entities, "domestic dependent nations," capable of managing their own internal affairs. Since 1831, the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12398360851099270972">Supreme Court</a>, the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/25/chapter-14/subchapter-II">US Congress</a> and successive presidents since <a href="http://www.epa.gov/tp/pdf/president-nixon70.pdf">Richard Nixon</a> [PDF] and including <a href="http://www.justice.gov/otj/pdf/obama-executive-memo110509.pdf">Barack Obama</a> [PDF] have consistently reaffirmed tribal sovereignty and the ability of tribes to manage their internal, domestic affairs. Notably, in 1897, the Supreme Court <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4054731357526578264">acknowledged</a> that tribal nations' authority over domestic affairs included authority over marriage requirements within the tribal territory.</p>

<p>In addition to recognizing the separate sovereignty of tribal nations since the early nineteenth century, so too has the US recognized that the laws of states do not apply to tribal nations under certain circumstances. In 1832, the Supreme Court decided <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6938475705816460383">Worcester v. Georgia</a>, which addressed the authority of Georgia to apply its laws to activities occurring within the Cherokee Nation's territory. At the time, the Cherokee Nation was located within the boundaries of Georgia. In holding that Georgia could not apply its laws to activities occurring within the territory of the Cherokee Nation, Marshall explained that the laws of the states generally do not have force and effect within Indian country. Tribes therefore have the inherent sovereignty to pass laws regulating their internal, domestic affairs, and, generally, the laws of the states do not apply in Indian country. Over the ensuing decades, the absolute prohibition against the application of state law within tribal territories has eroded, but it is <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14799549859514416959">still true today</a> that tribal power extends to "what is necessary to protect tribal self-government or to control internal relations." Passage of the LTBB Waganakising Odawak Statute 2013-003 was therefore consistent with this enduring principle of Indian law.</p>

<p>Moreover, adoption of the Waganakising Odawak Statute 2013-003 is also consistent with tribal customs and traditions. In a March 27, 2013, telephone interview [by the author], Annette VanDeCar, an enrolled member of LTBB and Communications Coordinator for LTBB, explained that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered (LGBT) people were historically seen by the Anishinaabe (Odawa, Ojibwe and Algonquin people) of the Great Lakes region as possessing "two spirits" &#8212; one male and one female spirit. As such, LGBT individuals in many tribal communities are typically referred to as "two-spirit people." Two-spirit people were generally accepted by Anishinaabe communities, as it was recognized that each individual had an important role to play within the tribal community. LTBB norms and beliefs may have changed because of the incorporation of Christianity into the community. However, VanDeCar believes that the majority of the present day LTBB community is supportive of two-spirit community members, and she noted that the majority of feedback the tribe has received since passage of the Waganakising Odawak Statute 2013-003 has been positive. In an <a href="http://turtletalk.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/ltbb-chair-dexter-mcnamara-will-sign-same-sex-marriage-ordinance-on-march-15-2013/">e-mail</a> sent by LTBB Chairman Dexter McNamara, he explained that "[t]he Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, in exercising powers of self-governance, shall NOT deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of its laws or deprive any person of liberty or property without due process of law."</p>

<p>The customs and traditions of the Anishinaabe seem to be consistent with other tribal communities. Scholars have <a href="http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/umijlr39&g_sent=1&collection=journals&id=833">identified</a> similar traditions of respecting two-spirit people in other communities, such as the Navajo Nadleehe, Zuni Lhamana, and Lakota Winkte. In this regard, tribal law recognizing same-sex unions or marriages may be <a href="http://freemarry.3cdn.net/db192aac4b3b87faf6_7ym6beks9.pdf">consistent</a> [PDF] with how two-spirit people have been treated historically by some tribal nations. </p>

<p>As previously acknowledged, however, LTBB is located within the territory of the state of Michigan. As far back as the nineteenth century, the Michigan Supreme Court acknowledged that it did not have control over tribal nations' internal affairs, and marriages in particular, commenting in <a href="http://turtletalk.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/kobogum-v-jackson-iron-1889.pdf">Kobogum v. Jackson Iron Co</a> [PDF], that "we had no more right to control [tribal] domestic usage than those of Turkey or India." Accordingly, Michigan will not try to assert its laws over marriages recognized by LTBB.  </p>

<p>However, this does not mean that the state of Michigan will itself recognize same-sex marriages performed within LTBB. According to <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(oe0xuv45ldfzj4455qsff2ig))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectname=mcl-Article-I-25">Article I, Section 25</a> of the <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(0wqguzyovuwmlz33uv4wezbq))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectname=mcl-Constitution">Michigan Constitution</a>, "[t]o secure and preserve the benefits of marriage for our society and for future generations of children, the union of one man and one woman in marriage shall be the only agreement recognized as a marriage or similar union for any purpose." Given that the state of Michigan defines marriage as "the union of one man and one woman," Michigan will not recognize same-sex marriages conducted by LTBB when those benefitting from the LTBB law leave the tribe's territory.  A spokesperson for the Michigan attorney general <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/17/politics/michigan-same-sex-marriage">stated</a> that "[t]he Michigan Constitution defines marriage as a union between one man and one woman. Same-sex marriages performed in other states, countries, or in sovereign tribal nations are not valid in the state of Michigan." This is consistent with the general principle of federal Indian law that Indians are subject to the non-discriminatory state laws applicable to all citizens of the state when they leave tribal territory. </p>

<p>Moreover, Michigan would not be required to recognize same-sex marriages recognized by LTBB under the doctrine of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/comity">comity</a> or the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/full_faith_and_credit">Full Faith and Credit Clause</a> of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/">US Constitution</a>. The doctrine of comity allows states great flexibility in deciding whether or not to recognize the judgments of other jurisdictions. Despite the fact that states generally apply the doctrine of comity to tribal judgments, given that same-sex marriages are constitutionally prohibited in Michigan, it is unlikely that the state would apply the doctrine to same-sex marriages recognized by LTBB. There is debate as to whether the federal recognition requirement applies to tribal nations, given that tribal nations are not US states, and it is unclear whether they would qualify as territories or possessions under the applicable federal <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1738">statute</a>. In the context of same-sex marriages and unions, however, this question is moot given that the <a href="/feature/2012/02/same-sex-marriage.php#doma">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) allows states to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states. Notably, the Supreme Court is currently <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-doma.php">considering</a> the constitutionality of DOMA, and, as a result, the Court's decision may revive debate regarding the application of the federal full faith and credit provision to tribal nations.</p>

<p>In short, LTBB clearly had the authority to enact the Waganakising Odawak Statute 2013-003, allowing for same-sex marriage. Enactment of this statute is consistent with tribal sovereignty, Indian law and, apparently, tribal customs and traditions. In this regard, LTBB becomes one of an increasing number of tribal nations and states recognizing same-sex marriages and unions. Despite the tribe's sovereignty, however, Michigan is currently not required to recognize same-sex marriages performed in accordance with LTBB law.</p>

		<title>How International Drone Policy Shapes Domestic Drone Use</title>
		<link>https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2013/04/samar-warsi-drone-policy/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Samar Warsi of the <a href="http://www.muslimclu.org/">Muslim Civil Liberties Union</a> argues that the international drone policy sets the tone for domestic drone policy decisions...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>F</strong></font>or laws to be effective, they must have ascertainable limits. </p>

                <p>Clear limits are determined by definitions contained within laws and the meanings we attribute to words within those definitions. If international law can be violated through manipulating key conflict definitions, constitutional parameters can be similarly manipulated to encroach on the civil liberties of Americans right here at home. </p>

                <p>To think that the drone policy overseas has no impact on local policies is <a href="http://www.policymic.com/articles/24983/obama-drone-memo-sets-dangerous-precedent-for-domestic-drone-use">misguided</a>, as the "permanent 'war on terror' sets precedents that slowly find their way to be used domestically for largely the same reasons they are deployed abroad." </p>

                <p>When it comes to foreign policy, the entire drone narrative has been fraught with ambiguous language, making it difficult for the American public to pin down President Obama's policy. For example, a few weeks ago, the Obama Administration heeded the bi-partisan demand for more information and released a <a href="http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/holderletter.pdf">statement</a> [PDF] saying that the president does not have the authority to kill "an American not engaged in combat on American soil." However, what does "not engaged in" truly mean?</p>

                <p>Then there were the targeted killing <a href="http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/sections/news/020413_DOJ_White_Paper.pdf">"white papers"</a> [PDF]; a thicket of flimsy and ill-defined terms intended to obfuscate any legal criticism of the president's actions. The document raised more questions than it answered: what does it mean to be a "senior" al Qaeda official? What constitutes "operational?" What is "imminent?" What establishes a "threat?" Who is considered a "high-level official" permitted to order the drone strike? What is the criterion for "feasible?" </p>

                <p>An <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/02/obamas-memo-on-killing-americans-twists-imminent-threat-like-bush/272862/">imminent threat</a> used to be someone who represented a clear and present danger. Now it is someone who appears dangerous. The new "imminent threat" of violence does <strong>not</strong> require the US to have clear evidence that an attack on the US will take place in the immediate future. Impendency can be decided on the whim of the president. While every definition has parameters, those parameters are usually ascertainable. Here, the definition of impendency is so broad the limits are essentially meaningless.</p>

                <p>Collateral damage used to be defined as anyone who was not a target &#8212; now it is only women and children. The narrowed definition of "collateral damage" <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?pagewanted=all">renders</a> "all military-age males in a strike zone as combatants ... unless there is explicit intelligence posthumously proving them innocent." In effect, we determine whether you were innocent after we kill you. There is justice, after all. In essence, there is a presumption of guilt attached to individuals in physical proximity of al Qaeda members. That the proximity could be due to a number of factors (rescue work, journalism, research and so on) other than involvement in terrorist activities seems to be an irrelevant detail to the administration. </p>

                <p>There is a power in the use of such partisan <a href="http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=FTrgh74moswC&oi=fnd&pg=PR6&dq=weapons+of+mass+seduction&ots=69dpwQf3kR&sig=10Cys4FBtMzFOGh1QdMOBAI2kSo">language</a> that tends "to embed itself in everyday discourse and, thus, appear natural, neutral and objective. There are "good guys" and "bad guys"; there is "us" versus "them." Who would not want to kill the "bad guys?" Undoubtedly, there are some individuals that should be killed &#8212; but, the sweeping and dangerous generalizations occurring at the highest government level make it difficult to tell whom.</p>

                <p>The result is a fractured and ambiguous policy. A recently leaked White House <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2013/04/09/188062/obamas-drone-war-kills-others.html">document</a>, acquired by <em>McClatchy</em>, reveals that "at least 265 of up to 482 people who the US intelligence reports estimated the CIA killed during a 12-month period ending in September 2011 were not senior al Qaeda leaders but instead were 'assessed' as Afghan, Pakistani and unknown extremists."</p>

                <p>Americans must demand concrete definitions which provide us with ascertainable limits of the international drone program. While the establishment of concrete definitions would not eradicate all inconsistencies in how the US deals with terror threats, it would be a step towards transparency. Details would give the drone program a legitimacy it currently lacks. It would allow us to retroactively analyze how accurate our defense programs are, assess and address policy concerns, truthfully research how our relationships with other countries are developing as a result of such programs and allow families who have been wronged to seek redress and compensation. Without any determinable guidelines, there can be neither objective evaluation nor progress. </p>

                <p>Failing to ask for ascertainable limits of the international drone program sends one of two messages: 1) we are not paying attention to how the government is manipulating laws, or 2) we know, but we do not care. Either option sets the stage for the manipulation of laws at home. When it comes to the issue of domestic drones, the foreign drone policy sets the tone. In the context of criminal justice, specifically the "war on terror," the use of domestic drones can quickly strip away one's civil liberties under the guise of national security.</p>

                <p>The <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> safeguards the "right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures" by the government. This means police need a warrant to search a person or their property, with a few exceptions. Whether government surveillance constitutes a "search" depends upon the reasonableness test set forth in Justice Harlan's concurrence in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=katz+v+united+states&hl=en&as_sdt=2,5&case=9210492700696416594&scilh=0">Katz v. US</a>. The test considers whether the person has a subjective expectation of privacy in the area to be searched and whether society is prepared to deem that expectation reasonable. One's home always falls within the scope of protected areas under the Fourth Amendment. </p>

                <p>One exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement, explained in <em>National Treasury Employees Union v. Von Rabb</em>, is the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=national+treasury+union+v+von+raab&hl=en&as_sdt=2,5&case=9123832187759361431&scilh=0">"special needs"</a> doctrine which requires the government to demonstrate that the government interest outweighs the intrusion. The "special needs" exception could give law enforcement a free pass to monitor specific homes when looking for domestic terror threats. Without written guidelines, law enforcement could justify any number of surveillance initiatives under the pretext of fighting the "war on terror." In addition, given the political and social stigmatization of Islam, the potential for misuse of the "special needs" exception to disproportionately target American Muslims is great. Last year's <a href="/hotline/2012/05/samar-warsi-muslim-surveillance.php">unlawful surveillance</a> of Muslims throughout New York by the New York Police Department is evidence of this risk. </p>

                <p>It is imperative to have clear and unambiguous written policies regarding the parameters of domestic drone use. As Noam Chomsky famously stated, we must engage in <a href="http://openpolitics.ca/tiki-index.php?page=Intellectual+Self-Defense+by+Noam+Chomsky">"intellectual self-defense"</a> by staying informed. Specifically, we must scrutinize words, their meanings and their implications. Words create perceptions which form the basis for government policy, create narratives that contribute to public complacency and most importantly, dictate the scope of laws. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Olga Synoverska is an LL.M. candidate from the <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/">University of Pittsburgh School of Law</a> Class of 2013, and has interned at OMP Law Offices in Kyiv Ukraine while studying for her law degree. Synoverska discusses a recent change to the laws of Ukraine regarding the commonplace practice of Members of Parliament entering votes for their colleagues...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/dateline/olga_synoverska.jpg" width="120" height="194" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n February 22, 2013, the <a href="http://rada.gov.ua/en">Verkhovna Rada</a> of Ukraine (the Parliament) amended Part 3, Article 47, of the <a href="http://zakon4.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/1861-17/print1360302238778531">Law of Ukraine on the Rules of Procedure of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine</a>. The new changes were made to ensure each member of Parliament personally votes instead of having a deputy or another member of Parliament do it for him. The Parliament hopes to accomplish this by implementing a system of tracking violations of new personal voting rule. The changes constitute a compromise between the majority and opposition in Parliament, ending a standoff since February 5, 2013, the date the second session of Parliament opened. The opposition blocked any work in Parliament until a change was made to the old electronic vote-counting system of voting in Parliament. The rampant problem of violation of the personal voting rule has long been a heated source of contention in Ukraine. Under Article 47 of the above-mentioned law, members of Parliament are obligated to vote in person using the electronic vote-counting system at the session of the Parliament or at location specifically designated for secret voting near the plenary hall.   </p>

<p>The electronic vote-counting system, named "Rada-3," was created in 2002 to ensure voting by each parliamentarian in person by using specific personal electronic cards. To vote, the member of Parliament must put his personal card into the vote-counting system and to press one of the three buttons &#8212; "for,"  "against" or "abstention" within ten seconds. However, such procedure of personal voting turned out to be ineffective. There were numerous cases of members of Parliament giving their personal voting cards to their colleagues, who would use them to vote for the absent Member. Such members became well known throughout Ukrainian society as <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20730241">"button pushers"</a>. </p>

<p>Under the newly adopted system of vote-tracking, if a violation of the personal voting rule is believed to have occurred by a member of Parliament, the work of Parliament shall be stopped on his demand. The chairman shall determine whether the deputy whose card was used for voting is present. In case of his/her absence, the voting card of an absent deputy <a href="http://rada.gov.ua/news/Top-novyna/73133.html">shall be forfeited</a> and the voting for a proposal shall be conducted again. The new amendments to the personal voting rule are not the first attempt to change the unethical practice of voting by members of Parliament. In December 2012, the Parliament amended Article 26 of the Law of Ukraine on the Rules of Procedure of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine to require personal registration of each Member of Parliament before a plenary meeting using the identification card and signature through the electronic system. From the legal standpoint voting for other deputies constitutes a direct violation of the Constitution of Ukraine, Article 84 of which stipulates that voting at the meetings of the Parliament of Ukraine shall be performed by a people's deputy of Ukraine in person.  </p>

<p>In 1998, the <a href="http://www.ccu.gov.ua/en/">Constitutional Court of Ukraine</a>, which is authorized to give official interpretation of the Constitution and laws of Ukraine, held that Article 84 of the <a href="http://www.ccu.gov.ua/en/doccatalog/list;jsessionid=7B3E71314DEE7005047FDD7D6E450C81?currDir=12083">Constitution of Ukraine</a> precluded the use by one member of Parliament of another member of Parliament's card to vote for him. The Constitutional Court <a href="http://zakon4.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/v011p710-98">stated</a> that such action contradicts the nature of the constitutional mandate of the elected member of Parliament who shall act as an authorized representative of the Ukrainian nation in Parliament. The Constitutional Court mentioned that the practice of voting for another deputy has no legal grounds. Moreover, the Constitutional Court emphasized that according to Article 152 of the Constitution of Ukraine, any law or other legal act by the government shall be deemed unconstitutional if there was a procedural violation in the process of reviewing and adopting said law or other legal act. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/homepage_en/">European Court of Human Rights</a> (the ECHR) also addressed the problem of personal voting rule violation by Members of the Ukrainian Parliament) in the case <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-115871#{%22itemid%22:[%22001-115871%22]}">Volkov v. Ukraine</a>, decided on January 9, 2013. Oleksandr Volkov, a judge on the Supreme Court of Ukraine, was dismissed from his for "breach of oath." Volkov claimed that the Parliament abused the electronic voting system when it dismissed him as a judge. He argued that members of Parliament used voting cards of their colleagues who were not present at the plenary meeting when voting for his dismissal. To support his complaint, Volkov provided written statements of four Members of Parliament and video record of the plenary meeting when his dismissal vote occurred. The ECHR found that Volkov's dismissal violated the Constitution and the current laws of Ukraine that require personal voting by members of Parliament. Furthermore, the ECHR found such actions by the members of Parliament violated the principle of legal certainty, which constitutes a breach of Article 6, Section 1 of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/EN/Header/Basic+Texts/The+Convention+and+additional+protocols/The+European+Convention+on+Human+Rights/">European Convention on Human Rights</a>. </p>

<p>Since the passage of the amendments to the personal voting rule, politicians are discussing the necessity of creating a new electronic system to replace "Rada-3," which will make it impossible for any Member of Parliament to vote for another. The largest challenge for Ukrainian parliamentarians will be introduction of liability for those deputies who violate the personal voting rule. Even though liability for similar violations is common in other countries, the concept is uncommon in Ukrainian law and will be a difficult change to bring to fruition.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Associate Editor <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=Fangxing+Li">Fangxing Li</a>, <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/">University of Pittsburgh School of Law</a> Class of 2014, explores the upcoming US Supreme Court decision on affirmative action policies in institutions of higher education and argues that these policies harm rather than help diversity in schools that employ those policies...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="li2.jpg" src="/dateline/li2.jpg" width="120" height="200" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n March, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-to-rules-on-new-affirmative-action-issue.php">granted certiorari</a> on <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/schuette-v-coalition-to-defend-affirmative-action/">Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action</a>. This is the second affirmative action case currently before the Court; the <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/us-supreme-court-hears-oral-arguments-on-affirmative-action-challenge.php">oral argument</a> of the another case, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1696883576127835788">Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin</a>, was conducted in October 2012.</p>

<p>The current debate on affirmative action is whether the Court should overrule <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5183084208914209139">Grutter v. Bollinger</a>, the most recent landmark case that provided the jurisprudence supporting higher education institutions' affirmative actions when the schools have a compelling interest in attaining a racially-diverse student body that can pass the most rigorous <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/strict_scrutiny">strict scrutiny test</a> on race-based admission process, and when their holistic reviews of applications are narrowly tailored to further the compelling governmental interest.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Equal Protection Clause</a> of the Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution provides that no State shall "deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."</p>

<p>Justice Powell, in his touchstone opinion in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4987623155291151023">Regents of the University of California v. Bakke</a>, characterized the interests of remedying past discrimination and racial balancing as not compelling and left only the interest of attaining a diversity student body as legitimate aim that survived strict scrutiny. He therefore struck down a medical school's admission policy that reserved 16 out of 100 seats for students of certain minority groups. The interest, in Justice Powell's view, is not a simple one with statistical ethnic diversity but embraces "a far broader array of qualifications and characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important element."</p>

<p>Twenty-five years later, the Court reviewed University of Michigan Law School's admission procedure in <em>Grutter</em> and upheld its constitutionality on the ground that its consideration of race was lawful when the interest of diversity by aiming at enrolling a "critical mass" of minority students was a compelling state interest that could justify the use of race in university admissions. Justice O'Connor explained that critical mass must be "defined by reference to the educational benefits that diversity is designed to produce," and the Court was to give a degree of deference to a university's academic decisions within constitutionally prescribed limits." However, the idea of "critical mass" was largely overshadowed by Chief Justice Rehnquist's dissent that the term should be interpreted only as a proportion of the student body, or in other words, a disguised label of quota, that was strictly rejected by the <em>Bakke</em> Court, and the Court's "application of [the strict scrutiny] review is unprecedented in its deference."</p>

<p>In the current <em>Fisher</em> case, The University of Texas (UT) observed that there are "underrepresented" minorities based on a comparison between the undergraduate student body and the state's population, and there were some other racial groups that were overrepresented. For instance, Hispanic enrollment was less than two-thirds of the Hispanic percentage of Texas' population and African-American enrollment was only half of the African-American percentage of Texas' population, whereas Asian-American enrollment was more than five times the Asian-American percentage of Texas' population. In 2004, for example, Asian-Americans comprised about three percent of the population in Texas, yet accounted for 18 percent of UT's freshman class.</p>

<p>However, isn't true diversity found only at the individual level and created by individual differences in ability, experience, interest, opinion and other personal qualities, judged without resort to the invidious short cut of racial stereotyping? Student body diversity is an educational interest but never a representational one. A lack of proportional representation could never justify racial preferences. Diversity may help with classroom discussion, preparation for the real life diverse working environment and achieving the "one Nation" dream. It calls for students of different backgrounds, experiences, majors, socio-economic statuses and other indexes that can help the school achieve these educational benefits. However, UT is simply differentiating students by their race to bring UT's student-body demographics in line with the racial demographics of the state. Simply admitting more minority students will not benefit diversity, and the true diversity cannot be explained purely by the color of students' skin. UT's effort of characterizing minority groups as "underrepresented" and "overrepresented" is a disguised racial balancing approach in that its only purpose is to have "some specified percentage of a particular group merely because of its race or ethnic origin", an idea that was clearly rejected by <em>Bakke</em>. UT's use of race in admissions does not favor, and actually discriminates against other groups. It is not clear why fewer members of one group than another be needed to achieve the educational benefits of diversity.</p>

<p>Furthermore, even assuming that race was a decisive factor in the admission process, UT's use of race still could only have added, at most, 58 African-American and 158 Hispanic students to an in-state class of 6,322. In other words, the race-conscious policy would have only admitted 0.92 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively, of the whole student body enrolled in the in-state freshman class. The 2.7 percent difference, or 33 additional students, between 2004 and 2008 would be the <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/vp/irla/Documents/American%20Center%20for%20Law%20and%20Justice%20May%2029%202012.pdf">only affected number by race</a> [PDF], if race were determinative of their admission. Diversity would never be achieved by such a negligible effect produced by the race-conscious mean in the huge size of student body. This is not even close to a "narrowly tailored" mean to achieve the richly diverse student body.</p>

<p>Moreover, the "critical mass" test in <em>Grutter</em> is flawed. Justice O'Connor refused to tie the concept of "critical mass" to any fixed number. Rather, she suggested that critical mass meant a "meaningful numbers" or "meaningful representation" that will encourage underrepresented minority students to participate in the classroom and allow them to not feel isolated. But the definition itself does not provide any meaningful guide that helps school define what is the real critical line but rather create ambiguity that may lead to floods of litigation. Any percentage of minorities, either published or unpublished, is defined by the school. The criteria that are used to examine whether the goals such as "minorities not feeling isolated, adequate class interaction and students critical thinking" were achieved can by no means be proved or disproved. What's more, <em>Grutter</em> simply gave deference to the university and concluded that its use of race was constitutional as long as there was no specific percentage of minority enrollments under the critical mass, and the school might have an unspecified number although it is inherently similar to quota, an idea expressly rejected in <em>Bakke</em>. </p>

<p>Justice Scalia depicted the critical mass justification for its discrimination race challenges as a "sham to cover the scheme of racially proportionate admissions." How can a vague, self-contradicted and unsuccessful test provide any helpful guidance to schools? By the way, is it really a strict scrutiny? Under <em>Grutter's</em> jurisprudence, as long as a school imitates the University of Michigan's admission process by articulating its purpose to reach diversity to the level of "critical mass" and the school considers race in a holistic and individualized manner, it will survive the strict scrutiny test. <em>Grutter's</em> lenient use of strict scrutiny and unprecedented deference is never seen in the Court's history.</p>

<p>The US was founded on the principle that "all Men are created equal." "All Men" now mean all human beings&#8212;men, women and all ethnicities. We have seen the worst times of discrimination with "<a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16038751515555215717">separate but equal</a>" policies that established that ethnic minorities were inherently unequal to white Americans. To redress past evil, the Court sustained the interest of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12652464934759819033">"remedying the past wrong."</a> However, race is corrosive to human dignity and the fundamental value of individual rights under our Constitution. Our dream is to create "a nation of equal citizens in a society where race is irrelevant to personal opportunity and achievement." Affirmative action, with no doubt, violates this fundamental principle. Any further use of race will detrimentally harm innocent citizens.</p>

<p>Race is an immutable character trait with which people are born naturally. With internationalization, more and more people choose to marry with members of other racial or ethnic groups, and there is no way to characterize others as purely Caucasians, Asians or African-Americans. As Justice Kennedy concurred in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13995371921000266257">Parents<br />
Involved v. Seattle School District No.1</a>, "[w]hen the government classifies an individual by race, it must first define what it means to be of a race. Who exactly is white and who is nonwhite?" In <em>Plessy</em>, this Court held that a 7/8 white passenger should be denied use of public facility on account of the statute that was discriminating against blacks. Recently, a driver <a href="http://offthebench.nbcsports.com/2012/04/20/driver-sues-nascar-says-he-was-too-caucasian-for-diversity-program/">sued</a> NASCAR because he believed that NASCAR denied him because he did not fit the purpose of the affirmative action program because he looked like a Caucasian male. </p>

<p>Now, what if a half-Asian half-African American applies to UT, should she be favored or disfavored? Does a 1/16 African-American who looks white fit for the protected targets under affirmative action? What about 1/64? 1/128? Are we really distinguishing people under their color of skin, and under what ground can that be justified? </p>

<p>"Programs should also not unduly burden individuals who are not members of the favored racial and ethnic groups." Now the <a href="http://www.projectonfairrepresentation.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/Amicus-Brief-Fisher-v-Univ-of-Texas-Asian-American-Legal-Foundation.pdf">net penalty</a> [PDF] for Asian-Americans under those race-based diversity programs was 280 SAT points relative to African Americans and 235 to Hispanic applicants. Is this penalty minimal and can it be ignored?</p>

<p>Due to the discriminating admission policy, many Chinese-American children <a href="http://www.projectonfairrepresentation.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/Amicus-Brief-Fisher-v-Univ-of-Texas-Asian-American-Legal-Foundation.pdf">have become ashamed</a> [PDF] of their ethnic heritage after concluding that their unfair denial is a form of punishment for doing something wrong and are thus unwilling to state their race at all on college applications or self-identify with their non-Asian parents. It is absurd to punish those people under the disguise of affirmative action. Classifications based on race carry a danger of stigmatic harm, may promote notions of racial inferiority and threaten to incite racial hostility. It is not our Nation's wish to send to any racial group message that they are not part of it.</p>

<p>The racial diversity is also not justified in that it is too over-inclusive as it does not distinguish different racial groups. For example, Asian-Americans incorporate Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Indian and others. These racial groups have very different backgrounds, languages, cultures and perspectives, and their viewpoints are highly diverse. The compelling interest of government is "true diversity," which is based on students' distinct socio-economic status of their family, languages other than English spoken at home, a single-parent household, different sexual orientations and others rather than the color of their skin. </p>

<p>Race-conscious admission process also might <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/11-345tsacAbigailThernstromStephanThernstromAltheaK.NagaiAndRussellNieli-3.pdf">detrimentally affect certain protected minority students</a> [PDF]. People may tend to work or study with others who share equality of status, or, put in the context in the instant case, who are admitted by the regular means rather than benefiting from other aspects rather than grades. Whites and Asians may express considerable "social distance" from African Americans and Hispanics who benefited from affirmative action because of their lower standardized test scores, and thus to every African American or Hispanic who does not benefit from affirmative action. African Americans may tend to self-segregate and some African Americans or Hispanics, such as the ones who were not admitted because of affirmative action, may undergo unfair disrespect.  </p>

<p>What still echoes is Justice Harlan's notable dissent in <em>Plessy</em>: "[o]ur Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens. In respect of civil rights, all citizens are equal before the law." Justice O'Connor's expectation that 25 years from then the end of use would come is only a pure speculation, and it is now time to act. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www1.law.wne.edu/faculty/index.cfm?selection=doc.9735&uid=79">Lauren Carasik</a> of the Western New England School of Law says that the US must restrict aid to the Honduran government, so long as human rights abuses continue ...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/laurencarasik.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="L" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>H</strong></font>onduras is plagued by the world's highest homicide rate. This has been widely reported for the past two years, yet the number of deaths has continued to climb. The UN put the number of homicides in 2011 at <a href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/homicide.html">91 per 100,000</a>. The rate has spiked since the illegal <em>coup d'&#233;tat</em> that ousted the country's democratically elected president in 2009 and the subsequent breakdown of Honduras' institutions; in 2008 the homicide rate was 61 per 100,000. A climate of impunity solidified as the generals and others who carried out the coup were rewarded with appointments in the post-coup government rather than prosecuted for their role in the overthrow.</p>

<p>Contrary to what is often suggested in the press, the violence is not just random or drug- or gang-related; some of the most vulnerable sectors in society are frequent targets &#8212; those whose rights the US Department of State tells us it considers to be a high priority &#8212; women, the LGBT community, journalists, opposition party politicians and Hondurans who opposed the coup. Twenty-five journalists <a href="http://en.rsf.org/honduras-another-journalist-slain-special-16-08-2012,43232.html">have been murdered</a> in Honduras since the 2009 coup; all but one of them since the current post-coup president, Pepe Lobo, took office in January 2010. At least 53 lawyers <a href="http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=712249&CategoryId=23558">were killed</a> between 2010 and 2012.</p>

<p>On my recent trip to the Lower Aguan region of northern Honduras, I visited with <em>campesinos</em> from the San Isidro collective that were occupying land to which they possessed legal title, the patina of legitimacy that has often been wrested away from the <em>campesino</em> collectives through fraud and coercion. This legal title emanated from a rare victory meted out by the notoriously ineffective judicial system that typically favors the agro-oligarchs engaging in brutal land grabs in the region. Those with whom we met spoke eloquently of their intrepid lawyer, Antonio Trejo. He was the only lawyer in the Aguan region that had successfully litigated land rights claims for the campesinos. Trejo was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-19695587">gunned down</a> in September 2012, and his brother was murdered five months later. While some are confident that Trejo's murder was related to political persecution, alternative apolitical motives for Trejo's murder have been floated. Irrespective of the motive, Trejo's untimely death eliminates the one lawyer who had achieved any relief for the beleaguered campesinos of the Lower Aguan. Each murder statistic rattled off is a real person with a real family that will be forever anguished by the loss of their loved ones. </p>

<p>This repression has been aided by US support for the alleged perpetrators of many of these crimes: the Honduran police and military. Concerned US citizens across the country have weighed in with our members of Congress, and Hondurans and other Latinos living in the US have also voiced their concerns about US support for Honduras' police and military while it continues to kill, kidnap, torture and commit other heinous crimes with impunity. Congress responded to these concerns. In March 2012, 94 members sent a <a href="http://www.justforeignpolicy.org/sites/default/files/signed_honduras_letter.pdf">letter</a> [PDF] to the State Department urging it "to suspend US assistance to the Honduran military and police given the credible allegations of widespread, serious violations of human rights attributed to the security forces." Just this January, 58 members <a href="http://hankjohnson.house.gov/press-release/rep-johnson-57-colleagues-call-investigation-dea-related-killings-honduras">voiced concerns</a> about repression of Honduras' Afro-indigenous Garifuna community, several of whom were "<a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/collateral-damage-of-a-drug-war">collateral damage</a>" in a lethal DEA-related counter narcotics operation last May.</p>

<p>The response from the State Department has been tepid at best. When asked about human rights in Honduras, State Department spokespersons speak of "protect[ing] the human rights of all Hondurans," as they did <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2013/03/206637.htm#HONDURAS">yet again</a> last month, yet they fail to express concern regarding the many attacks targeting political opponents and other vulnerable groups. Meanwhile, the killings have continued while the perpetrators go free. Partly in response to the lack of urgency on the part of both the State Department and the Honduran government to halt the killings by the police and military, last year Congress halted tens of millions of dollars in aid money under the "<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/2304">Leahy Law</a>" which bars US assistance to units believed responsible for gross human rights abuses.</p>

<p>Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and his colleagues' concerns have focused on National Police Director General Juan Carlos "El Tigre" Bonilla, who has been accused of running death squads in the early 2000s. While it is true that Bonilla was acquitted of a murder charge, the head of police internal affairs at the time, Maria Luisa Borjas, claims that she was threatened and that high-level security officials <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/10267975">obstructed investigations</a> into serious allegations against Bonilla regarding murders and forced disappearances. Other pending murder charges against Bonilla have not yet been fully investigated.</p>

<p>US funds for the Honduran police have continued, but State Department officials have said that these are for specially "vetted" units that are not under Bonilla's control. US Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs William Brownfield even committed to <a href="http://justf.org/blog/2013/03/29/nl-assistant-secretary-brownfields-trip-honduras-and-costa-rica">increasing security assistance</a> to the tune of $16.3 million during a trip to Honduras over St. Patrick's Day weekend.</p>

<p>The same weekend, the Associated Press released a <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/honduras-police-accused-death-squad-killings">major investigative feature</a> examining ongoing death squad activity in the Honduran police, profiling among others the case of a suspected gang member and his girlfriend who were taken into police custody and subsequently disappeared. The AP also noted that other recent incidents &#8212; including one caught on video showing the extrajudicial killings of suspected gang members by armed gun men on city streets &#8212; fit the modus operandi of police death squads, and that Honduran prosecutors have received over 200 complaints about "death squad style killings" in Honduras' two largest cities over the last three years.</p>

<p>It appears that the State Department has not been honest with Congress about whom it is funding. A follow-up <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/us-aids-honduran-police-despite-death-squad-fears">AP report</a> reveals that no special "vetted" units exist outside of Bonilla's control. All Honduran police &#8212; according to Honduran officials and legal experts cited in the article &#8212; report to the national police chief after all. It is inconceivable that the US State Department was not aware of this chain of command, nor that US funds could easily wind up in the hands of police death squads.</p>

<p>It is outrageous if the State Department is attempting an end run around Congress to fund shady, questionable security forces in Honduras. Such conduct disrespects Congress, and disrespects constituents who have worked hard to have our voices heard regarding what is done in our name, with our taxpayer dollars. Given US complicity in human rights abuses in Central America for decades, we should know better. History has demonstrated our willingness to disregard human rights abuses while advancing US geopolitical interests. In fact, these revelations come just as General Rios Montt finally faces trial for the genocide perpetrated by his scorched earth policies in Guatemala, and the US has apologized for its role in Guatemala's bloody history. We must not repeat past mistakes that contributed to unspeakable suffering.</p>

<p>There are simply too many concerns, too many red flags, for the US-Honduran relationship to continue on its current path. The State Department's response to ongoing questions over Bonilla's dark history should be to exercise the precautionary principle and cut off funding as long as the questions persist. But that cannot be all: more importantly, US support for Honduras' brutal police and military must cease as long as the rights violations continue and impunity reigns. John Kerry, the new US secretary of state, has <a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2018912385_aplthondurashumanrights.html">signaled before</a> that he is sympathetic to this common sense approach. Let's hope he maintains that posture in his new capacity.</p>

		<title>Freedom of Religion in Palestine: Converting Religions</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Ibrahim Fares, an LL.M. Candidate from the <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/">University of Pittsburgh School of Law</a> Class of 2013, explains the impact of religion on legal rights in Palestine...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>R</strong></font>eligion affects many aspects of life in Palestine, including legal rights. One sensitive issue in Palestine is converting from Islam to Christianity (or vice versa) and from within a religion to a different school. Religion may not have legal effects in the US or Europe; however in the Arabic world in general, and in Palestine in particular, it has significant legal implications. As a result, this article seeks to clarify the legal system of converting religions in Palestine under the <a href="http://www.palestinianbasiclaw.org/basic-law/2003-amended-basic-law">Palestinian Basic Law 2003</a>, which act as a temporary constitution, and its effects on freedom of religion. </p>

<p>Article 9 of the Palestinian Basic Law provides that: "Palestinians are equal before the law and the judiciary, without distinction based upon race, sex, color, religion, political views or disability." Article 18 expressly provides: "Freedom of belief, worship and the performance of religious functions are guaranteed." Moreover, Article 10 stipulates that: "basic human rights and liberties shall be protected and respected." </p>

<p>Thus, it is clear that the Palestinian Basic Law guarantees the freedom of religion as a constitutional right. Because Palestine is not yet a state and cannot join international conventions related to human rights, the Palestinian National Authority under Article 10 binds itself by all the UN human rights conventions and declarations. One of the most important declarations of human rights is <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml">the Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>, which guarantees freedom of religion under Articles 16 and 18. </p>

<p>In terms of converting religion, the process of converting from Christianity to Islam and vice versa requires a legal procedure that has to be endorsed by "the competent authorities," such as the religious courts.</p>

<p>Article 36 of the Palestinian Status Law Number 2 of 1999 provides that any change or correction in the civil status "should be by a final court judgment," but in Article 37 the law exempts religion from this process and provides that to change religions requires only documents issued by "the competent authority." To clarify the process in practice, I will give a hypothetical example. When a Christian wants to be a Muslim, the process works as follows:   <ol><br />
	<li>The Christian must fill out an application and then appear in front of a Shar'h court with two witnesses to assert that he has become a Muslim .</li><br />
	<li>After the application is completed and endorsed by the Shar'h court, it must be circulated to all governmental departments, because this change has significant legal effects regarding family law, as will be explained later.</li><br />
	<li>The Shar'h court has to circulate the previous procedures in a local newspaper to inform the public in new legal situation to the interested person.</li></ol>As mentioned above, in Palestine converting religion has a significant impact especially regarding family law. The enforceable family law for Muslims is Family Law Number 61 of 1961, which is based on Islamic rules. Christians are governed by laws established by their respective churches. The significant effects are:</p>

<p><em>A. Marriage and Divorce</em></p>

<p>The main rule of marriage for both Muslims and Christians is not to allow marriage between them. This rule motivates some Christians to become Muslims and vice versa just for marriage purposes. As the result of changing religions, some Palestinian women have been <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/jun/23/israel">killed</a> in order to protect family honor. If one person in the couple, either a Muslim or a Christian, changes his or her religion, then the marriage becomes invalid.</p>

<p>With respect to divorce in Christianity, some Catholics have converted to Orthodoxy, because the Orthodox school is <a href="http://www.freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/inline_images/Palestine%20(Palestinian%20Authority%20and%20Israeli%20Occupied%20Territories).pdf">more flexible in divorce proceedings</a> [PDF].</p>

<p><em>B. Inheritance</em><br />
 <br />
In both Christian and Muslim families, if any member of the family converts his or her religion, he or she loses inheritance rights. This is a major rule in both religions: any "renegade" (a person who changed his religion) does not have the right to inherit. </p>

<p><em>C. Change in Personal Identification (ID)</em></p>

<p>On the Palestinian ID, there is a space for religion and anyone who changes his or her religion has to change his or her ID to be consistent with the effects under the new religion. Moreover, a change in ID in such a case is often accompanied by a change in name, which requires a judgment from a competent court . </p>

<p><em>D. Custody</em>  </p>

<p>Divorced women are entitled to custody of their children, either in Islamic or Christian rules; but, the divorced mother loses the custody of her children if she converts her religion. According to both Islam and Christianity there is no custody for a "renegade" . </p>

<p>Under legal precedent regarding religious conversion, it seems that family laws for Muslims and Christians violate the Palestinian Basic Law, which is the supreme law in the country, especially Articles 9, 18 and 10 that guarantee freedom of belief, worship and the performance of religious functions. On the other hand, the Palestinian Status Law Number 2 of 1999 also violates the Palestinian Basic Law by requiring such procedures to convert religion.</p>

<p>The first <a href="http://www.islamahmadiyya.net/show_page.asp?content_key=18&article_id=274">case</a> before the Palestinian Constitutional Court  regarding freedom of religion was in July 2010. In this case, Palestinian couples believed in an Islamic school called <em>Al-ahmdeh</em>. This school was not recognized by Sunni Muslims, the majority of Muslims in Palestine. The Personal Status Prosecution (Shar'h Prosecution) filed a complaint against the couples before the First Shar'h court, claiming that their marriage contract was invalid because these couples were "renegades," not Muslims, because they believed in that school. The First Shar'h court <a href="http://www.islamahmadiyya.net/show_page.asp?content_key=18&article_id=274">held</a> that their marriage contract was invalid. </p>

<p>The defendant appealed and filed an action before the Palestinian Constitutional Court, asking the court to decide that the Shar'h Prosecution was unconstitutional because it violated Articles 9 and 18 of the Palestinian Basic Law. The Constitutional Court <a href="http://www.maannews.net/arb/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=368690">dismissed</a> the case because the plaintiff did not sue the government in the action, which is a procedural requirement for the Constitutional Court. </p>

<p>On appeal, the Shar'h Court of Appeals in November 2011 <a href="http://www.islamahmadiyya.net/show_page.asp?content_key=18&article_id=274">ruled</a> that the contract marriage of the couples was valid, because the couples "re-enter[ed] the Islam." This decision came as a result of public pressure, resulting from extensive media coverage and human right institutions interested in the case. Interestingly, Palestinian society was divided on the issue. Some believed that freedom of religion is a constitutional right and the Constitutional Court has to protect this right by holding that the marriage is valid and the Shar'h Prosecution's powers were unconstitutional because it does not have the right to decide who is or is not Muslim. Others supported the Shar'h Prosecution's perspective. Unfortunately, when the Constitutional Court noticed that this case had become a public case, it preferred to get out of that debate and dismissed the case, rather than upholding and protecting the Palestinian Basic Law's articles that guarantee the freedom of religion. </p>

<p>Undoubtedly, there is a huge gap between the Palestinian Basic Law, which guarantees freedom of religion, and the Palestinian legal and judicial system. Ultimately, the Palestinian Constitutional Court must address this gap but it has failed to take this responsibility as it should under its law.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.creighton.edu/law/faculty/borchers/index.php">Patrick Borchers</a> of the Creighton University School of Law says that the Supreme Court's opinion in <em>Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum</em> overlooks recent relevant developments in the conflict of laws and may have unintended effects on future cases...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/patrickborchers.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he US Supreme Court's already-strange extraterritoriality jurisprudence just got a lot stranger with its April 17 decision in <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/supreme-court-rules-against-extraterritorial-application-of-alien-tort-statute.php">Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum</a>. Because my academic specialty is the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/conflict_of_laws">conflict of laws</a>, I tend to see these decisions through the lens of my discipline. So viewed, <em>Kiobel</em> appears to be part of an ongoing campaign to roll the clock back to the 1950s or even earlier.</p>

<p>The facts in <em>Kiobel</em> are well-known to anyone who has followed the case and I will not dwell long on them.  The plaintiffs were Nigerian nationals now living in the US. They alleged &#8212; and at the pleading stage it must be accepted as true &#8212; that various Dutch, British and Nigerian oil corporations (though the corporate defendants were alleged to have some physical presence in the US) conspired with the Nigerian government to commit grotesque human rights violations against locals who were protesting the environmental effects of the corporate defendants' activities.</p>

<p>The plaintiffs brought suit in a New York federal court under a funny little law called the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1350">Alien Tort Statute</a> (ATS). That statute, which dates back to the original <a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/judiciary.html">Judiciary Act of 1789</a>, provides that "[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States." The ATS was <a href="http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL32118_20031002.pdf">apparently enacted</a> [PDF] in response to two notorious episodes in the 1780's. One involved a 1784 assault in Philadelphia on the Secretary of the French Foreign Legion. The other came three years later when a New York constable entered the Dutch Ambassador's house and arrested one of his servants.</p>

<p>In the 1980's the statute was rediscovered. In the famous US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit case of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17038181689969568294">Filartiga v. Pena-Irala</a>, the plaintiffs claimed that their 17-year-old son was tortured to death in Paraguay by the defendant &#8212; a police official &#8212; in reprisal for the family's political views. Jurisdiction over the defendant was obtained by personal service of process while the defendant was in New York. The Second Circuit ruled that the ATS was an appropriate vehicle for relief because conduct of this sort violated the law of nations, even when committed by a government official against one of this own nationals.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court eventually waded into the debate in 2004 in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6103279683071618777">Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain</a>. The Court held that the ATS did provide a federal forum for torts that transgressed a well-established norm of international law. The Court said that the norm had to be well enough established that it corresponded to the norms that Sir William Blackstone <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=R20aAAAAYAAJ&dq=intitle%3ACommentaries%20inauthor%3Ablackstone%20inauthor%3ACarey-Jones&lr&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is&num=100&as_brr=0&pg=PA2236#v=onepage&q&f=false">listed</a> around the time of the ATS's passage &#8212; violation of safe conducts, infringements of the rights of ambassadors and piracy. Holding that the facts of <em>Sosa</em> did not rise to that level, the Court held that no relief could lie.</p>

<p>In <em>Kiobel</em>, the Supreme Court took the case apparently to resolve a circuit split as to whether corporations could be liable for the torts imported through the ATS. The Second Circuit <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17590512216294512273">had said no</a> while the US Courts of Appeal for the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4610835644669817272">Seventh</a>, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1723281947781561009">Ninth</a>, and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5749540025048255283">District of Columbia</a> Circuits had said yes. <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-corporate-liability-for-torture-overseas.php">Oral argument</a>, however, quickly shifted to the question of whether, given the slender connections to the US, the arm of the relief in a federal forum could reach the case.</p>

<p>The Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/supreme-court-to-rehear-arguments-on-corporate-liability-for-human-rights-violations.php">ordered</a> more briefing and another round of argument. Unanimously in result, though not in rationale, the Court said no.</p>

<p>The Court said that the ATS contained no clear expression that it was intended to apply "extraterritorially." Relying heavily on its fairly recent decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3519216444119666685">Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd.</a> &#8212; which held that federal securities fraud laws applied only to securities traded in the US &#8212; the Court held that the "presumption against extraterritoriality" was not overcome.</p>

<p>So why all the fuss? One factor, of course, is the gruesome facts of <em>Kiobel</em> and the practical consequence that the ATS will now apply to only a very small fraction of cases of the sort in which it has been used recently. Essentially, the majority opinion of Chief Justice John Roberts seemed to say that if the liability-creating facts occurred outside the US, relief under the ATS could not be had. One can imagine such cases (for instance, persons in the US issuing directives that lead to human rights violations), but such cases will be hard to find and harder yet to prove.</p>

<p>But there are deep tensions in the Court's rationale. The Court in this line of cases spanning <em>Morrison</em> and <em>Kiobel</em> is fixated on the physical location of the liability-creating events. We conflicts types recognize this as the old <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/lex_loci">lex loci delicti</a> (place of wrong) rule. Yet there is at least one other line of cases (which the Court pretended not to notice both in <em>Morrison</em> and <em>Kiobel</em>) in which the Court has taken a much broader view of the scope of application of federal law. In 1993 in the case of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8104177412766465037">Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. California</a>, the Supreme Court held that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/chapter-1">Sherman Act</a> applied to London reinsurers alleged to have &#8212; in a meeting held in London &#8212; strong-armed US primary insurers into writing policies less favorable to policyholders. A majority of the Court held that the predictable and substantial effects of the activities were enough to allow application of the US antitrust laws. More recently (2008) and spectacularly, the Court applied a "functional" test in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2483936489630436485">Boumediene v. Bush</a> to hold that the right of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/habeas_corpus">habeas corpus</a> to foreign detainees held at <a href="http://jurist.org/feature/featured/guantanamo/">Guantanamo Bay</a>.</p>

<p>We conflicts types recognize the Court's approach in <em>Hartford</em> and <em>Boumediene</em> as being a species of interest analysis or one of the other modern conflict-of-laws approaches. Yet each time the Court sets its mind to apply a territorial approach (as it did in <em>Kiobel</em> and <em>Morrison</em>) it simply pretends as if the other line of cases does not exist. Essentially the heart of Justice Stephen Breyer's concurrence in the judgment (though not expressed in so many words) is that the ATS ought to be evaluated by one of those more flexible methodologies. The majority simply ignored <em>Hartford</em> and <em>Boumediene</em>, and while Breyer did not cite those cases, he did at least cite to the provisions of the <a href="http://www.ali.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=publications.ppage&node_id=33">Third Restatement of Foreign Relations</a>, upon which <em>Hartford</em> rested. Breyer and the three that joined him thought that there simply were not enough contacts in Kiobel to justify application of the ATS, even under their standard.</p>

<p>Forced to choose, I surely would have signed Breyer's opinion. But the whole debate leaves me cold because, I believe, the Court was asking and attempting to answer the wrong question. The ATS tells the reader what its scope of application is: it applies to cases filed in federal court. Surely nobody contended that the plaintiffs could have filed the case in Nigeria and relied upon the ATS.</p>

<p>But to the extent that the ATS imports relatively universal norms of international law, it imports them precisely because they are universal and lacking in territorial boundaries. Roberts's opinion had relatively little difficulty dealing with two of Blackstone's three categories &#8212; safe conducts and offenses against ambassadors. But, oh that nagging piracy category. Roberts attempted to dispose of that example on the grounds that such offenses occur on the high seas, so interference with other sovereigns was unlikely to occur. But Breyer caught Roberts on this point. The offenses are not committed by pirates swimming around on the ocean; they occur on ships, which &#8212; of course &#8212; fly flags and thus (for some purposes at least) take on the characteristics of sovereign territory.</p>

<p>Oh had Breyer had recognized the full implications of this. Breyer used that insight to argue for his more flexible test, but even that does not really get to the heart of the matter. The concept of universal jurisdiction for, at least, criminal jurisdiction in human rights cases is well known. At first blush it seems to me that the most sensible reading of the ATS (at least as refracted through the lens of <em>Sosa</em>) is that the ATS was meant to provide a federal forum for civil enforcement of universal norms.</p>

<p>Unless Congress steps in to fix the problem, the ATS is now close to a dead letter. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court's effort to return its extraterroriality jurisprudence to the bygone days of "vested rights" is certain to leave huge gaps in the civil enforcement of all sorts of regulatory norms. As Laurel and Hardy would have said in the 1930's (coincidentally the high water mark for the vested rights theory of conflicts), it's another fine mess.</p>

The instruction establishes "DOD policy, assigns responsibilities, and provides procedures for DOD support to Federal, State, tribal, and local civilian law enforcement agencies, including responses to civil disturbances within the United States."</p>

<p>The DOD released <a href="http://info.publicintelligence.net/DoD-CivilianLawEnforcement.pdf">DOD Instruction 3025.21</a> [PDF], "Defense Support of Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies," on February 27, 2013, replacing several older directives on military assistance to civilian law enforcement and civil disturbances. The instruction requires that senior DOD officials develop "procedures and issue appropriate direction as necessary for defense support of civilian law enforcement agencies in coordination with the General Counsel of the Department of Defense, and in consultation with the Attorney General of the United States," including "tasking the DOD Components to plan for and to commit DOD resources in response to requests from civil authorities for [civil disturbance operations]." Military officials are to coordinate with "civilian law enforcement agencies on policies to further DOD cooperation with civilian law enforcement agencies" and the heads of the combatant commands are instructed to issue procedures for "establishing local contact points in subordinate commands for purposes of coordination with Federal, State, tribal, and local civilian law enforcement officials."</p>

<p>These policy changes must be read in light of an evolution, rather than revolution, involving over a century of federal troop deployments and 200-plus years of legal precedent. The <a href="http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/dept/polsciwb/brianl/docs/1807InsurrectionAct.pdf">Insurrection Act of 1807</a> [PDF] was one of the first and most important US laws on this subject, and was followed some 71 years later by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1385">Posse Comitatus Act of 1878</a>, which further limited executive authority to conduct military law enforcement on US soil. Each of those laws has evolved over time &#8212; consistent with the times and the popular will expressed through Congress.</p>

<p>Considering those two acts in chronological order, the Insurrection Act, (codified, as amended, at <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/subtitle-A/part-I/chapter-15">10 USC &#167;331&#8211;335</a>) has changed from its 1807 inception many times, with most notable alterations in the mid-twentieth century. It has consistently exempted federal (and federalized troops) from legal prohibitions on employment and deployment on US soil where troops provide federal aid for state governments (<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/331">&#167;331</a>), are militia and armed forces enforcing federal authority (<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/332">&#167;332</a>), are dealing with interference with state and federal law (<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/333">&#167;333</a>), where there has been a  proclamation to disperse in times of civil disturbance (<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/334">&#167;334</a>), including Guam and the US Virgin Islands (<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/335">&#167;335</a>), and for a brief year, was expanded under the 2007 <a href="http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.uscongress/legislation.109hr5122">John M. Warner Defense Authorization Act</a>, then brought back to longstanding language in the subsequent fiscal year.</p>

<p>The so-called Posse Comitatus Act, passed on June 18, 1878, prohibited federal troops from supervising confederate state elections in the latter portion of the Reconstruction Era. It originally applied only to the US Army, but was amended after the US Air Force was created to include those forces in 1956, then has applied by DOD regulation to include US Navy and US Marine Corps forces as well. The Posse Comitatus Act read then, and reads now, as follows:<blockquote>Whoever, except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress, willfully uses any part of the Army [or the Air Force] as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.</blockquote>The Posse Comitatus Act has prohibited troops under federal authority (that is <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/">Title 10</a> Active Component troops and "federalized" <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/32">Title 32</a> National Guard troops) from generally conducting law enforcement duties on US soil absent congressionally legislated or constitutionally enumerated authority or exception. Several such federal troop use exceptions to the Insurrection Act and Posse Comitatus Act would be troop employment and deployment during a biological, radiological, or nuclear event under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/831">18 USC &#167;831</a>, or intelligence, military equipment, training, advice or facilities usage, amongst other matters, in support of civilian law enforcement under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/subtitle-A/part-I/chapter-18">10 USC &#167;382</a>.</p>

<p>An armed force that is bound neither by the Insurrection Act nor by the Posse Comitatus Act is the US Coast Guard (USCG). Under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/14/1">14 USC &#167;1</a>, "[t]he Coast Guard as established January 28, 1915, shall be a military service and a branch of the armed forces of the United States at all times." Created long after the Posse Comitatus Act and the Insurrection Acts, the USCG is now under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and acts in peacetime as a law enforcement agency that can conduct activities on US soil. The USCG takes on a unique naval force role, however, under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/14/3">14 USC &#167; 3</a>, as amended by section 211 of the <a href="http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.uscongress/legislation.109hr889">Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006</a>, upon declaration of war or when the president directs.</p>

<p>In their substance and spirit, neither the Insurrection Act of 1807 nor the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 provide for the federal government to supersede the ordinary operation of US federal, state or territorial law, nor have either of the two acts ever proscribed federal troop employment and deployment during transitory crises, emergencies and disorders.  Even prior to employment of assets and deployment of forces to assist in the fall 2012 <a href="http://www.defense.gov/home/features/2012/1012_sandy/">Hurricane Sandy</a> relief, or in April 2013 inter-agency support in the aftermath of the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=119782">Boston Marathon</a> bombings, there were many instances and exemptions whereby federal (or federalized) troops were called upon to conduct brief operations other than training on US soil in accordance with an Executive Order or Proclamation under the Insurrection Act or some other exemption to the Posse Comitatus Act. </p>

<p>In 1919, President Woodrow Wilson <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MiVwxsjlxxcC&lpg=PA293&ots=SGdUh0ktO2&pg=PA293#v=onepage&q&f=false">called out</a> federal troops to quell race riots in 20 cities across the US. In 1932, President Herbert Hoover <a href="http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/trm203.html">called upon</a> General Douglas MacArthur, with the aid of his staff officers Majors George Patton and Dwight D. Eisenhower, to send US troops to displace and disperse a group of 20,000 aggrieved WWI veterans (the so-called "Bonus Marchers") encamped on or near the Washington Mall. During 1946, President Harry S. Truman <a href="http://www.trumanlibrary.org/executiveorders/index.php?pid=458&st=&st1=">sent out</a> federal troops against striking railroad workers. The year 1957 saw President Eisenhower <a href="http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?doc=89&page=transcript">federalize</a> Arkansas National Guard troops and send federal troops to Arkansas to counter desegregation violence. In 1962, President John F. Kennedy <a href="http://www.usmarshals.gov/history/miss/02.htm">sent federal troops</a> to Mississippi and Alabama to counter racial violence. President Richard M. Nixon <a href="http://www.usmarshals.gov/history/wounded-knee/index.html">sent federal troops</a> to Wounded Knee, SD in 1973 to counter racial violence. President George H.W. Bush <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=uDx_HbGpWPwC&lpg=PA276&pg=PA276#v=onepage&q&f=false">sent troops</a> to St. Croix, US Virgin Islands, in 1989 ostensibly at the request of the Territorial Governor to quell civil disturbance and provide disaster assistance after Hurricane Hugo, and in 1992 <a href="http://bushlibrary.tamu.edu/research/public_papers.php?id=4252&year=1992&month=5">sent federal troops</a> to Los Angeles to quell civil disturbance after a controversial court decision. Most recently, in 2005, President George W. Bush <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/reports/katrina-lessons-learned/chapter4.html">sent federal troops</a> to the Gulf Coast to quell civil disturbance and provide disaster assistance in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.</p>

<p>When employed or deployed after civil disturbances or natural disasters, federal troops from the DOD would and will receive direction from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in accordance with the <a href="http://www.fema.gov/national-response-framework">National Response Framework</a> (NRF) to work solo or in concert with other federal agencies to provide personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, and managerial, technical, and advisory services. Support scenarios could include: a Presidential Declaration of a Major Disaster; an Order to Perform Emergency Work Essential for the Preservation of Life and Property; and, a Presidential Declaration of an Emergency. </p>

<p>In all but the instance of a Presidential Declaration of Emergency, the governor of an affected state or territory must request assistance regardless of any state or local capacity to render disaster assistance. The NRF allows DHS to coordinate federal agencies that work alongside state and local agencies. In the <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0508/31/lol.01.html">words</a> of past DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff, these scenarios do not "supersede the state and local government," but "fit with the state and local government in a comprehensive response plan."</p>

<p>Past is certain to be prologue when it comes to both causes and effects of natural and man-made disasters, and politicians, academics, government officials, and all others likely to be affected would do well to study the 206-year history of the Insurrection Act and the 135-year-old Posse Comitatus Act as military forces play an ever-essential role in cooperating with civil authorities consistent with law and policy. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.wayne.edu/profile/john.rothchild/">John Rothchild</a> of Wayne State University Law School says the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Kirtsaeng</em> could impact the scope of the patent exhaustion doctrine as well as seller-imposed limitations on ownership of purchased copyrighted items....<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/john_rothchild.jpg" width="120" height="179" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he Supreme Court's <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-rules-copyrighted-works-can-be-sold-secondhand-abroad.php">recent decision</a> in <em>Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &#38; Sons, Inc.</em> definitively settled an important issue that had been haunting copyright law for decades &#8212; whether a copyright holder has the legal right to prevent the owner of an article embodying a copyrighted work from importing that article into the US if it was manufactured outside of the US. </p>

<p>Under the first-sale rule, codified at <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/109">17 USC &#167;109(a)</a>, once a copyright owner disposes of a copy she loses the right to control the further public distribution, including resale, of that copy. In <em>Kirtsaeng</em>, the copyright holder, publisher John Wiley &#38; Sons, argued that its textbooks manufactured abroad were outside the scope of the first-sale rule, on the ground that the rule applies only to items that are "lawfully made under this title" (i.e. <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17">Title 17</a>, the title of the US Code containing the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/copyright.table.html">Copyright Act</a>). Wiley argued that the quoted phrase should be interpreted to mean "lawfully made <em>within the United States</em>." But the Court flatly rejected that proposition: "We hold that the 'first sale' doctrine applies to copies of a copyrighted work lawfully made abroad." As a result, a person who purchases a book or other copyrighted item that is made with the copyright owner's authorization is free to import it into the US or resell it there, regardless of whether it was manufactured domestically or abroad.</p>

<p>So much is clear. What is not obvious on the face of the opinion is its potential impact on two more-or-less remote issues of law: the scope of exhaustion of patent rights, and the authority of a copyright owner to determine through a form of words when a person who has purchased a copyrighted item will be deemed the "owner" of that item for purposes of the first-sale rule.</p>

<p><strong>Patent Exhaustion</strong></p>

<p>Patent law has its own version of the first-sale rule, usually referred to as "exhaustion." That judge-made doctrine states that once an article embodying a patented invention has been sold with the permission of the patent owner, the patent owner loses the statutory right to control use or subsequent resale of the article. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7345126119320576745">Jazz Photo Corp. v. International Trade Commission</a>, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that patent exhaustion does not result from the sale of an article that occurs outside the US. In a <a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/cafc/03-1324/03-1324-2011-03-27.html">subsequent decision</a> it explained the basis for this holding: a foreign sale "can never occur under a United States patent because the United States patent system does not provide for extraterritorial effect."</p>

<p>The Court's decision in <em>Kirtsaeng</em> thoroughly undermines the rationale for this limitation of the patent exhaustion doctrine. Wiley argued that the first-sale rule's limitation to copies "lawfully made under this title" must exclude copies made outside the US because the Copyright Act does not apply extraterritorially. This rationale had been accepted in several lower-court decisions that found no copyright exhaustion from sales occurring outside the US. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's dissent in <em>Kirtsaeng</em> (joined by Justices Anthony Kennedy and Antonin Scalia) likewise relied on the extraterritoriality rationale: "The Copyright Act, it has been observed time and again, does not apply extraterritorially[.] The textbooks thus were not 'lawfully made under [Title 17],' the crucial precondition for application of &#167;109(a)." But the Court rejected the notion that predicating copyright exhaustion on a sale that occurs outside the US constitutes an extraterritorial application of the Copyright Act. It quoted with approval the <a href="http://www.lexisnexis.com/store/catalog/booktemplate/productdetail.jsp?pageName=relatedProducts&prodId=10441">Nimmer treatise</a>'s observation: "the principle that 'copyright laws do not have any extraterritorial operation' 'requires some qualification[.]'" Nimmer goes on to illustrate one such "qualification":  "[A] distinction should be drawn between purely extraterritorial conduct, which is itself nonactionable, and conduct that crosses borders, so that at least a part of the offense takes place within the United States[.] U.S. courts may entertain such multiterritorial infringement claims."</p>

<p>Thus, the Court in <em>Kirtsaeng</em> adopted a narrower view of what constitutes "extraterritorial" application of a US law than did the lower courts that found no exhaustion of copyright rights resulting from sale of a foreign-made article. Specifically, the Court rejected the notion that a court may not <em>take account</em> of conduct occurring outside the US in assessing whether conduct occurring in the US violates a US law. Applied in the context of patent exhaustion, this holding contradicts the Federal Circuit's view that it would be a forbidden extraterritorial application of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35">Patent Act</a> to find that a US patent is exhausted by a sale of the patented article outside the US. If it is not an extraterritorial application of law to hold that a copyright is exhausted from first sale of a copyrighted article <em>manufactured</em> abroad, neither is it an extraterritorial application to hold that a patent is exhausted when a patented article is <em>sold</em> abroad. And if international exhaustion is not an extraterritorial application of the patent law, then the rationale for refusing to find exhaustion from a sale abroad falls away.</p>

<p><strong>Controlling Application of the First-Sale Rule Through Use Restrictions</strong></p>

<p>The Court's decision in <em>Kirtsaeng</em> may also have an impact on another fiercely debated issue relating to copyright's first-sale rule. Under &#167;109(a), only "the <em>owner</em> of a particular copy" (emphasis added) is entitled to the benefits of the first-sale; one who merely (albeit lawfully) <em>possesses</em> a copy, such as through a lease or bailment, remains fully subject to the copyright owner's right to control public distribution of the copy. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10742056384168408518">Vernor v. Autodesk, Inc.</a>, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit adopted the view that a copyright owner can prevent one who purchases a copy of copyrighted software from being deemed the "owner" of that copy for purposes of the first-sale rule by reciting limitations on the purchaser's right to use that copy: "We hold today that a software user is a licensee rather than an owner of a copy where the copyright owner (1) specifies that the user is granted a license; (2) significantly restricts the user's ability to transfer the software; and (3) imposes notable use restrictions."</p>

<p>In <em>Kirtsaeng</em>, the publisher tried just this maneuver in an effort to prevent application of the first-sale rule to textbooks that it sold outside the US. The books displayed a legend stating:<blockquote>This book is authorized for sale in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East only and may be not exported out of these territories. Exportation from or importation of this book to another region without the Publisher's authorization is illegal and is a violation of the Publisher's rights.</blockquote>This restriction would seem to meet <em>Vernor</em>'s second and third criteria, and the addition of a statement that "This book is licensed not sold" would not seem to add any meaningful additional restriction. Yet the Court did not find that this use restriction prevented the book purchaser from becoming an "owner" of the copy for purposes of the first-sale rule.</p>

<p>It is true that the issue of whether the textbook purchaser was "owner" of the books was not an issue in the case, and therefore the decision's impact on <em>Vernor</em> and similar cases is only suggestive. Nevertheless, the <em>Kirtsaeng</em> decision provides an additional avenue of argument for rejecting the view that a copyright owner can prevent operation of the first-sale rule, thereby obtaining perpetual control over resale of copies that by all commonsense standards it has sold, merely by reciting restrictions on the use of the copy.</p>

Since New Zealand has no upper house or senate, no further vote was necessary. The royal assent, the final step in the process, was given on April 19.

The 1986 and 2004 reforms were accompanied by passionate campaigns on both sides of the issue, and featured some very militant statements. In 1993, sexual orientation was <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0082/latest/DLM304475.html">added</a> to the grounds of unlawful discrimination and in 2001, the law relating to property division on separation and inheritance laws were <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1976/0166/latest/DLM441113.html">amended</a> to include "de facto relationships," the statutory phrase for unmarried cohabitation. "De facto relationships" include same-sex relationships. Interestingly, the 1993 and 2001 changes attracted comparatively little animosity. Same-sex marriage, or "marriage equality," as proponents call it, is the culmination of this process. </p>

<p>Quite remarkably, and in contrast to the heated debate in <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/france-parliament-gives-final-approval-to-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">France</a>, the law was enacted with very little vigorous protest. The most vocal opposition tended to come from churches and fringe groups outside Parliament: inside Parliament, most of the politicians opposed to the new law spoke against it moderately. Several argued that they supported civil unions and it was therefore unnecessary to change marriage: this only a few years after staunch opposition by many to the civil union legislation. One political party tried unsuccessfully to have the law conditioned upon a referendum.</p>

<p>The Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill was introduced to Parliament on July 26, 2012. It was sponsored by Louisa Wall, an opposition Labour Party Member of Parliament, who is openly lesbian and an indigenous Maori. While it was not a government measure, it had the support of the Prime Minister [John Key] and many members of his National Party. The size of the vote in support of the bill was surprising, but reflects the changing attitudes in New Zealand reflected in many other countries, including the US and the UK, where the Conservative Prime Minister is promoting a <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/uk-parliament-approves-same-sex-marriage.php">change</a> in the marriage law. </p>

<p>The bill inserts into the <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1955/0092/latest/DLM292028.html?search=ts_act_marriage_resel_25_a&p=1">Marriage Act 1955</a> a new definition of "marriage," which now means "the union of two people, regardless of their sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity." Previously, there was no statutory definition at all, but the Court of Appeal had earlier <a href="http://www.equalrightstrust.org/ertdocumentbank/Quilter%20v.pdf">confirmed</a> that, according to the law as it then existed, marriage involved a man and a woman. That decision is now reversed. Notably, the new definition takes account not just of gay and lesbian persons, but also of transgender people. Until now, it has been necessary for a married person who has a sex change to have the marriage dissolved because it would have become "same-sex." Under the new law, this is no longer necessary. Along with the new definition of marriage, the "prohibited degrees of marriage," listed in schedule two of the Marriage Act, have been changed to be gender-neutral. For example, references to "grandfather" and "grandmother" are replaced with "grandparent."</p>

<p>Following standard legislative practice, the bill was sent to a parliamentary "select committee," so that the public could make submissions. The <a href="http://www.parliament.nz/NR/rdonlyres/3955C9B8-9FCF-4EF8-B39B-6B4BE630B0D7/264032/DBSCH_SCR_5764_MarriageDefinitionofMarriageAmendme.pdf">committee</a> [PDF] received 21,533 written submissions, a very large number for a country of 4.5 million. However, 18,635 of these were more or less the same in form, either for or against, leaving 2,898 of "unique content." Many members of the public were given the opportunity to make their submission orally before the committee.</p>

<p>Apart from same-sex marriage, two issues in particular encouraged the committee to act. The New Zealand <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1955/0093/latest/DLM292661.html">Adoption Act of 1955</a> is widely recognized as being antiquated and in need of wholesale reform. Married couples and single persons can adopt. A recent High Court <a href="http://www.nzlii.org/cgi-bin/sinodisp/nz/cases/NZHC/2010/977.html">judgment</a> held that heterosexual de facto couples can be included in the phrase "two spouses jointly" but cast doubt on whether it could extend to homosexual de facto couples and civil union couples. Some comments indicated uneasiness about allowing same-sex couples to adopt, but the committee took a different view, noting that many same-sex couples have children and should be able to apply for adoption. This may be desirable, for example, to take account of the part played by a new partner or to regularize parentage following some form of assisted human reproduction. Among other points, the committee thought it absurd that a gay person can adopt alone, even if in a relationship, but a couple cannot do so. The committee added some terminological changes to the Adoption Act to make it clearer that a married couple, irrespective of sexuality, can adopt. The law nevertheless remains highly anomalous because of the uncertainty about civil union and same-sex <em>de facto</em> couples.</p>

<p>The other issue was more fraught: can a marriage celebrant opposed to same-sex marriage refuse as a matter of conscience to officiate at such a wedding? For most, this represents an appeal to freedom of religion. A clash of principles therefore arises: freedom from discrimination versus religious rights. </p>

<p>According to section 29 of the Marriage Act, a marriage license obtained by the parties planning to get married "shall authorise but not oblige any marriage celebrant to solemnize the marriage to which it relates." Taken literally, this allows a marriage celebrant to refuse to officiate a wedding between two individuals of the same sex. However, legal opinion was divided over whether the section is subject to limitations. The New Zealand <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1990/0109/latest/DLM224792.html">Bill of Rights Act 1990</a>, which includes rights relating to non-discrimination and freedom of religion, requires legislation to be interpreted whenever possible consistently with its provisions. No one would accept that section 29 allows a celebrant to discriminate on grounds of race: can the same not be said where a person discriminates on grounds of sexual orientation?</p>

<p>General agreement existed in the committee that people should not be forced to act against their conscience: "It is our intention that the passage of this bill should not impact negatively upon people's religious freedoms." So, the committee added a new subsection to section 29. To explain this, we must note three kinds of celebrant: (1) those belonging to one of the ten religions listed in the First Schedule to the Marriage Act, which are mainstream Christian churches and Jewish congregations; (2) those belonging to "approved organisations," approved by the Registrar-General of Marriages, of which approximately 1,000 exist, mostly but not all religious groups of some sort not covered under (1); and (3) individuals who apply independently to the Registrar-General for approval as celebrants. </p>

<p>The new subsection applies only to the first two categories and not the third. Importantly, it spells out that no obligation to officiate exists if this "would contravene the religious beliefs of the religious body or the religious beliefs or philosophical or humanitarian convictions of the approved organisation." The wording is significant: the exemption applies not to the individual's own beliefs or convictions but to those of the church or other body. Where does this leave the clergyperson whose church supports same-sex marriage but who disagrees with that church's position? The answer is unclear, but that person may end up in contravention of the discrimination laws. What of the clergyperson who belongs to a conservative church but who holds a liberal view on marriage? The Marriage Act does not prevent that person from officiating, but the church concerned may want to take some form of disciplinary action. Will such action contravene the discrimination laws? Another point of uncertainty.</p>

<p>The new subsection does not apply to "independent" celebrants. <em>Prima facie</em>, they cannot invoke their own consciences or convictions. This is arguably the correct result: they do not purport to represent an organisation with certain beliefs, but they do (usually) hold themselves out as offering their services to the public. They ought thus to abide by the law and not discriminate on grounds of sexual orientation.</p>

<p>The question marks over celebrants may prove to be more theoretical than real. Putting them to one side, the law change is a landmark for New Zealand's family law.</p>

		<title>Release the Cleared Guantanamo Detainees to End the Hunger Strike</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/people/visiting-faculty/david-jr-frakt">David Frakt</a> of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law says that the Obama administration should release those detainees held at Guantanamo Bay who have already been declared to not be a danger to the US...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/DavidFraktMDU.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>ne of the most vexing problems currently facing the administration of US President Barack Obama is its inability to release 85 detainees from <a href="/feature/featured/guantanamo/">Guantanamo Bay</a> who were <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/most-detainees-at-guantanamo-low-level-combatants-report.php">cleared for release</a> by the Guantanamo Review Task Force (GRTF) more than three years ago. Many of these detainees are now engaged in a <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/more-than-half-of-guantanamo-detainees-now-on-hunger-strike.php">hunger strike</a>, at least in part, to protest their continued, indefinite detention. Although cleared for release, politically motivated restrictions in the <a href="http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.uscongress/legislation.112hr4310">National Defense Authorization Act</a> have made it virtually impossible for the administration to transfer these detainees out of Guantanamo absent a court order, such as a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> from the US District Court for the District of Columbia. Unfortunately, the sole focus of the <em>habeas</em> review currently is on the legality of detention at the time of capture. If the US can establish that the detainee was lawfully detainable at that moment (and the standard of review created by the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/us-federal-appeals-court-overturns-guantanamo-habeas-grant.php">Al-Adahi v. Obama</a> makes this an easy burden for the government to meet) then the lawfulness of continued detention until the cessation of hostilities is conclusively presumed. Because the US loathes to admit that it has made a mistake and detained someone for many years without a legal basis, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) is in the awkward position of opposing <em>habeas corpus</em> petitions even when the GRTF has determined continued detention of the petitioner is unwarranted because he no longer poses a danger to the US. In fact, the DOJ has successfully blocked the release of eight detainees off the cleared list by opposing their <em>habeas corpus</em> petitions, including three cases where the detainee won the writ at the trial level and the Department of Justice won a reversal on appeal. One of those who won his petition only to have it reversed on appeal was Adnan Latif, whose resulting desperation drove him to <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/guantanamo-detainee-dies-after-being-found-unconscious-in-cell.php">commit suicide</a>. In fact, no detainee has prevailed in a <em>habeas corpus</em> petition in three years. </p>

<p>I have a proposed solution to this problem.</p>

<p>I represented former detainee <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/us-military-lawyers-petition-afghan.php">Mohammed Jawad</a> (along with the ACLU) in his <em>habeas corpus</em> petition in 2009. After the district court judge ruled that most of the government's evidence was <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/federal-court-suppresses-detainee.php">inadmissible</a>, the DOJ <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/pdfs/safefree/alhalmandyvobama_govtfiling.pdf">filed a notice</a> indicating that they were no longer treating Mohammed as detainable under the <a href="http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.uscongress/legislation.107sjres23">Authorization for Use of Military Force</a> (AUMF) and would no longer oppose his <em>habeas corpus</em> petition. The government did not admit that Mohammed had been unlawfully detained. One month later, including a 15-day waiting period after notice of the transfer was provided to Congress, Jawad was <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/guantanamo-detainee-jawad-repatriated.php">home in Afghanistan</a>. This proves that when the Obama administration really wants to transfer a detainee, they are quite capable of doing so. There is nothing to stop the DOJ from filing similar notices for the cleared detainees indicating that the government no longer considers them detainable and does not oppose their petitions for <em>habeas corpus</em>. If any explanation is required, the DOJ can inform the court that the government has revised its view of the propriety of indefinite detention of non-dangerous detainees under the laws of war, and now considers it to be inconsistent with the law of war to hold detainees indefinitely when the justification for their original detention no longer exists.</p>

<p>Critics might suggest that this is simply a gimmick to circumvent the will of Congress to block the transfer of detainees from Guantanamo. In my view, this change of position would actually represent a correct application of the law of war. Although it has become conventional wisdom that the US has the power under the international law of armed conflict to detain enemy combatants at Guantanamo until the "cessation of hostilities," the basis for this belief is very flimsy. It is certainly true that a nation state may hold prisoners of war until the cessation of hostilities in an international armed conflict. This is clearly spelled out in <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/geneva03.asp">Geneva Convention III</a>, on the Treatment of Prisoners of War. But the detainees at Guantanamo are not and have never been treated as prisoners of war and the Supreme Court has <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/breaking-news-supreme-court-rules.php">determined</a> that we are in a non-international armed conflict. Nevertheless, the US, without any clear legal authority, has asserted that it has the identical power to detain enemy combatants as if they were prisoners of war (POWs). The justification for detaining POWs until the cessation of hostilities is obviously to prevent repatriated POWs from returning to the battlefield. The same justification has been advanced to explain why the US is entitled to hold detainees until the cessation of hostilities.</p>

<p>However, this argument ignores one crucial distinction between POWs and the detainees at Guantanamo: POWs are members of the uniformed armed forces of the opposing state, while Guantanamo detainees are not. A released POW repatriated to his home country during an ongoing armed conflict would not only have the legal right to return to the battlefield, but in most cases, as a member of the armed forces, would be legally obligated to do so under domestic law. Thus, it is fair for a state to presume that repatriating POWs would undermine its ongoing effort to defeat the enemy. Guantanamo detainees, on the other hand, have been declared as a class to be unlawful combatants, with no legal right to engage in hostilities. They are not members of the armed forces of a state, but are civilians who allegedly engaged in hostilities for a brief period many years ago. Absent specific evidence of an individual detainee's intent or likelihood to re-engage in hostilities if released, there is no basis for presuming that he would. Under the law of war, civilians who directly participate in hostilities may be targeted or captured and detained in self-defense, but it is not clear under the law of war why a state should have the right to continue to detain individuals when the original rationale for the detention no longer applies. </p>

<p>A possible objection to this plan is that it would be inconsistent with Section 1021 of the <a href="http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.uscongress/legislation.112hr1540">National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012</a>, which reaffirmed the president's authority to indefinitely detain enemy combatants. However, a close reading of this provision suggests that it would not prevent the DOJ from amending its position with respect to cleared detainees.  Section 1021 requires the president to dispose of detainees under the law of war. While Congress has declared that one of the lawful options for disposition under the law of war is indefinite detention until the end of hostilities, the act states that is it is not the only option and that the act does not "limit the authority of the President." Review of the legality of detention by federal courts pursuant to a <em>habeas corpus</em> petition is a form of disposition under the law of war and Congress cannot prevent the DOJ's views on the law of war from evolving. Indeed, there is support for such a change of position in recent Supreme Court precedent. In the Supreme Court's 2004 decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?&case=6173897153146757813&scilh=0">Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</a>, the plurality opinion stated: "[W]e understand Congress' grant of authority for the use of 'necessary and appropriate force' to include the authority to detain for the duration of the relevant conflict, and our understanding is based on longstanding law-of-war principles." However, the opinion included the following caveat: "If the practical circumstances of a given conflict are entirely unlike those of the conflicts that informed the development of the law of war, that understanding may unravel." We are now at or beyond the unraveling stage. </p>

<p>There is no precedent in modern military history for detaining individuals determined to pose no threat to the detaining power for years on end, during which time the nature and circumstances of the conflict have changed so dramatically that it bears little resemblance to the armed conflict in which they originally took part. Both the Bush and Obama administrations have repeatedly stated that we are in a new kind of war in which new rules are needed. The law of war is designed to reduce unnecessary human suffering and facilitate the restoration of peace. Many of the detainees on the cleared list have now been held for well over a decade and some have been cleared for release multiple times by multiple administrations. Indefinite detention of those determined no longer to pose a threat to the detaining power is inconsistent with these purposes of the law of war. Regardless of whether one supports the president's goal of closing Guantanamo, all should be able to agree that it is intolerable for a civilized nation to detain scores of men for purely political reasons. The president should direct the attorney general to immediately inform the DC Circuit that the Department of Justice no longer considers the detainees on the cleared list to be detainable. The hunger strike will end when cleared detainees start going home.</p>

		<title>Arms Trade Treaty Shows Remarkable Progress</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Clare da Silva of <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> argues that the new Arms Trade Treaty shows remarkable progress in the international regulation of arms transactions...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n April 2, 2013, the United Nations General Assembly voted overwhelmingly in favor of a <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2013/04/un-general-assembly-approves-global-arms-trade-treaty.php">global treaty</a> that applies international legal standards to govern transfers of conventional weapons across borders. Of 193 member states, only three voted to reject the treaty: North Korea, Syria, and Iran.</p>

                <p>Despite the huge margin, the adoption of an Arms Trade Treaty to regulate the international trade in conventional arms was far from a given. It took a series of shocking crises&#8212;including the wars in the Persian Gulf and in the former Yugoslavia, the 1994 Rwanda genocide, and conflicts in Africa's Great Lakes region, West Africa, Afghanistan, and in Central America&#8212;before the international community could no longer ignore the repercussions of untrammeled and irresponsible arms transfers, and began to move forward with attempts to control the global trade in conventional weapons.  </p>

                <p>Interested governments and nongovernmental organizations including Amnesty International worked for more than twenty years, seven of them under the aegis of the UN, to reach this historic climax. The goal was winning near-universal support for a treaty with the potential to save countless lives and revolutionize the 70 billion USD global trade in conventional weapons.</p>

                <p>Understanding this watershed moment and what the treaty itself means requires a closer look at both the United Nations process and the substance of the treaty itself.  </p>

                <p>The process at the United Nations began in the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/first/">UN's First Committee</a>, rather than in the largely dysfunctional <a href="http://www.unog.ch/cd">Conference on Disarmament</a>. In 2006, seven co-authoring states, (Finland, Japan, Kenya, Argentina, Costa Rica, United Kingdom, Australia) kick-started the process by introducing a draft resolution that 153 states voted to adopt; 24 countries abstained, but only the US, under the Bush Administration, voted against the measure.</p>

                <p>Fast-forward seven years, and it is clearly apparent that the General Assembly vote to adopt the final Arms Trade Treaty text largely reflected the same voting pattern: 155 states in favor, 23 abstentions, and 3 opposed. Clearly, those states that were committed at the beginning of the process to achieve a treaty on regulating the trade in conventional weapons remained so. The US reversed its position after the inauguration of President Barack Obama in January 2009. In the final vote on the treaty in April 2013, the US not only voted yes but also co-authored the resolution that brought the final treaty text to a vote in the General Assembly.</p>

                <p>Another important procedural point is that the Arms Trade Treaty remained on the agenda of the General Assembly from the outset. Two conferences on the Arms Trade Treaty (July 2012 and March 2013) made it clear that the aim was to negotiate a treaty that would be accepted by consensus; but as the General Assembly remained seized of the issue throughout, it was always a possibility that a State or group of States could request a vote on a treaty text by Member States. And so in the end, the text adopted by the General Assembly was the same that would have been adopted unanimously by the negotiating conference but for the opposition of Syria, North Korea and Iran.</p>

                <p>Negotiating on the basis of consensus ensured that a number of key exporters and importers of conventional arms participated actively in engineering the substance of the treaty's text. Keeping these key states engaged in the process was fundamental to finalizing a text that would have credibility and increase the probability that it would be widely ratified by parliaments and governments.</p>

                <p>Treaties negotiated by all the countries of the world are always going to be complex and subject to often tedious processes of compromises and arm-twisting. The Arms Trade Treaty's negotiating process was no different and the final text is far from perfect.</p>

                <p>But despite the compromises and what might be seen as shortcomings, the treaty itself is nothing short of remarkable.  </p>

                <p>This is significant because it is the first multilateral treaty in which states have agreed to be bound by international legal principles to regulate a variety of activities related to the international trade in conventional arms&#8212;including exports, imports, brokering, and transit shipments. International human rights and humanitarian law are at the top of the list of such criteria&#8212;something unthinkable even half a decade ago.</p>

                <p><a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/legal-fact-sheet/arms-trade-treaty-summary.htm">Article 6</a> of the treaty provides a clear standard for those instances when a transfer of conventional arms is absolutely prohibited. This article reflects existing international law by including prohibitions in cases when an international arms embargo is in place and where a transfer would violate a state's obligations under international agreements to which it is a party.  But, importantly, it also extends existing international law by establishing an absolute prohibition of the transfer of conventional arms if a state party "has knowledge at the time of authorization that the arms or items would be used in the commission of genocide, crimes against humanity, grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949, attacks directed against civilian objects or civilians protected as such, or other war crimes as defined by international agreements to which it is a Party."</p>

                <p>Article 7 requires a state party to conduct a rigorous risk assessment to determine whether a proposed export of conventional arms could be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of international humanitarian law or international human rights law, as well as acts of terrorism or transnational organized crime. Where there is an "overriding risk" of any of these outcomes, a state party shall not authorize the export. State parties are also required to take into account the possible risk of the conventional arms being used to commit or facilitate serious acts of gender-based violence or serious acts of violence against women and children.</p>

                <p>The treaty's definition of "conventional arms" is outlined in Article 2. This definition encompasses the major categories of conventional arms from the United Nations Register on Conventional Arms as well as small arms and light weapons. The inclusion of small arms and light weapons was something that the Peoples Republic of China and a number of other states resisted for many years; it was a significant victory to have them included in the array of arms whose trade is to be regulated. Although the categories of arms are extremely limited, the reality is that any state implementing the treaty in good faith will apply its obligations under the Arms Trade Treaty - especially under Articles 6 and 7 - to all items on their export control lists, which in practice is much more comprehensive that the categories of the Register.</p>

                <p>The treaty sets out basic obligations on states parties to regulate their imports, the brokering activities within their jurisdiction, and the transit and transhipment of conventional weapons. Many of these obligations are ambiguous and left to governments to implement "as appropriate". But since the treaty can be amended and has many strong rules, it provides a firm foundation on which to construct an international system to curb the flow of arms to those persons who would commit atrocities, both in war and in peacetime. And because it builds upon and complements the existing obligations states have accepted under international law, it will become a fundamental part of the legitimate trade in conventional weapons and munitions in years to come.</p>

                <p>The Arms Trade Treaty will be opened for signatures and ratification on June 3, 2013, at the United Nations General Assembly, and will enter into force shortly after it has been ratified by 50 states.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Shubin Nikita, <a href="http://rggu.com/">Russian State University for the Humanities, Law Faculty</a>, explores a new amendment to Russian law affecting non-commercial organizations...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="Nikita.jpg" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Nikita.jpg" width="143" height="215" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n November 21, 2012, Federal Law 121-FL came into force in Russia. This law works to amend various legislative acts, such as those regarding public associations, non-profit organizations and the laundering of crime proceeds to finance terrorism. They also amend the <a href="http://www.russian-offences-code.com/">Code of Administrative Offences</a> and the <a href="http://www.russian-criminal-code.com/">Criminal Code</a>.</p>

<p>This need for various amendments came about with the act's creation of the concept of a "non-commercial organization (NCO) carrying functions of a foreign agent." This is elusively defined by the act as an NCO that both carries out political activities and receives foreign funding. The funding can be in the form of money or other property, and may be received from foreign countries, state agencies, international and foreign organizations &#8212; among others.</p>

<p>Many experts view the broad definition and interpretation of "political activities" by government authorities as a big disadvantage to NCOs. An NCO is <a href="http://www.icnl.org/research/monitor/russia.html">deemed to be carrying out political activities</a> if "it participates (including through financing) in organizing and implementing political actions aimed at influencing the decision-making by state bodies intended for the change of state policy pursued by them, as well as in the shaping of public opinion for the aforementioned purposes." The actual goals and intentions of the organization are not considered when determining if the NCO is carrying out political activities, nor is the determination of whether or not the NCO is conducting activities to the benefit of the foreign funding source. </p>

<p>These considerations make it possible for virtually any organization that is working to change public policy or focusing on implementing and executing state and constitutional guarantees to be deemed as taking part in "political activities". </p>

<p>Alexei Kudrin, a member of the Committee of Civil Initiatives, which was formed in 2012, <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2012/12/04/russias-kudrin-warns-of-crisis-of-confidence/">stated</a> that the Russian government must give its civilians a clear strategy of, among other things, the social development in the country. This is truly necessary, because under Federal Law 121-FL, almost any attempt to participate in the development of public-political practice or even an organization's formation of public opinion on a public issue may be considered "political activity."</p>

<p>NCOs labeled as "carrying functions of a foreign agent" must report to the Russian government any and all cash and/or property received by a foreign source. Furthermore, any foreign entity wishing to make a tax-exempt grant to a Russian NCO must be on the list of approved entities, before they can provide such a donation.</p>

<p>In addition to extensive regulations placed upon these particular NCOs, the organizations are also subject to annual government inspections. Additionally, the law provides for a list of circumstances by which the government can conduct more frequent inspections. The Commissioner is also obligated to submit a report on the activities of the NCO carrying functions of a foreign agent, including information about the organization's involvement in political activities, expenditure of funds and other observations noted during inspections.</p>

<p>Any NCO carrying functions of a foreign agent is subject to potentially harsh penalties for failing to provide information, or for providing information that is considered incomplete or distorted to the Russian government. Penalties may be in the form of a monetary fine or, in the case of a "willful evasion" of duties, criminal charges may be applied. Violations may also lead to suspension of the NCO's activities for up to 6 months.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Article 61 of the <a href="http://www.russian-civil-code.com/">Civil Code of the Russian Federation</a>, as well as Part 10 of Article 32 of the Federal Law. On NCOs give judicial authorities the right to apply to the court for the liquidation of a NCO found to have violated the law.</p>

<p>It should be noted that when the bill was sent for evaluation to the Supreme Court, concerns were voiced about aspects of the legislation. One concern was that the absence of a statutory definition of "malice" might cause difficulties in objectively enforcing the act. It was also noted that the act might cause a degree of social danger. However, despite these various concerns, the act was ultimately passed.</p>

<p>Recently, the Russian Ministry of Justice has <a href="http://rt.com/politics/golos-russia-elections-foreign-agents-609/">accused</a> the GOLOS Association of failing to register as a "foreign agent." Although the ministry has requested the closure and suspension of various NCOs since the act's passage, this case represents the first potential litigation for the ministry regarding the act.</p>

<p>The law has been enacted in different ways throughout the country, and has mostly received a negative assessment.<br />
The head of the Moscow-Helsinki Group, Ludmilla Alexeeva, has referred to the act as "sneaky". She intends to pursue placing its authors on a <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/russia-response-magnitsky-list/24956553.html">"Magnitsky list"</a>. The Presidential Council on Human Rights also called upon the State Duma to withdraw the bill and officially put it up for public discussion, "to avoid rooting unconstitutional policies and practices." </p>

<p>In turn, political analyst Sergei Markov, a member of the Public Chamber said that if political leaders of foreign countries decided to instigate "orange" revolutions in Russia, these NCOs would play a key role. He said the bill's goal is to protect the sovereignty and integrity of Russia. However, the Public Chamber itself has also refused to support the bill in its current form. In conclusion, the experts said that the term "foreign agent" is perceived negatively and seems to refer to "a spy."</p>

<p>Some proponents of this legislation have tried to draw similarities between the act and the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/219">US Foreign Agents Registration Act</a>. In essence, however, it is significantly easier to note the differences between the two pieces of legislation than it is to find their common ground. </p>

                <p><strong>Background</strong>	</p>

                <p>This case arose from <a href="http://mediacenter.motorola.com/Content/Detail.aspx?ReleaseID=13577&NewsAreaID=305&ClientID=1">Motorola's</a> suit against Apple for direct and indirect infringement of method and apparatus claims of wireless communication systems technology. These included US Patent Nos. 6,272,333, 6,246,697, 5,636,223, 6,246,862, 5,359,317 and 7,751,826. Motorola accused the full panoply of Apple's product lines, including mobile phones, tablets, personal computing devices and other computer products. <br />
                    Among Apple's affirmative defenses was unenforceability through unclean hands. The gravamen of Apple's unclean hands defense was the contention that Motorola failed to timely disclose one of the asserted patents to a European Standard Setting Organization (SSO), thereby inducing it to adopt a standard that practiced the Motorola patents. See, e.g., <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10573148131108100751">Hynix Semiconductor, Inc. v. Rambus, Inc.</a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11310044230697690017">Qualcomm Inc. v. Broadcom Corp.</a>.</p>

                <p>Apple also pleaded purely RAND-related affirmative defenses in its <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/104259546/Apple-vs-Motorola-M-answers-to-A-s-amended-complaint-docket-75">answer</a> to the complaint. The typical RAND (reasonable and non-discriminatory) defenses arise under the doctrines of contract, equitable estoppel, implied/actual license and waiver. Apple's answer intermingled the substance of these theories in the same individually designated affirmative defense.</p>

                <p>For whatever tactical reason, Apple withdrew its purely RAND-based defenses during the case, memorializing that decision in a letter to counsel. It also withdrew its proposed expert on the issue of whether or not Motorola had made a RAND offer. The Office of Unfair Import Investigations (the Staff) withdrew from participation in the case specifically because the RAND-based defenses had been dropped.</p>

                <p>Apple did, however, file RAND counterclaims against Apple late in the case. In the ITC, counterclaims are not tried with the case. Rather, under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/19/1337">19 U.S.C. &#167; 1337(c)</a>, the respondent filing them must simultaneously remove the counterclaims to a US District Court for adjudication. Apple removed its RAND counterclaims to the Western District of Wisconsin. </p>

                <p><strong>First Initial Determination</strong>   </p>

                <p>Motorola terminated the investigation in part by withdrawing the '317 and '826 patents.</p>

                <p>In his Initial Determination (ID), Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) David P. Shaw rejected Apple's unclean-hands defense. He found a violation of Section 337 as to the '697 patent and recommended an exclusion order for Apple's products, including its iconic iPhones and iPads. He found no violation as to the '223, '333 and '862 patents.</p>

                <p>The Commission <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-06-29/pdf/2012-15916.pdf">voted</a> [PDF] to review the ALJ's ID. Several of the issues under review were typical: claim construction, validity, infringement and domestic industry. In addition, however, the Commission called for the parties to the investigation to brief certain RAND-related issues. It also invited comments on these issues from interested government agencies, the Staff and any other interested parties. </p>

                <p>The Commission requested briefing on the theories in law, equity and public interest (<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/19/1337">19 U.S.C. § 337(d)(1)</a>) that might preclude issuance of an exclusion order under various factual scenarios. These permutations <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-06-29/pdf/2012-15916.pdf">included</a> [PDF]: where the record lacks evidence to support a RAND-based affirmative defense (e.g., equitable estoppel, implied license, waiver, etc.); whether the mere existence of a RAND obligation precludes issuance of an exclusion order; where a patent owner refused to offer a license to a named respondent in a Section 337 proceeding; where a patent owner has refused to offer a license on a RAND-obligated patent to some other entity, regardless of whether that entity is a named respondent in a Section 337 proceeding; where a patent owner has refused to negotiate a license on RAND terms with a named respondent; where a patent owner has refused to negotiate a license on RAND terms with some other entity, regardless of whether that entity is a named respondent; and where a patent owner who has offered a RAND license that the named respondent in a proceeding has rejected. The Commission also asked the parties to address whether Apple waived its RAND defenses.</p>

                <p><strong>Public Interest Submissions and Arguments</strong></p>

                <p>Under 19 U.S.C. &#167; 1337, there is an exception for Section 337 remedies where the ITC, after considering the public health and welfare, competitive conditions in the US economy, the production of like or directly competitive articles in the US, and US. consumers, finds that infringing articles should not be excluded. These are often referred to as the "public interest factors." The ITC seeks input on public interest factor considerations before a case is instituted and after the ALJ issues the ID.</p>

                <p>The Staff raised three arguments in response to the Commission's invitation for public interest submissions. First, it opined that Apple waived its RAND defenses. Second, it stated that the mere existence of a RAND obligation does not preclude relief at the ITC. To hold otherwise would undermine the ITC's ability to protect domestic industries from unfair acts by foreign importers. Third, the Staff noted that whether a particular RAND commitment, or breach thereof, bars relief in any particular ITC case will depend on the facts and circumstances in the case, including the products and industries.</p>

                <p>The response to the Commission's invitation for comments was substantial, generating the greatest interest in an ITC case over the past five years. <a href="http://info.usitc.gov/ouii/public/337inv.nsf/34ee115c5a9962e28525656a00601452/71c1de618b2a12d085257022004ce314?OpenDocument">Certain Baseband Processor Chips and Chipsets</a>, Inv. No. 337-TA-543 generated such a high degree of interest that the ITC held a public Commission hearing, the first in a Section 337 case in recent history. Several major companies weighed in. Some, including Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft and Verizon, were against the availability of an exclusion order in virtually any RAND scenario, arguing that it is against the public interest. Other comments from Ericsson, Nokia, RIM, Samsung and others were more nuanced; they argued that the availability of an exclusion order should depend on the facts and circumstances of the RAND obligations and facts of the case. One company, Qualcomm, opined that exclusion orders generally should be available. Three trade associations &#8212; the Association for Competitive Technology, Business Software Alliance and Retail Industry Leaders Association &#8212; voiced their opinions that exclusion orders should generally not be available. Conversely, Innovation Alliance said that they should.</p>

                <p>Commentary was not restricted to those with commercial interests. The <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a> was against the availability of exclusion orders where there was a RAND obligation except in extreme and unusual cases, positing that otherwise there would be a significant risk of patent hold-up types of anticompetitive behavior by the patentee. 19 Economics and Law Professors signed a letter largely against the availability of an exclusion order. Moreover, six US Senators &#8212; Conryn, Hoever, Kohl, Lee and Risch &#8212; also spoke out essentially against the relief afforded by an exclusion order where there were RAND commitments. </p>

                <p>The parties adopted predictably parochial positions. Apple asserted that it had not waived its RAND arguments because there is a substantive difference between an affirmative defense during the case before the ALJ, and a public interest statement to the Commission under 19 U.S.C. § 1337(d)(1). It then argued in favor of a per se rule precluding exclusion orders where there was a RAND commitment, irrespective of sufficiency of evidence for affirmative defenses.  </p>

                <p>Motorola argued that precluding exclusion orders would create disincentives to licensing and would chill standard-setting participation. It also pointed out that Congress amended &#167; 1337 in 1988 to eliminate the injury requirement, reasoning that whether or not one may be adequately compensated by money damages is not relevant in a Section 337 case. <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4819344338954570996">eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C.</a> does <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15493016771758426441">not</a> apply at the ITC for precisely that reason. Accordingly, Apple's attempt to circumscribe the availability of an exclusion order where there are RAND obligations would impermissibly reintroduce the injury requirement.  </p>

                <p><strong>Commission's Remand, Remand and Final Determination</strong></p>

                <p>After having ignited a firestorm of interest, the Commission completely <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-08-30/pdf/2012-21373.pdf">ignored</a> [PDF] the public interest statements it solicited, leaving for another day the viability of RAND defenses at the ITC. The Commission reversed the finding of a violation as to the '697 patent, affirmed findings of no violation as to the '333 and '223 patents. The Commission remanded the finding of no violation of the '862 having reversed the ALJ's finding that it was invalid as indefinite.</p>

                <p>Upon remand, the ALJ found the '862 patent infringed, but invalid as anticipated. Having voted to review the Remand Initial Determination, the Commission <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-04-26/html/2013-09845.htm">held</a> that the '862 is invalid as obvious (reversing the ALJ's finding of anticipation).</p>

                <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

                <p>Some ITC commentators have observed an apparent hesitancy on the part of the Commission to issue an exclusion order covering Apple's products. Whether this is coincidence remains to be seen. The ITC is under considerable political pressure, having been the subject of three Congressional hearings in the past year to which it was not even invited. Excluding a flourishing American brand such as the iPhone could evoke a political backlash against the ITC, resulting in modifications to its enabling statute.</p>

                <p>Public interest and RAND defenses as applied to Apple are set for determination by the ITC on May 31, 2013. In <a href="http://info.usitc.gov/ouii/public/337inv.nsf/34ee115c5a9962e28525656a00601452/1af12e6ffed97ccf852578df0057aff4?OpenDocument"><em>Certain Electronic Devices, Including Wireless Communication Devices, Portable Music and Data Processing Devices, and Tablet Computers</em></a>, 337-TA-794, the Commission has asked for briefing on these issues. Perhaps this will be the case in which the Commission finally clarifies whether public interest and RAND defenses place the products of certain US companies beyond relief at the ITC.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.victoria.ac.nz/law/about/staff/elisabeth-mcdonald">Elisabeth McDonald</a> of the Victoria University of Wellington Faculty of Law evaluates the recent legalization of same-sex marriage by the New Zealand House of Representatives...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/elisabethmcdonald.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n Wednesday, April 17, 2013 New Zealand <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/new-zealand-parliament-votes-to-legalize-same-sex-marriage.php">became</a> the thirteenth country to allow same-sex couples to <a href="/feature/2012/02/same-sex-marriage.php">marry</a>. Although a clear majority of the Members of Parliament supported the change, the public debate had been vitriolic and illogical at times. Therefore, it was important for the bill's supporters to include in the law reform that occurred in other jurisdictions, where, in the <a href="http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/PB/Debates/Debates/d/b/c/50HansD_20130417_00000020-Marriage-Definition-of-Marriage-Amendment.htm">words</a> of the Honorable Maurice Williamson during the final reading: "The sun still [rises]...[t]eenage daughter[s] still argue back as if [they know] everything...[People] do not have...toads in their beds.... The world [has carried] on." </p>

<p>What was not always apparent in discussions about the bill was that the proposed changes went further than most previous reforms. The New Zealand <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/member/2012/0039/latest/whole.html?search=ts_act%40bill%40regulation%40deemedreg_marriage_resel_25_y&p=1#DLM4505003">legislation</a>, due to take effect on August 19, 2013, does not just provide that same-sex couples may marry. Section 5 of the act amended the interpretation section of the <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1955/0092/latest/DLM292028.html?search=ts_act_marriage_resel_25_a&p=1">Marriage Act 1955</a> to read: "<strong>marriage</strong> means the union of two people, <em>regardless of their sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity</em>" (emphasis added). This definition is significant as it allows the marriage of any two people, without the need for either person to define themselves as either the same or different sex as their partner, or to be legally recognized as either male or female. The definition therefore will allow a transgender man (someone born with a female body who has a male gender identify) to legally marry a cisgender woman (someone born with a female body and a female gender identify) without having to first establish his legal sex. It allows a person who identifies as intersex (a general term used for a variety of conditions in which a person is born with a reproductive anatomy that does not seem to fit with the typical biological definitions of female or male) and whose birth certificate records their sex as indeterminate to marry any other person.</p>

<p>The significance of this change was not lost on some of the contributors to the debate. The importance of addressing discrimination against transgender and intersex communities was acknowledged. A Member of Parliament for the National (conservative) Party went further to <a href="http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/PB/Debates/Debates/d/b/c/50HansD_20130417_00000020-Marriage-Definition-of-Marriage-Amendment.htm">address</a>, for probably the first time in the debating chamber, the previous invisibility of intersex people:<blockquote>As a former specialist obstetrician and gynecologist, extremely poignant experiences for me were the rare occurrences where at the birth of a baby, when the parents instinctively asked: "Is it a boy or a girl?" I had been literally unable to tell them. This has been because of ambiguous genitalia or a unique physical abnormality. It may take some weeks to fully assess a child, have genetic testing carried out, and assign a sex. Even that may be later changed. This illustrates the dramatic new knowledge available in the modern world to better understand the spectrum of physical, genetic, and social expression of gender and sexuality that was simply not possible in the past. I ask anyone, on either side of the debate, whether they would not hope that their newborn could be brought up in a society that is both tolerant and as caring about their child's status and aspirations as any other child's, a society that is inclusive, fair, and committed to respecting one another[.] In the first reading of this bill I said that despite trying hard, I could not construct a strong enough intellectual, moral, health, or even spiritual reason to vote against it. I am now quite convinced that, at the end of the day, the strength of any human union is about love, tolerance, giving, forgiving, sharing, inclusiveness, commitment, and fairness irrespective of gender. These are universal qualities that have no boundaries." </blockquote><br />
The passing of this legislation is therefore part of the growing international recognition of the need to address the unique and previously ignored legal status of those who are members of transgender and intersex communities. The use of the words "gender identity" in the act acknowledges that reference to "sex" or "sexual orientation" in legislation does not sufficiently reflect the basis of difference that impacts on those communities and the discrimination visited on them. But there is much more work to be done. For example, there is still no reference to "gender identity" or "gender expression" in the <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0082/latest/DLM304212.html">Human Rights Act 1993</a>. </p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/wpg_URL/Services-Births-Deaths-and-Marriages-Information-for-Transgender-Applicants?OpenDocument">change</a> that did take place in New Zealand in 2013 allows people to self-identify as M, F or X for the purposes of recording their gender on a passport application. There is no need to apply for a change to their birth certificate or even undertake any steps to live as the gender they identify as. There is also on-going work, particularly by one of the world's first intersex advocates, Mani Bruce Mitchell, to <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session22/A.HRC.22.53_English.pdf?utm_source=AIC+mailing+list&utm_campaign=0940e5a7fc-&utm_medium=email">challenge</a> the historical medical practice of early surgery on intersex infants. This issue is also now being recognized internationally and a number of publications view the practice as a human rights violation. </p>

<p>The reform of the New Zealand Marriage Act was not only an important political statement for the gay, lesbian and bisexual communities, but it has also increased the visibility of transgender and intersex communities, as well as providing them with the ability to marry and the associated legal rights and responsibilities. For some members of these communities, the reform does not go far enough. It does not challenge the contemporary relevance of the traditional institution of marriage. It does not allow legal recognition of polyamorous relationships. It may well have exhausted all the social and political will for change which addresses inequitable treatment on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity for a number of years. All these claims may well be true. However, this reform could also be the catalyst for more far-reaching change, even if only in the minds of those who prior to the passing of the Act had never even heard the word intersex. </p>

Detractors say laws like Alabama's are back-door restrictions on the right to have an abortion. Ten states have passed or are considering legislation like Alabama's, including Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Kansas, North Carolina, Mississippi, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Virginia, <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/Abortion/New-York-Washington-State-Consider-Bucking-Trend-on-Abortion-Laws.aspx">according to the Pew Center</a>. Lawmakers intend to force the US Supreme Court to reexamine its 1973 decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12334123945835207673"><em>Roe v. Wade</em></a>, which held that abortion is a constitutionally-protected privacy right.<br />
	<br />
Alabama's Women's Health and Safety Act is a plank of the House Republican Caucus' 2013 <a href="http://alhousegop.com/wedaredefend/">platform</a> called "We Dare Defend Our Right to Life," to address "[q]uestionable Supreme Court rulings [that] have eliminated the state's ability to prohibit abortions altogether." The sponsor of Alabama's law, Rep. Mary Sue McClurkin, <a href="http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/article/20130218/NEWS02/302180010/Ala-House-Representatives-expected-take-up-abortion-clinic-bill-Tuesday?gcheck=1&nclick_check=1">told an Alabama newspaper</a> [Paywall] that the law was needed to protect women because "[w]hen a physician removes a child from a woman, that is the largest organ in a body." </p>

<p>The Women's Health and Safety Act is among the most restrictive state laws for abortion providers. The law requires that within six months, the state's five reproductive health centers must provide the same patient care and meet the same building codes as ambulatory surgical clinics. Alabama clinics will likely have to add rooms, widen doorways to accommodate stretchers, and add pipelines for anesthesia. </p>

<p>The Alabama law also requires reproductive care clinics to report the name of the father of an unborn child to police when a patient is under age 16. The doctor performing an abortion on a minor must also contact the county department of human resources if the father is more than two years older than the minor. If a minor patient initially refuses to name the father, the law directs the clinic to encourage the minor to do so, consistent with state child abuse reporting requirements.</p>

<p>The provision that that will likely have the most impact, however, is the regulation of doctors who work at reproductive health care centers. The law mandates that every physician at a clinic where abortions are performed must have staff privileges at a hospital within the clinic's metropolitan area. Alabama law previously required that only one doctor at a clinic have admitting privileges at an area hospital. The admitting privileges requirement is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/16/us-usa-abortion-mississippi-idUSBRE93F07120130416">difficult</a> for reproductive health centers to meet: hospitals with religious affiliations commonly refuse admitting privileges to OB/GYNs who perform elective abortions. A federal court recently <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-closure-of-lone-mississippi-abortion-clinic.php">stayed the enforcement</a> of a similar Mississippi law after no area hospital would admit doctors who worked in that state's only abortion clinic. In places where there are few in-state doctors willing to perform abortions, clinics must seek out-of-state physicians who are willing to travel. Given the controversy surrounding abortion issues, even local hospitals that have no religious affiliation may be reluctant to grant admitting privileges to out-of-state doctors for abortion care.</p>

<p>Opponents call such state abortion reform laws TRAP laws (Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers). The goal of TRAP laws, <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/en/project/targeted-regulation-of-abortion-providers-trap">argue</a> organizations such as the Center for Reproductive Rights, is to do incrementally what <em>Roe</em> prevents states from doing directly: ban abortions. Pro-choice advocates say that these measures make providing abortions so expensive and burdensome that clinics will be forced to close. They also argue that the new laws' building codes and surgical care requirements are also medically unnecessary, pointing to CDC <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6108a1.htm">reports</a> that of 784,507 legal abortions performed in the United States in 2009, twelve women died as a result of the procedure. </p>

<p>Some states have passed more stringent abortion statutes, such as banning abortions when there is a <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/arkansas-legislature-overrides-governors-veto-of-12-week-abortion-ban.php">fetal heartbeat</a>, which can occur as early as six weeks after conception and recognizing fetal "<a href="/paperchase/2013/04/north-dakota-house-approves-fetal-pain-bill.php">personhood</a>," which protect a fetus' "inalienable right to life" at conception onward. Fetal heartbeat and personhood bills are unlikely to survive federal court scrutiny, and, according to some pro-life advocates, success in the courts is not the point. Anti-abortion activists justify the legislative efforts as part of a "new paradigm of the pro-life movement," Dan Becker, president of Georgia Right-to-Life <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21573594-rest-south-not-far-behind-strict-new-law-arkansas-cutting-away-roe-v">told</a> the Economist in March. Becker explained that their abortion strategy is "all about introducing tension into the law.... We have different courts ruling in different ways, which is a surefire way to challenge <em>Roe</em>."</p>

<p>Another category of recent abortion laws require women seeking abortions to have ultrasounds and further <a href="http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_RFU.pdf">mandate</a> [PDF] that doctors display the ultrasound screen and describe the fetus' image to the patient. Three states, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Texas, do not <a href="http://connecticutlawreview.org/files/2013/01/GaylordMolony.CaseyandaWomansRighttoKnow.45Conn.L.Rev_.595.pdf">give</a> [PDF] the woman an option to refuse the ultrasound image and description. Lawmakers intend that if women see the fetus during an ultrasound, it may dissuade them from going through with the abortion. Paradoxically, as one commentator <a href="http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2013/03/01/challenges-in-the-trans-vaginal-ultrasound-debate/">notes</a>, forced ultrasounds may strengthen women's resolve to have an abortion because it reminds patients of losing their ability to choose. A less-recognized issue with ultrasound requirements, however, is that they may add <a href="http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2013/03/01/challenges-in-the-trans-vaginal-ultrasound-debate/">significant cost</a> to an abortion procedure. </p>

<p>The recent abortion regulations are already having an effect. In Mississippi, pro-choice advocates are <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/mississippi-abortion-clinic-sues-to-block-strict-abortion-law.php">suing</a> to prevent the state's only abortion clinic from closing. Courts now will decide if this recent wave of abortion-reform laws are within the states' powers to enforce. Under <em>Roe</em>, states cannot abolish or restrict abortion rights unless they have a "compelling state interest" to do so, which balances the states' interests in protecting the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens against the right to an abortion. The Supreme Court, however, will <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/Abortion/A-History-of-Key-Abortion-Rulings-of-the-US-Supreme-Court.aspx">allow</a> states to pass laws to protect the health of its citizens, including setting medical licensing regulations, and it is this power that states will use arguing that their regulations do not contravene <em>Roe</em>. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist, <a href="http://www.valpo.edu/law/about-us/full-time-faculty/faisal-kutty">Faisal Kutty</a> of the Valparaiso University Law School says that the Muslim community has risen to the challenge of addressing the mainstream about extremists within, and that, to win the war on terror, democratic governments must foster productive bridge building with the majority of Muslims who oppose jihadist ideology...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/faisalkutty.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>A</strong></font> tipoff from a prominent Toronto imam more than a year ago appears to be at the heart of arrests at the end of April in the alleged VIA Rail <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2013/04/22/suspects_in_toronto_terror_plot_arrested_sources.html">terror plot</a> in Canada. In fact, counterterrorism police began their press briefing by <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/tip-from-imam-led-police-to-first-known-al-qaeda-plan-of-attack-that-weve-experienced/article11492749/">thanking</a> Muslim leaders.</p>

<p>Even in the Boston marathon tragedy, <a href="http://www.democraticunderground.com/1014455005">national</a> and <a href="http://politix.topix.com/homepage/5682-muslim-organizations-denounce-bombing-suspects-following-standoff">local</a> Muslim organizations have condemned the bombings. The largest Muslim civil rights group in the country, the <a href="http://www.cair.com/">Council on American-Islamic Relations</a>, even <a href="http://bostonherald.com/news_opinion/local_coverage/2013/04/american_muslims_condemn_boston_marathon_bombings">asked</a> Muslims to offer authorities any leads they may have. Moreover, in an interesting twist, mosques <a href="http://www.onislam.net/english/news/americas/462348-funeral-of-boston-attacker-troubles-muslims.html">refused</a> to arrange Tamerlan Tsarnaev's <em>janaza</em> (Islamic funeral prayers). In fact, a number of <a href="http://www.onislam.net/english/ask-the-scholar/acts-of-worship/prayer/funerals/462408-islamic-funeral-for-boston-attacker-allowed.html">fatwas</a> (religious opinions) have been issued recommending that prominent individuals and imams not lead his janaza. Imam Suhaib Webb, a nationally recognized cleric from Boston, <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/boston-bombing-suspects-aunt-says-tamerlan-tsarnaev-denied-burial-boston-mosque-1214931#">said</a> "I don't think I could ethically lead a prayer for him, but I would not stop people from praying upon him." The intent behind this is to send a clear message to potential terrorists.</p>

<p>Despite such proactive measures, some self-proclaimed experts continue to pin collective blame on Muslims, citing the "radicalization" of the community. In fact, some <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/fact-checker/2011/03/peter_kings_claim_about_radica.html">Islamophobes</a> who have the ear of governments both side of the border have had the audacity to claim that 80 per cent of the mosques in are controlled by radical imams and serve as incubators of "homegrown" terrorists.</p>

<p>There is no credible evidence to support such bald assertions. On the contrary, the <a href="http://tcths.sanford.duke.edu/">Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security</a> at Duke University released a study in February titled "<a href="http://tcths.sanford.duke.edu/documents/Kurzman_Muslim-American_Terrorism_final2013.pdf">Muslim-American Terrorism: Declining Further</a>," [PDF] which concluded that Muslim terrorism was not a significant threat. It had claimed 33 lives since Sept. 11, 2001, compared with 200 victims of far-right terrorists and 180,000 murders. Moreover, the Center has documented the active role of Muslims in combating terror in the US. The same can be said for Canada.</p>

<p>National security reporter Spencer Ackerman <a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2013/02/american-muslim-terrorism/">notes</a>, "In just the past year, the mass shootings that have captivated America's attention killed 66 Americans." This is twice the number from Muslim-American terrorism in the 11 years after <a href="/feature/featured/911/">9/11</a> leading up to the Boston tragedy. </p>

<p>Muslims must not be held collectively responsible for the alleged actions of criminals among them. No other community is put in such an unenviable position. Italians are not asked to condemn the actions of the Mafia, nor were the Irish asked to apologize for the actions of the Irish Republican Army. The general public is not expected to take responsibility for the actions of the criminals who vandalized mosques and discriminated against or attacked Muslims since the tragic events of Sept. 11. In fact, the FBI has <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2012/spring/fbi-dramatic-spike-in-hate-crimes-targetin#.UY5JoCvwKpV">documented</a> a dramatic spike in anti-Muslim hate and this cannot be pinned on the average American.</p>

<p>The vast majority of Muslims <a href="http://kurzman.unc.edu/islamic-statements-against-terrorism/">condemn</a> terrorism because even classical Islamic law explicitly classifies <em>hirabah</em> (terrorism) as a serious sin. In fact, indiscriminate killing and attacks are prohibited. Indeed, the Qur'an (6:151) <a href="http://www.emuslim.com/islamagainstVoilence.asp">proclaims</a>: "Anyone who kills a person (except pursuant to law) it is as if he has killed the whole of humanity." </p>

<p>Moreover, the Prophet Mohammed's strict <a href="http://abidnyc.wordpress.com/2011/03/28/islam%E2%80%99s-view-on-war-and-terrorism-a-survey-of-the-quran-and-prophetic-traditions/">rules of engagement</a> even in times of hostility were blunt: "Do not kill women or children or non-combatants." Such nuances are lost on those with limited knowledge of their religion. Indeed, a 2010 United States Institute for Peace <a href="http://www.usip.org/files/resources/SR236Venhaus.pdf">study</a> [PDF] titled Why Youth Join al-Qaeda of more than 2,000 people who were attracted to terrorism confirms this. Colonel John Matt Venhaus, the author of the report, found that most of these youth "have an inadequate understanding of their own religion, which makes them vulnerable to misinterpretations of the religious doctrine."</p>

<p>Muslims wonder why they must keep distancing themselves from something so antithetical to their world view. Even when they disown such conduct, it is <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-boston-marathon-bombing-muslims-fear-another-hysteria-20130416,0,4139428.story">under-reported</a> or dismissed as a PR exercise. That said, as part of a democratic civil society the Muslim community has a duty to the mainstream to address the perception real or imagined, about the extremists within.</p>

<p>To its credit, the community has risen to the challenge. Many imams and scholars openly challenge jihadist ideology. From my legal and activism experience on both sides of the border over the years, numerous individuals and institutions have organized anti-radicalization events and even worked with counterterrorism officials in the interest of our collective security.</p>

<p>As part of the same civil society, our governments also must also do their part.</p>

<p>First, we must re-examine our foreign policy and its consequences. It is high time to acknowledge that all innocent lives lost, whether to terrorists or to the "war on terror," are equally deplorable. Victims do not appreciate the difference between a pressure-cooker bomb and a drone strike. Disagree with their tactics as you may, it is undeniable that there are many people in the world who have legitimate grievances against our foreign policy, some of whom may allow anger to overshadow religious rules of engagement. </p>

<p>Moreover, Washington's <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/holder-drone-strikes-on-us-soil-legal-in-extraordinary-circumstances.php">drone policy</a> has only contributed to greater distrust in the global and domestic arena. As Farea Al-Muslimi, a Yemeni writer, <a href="http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/pdf/04-23-13Al-MuslimiTestimony.pdf">testified</a> [PDF] about a drone strike against his village just before last week's Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearings into the <a href="http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/hearing.cfm?id=b01a319ecae60e7cbb832de271030205">issue</a>, "the drone strike and its impact tore my heart, much as the tragic bombings in Boston last week tore your hearts and also mine." He described the blowback from such attacks.</p>

<p>Second, at the domestic level, both of our governments have been on an undeclared and possibly unintended witch hunt. Muslim charities are unfairly targeted, Islam and its symbols are unnecessarily made into an issue and intelligence harassment is rampant. Terrorist profiling often is based simply on guilt by association, which just adds to the vicious cycle of marginalization, distrust and blowback. </p>

<p>In the US, between 2010 and 2012, <a href="http://features.pewforum.org/sharia-law-map/">lawmakers</a> in 32 states introduced bills to ban Islamic law, and seven states&#8212;<a href="/paperchase/2011/09/federal-appeals-court-considers-oklahoma-sharia-law-ban.php">Oklahoma</a>, Arizona, Kansas, Louisiana, South Dakota, Idaho, and Tennessee&#8212;enacted such bills into law. As <a href="http://www.adl.org/press-center/c/shout-down-the-sharia-myth-makers.html#.UYRbfbXDzvo">many</a> commentators have documented, these bills are essentially a solution looking for a problem. In fact, these laws may have even created additional <a href="http://www.islawmix.org/banning-sharia-law-banning-womens-rights/#.UYRbxLXDzvo">challenges</a> for some women who sought to advance their rights. Department of Justice (DOJ) figures also <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/publications/post911/post911summit_report_2012-04.pdf">suggest</a> [PDF] that anti-Muslim "zoning bias," where towns refuse to grant building permits for mosques, is a growing problem. </p>

<p>In the Canadian context, <a href="http://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2013/04/24/conservative_antiterror_bill_and_arrests_match_up_beautifully_dont_they_mallick.html">some</a> have questioned the timing of the arrests (especially given that there was no imminent threat), which appears planned to push through <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/canada-house-of-commons-passes-expanded-anti-terror-legislation.php">The Combating Terrorism Act</a> that would revive some provisions of Canada's <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-11.7/">Anti-terrorism Act</a> which had "sunsetted" after a five-year period. The bill, <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2013/04/24/pol-anti-terror-bill-s7-vote.html">passed</a> two days after the arrests, revived two draconian provisions that had expired: preventive detention for three days without charges and "investigative hearings" under which a suspect who refuses to testify before a judge could be imprisoned for up to a year, as well as new restrictions on travel.</p>

<p>Third, government officials must be careful not to alienate the community by seeking advice only from those with an anti-Muslim agenda. Too many hawks and Islamophobes have the ear of both administrations.</p>

<p>Fourth, the accused must be given their day in court in a fair, open and transparent manner. The trust and confidence asked of the community must not be squandered by resorting to the secret hearings and secret evidence provisions of the anti-terror legislation. Any attempt to deny due process and the rule of law will certainly have an impact on co-operation. </p>

<p>Finally, it must be understood that the majority of Muslims, who are neither secular nor ultra-orthodox, hold the key to any serious and productive bridge-building. If government agencies believe they can win the "war on terror" by undermining front-line soldiers, they had better think again.</p>

		<title>What Exactly is &#034;Extraterritorial Application&#034; of a Statute?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://ualr.edu/law/faculty/kenneth-gallant/">Kenneth S. Gallant</a> of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, William H. Bowen School of Law says that careful delineation of the application of extraterritorial law is the key to its predictable application ...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/kennethgallant.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="L" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n two recent cases, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13588119018619579136"><em>Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum</em></a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3519216444119666685"><em>Morrison v. Australia National Bank</em></a>, the US Supreme Court reaffirmed the presumption against extraterritorial application of federal statutes. The presumption applies unless there is a demonstration of Congressional intent for the statute to apply extraterritorially.  </p>

<p>But the Court did not set out an explicit standard for when the application of a statute is "extraterritorial." So, we have a rather important question: What do we mean by "extraterritorial application" of a statute, or any other law for that matter?</p>

<p>Early English common law, at least the criminal side of it, treated itself as completely territorial. If any matters constituting what we moderns would call "elements" of a crime occurred outside England (or, even more restrictively, the venue of the court hearing the matter), the court could not hear the case. In the famous <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=pZfD7lAK7lgC&pg=PA76&lpg=PA76&dq=lacey+case+1583&source=bl&ots=MHa0yeHAJg&sig=LvQ4sy2I1ERA5XmZMIMk1W6VkLo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ZuuTUYq-CYW14APL14HwBQ&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=lacey%20case%201583&f=false">Lacey's Case of 1583</a>, the defendant attacked a man on board an English ship, but the victim did not die until reaching land. Neither the Admiralty Court nor the common law courts could convict the defendant of murder, because the death did not occur in the Admiral's jurisdiction, and the attack did not occur in the jurisdiction of a common law court. Essentially, the extraterritoriality of one element made the crime itself extraterritorial, and not punishable by the common law. An Act of Parliament was required to create English criminal law as to crimes with any foreign elements, and a presumption against extraterritoriality applied unless the intention of Parliament to do so was clear. [Michael Hirst, <em>Jurisdiction and the Ambit of the Criminal Law</em> (Oxford Univ. Press 2003), pp. 3-10, 29-32. Print Only]</p>

<p>On its own, for an island nation before the age of instant communication and easy transportation, this idea has some logic. In England, the presumption against extraterritoriality is so well known to Parliament that an intent to cover <a href="http://www.e-lawresources.co.uk/Treacy-v-DPP.php">extraterritorial acts</a> is usually made clear. On the other hand, too many crimes and civil wrongs today involve the crossing of borders, and our statute writing tradition is too different from England's to make this very tough version of the presumption practical. Too many cases are likely to fall through cracks, at least if all nations whose territory is involved in a crime or other wrong use a presumption that all elements of a wrong must occur on their own territory before it violates that nation's law.</p>

<p>Some American states, dealing with "result" crimes such as murder and with personal injury torts, came up with the idea that where a crime or tort crosses borders, the wrong could be "localized" to the place where the wrongful force "took effect." For example, the crime of false pretenses might be said to have been committed where the property was obtained rather than where the messages containing the false pretenses were written [Harvard Research, <em>Jurisdiction with Respect to Crime</em>, 29 AJIL Supp. 435, 488-90 (1935). Print Only]. A tort might be said to have occurred where a train coupling injured the rail worker, rather than where the coupling was negligently handled. In each case, the consequence of the localization is that the law of one place was chosen as applicable to the problem. </p>

<p>This is like the fact pattern of <em>Morrison v. National Australia Bank</em>. The plaintiffs there alleged that they were defrauded on stock deals where some of the key lies originated in the US, but the wrongful result of those lies on plaintiffs occurred when they bought shares on foreign stock exchanges. The Court discussed the presumption against the extraterritorial application of statutes, but never said that the foreign effect of the wrong was either necessary or sufficient to invoke the presumption. Because all nine justices agreed that Congress intended to apply the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 only to trades on US exchanges or other trades in the US, the appropriate result would have been reached without application of the presumption.</p>

<p>It is hard to accept the "presumption" as it emerges from this reading of <em>Morrison</em>. It would mean that Congress is presumed not to prohibit bad conduct in the US, unless the wrongful results of that conduct also occur here; though Congress would also be presumed to prohibit the same conduct overseas, so long as the wrongful results occur here.</p>

<p>This would contradict a central tenet of territorial sovereignty itself. The government of a territory is authorized to make law concern persons and things present in the territory; and acts committed and events occurring there. No modern nation can be presumed to give up this authority; but the presumption, if applied regularly to facts like Morrison's would exclude the application of some statutes to persons and actions in the US. In other words, authority to control acts occurring within the country is at the core of a nation's legislative authority. Many US states accept the view that either criminal acts done or results occurring in the state bring the crime within the ambit of the states' criminal law. [Harvard Research at 494-97. Print Only]</p>

<p>Another reading of the <em>Morrison</em> presumption is that it applies where the "focus" of the federal statute is on either acts or effects in the US. If this is true, then there really is no need for a presumption against extraterritoriality because it has already been determined that there was no Congressional intent to apply the statute extraterritorially. However, the continuing vitality of the doctrine in <em>Kiobel</em> suggests that the presumption does have real, independent meaning.</p>

<p>The following version of the presumption would give it real force. It would also make the presumption appropriate in the context of the tradition of US statute drafting, and the view that a nation or state may treat as territorial a crime or cause of action in which either the wrongful act or prohibited result occur on its territory:</p>

<p>If a federal statute declares certain acts to be bad or prohibited, and certain results of acts to be wrongful, the application of the statute remains in the core of US lawmaking authority if either an act-element or a result-element of a crime or cause of action occurs in the US. The presumption against extraterritoriality, then, would come into play when no element occurs in the US. Once the presumption is invoked, it can be overcome only if there is clear evidence of congressional intent that the statute should be applied in the given circumstances. </p>

<p>In <em>Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum</em>, an <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1350">Alien Tort Statute</a> case, the wrongful acts alleged were done in Nigeria and the wrongful results (including death) occurred there as well. Given the history of common law jurisdiction to prescribe as focusing on territoriality, it makes sense to presume that the ATS does not apply, unless there is evidence that Congress intended it to apply to this type of situation. The material in the concurrence in the result suggesting that there are some truly extraterritorial claims that Congress did intend the ATS to cover should go to rebutting the presumption when those cases are brought to court; but a presumption against extraterritoriality should exist as to application of a US statute to a case with no domestic elements. Application of the presumption in these cases will help put to rest the fear of many Europeans that the US will generally apply its own law even where the effects on the US are indirect or remote.</p>

<p>The presumption against extraterritoriality does not prohibit prosecutions of crimes committed outside the US on acceptable bases such as nationality jurisdiction, protective jurisdiction, passive personality jurisdiction (especially where US nationals are victims of terrorism abroad), or even universal jurisdiction. It simply requires that Congress manifest its intent to extend the ambit of the relevant US statute to such cases. Nor does a presumption as stated here upset the common law rules which, in private law cases, allow cases to be adjudicated in federal or state court using foreign rules of decision: i.e., it does not upset general "choice of law" rules.</p>

<p>A carefully delineated presumption against extraterritorial application of US laws can assist those acting outside the US in determining when their acts, and the results of their acts, may subject them to US law. Especially in criminal law, where certainty of application is vital both to fairness to defendants and to the deterrent effect of statutes, this is a good thing.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.gsu.edu/directory/segall">Eric Segall</a> of the Georgia State University College of Law evaluates the implications of same-sex marriage cases before the Supreme Court, and their effect on upcoming challenges to affirmative action...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/ericsegall.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>B</strong></font>etween now and the end of June, the Supreme Court will rule on the constitutionality of both <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-doma.php">same-sex marriage</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-to-rules-on-new-affirmative-action-issue.php">affirmative action</a>. Both issues implicate the Equal Protection Clause of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a>, prohibiting the states (and the federal government through incorporation of the <a href=" http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment">Fifth Amendment</a>), from denying any "person" the "equal protection of the laws." The reasons why the Court should rule that the states and federal government have a constitutional obligation to recognize same-sex marriage shed light on why the Court must allow the states and the federal government to use affirmative action if they so desire.</p>

<p>The female partners in the <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-proposition-8-case.php">Proposition 8 case</a> wish to be treated the same as all other heterosexual couples. The plaintiff in <a href="paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-doma.php">United States v. Windsor</a> lost over $300,000 because the federal <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/1/7">Defense of Marriage Act </a> (DOMA) defines marriage as between a man and a woman for all federal purposes, including the estate tax. All of these plaintiffs are "persons" within the meaning of the Equal Protection Clause, and they have all been denied important government benefits and/or status, and no one seriously argues otherwise. The only defense that opponents of same-sex marriage make is that the institution of marriage must be reserved for heterosexual couples for reasons having to do with children, procreation, or to maintain the traditional institution of family in a way that is centuries old.</p>

<p>We allow heterosexual couples to marry whether or not they want to have children or are even capable of having children. We allow heterosexual couples to marry whether or not they intend to procreate or even are able to procreate. The institution of marriage has never, in US history, been reserved for people having children, and millions of heterosexual marriages are devoid of children. To suggest that the government encourages couples through financial inducements and other privileges to marry so that they can have children is a frivolous claim. </p>

<p>Ms. Windsor should not be denied over $300,000 because she never had children or never intended to procreate. Moreover, millions of same sex couples do have children through adoption, artificial insemination, or other means, and thus are similarly situated to heterosexual couples in that regard. The Equal Protection Clause does not allow the government to disqualify an entire class people from important benefits because of such fanciful claims.</p>

<p>The argument that same-sex couples cannot marry in order to preserve the traditional idea of marriage is equally devoid of logic or law. Other "traditional" ideas used to be that public schools and the military needed to be segregated by race, that teacher-led prayer in public schools was necessary, and that children in those schools had to recite the pledge of allegiance even if they didn't want to. Those "traditions" have gone by the wayside because they were deemed by the Court to be unconstitutional and so should the bans on same-sex marriage. </p>

<p>Moreover, even if the traditional idea of marriage is built upon notions of promised monogamy and the family unit being a stable part of a well-functioning society, gay monogamous couples serve those purposes just as well as heterosexual partnerships.</p>

<p>What these cases really come down to is a moral judgment that society should not encourage gays to marry and should not bestow on gays the benefits of marriage because some people in the US disapprove of homosexual conduct. The Supreme Court, however, has already held on at least three different occasions (two of which involved gay rights), that mere disapproval or animus (in legal language) is not a sufficient enough interest to justify denying people the equal protection of the law. In fact, when animus is at work, as Justice Kennedy once wrote in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17758055891258118781">Romer v. Evans</a> a gay rights case, there is "a denial of equal protection of the laws in the most literal sense." The Supreme Court (jurisdictional issues aside) should rule in favor of the plaintiffs in both the Proposition 8 and the <em>Windsor</em> cases.</p>

<p>Now compare the <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/us-supreme-court-hears-oral-arguments-on-affirmative-action-challenge.php">affirmative action complaint</a> of Abigail Fisher who claims she was denied the equal protection of the laws when she was refused admission to the University of Texas. The University, like thousands of others across the country, uses race as one factor to determine how to build its in-coming class. The major factor the university uses is high school grade point average which accounts for <a href="www.racismreview.com/blog/2013/03/24/top-ten-percent-rule-fisher-v-university-of-texas/">seventy-five percent</a> of its class and is race neutral. Other factors include SAT scores, extra-curricular activities, written essays, alumni status, special circumstances and race. Of course alumni status is a racial factor given the many years only whites were allowed in to the university, and no one claims it is an unconstitutional factor. The issue before the Court, however, is whether colleges that use race overtly among many other criteria in their admissions process violate the equal protection rights of white applicants like Abigail Fisher.</p>

<p>The college does not disqualify all whites from admission nor does it have a rigid quota for minority students or non-whites. Unlike the same-sex marriage cases, the University of Texas does not disqualify an entire identifiable group of people from a benefit it hands out. In fact, the University of Texas is approximately fifty percent white according to enrollment information. So the first important difference between the cases is that Abigail Fisher was not denied admission because she was white but because her entire application when compared with the thousands of other applications was deemed by Texas officials to not add as much to the class as the admitted applicants. No such balancing happens with DOMA or Proposition 8.</p>

<p>Although the government is not allowed to adopt racial classifications absent a compelling interest, the University of Texas has done no such thing. Its use of race as one factor among many to decide what kind of class to admit no more creates a racially based admissions process than the use of athletic ability as one factor converts the process into an athletic based admissions system. </p>

<p>The interests put forth by the University to use race as one factor in its admissions process are far weightier than the animus based interests at the heart of the arguments against same-sex marriage. For many years the University of Texas accepted only whites and now it wants to make sure that its entering class mirrors the society its students are being prepared to enter. In addition, teaching a class with students from diverse backgrounds makes for a much better educational experience for all the students (including the white ones) than teaching a predominantly all white class. As Justice O'Connor noted in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5183084208914209139">Grutter v. Bollinger</a>, the Court's last affirmative action case dealing with higher education, private industry, the military, and other educational institutions all benefit when people of color graduate from our elite colleges and universities.</p>

<p>The same-sex marriage cases involve the governments (both state and federal) denying an entire and identifiable group of people important benefits based solely on their membership in a disfavored class. The <em>Fisher</em> case involves a public school trying to admit the best and most diverse class it can by using race as one factor among many to dole out the privilege of attendance at the state's flagship school. DOMA and Proposition 8 discriminate against gays and lesbians for no good reason while the University of Texas is trying to alleviate the harmful effects of centuries of formal and overt discrimination and graduate a richly diverse student body. The Court should rectify the former and leave the latter alone.</p>

		<title>Mandating Sweat-Free Garment Labels: Feasible Under the First Amendment</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.cuny.edu/faculty/directory/robson.html">Ruthann Robson</a> of the CUNY School of Law argues that requiring manufacturers to label clothing as "sweat-free" is feasible under the First Amendment...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/ruthannrobson1.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>B</strong></font>uying a shirt is an ethically fraught endeavor. This is nothing new: the production of clothes has long been interwoven with slavery, indentured servitude, "wage slavery," immigrant labor, and child labor. But domestic change did occur, albeit gradually and incompletely, despite powerful forces of resistance. Today, regulation of working conditions, while still contested in specific instances, is legal orthodoxy. <br />
 <br />
Global free trade, however, is a reiteration of the once-dominant domestic acceptance of complete laissez-faire. Just as we once believed there was no national power to regulate state and local working conditions, we now accept that there is no national power to regulate foreign working conditions. It is possible, although unlikely, that the US could use trade policies to address situations such as the Rana Plaza building <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-22525431">collapse</a> in Dhaka, Bangladesh that killed over 1,000 people, almost all of them garment workers. <br />
 <br />
Instead, it is more comfortable to exhort consumers and corporations to be "ethical." Yet, even this exhortation is wedded to legal action. The ability to be ethical, even if we agreed about what that might mean, is stymied by the lack of information about the clothes we wear.<br />
 <br />
In 1918, the US Supreme Court revealed the heart of this problem in <em><a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17101646802366258583">Hammer v. Dagenhart</a></em>. In striking down the <a href="http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?doc=59&page=transcript">Keating-Owen Act</a> curtailing child labor, the Court accepted the argument of the Southern Cotton Manufacturers that there was nothing inherently "evil" in the textiles children milled. Retrofitted to a federalism argument, the Court contrasted the "evil" of a lottery ticket in the earlier <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14865911065943917758">Champion v. Ames</a> (the "Lottery Case") with the "child-made goods" in <em>Hammer</em> that were themselves "harmless." Indeed, a person buying such textiles would not be able to discern the conditions of their manufacture.<br />
 <br />
For consumers in 2013, this obstacle persists. The current labels reveal little, even when they purport to identify the country of origin. Instead, the law should require retailers to certify that each item of apparel offered for sale is sweat-free, or to disclose by a prominent label that it is not, and thus provide consumers with the type of information they require to exercise ethical choices. <br />
 <br />
Corporations would undoubtedly challenge any such regulations, including arguing that the labeling is compelled speech in violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a>. Although commercial speech is less highly valued than political speech, this argument has achieved varying levels of success in assorted circumstances involving labeling requirements. <br />
 <br />
Take cigarette packages. For almost half of a century, Congress has required tobacco products to include a label that cigarette smoking can be harmful to one's health. While the label has changed over the years, recent attempts to require more graphic labeling provoked challenges by tobacco companies. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7553770370209139524">R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. v. Food &#38; Drug Administration</a>, a divided panel applied the intermediate scrutiny standard to commercial speech, but nevertheless held that the government did not meet its burden of showing that the graphic warnings would accomplish the purpose of reducing smoking. <br />
 <br />
In a case awaiting a ruling from the Second Circuit for over a year since oral argument, at issue is New York City's <a href="http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/LAWSSEAF.cgi?QUERYTYPE=LAWS+&QUERYDATA=$$ADC20-816$$@TXADC020-816+&LIST=LAW+&BROWSER=BROWSER+&TOKEN=06376449+&TARGET=VIEW">Local Law 17</a> requiring pregnancy services centers to disclose whether they have medical personnel and whether they make referrals for abortion or emergency contraception. A district judge held that the fact that Local Law 17 mandated only factual disclosures did not save it from strict scrutiny and <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-court-blocks-nyc-law-forcing-pregnancy-centers-to-disclose-services.php">held</a> it unconstitutional in <a href="http://c0391070.cdn2.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/pdf/new-york-pro-life-preliminary-injunction11-7-13.pdf">Evergreen Association v. City of New York</a> [PDF]. And in a case currently being litigated in the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, the National Association of Manufacturers and other trade groups challenge a provision of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/dodd-frank_title_i">Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act</a> requiring disclosures of the use "conflict minerals:" tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold in SEC filings. The argument is that these disclosures would not necessarily impact the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. <br />
 <br />
Central to these and similar controversies, such as those involving the labeling of genetically modified food, is not only the question of government's ability to interfere in laissez-faire economics, but the government's power to persuade and inform consumers. Perhaps persuasion is too much, but information is certainly not. Requiring labels on garments that provide the necessary details of their production should survive the First Amendment under the doctrines of commercial, and even compelled, speech.<br />
 <br />
Today, we cannot determine how our clothes were made. Before we can choose to be ethical consumers, we require more information on our labels. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.tjsl.edu/directory/marjorie-cohn">Marjorie Cohn</a> of the Thomas Jefferson School of Law aruges that the Turkish government must stop the violence against its own people...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/marjoriecohn.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>F</strong></font>or nearly three weeks, thousands of protestors have gathered peacefully at Occupy Gezi in Taksim Square in Istanbul. Turkish police have unleashed a brutal crackdown, resulting in three confirmed deaths and nearly 5,000 injured. According to Turkish lawyer Kerem Gulay, a Fulbright Scholar and doctoral student at Cornell Law School, police tactics include excessive beatings with police batons and rifle handles, and the use of pepper spray and other chemicals, rubber bullets, and, allegedly, real bullets.</p>

<p>In order to provide a pretext for police aggression against peaceful protestors, <a href="http://www.goodmorningturkey.com/the-guardian-the-molotov-cocktail-throwers-were-undercover-police-officers/">undercover police officers</a>, acting as agents provocateurs, threw Molotov cocktails Tuesday at police, after which police launched a vicious attack on protestors.</p>

<p>A broad coalition of groups courageously gathered in Taksim Square is protesting neoliberal governmental policies, including economic, agricultural and environmental policies, human rights abuses, mass detentions, privatization of water resources, attacks on freedom of the press and on freedom of religion, and the treatment of Kurdish citizens of Turkey. The protestors' politics range from moderate to center right to nationalist to left liberal to extreme leftist. "All these people have in common," Gulay told me, "is they are critical of government policies."</p>

<p>When lawyers were issuing a press statement decrying the mass detentions of their clients, some 50 lawyers were <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2013/06/turkish-lawyers-join-ongoing-protests.php">arrested</a> and dragged on the ground by riot police. Many lawyers were injured before they were released 10 hours later. Nearly 3,000 lawyers gathered at the courthouse Tuesday to protest these detentions. </p>

<p>There is an ongoing and dangerous process of criminalization of lawyers in Turkey. Nine of fifteen lawyers arrested on <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2013/01/turkish-court-charges-nine-lawyers-under-anti-terrorism-law.php">January 18, 2013</a>, for representing unpopular clients, remain in custody without charges or access to legal papers about their cases. On that date, police raided the Istanbul and Ankara offices of the Progressive Lawyers Association (CHD), a member organization of the <a href="http://www.iadllaw.org/">International Association of Democratic Lawyers</a> (IADL). Twelve CHD officers or members were violently detained under vague terrorism-related allegations. They were interrogated about their representation of clients. They were denied water and the use of a bathroom. </p>

<p>These arrests, detentions, and seizure of property&#8212;including confidential client files&#8212;violate the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a>. The cases are pending in the Special Heavy Penal Courts, which have jurisdiction over "terrorism" proceedings. Their use of secret evidence and repressive procedures have been condemned by several international and regional human rights monitoring bodies and mechanisms. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Judiciary/Pages/IDPIndex.aspx">Gabriela Knaul</a>, who recently visited Turkey, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session20/A-HRC-20-19-Add3_en.pdf">strongly criticized</a> [PDF] the Special Heavy Penal Courts, saying their "special authority" does not comply with human rights standards on fair trial, and they should therefore be abolished. </p>

<p>A group of 500 lawyers who went to the courthouse to protest the lawyers' detention in January were assaulted by police. The Istanbul Bar Association <a href="http://www.istanbulbarosu.org.tr/Detail_EN.asp?CatID=57&SubCatID=1&ID=7715">lambasted</a> the unlawful raids as an "explicit attack towards the legal profession and its honor, as well as the people's right to legal remedies." </p>

<p>When I visited Istanbul as a representative of IADL in April, I met with officers of the Istanbul Bar Association, and I spoke with lawyers who had been arrested and released after the January raid. Some are members of CHD. Many specialize in defending victims of torture, arbitrary detention, extrajudicial executions, police brutality and other human rights violations. They also provide free legal assistance in terrorism-related cases, and those involving freedom of expression or protection of the environment. Because of their work in defending clients who challenge government policies, CHD lawyers have been targeted by the government and the police.</p>

<p>Knual also reaffirmed the principle that a government should not identify lawyers with the causes of their clients. The <a href="http://www.unrol.org/doc.aspx?d=2327">United Nations Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers</a> mandate that governments ensure lawyers are able to perform their professional functions without intimidation, hindrance, harassment or improper interference. They also provide that lawyers shall not be identified with their clients or their clients' causes as a result of discharging their functions. </p>

<p>The president of the Istanbul Bar Association has been accused of contempt of court for protesting the January detentions of lawyers. According to the 2010 US State Department <a href="http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/eur/154455.htm">country report</a> on Turkey, there are more than 10,000 people suspected of "terrorism" in Turkey (one-third of the world's terrorism suspects). Several hundred students, as well as army officials, journalists, lawyers, academics, Kurdish activists, nationalist activists, soldiers and members of the Turkish parliament are in prison, Gulay said. </p>

<p>Frequent and systematic repression against political and human rights activists in Turkey, particularly lawyers and journalists, has been well documented. This year alone, representatives of IADL witnessed evidence of the Turkish state's enforcement of broad and oppressive laws to suppress political dissent from journalists, lawyers, trade unionists and citizens.</p>

<p>The Turkish government must immediately halt all police repression against Turkey's protestors, including police beatings, the use of tear gas and other chemicals; release all detained protesters who were expressing their fundamental right to freedom of expression; and launch an immediate investigation into the human rights abuses committed against the Turkish people since the beginning of the protests, including an investigation into the unlawful use of tear gas and other chemicals.</p>

<p>Taksim Solidarity, the group that was organized before the recent demonstrations to stop the notorious Taksim project of the government, and which has become the voice of the resistance, has declared June 13 International Day of Solidarity with the resisting people in Turkey. Taksim Solidarity invites progressive people around the world to condemn the police violence carried out by the direct order of the government and to show their solidarity. CHD has also issued a call for international solidarity and asks lawyers organizations and human rights organizations to express their concerns to the Turkish government and state bodies. IADL calls upon people throughout the world to join us in demanding an end to the violence against Turkish protestors and accountability.</p>

		<title>Is Egypt&amp;apos;s Stance on the Blue Nile Dam Legally Justified?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.abdn.ac.uk/law/people/profiles/zeray.yihdego">Zeray Yihdego</a> of the University of Aberdeen Law School examines several legal issues arising from the dispute over the Blue Nile Dam between Egypt and Ethiopia...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/zerayyihdego.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>E</strong></font>gypt and Ethiopia are in a war of words concerning the damming of the Blue Nile. Ethiopia <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-22696623">intends</a>, and has already completed twenty-one percent of the construction of the dam, to generate 6000 megawatts of electricity, which is equivalent to six nuclear power plants, in order to support and improve its sustainable development standing, thereby increasing the living standards of millions of its citizens. Egypt opposes the project, fearing that the dam will reduce the flow of the water. Interestingly, Sudan <a href="http://www.africareview.com/News/Sudan-and-Egypt-clash-over-Ethiopia-dam/-/979180/1874356/-/k2bqs7z/-/index.html">sees</a> the dam as beneficial to all downstream and upstream Nile Basin countries. Egypt has <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/africa/130606/egypt-ethiopia-butt-heads-over-nile-diversion-morsi-gaffe-draws-">declared</a> that "all options are open" to stop a reduction of  "even one drop of Nile water" as a result of  the construction of the dam, including involving the military, arming opposition groups and sabotaging the dam, although it says that it does not want to go to war with Ethiopia. This controversy poses several critical legal issues. </p>

<p>The first concerns the legal basis of both sides for using Nile waters and resources. Egypt argues on the basis of "inherent" or "historic" title, as enacted in colonial treaties, including in the 1929 and 1959 <a href="http://www.ethiopians.com/abay/engin.html#1959">Nile Water Treaties</a> between Egypt and Sudan. The latter treaty entitles Egypt to use eighty-seven percent of the Nile which amounts to 55 billion cubic meters of water per annum, while Sudan is entitled only to eighteen and a half billion cubic meters of water per year. The rest evaporates into the air. Ethiopia and other upstream riparian counties including Kenya, Tanzania, Burundi, Uganda, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo rely on the principle of "equitable and reasonable use and utilization" of the Nile River waters and resources. This principle has been codified in <a href="http://treaties.un.org/doc/Treaties/1998/09/19980925%2006-30%20PM/Ch_XXVII_12p.pdf">Article 5</a> [PDF] of the 1997 Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational Uses of International Water Courses, which is considered  a codification of customary principles. In the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/pcij/serie_A/A_23/74_Commission_internationale_de_l_Oder_Arret.pdf">River Oder Case of 1929</a> [PDF], the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) explicitly proclaimed that the "community of interest of riparian States" forms the "basis of a common legal right...of all riparian States..."  It must be noted that Ethiopia had opposed the colonial treaties on the Nile since their inception, and all upstream countries are oppose relying on colonial treaties, considering them unfair and discriminatory. </p>

<p>Egypt might argue, however, that colonial treaties must be honored, which includes those agreements entered into between the British colony and most upstream countries not to use or "arrest" the Nile waters without receiving permission from Egypt and Sudan. This argument is rather weak, as Ethiopia had persistently objected to the treaties, and all upstream (and downstream) countries were under colonial rule and thus not legally bound by such treaties as newly independent countries. The "clean state" doctrine, as codified under <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/3_2_1978.pdf">Article 16</a> [PDF] of the Vienna Convention on Succession of States in Respect of Treaties of 1978, submits that countries that gain independence are not obliged to succeed to colonial treaties excepting boundary issues. </p>

<p>The exception of "special regimes" such as <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Article 13</a> of Rome Statute of the ICC, which imposes obligations on non-party states, is less likely to apply to these colonial treaties which were created to pursue self-interest rather than common values and shared interest among the Nile Basin states. This is why most Nile riparian countries have entered in to the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-22894294">Nile Basin Cooperative Framework Agreement</a> in 2010 which is based upon equality, and cooperation, rather than the status quo ante; it will also establish a joint Commission to oversee the River's management. From this, it can fairly be argued that contemporary international law does not recognize the "inherent" or "historic" use "principle" to exclusively utilize a water course without ensuring the fair share of other riparian states. For that matter the 1997 UN Convention expressly rejects the "inherent" use claim as a bar to the equitable and reasonable use of international waters.</p>

<p>However, as a second legal issue, upstream countries must not inflict a significant harm upon downstream states in their use of an international river like the Nile as stated in Article 7 of the UN Convention 1997 and Article 12 of the <a href="http://www.internationalwaterlaw.org/documents/intldocs/ILA_Berlin_Rules-2004.pdf">Berlin Rules</a> [PDF]. For example, the "minimum individual water requirements" of the people in downstream countries must not be jeopardized by a dam or other projects in upstream countries. Ethiopia <a href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-06-02/world/39698337_1_nile-water-egypt-flow">insists</a> that its Blue Nile mega dam project will not affect the flow of the water, and thus not only that it will not significantly affect Egypt or Sudanese interests but also that will be beneficial to most riparian countries, including Sudan and Egypt. The electricity generated will be exported to neighboring countries and the project will increase the flow of water to both countries. Conversely, Egypt <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContentPrint/1/0/73073/Egypt/0/Egypt-presidency,-opposition-figures-discuss-Ethio.aspx">argues</a> that Ethiopia has not done enough studies on the impact of the dam on downstream nations, especially on fishing, crops and developing new and major hydro-electric power plants in Egypt. </p>

<p>This problem seems to be related to the first legal controversy; Egypt is not willing to risk a reduction of "a drop of water" from the Nile as that is contrary to its "inherent" or "historic" title to fully use and utilize the Nile waters. However, the duty not to inflict a significant harm is founded on the principle of "equitable and reasonable use" of a trans-boundary river and thus does not rely on the prior will or permission of one concerned party. It does not allow one party to expand its projects while denying others to use the water for their sustainable development and poverty reduction endeavors.  Of course, establishing "a significant harm" is a technical matter, but what seems to be clear is that Ethiopia is vindicated by the Tripartite Commission's findings in that its project will not harm Egypt and Sudan significantly. </p>

<p>However, this poses a third legal issue. Egypt appears to call upon Ethiopia to halt its project, without providing a legal ground. It may well be justified to urge halting a significantly harmful project based upon evidence and reason but not based on a threat of violence and intervention. Even if the project will significantly harm Egypt, according to the 1997 UN Convention, Ethiopia might only be required to: "take all appropriate measures..., in consultation with the affected State, to eliminate or mitigate such harm and, where appropriate, to discuss the question of compensation."</p>

<p>Finally but most importantly, Egypt vows to use all available options including military force, intervention, sabotage, etc. As the country's economy and livelihood is dependent on the Nile, it may argue, even if remotely, that the Blue Nile dam is a threat to its survival and thus entitled to defend itself under <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter7.shtml">Article 51</a> of the UN Charter. In light of <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter1.shtml">Article 2</a> of the UN Charter, however, states can only use force to defend themselves if and when they are militarily attacked. Moreover, using force as a means of national policy including to secure water interests is totally banned under current international law. </p>

<p>However, whether Egypt has violated its Charter (or African Union) legal duties is not entirely clear. It may be said that Egypt threatened to use military force in violation of Article 2 of the Charter and <a href="http://www.au.int/en/sites/default/files/ConstitutiveAct_EN.pdf">Article 4</a> [PDF] of the AU Constitutive Act, and thus responsible for such persistent military threats against Ethiopia, in accordance with Articles 1, 40, 41, and 42 of the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf">International Law Commission Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States 2001</a> [PDF].</p>

<p>The opposing, and may be a more sound argument, is that what (some) Egyptian politicians have done, and are doing, is a sheer propaganda to intimidate and frightened Ethiopia, and thus no concrete breach is committed by Egypt of its duty owed to Ethiopia and the International Community at large. In fact, The Egyptian Nobel Peace Laureate Mohamed ElBaradei <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/06/05/egypt-ethiopia-dam-idINL5N0EH3N120130605">called upon</a> the President to make an apology to Ethiopia and Sudan for "the irresponsible utterances" made against them. It cannot be concluded at this point therefore  that Egypt has, or has not, violated international law, as this will depend on how the situation progresses. </p>

<p>As the African Union and the USA rightly <a href="http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/AU-urges-Egypt-Ethiopia-to-hold-talks-20130612">urged</a>, and as codified in Article 13 of the 1997 UN Convention and related rules, the way forward is to settle all problems peacefully, and to work together to maximize the benefits to all and minimize any possible harm of the dam on downstream nations and peoples. The solution lies on Egypt accepting the rights and entitlements of riparian countries in accordance with twenty first century international law, while Ethiopia making sure that its dam does not significantly impact Egypt and Sudan; if diplomacy fails both parties must opt for judicial or arbitral settlement. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Sabrina Ramirez, <a href="http://www.barry.edu/law/">Barry University School of Law</a>, Class of 2014, discusses the new immigration reform and the Hispanic vote's impact on the reform...<br />
<hr height='1'><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size='3'><strong>T</strong></font><strong>he Immigration Bill</strong></p>

<p>Immigration reform, a highly politicized topic, polarizes the country in two factions; those that support freer immigration policies versus those that want a more restrictive approach. On April 16, 2013 Senator Schumer (New York), a member of the bipartisan group of senators <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/01/28/immigrations-gang-of-8-who-are-they/">dubbed</a> the immigration "Gang of Eight," introduced <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c113:S.744:">Senate Bill 744 Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Act</a>, yet another attempt to pass comprehensive immigration reform. The 844-page bill proposes many changes to the current immigration system including the retention of highly skilled workers by granting the group permanent residency status, a guest and agricultural worker programs to meet labor demands and even the adoption of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:S.952:">DREAM Act (Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act of 2013)</a>. But most importantly, the bill creates a path to citizenship by creating the registered provisional immigrant status for the 11 million illegal immigrants present in the US, contingent on effectively securing the border. </p>

<p>In framing the political discourse, the drafters were very careful in not using the word amnesty, but in essence, the path to citizenship is amnesty because the government will pardon a group that violated immigration law by granting legal status that allows them to remain on US soil, travel and work. The bipartisan effort is a response to a changing electorate, and a race to gain the Hispanic vote, a voting bloc that will determine future elections and a community deeply affected by the broken immigration system. </p>

<p><strong>The Registered Provisional Immigrant</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/F?c113:1:./temp/~c113EtwjuU:e78278:">Section 2101</a> of Senate Bill 744 amends the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?i108:I05563:i108HUMBOLDT.html">Immigration and Nationality Act</a> by adding section 245B, which creates a registered provisional immigrant category. This new classification will in effect provide amnesty for illegal immigrants provided they meet certain qualifications.<br />
To become a registered provisional immigrant an alien must satisfy the following prerequisites:<ul><br />
	<li>• Must be physically present in the US at the time the bill is enacted and at the time they submit their application, and must prove a continuous presence in the US before December 31, 2011. A brief, casual or innocent absence can still meet the continuous presence requirement. </li><br />
	<li>• No criminal convictions. If an alien has been convicted of a felony, aggravated felony, or three or more misdemeanors for which the alien was convicted on three different dates in an American jurisdiction, the alien is disqualified. If the crime was committed in a foreign nation and such crime is illegal in the US, the alien cannot apply to become a registered provisional immigrant. Finally, if the alien engaged in unlawful voting, the alien cannot seek adjustment of status under the new bill. </li><br />
</ul>Even if the alien satisfies the continuous and physical presence requirement and has no disqualifying criminal record, the applicant must:<br />
<ul><br />
	<li>• Pass a security and law enforcement clearance. </li><br />
	<li>• Provide the Department of Homeland Security with biometric and biographic information. </li><br />
	<li>• Pay taxes in accordance with <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6203">6203 of the Internal Revenue Code 1986</a> and show proper documentation of compliance. </li><br />
	<li>• Pay any processing fee which include application, the cost of gathering biometric screening data and a $1,000 penalty fee. All proceeds must be deposited in the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Trust Fund established under 6(a)(1) of the act. </li><br />
</ul>Even though congress wants to send a strong message that it does not reward those that came into the country illegally, they will be giving them the biggest reward of all, to remain in the country by granting a pardon to those that violated immigration laws. More importantly, the applicant will be considered admitted and lawfully present in the US on the date the application is filed. The applicant can no longer be removed from the US. Once the adjustment to registered provisional immigrant is granted, identification will be provided which serves as a three year work permit, and grants the ability to travel outside the US provided that the absence does not exceed 180 days.</p>

<p>Overall, Congress will be granting amnesty by providing an opportunity to the illegal immigrant population to remain in the country, work and travel.</p>

<p><strong>The Importance of the Hispanic Vote</strong></p>

<p>The immigration reform bill was drafted with the Hispanic population in mind. The Hispanic bloc will be the swing vote in future American elections. According to the <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/p20-568.pdf">Census Bureau's Voting Report from the November 2012 Elections</a> [PDF], Hispanic turnout was 48 percent, almost 2 percent down from the previous election year (49.9 percent in 2008). Out of the 23.3 million Hispanics of voting age only 11.2 million voted in the last election. Hispanics make up 17 percent of the US population; however, 24 percent are under the age of eighteen, with about 800,000 becoming eligible to vote each year. The Hispanic bloc has not sworn allegiance to either party, and according to <a href="http://azstarnet.com/news/local/border/mccain-gop-stands-to-benefit-from-ok-of-immigration-bill/article_494befd0-dd64-51c0-b301-7754a532b2b0.html">Senator John McCain from Arizona</a>, if the immigration reform bill passes, he does not think that his party will "gain a single Hispanic vote immediately," however, "what it does is it puts us on a level playing field to compete for those votes."</p>

<p>Moreover, Hispanic voters are paying close attention to the immigration debate. According to a <a href="http://www.latinodecisions.com/blog/2013/03/05/new-poll-immigration-policy-stance-directly-tied-to-winning-the-latino-vote/">Latino Decisions poll</a>, 58 percent of the participants rated immigration reform as the most important issue that Congress and the President need to address. In addition, in a <a href="http://www.pewhispanic.org/2012/11/07/latino-voters-in-the-2012-election/">national exit poll</a>, 77 percent of Hispanic voters agreed that congress should offer an opportunity for illegal immigrants to apply for legal status when asked what should happen to illegal immigrants. </p>

<p>The reality is that the current immigration laws have deeply affected Hispanic families. According to the <a href="http://arc.org/dev3/shatteredfamilies">Shattered Families Report</a> by the Applied Research Center (ARC) 397,000 people were removed from the US during 2011, the largest number in the agency's history and during the first six months of the year more than 46,000 were mothers and fathers of US citizen-children. These removals have separated families, with the children ending in foster care and parental rights terminated, making family reunification extremely difficult. ARC estimates that there are at least 5,100 American citizen children living in foster care because of immigration removal proceedings. At the heart of US immigration policy is family reunification, but the current immigration policy has destroyed many Hispanic families. The registered provisional immigrant category will allow law-abiding parents to become of legal status, thus protecting the family structure, and resolving this shocking flaw in the current system.</p>

<p>The Obama administration finally changed its <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/15/politics/immigration">immigration policy</a> during the 2012 election year by issuing an executive order to stop the removal/deportation of illegal immigrants under the age of 30, who entered the country before they were 16 year of age, had no criminal record nor posed a security threat that were either successful students or served in the military. According to the administration, this was an effort to use resources to prevent current illegal immigration and remove criminals that pose a bigger security threat. Although many critics saw this as a usurpation of congressional power, this political move helped <a href="http://www.pewhispanic.org/2012/11/07/latino-voters-in-the-2012-election/">secure 71 percent</a> of the Hispanic votes during the 2012 election for Obama. Congress finally understands how important it is for both parties to pass comprehensive immigration reform if they are to gain the Hispanic vote.</p>

<p>The immigration bill has survived its first major test; on May 21, 2013, the Senate Judiciary Committee passed the bill 13-5. The immigration bill will go to the Senate floor for consideration. The real battle begins, however, when the bill goes to the House of Representatives. The House is working on its own bill, and will take a more conservative approach to the path of citizenship than the one offered by the Senate. Since granting legal status to the 11 million illegal immigrants hinges on effectively securing the border, Congress is likely to find a middle ground and pass the much needed reform. More importantly, both political parties are at a crossroad &#8212; if they want to gain the Hispanic vote, they must work together to pass comprehensive immigration reform.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.cato.org/people/walter-olson">Walter Olson</a> of the <a href="http://www.cato.org/">Cato Institute</a> weighs in on the Department of Justice's recent embrace of the Wartime Suspension of Limitations Act...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/walterolson.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>"W</strong></font>ar is the health of the state," wrote Randolph Bourne a century ago&#8212;from the <a href="http://www.taxhistory.org/thp/readings.nsf/ArtWeb/557559440437EDBC8525718B005ACCCB?OpenDocument">special war taxes</a> that can linger for a century, to the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/26/us/strategic-goats-gobble-up-trade-subsidy.html">mohair subsidy program</a> from the Korean War days, to New York City's <a href="http://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/how-rent-control-drives-out-affordable-housing">wartime emergency rent controls</a>, to the many incursions on civil liberties that don't get rolled back afterward. War, it now turns out, can even give a boost the lawyers who represent the federal government in civil litigation, magically transmuting losing cases into winners.<br />
                <br />
                Every major legal system embraces the concept of the statutes of limitations. In the US, statutes of limitations contribute to both our litigation system's fairness and its practicality. The great majority of civil claims must be filed within a time-frame ranging from one to five years, the exact length depending on the kind of claim and under which law it arises.<br />
                <br />
                In 1942, not long after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, Congress passed the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title18/html/USCODE-2010-title18-partII-chap213-sec3287.htm">Wartime Suspension of Limitations Act</a> (WSLA), providing that the statute of limitations would be suspended (or "tolled") on claims of defrauding the federal government until hostilities had ended. When the Japanese surrendered three years later, Congress left WSLA on the books, where nearly everyone forgot about it.</p>

                <p>Last year, however, in a case that <a href="http://www.friedfrank.com/siteFiles%2FPublications%2FFried%20Frank%20FraudMail%20Alert%C2%AE%20No.%2012-08-16.pdf">gave business lawyers chills</a> [PDF], the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">US Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) managed to rouse WSLA, long presumed dead, from its proverbial grave. The government had filed a lawsuit claiming that French bank <a href="http://www.bnpparibas.com/en">BNP Paribas</a> had improperly enrolled ineligible Mexican clients in a US trade promotion program six years earlier. Under the ordinary federal fraud statute, the claim was too stale to go forward, since the bank's alleged misconduct had occurred a bit too far in the past to satisfy the statute of limitations. Deadline, schmeadline, DOJ argued: the country is at war! There is one war in Afghanistan and another in Iraq, and both require that the ordinary statute of limitations be suspended, the argument goes. A Texas federal court <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4779952954548091714">agreed</a>. Never mind that BNP's misconduct (which it denies; the litigation is still pending) had nothing whatever to do with national defense or war or Afghanistan or Iraq. Never mind either that WSLA is part of the federal <em>criminal</em> code and refers in its text to an <em>offense</em>, ordinarily language that refers to criminal prosecution as distinct from civil suits; this statute nonetheless carries over to fraud as a purely civil claim, which demands a lower standard of proof.</p>

                <p>That ruling was no fluke: last month in a different case,  the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/Opinions/Published/121011.P.pdf">ruled</a> [PDF] the same way. It held that mere Congressional authorization of the use of military force&#8212;not necessarily an actual declaration of war&#8212;suffices to trigger the statute (Congress itself had encouraged this reading, it should be noted, in a 2008 law). The court further ruled that the provision was available not just to DOJ, but also to private plaintiffs who use the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/civil/docs_forms/C-FRAUDS_FCA_Primer.pdf">False Claims Act</a> [PDF] to accuse federal contractors of overcharging the government or misrepresenting work done. By law, the private complainant, if successful, pockets a share of the proceeds, and such "qui tam" provisions had already spawned a mini-industry of private bounty-hunting litigation against hospitals, universities and many other categories of federal contractor, including defense contractors.</p>

                <p>Reliance on WLSA is surging. Last December, the federal government <a href="http://www.bakerlaw.com/health-law-update-june-13-2013/">filed</a> a slew of mortgage-meltdown claims against Wells Fargo that would otherwise have been time-barred, citing the Afghan war as reason to ignore the statute of limitations. <a href="http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=72359e00-6dc9-4ce7-a34c-b907a5c61b37">Twelve times</a> the government invoked WSLA from 2009 to 2012, as many times as it has relied on the statute in the preceding 47 years.<br />
                    <br />
                    Nervous business lawyers are wondering who is next and when, if at all, they can safely advise clients that a potential dispute is too old to worry about. If truth is the first casualty of war, perhaps the fairness of dispute resolution is the next.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Samar Warsi of the <a href="http://www.muslimclu.org/">Muslim Civil Liberties Union</a> says that the extensive investigative infrastructure devised by the government has greatly eroded vital Fourth Amendment protections...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>S</strong></font>ince its inception, the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> required striking a fine balance between individual privacy rights and the public's security interests. We understood that Fourth Amendment rights were not absolute. So over time, exceptions were carved out: metal detectors to ensure passenger safety on flights; <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=DUI+checkpoint&hl=en&as_sdt=4,60&case=11348246873623439918&scilh=0">checkpoints</a> to combat drunk driving; <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=metal+detectors+flights+fourth+amendment&hl=en&as_sdt=4,60&case=5031844227599510007&scilh=0">dog sniffs</a> to fight the war on drugs and more.</p>

                <p>For each exception, we created parameters and procedures. Each of these measures was a temporary inconvenience for an identifiable greater good. If a passenger had a weapon on his or her person, the threat could be directly linked to the flight he or she was to board. If a driver was found drunk, the threat was immediate to others on the road, and if a dog sniffed out drugs, the threat of those drugs being used or distributed was apparent by virtue of their presence. There were clear cut answers. In theory, if you were a law abiding citizen, these measures were nothing but a momentary delay in your day. On the whole, these exceptions were considered reasonable in light of the security interest in question.</p>

                <p>Then there were the more questionable applications of the Fourth Amendment like the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=terry+v+ohio&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=17773604035873288886&scilh=0">"Terry frisk"</a> which allowed police officers to stop and frisk individuals who looked suspicious; the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=open+fields&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=3344582850095083654&scilh=0">"open fields" doctrine</a> which stated that open fields were not protected by the Fourth Amendment; and the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=us+v+leon&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=12950573209015417232&scilh=0">"good faith" doctrine</a> which allowed officers to get away with unreasonable searches as long as they swore before a magistrate that it was done in good faith.</p>

                <p>Some of these developments gave individual police officers an increased amount of discretion. Now, a police officer's subjective perception of a situation meant that Fourth Amendment laws could be applied differently across the board depending on the particular officer. By utilizing a police officer's subjective perception of a situation, Fourth Amendment laws are applied differently across the board depending on the particular officer. Increasing officer discretion is a dangerous thing. It creates inconsistency in the law. It lessens accountability as there is no set rubric against which actions have to be measured. "Reasonable suspicion" and "good faith" are concepts much like "national security" in that they often serve as a pretext to justify vast amounts of otherwise protected Fourth Amendment government activity. The consequences of using such concepts can be alarming. For example, the Center for Constitutional Rights recently <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/04/new-york-nypd-stop-frisk-lawsuit-trial-charts">reported</a> that fifty-two percent of the individuals who were stopped and frisked by the New York Police Department between 2004 and 2012 were black, thirty-one percent were Hispanic and only ten percent were white (eight percent were other). </p>

                <p>Since September 11, 2001, what were once the subtle increases in government discretion turned into an all-out free-for-all whereby any and all government intrusion can be justified to guard against terrorism. Over the last decade, Fourth Amendment protections have been chipped away at bit by bit starting with the oh-so nobly titled <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c107:H.R.3162:">Patriot Act</a>.</p>

                <p>As it currently stands, the government can use roving wiretaps, delve into your medical records, take DNA samples when they arrest you, track your internet activity, monitor your home, dissect your financial transactions, investigate your business records, subpoena bulk information from free press organizations, detain you indefinitely and potentially use domestic drones to spy on you all under the guise of national security. National security has become a free pass under which the government can become increasingly intrusive with little accountability.</p>

                <p>Recently, the National Security Agency (NSA) <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-lawmakers-urge-review-of-government-surveillance-activities.php">surveillance program</a> has come under scrutiny for its overly broad interception of hundreds of millions of phone calls, videos, photos, emails and messages. Specifically, the NSA's PRISM program is accused of tapping into user data of Apple, Google, Facebook and some of the most powerful technology companies in the world. The leak came on the heels of another scandal in which Verizon was <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/nsa-collecting-phone-call-data-under-top-secret-court-order.php">ordered</a> by a secret court to turn over telephone records of millions of its customers. A few weeks ago, President Barack Obama assured Americans that a secret court oversaw the surveillance program, but the very existence of a "secret" court is a hallmark of dictatorships, not free and democratic societies. Big Brother is a reality, and probably in a more chilling way than George Orwell could have ever predicted.</p>

                <p>You may be thinking why should you care? After all, you are not doing anything wrong so who cares what the government is collecting? However, by consenting to live in a virtual surveillance state, you are consenting to live in a society where the government can retroactively concoct a story about any of its citizens. In essence, by stockpiling data, the government can essentially link you to a crime by retroactively digging up selective fragments (and omitting others) of your past activity to paint a picture. <strong>Any picture</strong>. </p>

                <p>There has been a shift from the momentary inconvenience of a checkpoint or metal detector to a methodical, ongoing and highly paranoid campaign of monitoring law abiding citizens. It is deliberate, it is systematic and it is unprovoked. The omnipresent nature of the spying indicates that the government is no longer interested in searching for threats based on legitimate suspicion. Instead, it has created an extensive investigative infrastructure that essentially destroys our Fourth Amendment rights.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.lls.edu/aboutus/facultyadministration/faculty/facultylistl-r/levinsonjessica/">Jessica Levinson</a> of Loyola Law School, Los Angeles, examines the implications of the US Supreme Court's recent decision in <em>Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona</em>...

</tbody>
</table>
<span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>T</strong></span>o answer the question in the title: not so much.

Monday came and went without a "blockbuster" decision by the US Supreme Court. However, the Court did <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-arizona-voter-proof-of-citizenship-requirement.php">hand down</a> one important, and likely to be overlooked, decision regarding a hotly debated topic: proving of citizenship for purposes of registering to vote.

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-71_7l48.pdf">Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona</a> [PDF], Justice Scalia, writing for a 7-2 majority of the Court, found that federal law preempted Arizona's voter registration requirements. This sounds like a victory of voting rights activists, but let's delve deeper.

In 1993 Congress passed the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/chapter-20/subchapter-I%E2%80%93H">National Voter Registration Act</a> (NVRA). The NRVA requires that when States register voters for federal elections they "accept and use" a federal form. With respect to proof of citizenship, the so-called "Federal Form" requires that would-be voters profess that they are citizens. This claim is made under penalty of perjury.

The NVRA provides that states must allow voters to register to vote for Federal candidates with a driver's license application, in person, or by mail. The third method, registering to vote by mail, is at issue in this case. But Arizona law requires more. The state passed a law, via the initiative process, requiring that applicants must present documentary evidence of citizenship. If applicants do not, then state officials must reject the voter registration application.

Now let's get to the Court's rationale. The majority found that while the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei">Elections Clause</a> of the US Constitution gives States the responsibility to promulgate regulations providing the time, place and manner of federal candidate elections, it gives Congress the power to change or supersede those regulations. The majority concluded that the NVRA requirements that States "accept and use" the Federal Form preempts Arizona's additional voter registration requirements, specifically the requirement that officials reject voter registration forms without documentary evidence of citizenship.

Put another way, the Court concluded that the NVRA prohibits states from requiring that voter registration applications provide information in addition to that which is required by the Federal Form.

But for those who are happy with the Court's opinion thus far, wait a moment. Justice Scalia emphasized that Arizona can ask a commission, the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), to include these additional, state-specific requirements. Arizona would argue that obtaining documentary evidence proving citizenship was necessary to allow its election officials to determine whether applicants are eligible to vote. The EAC has the power to set the contents of the Federal Form in consultation with the States. The Federal Form already includes some state-specific requirements and instructions.

In fact, Arizona did ask the EAC for certain additional requirements to be part of the state-specific instructions for Arizona on the Federal Form. In 2005, the EAC <a href="http://www.eac.gov/assets/1/Page/EAC%20Letter%20to%20Arizona%20Secretary%20of%20State%20Jan%20Brewer%20March%206%202006.pdf">deadlocked</a> [PDF] 2-2 on that request, hence no action was taken. Arizona did not take the next step of challenging the EAC's inaction by seeking review in federal court under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/administrative_procedure_act">Administrative Procedure Act</a> (APA).

Justice Scalia, writing for the majority, noted that Arizona could now again ask the EAC to add state-specific requirements on the Federal Form. If the EAC rejected the request or failed to act, Arizona could then seek APA review. If Arizona can prove that its additional voter registration requirements are necessary to satisfy the citizenship requirement, then the EAC has no option but to include Arizona's requirement of documentary evidence of citizenship. Or as Justice Scalia put it, the EAC would then have a "nondiscretionary duty" to include that requirement in the Federal Form.

The majority acknowledged that the EAC currently has <a href="http://www.eac.gov/about_the_eac/commissioners.aspx">zero active commissioners</a>. However, it noted that Arizona could seek a writ of mandamus to force the EAC to act. If a court lacked the ability to force the EAC to act because it lacks enough commissioners to constitute a quorum, then, the majority suggested, Arizona could bring another suit asserting a constitutional right to require documentary evidence of citizenship in addition to the requirements on the Federal Form.

So for those seeing Justice Scalia's decision as a clear statement in favor of easing voter registration requirements, that is simply not the case. This case dealt with whether a federal statute preempts a state law. And the majority gave states a clear roadmap for establishing more stringent voter registration requirements.

		<title>The Prospect of US Liquefied Natural Gas Exportation</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Mike Blackwell, <a href="http://mckinneylaw.iu.edu/">Indiana University McKinney School of Law</a> Class of 2013, discusses the US federal regulatory framework for liquefied natural gas exportation...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="MikeBlackwell.jpg" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/MikeBlackwell.jpg" width="131" height="185" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>G</strong></font>lobal energy markets are currently undergoing a number of significant changes. A recent and rapid expansion in the US domestic supply of natural gas, resulting mainly from increased use of hydraulic fracturing extraction technology in the US, has caused a significant decrease in the domestic price of natural gas. Meanwhile, global population growth and the industrialization in the developing world encourages a consistent rise in demand for natural gas. Today, resource developers aim to take full advantage of the expanding gas market by extracting US shale gas reserves for export to foreign markets. Citizens, government agencies and NGOs alike have raised a number of concerns about the economic and environmental effects of prospective US gas export. As a result, US policy makers are in the midst of a significant debate regarding the future of the US natural gas industry.</p>

<p>Estimates suggest that the current domestic supply of natural gas in the US is substantial, due in large part to the recent commercial viability of hydraulic fracturing extraction techniques. According to the <a href="http://www.eia.gov/">US Energy Information Administration</a> (EIA), US natural gas production <a href="http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=811">increased</a> from 0.039 trillion cubic feet in 2000 to approximately 4.87 trillion cubic feet in 2010. In its 2013 Annual Energy Outlook, the <a href="http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/pdf/0383(2013).pdf">EIA predicted</a> [PDF] that natural gas production will increase by 44 percent to 33 trillion cubic feet by the year 2040. These domestic resources are highly valuable on the world market. Most nations, especially those nations located in resource-constrained regions of the world, strongly desire natural gas for its ability to provide cheap and relatively clean power to electric utilities, industrial manufacturers and power generating sources. Transporting natural gas to these markets has historically been very difficult and costly. However, recent advancements in gas liquefaction, storage and transportation technologies allow natural gas to be converted to liquefied natural gas (LNG) for transport overseas. Today, resource-constrained nations like South Korea and Japan are able to purchase and consume natural gas supplied by resource-rich countries like Quatar, Indonesia and the US.  </p>

<p>Despite the high costs of investment for LNG export infrastructure, speculators suggest that LNG export will not only yield high returns but also boost US tax revenues, improving the US trade balance. Accordingly, a number of natural gas companies have taken initial steps toward installing the necessary LNG export infrastructure by applying for proper permitting with US state and federal agencies. As of this writing, <a href="http://tjogel.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Salo.pdf">more than 25 applications are filed</a> [PDF] with the Department of Energy (DOE) for LNG export authorization. Also, eight applications have been filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for authorization to site and construct LNG export facilities. To date, only one facility has received full authorization for LNG export: the <a href="http://knowledgecenter.csg.org/drupal/system/files/lng_exports.pdf">Sabine Pass Liquefaction Project</a> [PDF] in Cameron Parrish, Louisiana. As the sole successful application, the Sabine Pass facility is currently the focus of the heated debates swirling about prospective US natural gas exportation.  </p>

<p>Section 3 of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/chapter-15B">Natural Gas Act of 1938</a> (NGA) governs international transport and sale of natural gas in the US. Entities seeking to export natural gas must obtain authorization from the Department of Energy (DOE) before export activity may commence. Separate permitting must also be obtained from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for the construction and operation of LNG export facilities. For DOE approval of proposed export activity, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/10/590.202">10 C.F.R. &#167; 590.202</a> requires that applicants provide "all applicable information" pertaining to the chain of supply and forecasted distribution network for the outbound natural gas. This expansive provision authorizes the DOE to consider not only the specific circumstances of the proposed export activity but also the broad impacts of LNG export on the larger US economy. In its consideration of these complex future market scenarios, 10 C.F.R. &#167; 590.202 inherently requires prospective exporters to engage in a highly speculative examination of the evolving natural gas market. Thus, it is very difficult for applicants to achieve a truly accurate and comprehensive representation of the relevant information.</p>

<p>An additional point of contention arises in the export permitting process under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/717b">15 U.S.C. &#167; 717(b)(a)</a>, which authorizes the DOE to deny a LNG export permit if the export activity "will not be consistent with the public interest." Determining whether the proposed export activity complies with this public interest provision depends largely on whether a qualifying free trade agreement (FTA) exists between the US and the proposed export destination country. The DOE regularly approves exports to free trade countries, but often shies away from approval of exports to nations which have not signed a free trade agreement with the US. Thus, under NGA Section 3, LNG export to a non-FTA nation is not presumed to be consistent with the public interest. Accordingly, the full DOE application and hearing process applies, allowing opponents of the proposed LNG export ample opportunity to overcome this presumption. To date, the Sabine Pass facility is the only proposed LNG export project in the US to receive authorization for LNG export to non-FTA nations. At present, DOE review of all other LNG export applications for LNG export to non-FTA countries is currently suspended. This delay is due in part to the economic and environmental issues raised by opponents of LNG export, who argue that the DOE must account for all available measurable data when making determinations of LNG export permitting.</p>

<p>The issues raised by opponents of LNG export are an important consideration that must be adequately counted in the relevant policy debates. Certainly, activities surrounding natural gas extraction, transport and consumption create a number of serious environmental concerns. Accordingly, proposals to FERC for construction of LNG export facilities fall within the purview of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/chapter-55">National Environmental Policy Act</a> (NEPA) review process. As the lead agency for the purposes of NEPA appraisal of LNG exportation, FERC is charged with evaluating the environmental impacts of all proposed actions prior to filing for FERC authorization. NEPA <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/1502.3">requires</a> preparation of a full environmental impact statement (EIS) unless the agency determines that the proposed action will not constitute "a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment." Preparation of an EIS is an extensive process that may take months or years to complete. Should FERC determine that the environmental impacts of the proposed action are not significant or within a categorical exclusion contained within <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/1502.2">40 C.F.R. &#167; 1502.2(c)</a>, the agency is required to prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA), a much less expensive alternative to the time-consuming EIS. In its <a href="http://www.ferc.gov/EventCalendar/Files/20120416164846-CP11-72-000.pdf">review of the Sabine Pass application</a> [PDF], FERC determined that conversion of the Sabine Pass LNG export facility did not significantly affect the quality of the human environment and concluded that preparation of a full EIS was not required.</p>

<p>Entities aiming to export LNG from the US must also overcome various state regulatory hurdles. For instance, the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/chapter-33">Coastal Zone Management Act</a> (CZMA) permits FERC to deny construction approval to proposed LNG facilities if a project fails to fit within the state-mandated approved coastal management policies and plans. Also, projects must comply with state water quality standards, permitting requirements mandated by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/chapter-85">Clean Air Act</a>, and other regulated standards.</p>

<p>Environmental and economic interest groups lean heavily on these statutory provisions to raise objection to DOE and FERC permitting of LNG export. Opponents of LNG export, including energy-dependent domestic industries, argue that exportation of domestic natural gas resources could dramatically increase domestic energy prices and hinder the use of natural gas as an alternative transportation fuel. Similarly, claims are made that the domestic retention of the newly accessible US natural gas reserves could provide some measure of energy independence for the US. Opponents also suggest that the LNG export could pose a number of significant environmental risks, including increases in domestic environmental degradation borne from hydraulic fracturing, the continued release of greenhouse gases due to continued reliance on fossil fuels and increased risk of explosion at LNG facilities. In a contrasting opinion, some commentators argue that increased domestic supply of natural gas would encourage the use of natural gas as an alternative fuel to coal and oil and provide society with a bridge to cleaner renewable energy sources. </p>

<p>While the debate over significance of these environmental impacts continues, entrepreneurs and corporations are scurrying to prepare for the seemingly inevitable expansion of the global market for natural gas. Supporters of LNG exports argue that LNG export would benefit long-run US employment rates (especially in the natural gas industry and many secondary employment markets), bolster tax revenues and improve US trade relationships with many nations. Economic studies <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/128706024/Liquefied-Natural-Gas-and-the-Great-Export-Debate">estimate</a> that one export facility alone could reduce the US trade deficit by $7.1 billion per year and provide 14,000 job-years in facility operation employment. Supporters also argue that a global free market for natural gas, however imperfect it may be, is the best allocator of resources that will bring the most widespread economic benefits to consumers. </p>

<p>Despite these contentions, there is no guarantee that US LNG export at present-day will bring long-term economic fortune to the US or its corporate constituents. Here, the timeliness of US export must also be considered. When will the comparative advantage of the US in the global natural gas market peak? More importantly, when will it fall away? In March 2013, Japanese scientists were the first to successfully <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21752441">extract methane hydrates</a> from the Sea of Japan. Once these extraction techniques become commercially exploitable by various nations of the world, the trade balance in the natural gas market will turn upside down once again. Then, there will be no guarantee of any comparative advantage of the US. </p>

<p>In the sort-term, it remains to be seen whether environmental and economic challenges will stop exporters from widely offering US natural gas to the world market. Yet the ever-increasing global demand and cheapening of supply for natural gas in the US will inevitably ensure continued efforts to export LNG from the US for many years to come, despite the significant environmental threats and regulatory hurdles that stand in the way. As gas extraction and transportation technologies continue to develop and the global energy markets continue to liberalize, a day will certainly come when the powers and predictions of the natural gas market will be turned upside-down once again. Then, the US trade advantage in the natural gas market will have faded.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.arcadia.edu/abroad/default.aspx?id=28142">Roland Adjovi</a>, Academic Director of the Arcadia Center for East African Studies says that by forbidding independent political candidates, the Tanzanian Constitution violates the African Union Charter on Human and People's Rights ... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/rolandadjovi.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n June 14, 2013, the <a href="http://www.african-court.org/en/">African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights </a>delivered its judgment in the case brought by Rev. Christopher Mtikila against the government of the <a href="http://www.tanzania.go.tz/">United Republic of Tanzania</a>. The court granted three out four arguments presented by the applicant. The <a href="http://www.thecitizen.co.tz/News/Mtikila-wins--independent-candidacy--case/-/1840350/1883400/-/8vlr3tz/-/index.html">ruling</a> is quite unique not only for the core element of the case (independent candidate for national elections) but also for the order made to the respondent state to take all constitutional and legislative measures required to comply with the court decision. </p>

<p>Mtikila is a political leader in Tanzania. He founded and continues to lead the Democratic Party. Just before multiparty democracy started in Tanzania in early 1990, the ruling party named <a href="http://www.ccm.or.tz/">CCM</a> introduced a requirement in the electoral framework for any candidate to be affiliated to a political party. This was enshrined in the Constitution of the [African] Union. As a result, Mtikila could not run as an independent candidate, and started enrolling in the CCM and later in the opposition party, <a href="http://chademablog.blogspot.com/">Chadema</a>. Later on, he managed to set up his own political party. In between, he challenged the prohibition of independent candidacy before the <a href="http://www.judiciary.go.tz/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=44&Itemid=67">High Court</a>. But, after overcoming various obstacles, the Appeals Court of Tanzania in 2010 overturned the decision, stating that the issue was political and it was the responsibility of the legislative to take appropriate measures. </p>

<p>During Spring 2011, while I was teaching human rights law in Africa at the Arcadia Center in Arusha with a small group of students, we decided to improve the learning experience focusing on a concrete case. We researched at the Appeals Court of Tanzania and identified the judgment in Mtikila's case as quite interesting. We then worked on it for some weeks with the aim of drafting an application. The students' commitment was so high that we agreed to look for Mtikila and offer him our services. We got the post office box of the Democratic Party online and some email addresses. However, all email addresses failed and we printed our email and sent it to him by post mail. A week later, he called with a very enthusiastic mood. We met and he provided the details we did not have, and signed a power of attorney. We were planning to file our application early June when two local organizations, the <a href="http://www.tls.or.tz/">Tanganyika Law Society</a> (TLS) and the <a href="http://www.humanrights.or.tz/">Legal and Human Rights Center</a> (LHRC) filed a very similar application on June 5, 2011. After a meeting with Mtikila, we agreed that our arguments were more elaborate and we had a better ground for admissibility. We therefore filed a separate <a href="http://www.etudesvihode.com/files/20110610_Mtikila_Application-FINAL.pdf">application</a> [PDF] for Mtikila on June 11, 2011, and his team was composed of myself, Counsel Adeogun-Phillips (Nigeria) and Counsel Dako (Benin) with three legal assistants who were the three students dedicated to the case, namely Thompson Megan (USA), Njau Deogratias (Tanzania) and Birdi Mary (Tanzania). </p>

<p>Mtikila. submitted to the Court that:<blockquote>(i)	The requirement for any candidate to be affiliated to a political party violates the freedom of association; <br />
(ii)	The same requirement prevents him from freely participating in public affairs in his country; <br />
(iii)	The same requirement discriminates between Tanzanians who adhere to political party and those who do not, and finally<br />
(iv)	The government introducing a constitutional amendment addressing a matter being litigated in court violates the rule of law principle.</blockquote> <br />
The mainland Bar Association (TLS) and the prominent Tanzanian human rights organization (LHRC) made similar arguments except for the rule of law, but in a more concise written submission. On September 22, 2011, the court <em>motu proprio</em>, and without consulting the parties, made an order for <a href="http://www.african-court.org/en/images/documents/case/Order%20for%20Joinder%20in%20Mtikila.pdf">joinder</a> [PDF] of the two cases. In June 2012, the parties appeared before the court to make their oral submissions. Tanzania raised various preliminary objections in its written submissions, and repeated them during the public hearing. Mtikila, TLS and LHRC responded against those objections, and expressed their common interest on the core issue at stack. Parties also argued the merits of the case as per the instructions of the court.</p>

<p>On June 14, 2013, the court found that the requirement enshrined in the Constitution of Tanzania for any candidate to an election to be affiliated to a political party violates the African Charter in various provisions related to non-discrimination, to the freedom of association and to the right to participate in public affairs. The president of the court read at length the reasoning of the court referring not only to African human rights instruments but also universal instruments such as the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> and the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a>, and to regional instruments such as the <a href="http://www.hri.org/docs/ECHR50.html">European Convention on Human Rights</a> and the <a href="http://www.cidh.oas.org/basicos/english/basic3.american%20convention.htm">Inter-American Convention on Human Rights</a>. The court abundantly referred to the jurisprudence developed by various human rights organs established to enforce some of those instruments, especially to <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/d0b7f023e8d6d9898025651e004bc0eb?Opendocument">General Comment 25</a> of the Human Rights Committee as an authoritative interpretation of the ICCPR as critically argued by Mtikila (see paragraphs 21 and 22 of his application). </p>

<p>However, the court rejected the argument on the rule of law, affirming that the applicant failed to show the right violated, even though the court admitted that rule of law is a very broad concept which encompasses all human rights. In his application, Mtikila explained the complexity of the principle, but focused on the separation of power and the independence of the judiciary (see paragraphs 50-54 of the Application). Only the written judgment would help understand better the reasoning of the court. </p>

<p>As a result, the court ordered the United Republic of Tanzania, which has already embarked on a constitutional review ahead of its next general elections in 2015, "to take constitutional, legislative and all other necessary measures within a reasonable time to remedy the violations... and to inform the Court of the measures taken." In addition, the court invited Mtikila to substantiate his claims for reparation within 30 days. </p>

<p>This is the first judgment of the African Court on the merits, and it has an implication for numerous African countries where independent candidates for election are not allowed. One needs to watch closely its implications on the electoral laws in Africa, while looking forward to the judgment on reparations. </p>

		<title>True Marriage Equality in California?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.pacificjustice.org/kevin-snider---chief-counsel.html">Kevin Snider</a>, Chief Counsel for the <a href="http://www.pacificjustice.org/">Pacific Justice Institute</a>, reacts to the landmark Supreme Court decision striking down the proponents of Proposition 8 in <em>Hollingsworth v. Perry</em>...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/kevinsnider.jpg" width="120" height="200" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>C</strong></font>alifornians have determined on <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-2008election-prop8prop22,0,333635.htmlstory">two occasions</a> that it is in the best interest of society to leave marriage as a union between a man and woman. Based on the experience of more than five thousand years of recorded human history, the collective wisdom of the voters is not particularly remarkable. Those who engage in procreative activities should be encouraged, if not required, to undertake the profound responsibility of raising those that they may create. Hence, this male and female unit is set apart by the community for special recognition, benefits, and burdens.  In contrast, a couple of the same-sex does not, either intentionally or unintentionally, create children as a result of their sexual activities. Thus, they are not a similarly situated unit. The majority of Californians and citizens from thirty-two other states understand that. </p>

                <p>But not everyone gets it. A <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/hollingsworth-v-perry/">lawsuit</a> was brought by two same-sex couples challenging <a href="http://www.smartvoter.org/2008/11/04/ca/state/prop/8/">Proposition 8</a> which codified the traditional definition of marriage and, as a result, violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection">Equal Protection Clause</a> of the 14th Amendment. Their lead attorneys, David Boies and Ted Olson, went to federal court with the grand design of mandating homosexual marriage across the country. Olson, who was an important early figure in the Federalist Society and thus ostensibly one who ascribes to original intent, apparently is under the impression that gay marriage was what the ratifiers of the 1868 amendment had in mind. <br />
                    <br />
                    As we know now, none of this matters because the high court <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">chose not</a> to strike down the Marriage Amendment. Instead, they contented themselves with emasculating the voters. The Court found no standing by the proponents to defend the law in federal court. Hence, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit's <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11174451370677368587">opinion</a>, which found Proposition 8 unconstitutional, is now "vacated, and the case remanded with instructions to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction." <br />
                    <br />
                    But what does that mean?  California's Governor, Jerry Brown, asserts that the ruling of the San Francisco district court judge, Hon. Vaughn Walker, will be reinstated. Walker, whom the <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/editorials/article/Gay-judge-has-proven-record-of-impartiality-3200496.php">San Francisco Chronicle</a> outed as gay, enjoined the state officials named as defendants from enforcing Proposition 8.  As such, Brown has <a href="http://blogs.sacbee.com/capitolalertlatest/2013/06/jerry-brown-tells-california-counties-to-issue-gay-marriage-licenses.html">ordered</a> county clerks from the borders of Mexico to Oregon to issue marriage licenses as soon as the Ninth Circuit lifts its stay. That might be premature. Judge Walker's decision may be corralled to just the two same-sex couples who brought suit rather than to all of California. The lack of clarity on this issue will sow the seeds for the next lawsuit.   </p>

                <p>All of this could have been avoided had Governors Arnold Schwarzenegger and Brown taken the procedural steps to file an appeal in this case. Instead, they have cunningly robbed the citizens of their day in court. The calculated choice by Schwarzenegger and Brown to deprive Californians of a fair opportunity to have their cause heard by the judiciary has disenfranchised millions of people. In view of that, the Supreme Court's decision lacks legitimacy.  </p>

                <p>As a result of the Court's decision, a governor can engage in what amounts to a constructive veto of any state law by not showing up in federal court when it is challenged. This amounts to a breathtaking judicially created transfer of power from the people to governor's mansions.  </p>

                <p>So as the members of the Supreme Court pushed this opinion out the door so they can leave for vacation a day early, they leave California in a constitutional crisis. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.hrw.org/bios/eric-goldstein">Eric Goldstein</a> of Human Rights Watch discusses the recent developments and ongoing pitfalls of the Moroccan judicial system<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/ericgoldstein.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he Moroccan police arrested Taki Machdoufi in El-Ayoun, Western Sahara, in 2010, and interrogated him over five days about fatal clashes that had just taken place between Sahrawi protesters and the police. Each time the Sahrawi activist denied any role in the violence, he says, two agents struck his neck and head. "Say whatever you want," they allegedly told him. "We're going to write your statement as we want."</p>

                <p>When finished with their questioning, the police presented Machdoufi with a statement to sign. He asked to read it. Instead, one of the officers walked behind him and grabbed his hand, which was cuffed behind his back, pressed his finger on an inkpad and then onto the statement, Machdoufi recalls. </p>

                <p>Like his co-defendants, Machdoufi saw no lawyer while in police custody. Before the court, he and the others r<a href="http://www.hrw.org/node/116322/section/7">epudiated their statements</a>; most said the police had tortured them. But the court did not order any medical exams to check their claims of abuse, and convicted all 25 of them for attacking the police. The only evidence was their contested confessions. Machdoufi is now free after two years in prison; his co-defendants are serving terms of up to 30 years.</p>

                <p>For nearly two decades, Morocco has followed a path of gradual reform with increasing space for criticism and protest. Some of the worst abuses by the security services under the late <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/402491.stm">King Hassan II</a>, such as forced disappearances, have ceased. A <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/2005/11/27/moroccos-truth-commission-0">truth commission</a> appointed by his son, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14121440">King Mohammed VI</a>, enabled the country to acknowledge past violations and compensate victims, although none of those responsible for the crimes were brought to justice.</p>

                <p>However, the judiciary has been a laggard in the reform process. A partially reformed state, as it eases up on naked force as a tool of repression, may rely more on a subservient judiciary to punish opponents who go too far. <br />
                    Conscious of public frustration with Morocco's court system, Mohammed VI made its overhaul the theme of an <a href="http://mohamed6.canalblog.com/archives/2009/08/21/14805632.html">address</a> to the nation in 2009. The 2011 <a href="http://www.ancl-radc.org.za/sites/default/files/morocco_eng.pdf">Constitution</a> [PDF] features many articles that could enhance judicial independence. A <a href="http://www.maghrebinfo.fr/maroc/actualites/713-maroc-installation-de-la-haute-instance-du-dialogue-national-le-roi-pose-le-premier-acte-de-la-reforme-de-la-justice.html">commission</a> [French] appointed by the king is expected shortly to unveil a blueprint for judicial reform in light of the new constitution.</p>

                <p>The courts can be reformed in countless ways but fair trials are possible only when the judiciary asserts its oversight over the police and tempers its readiness to accept contested statements into evidence.<br />
                    Human Rights Watch monitored several politically sensitive trials involving Sahrawi activists, protesters, and people accused of plotting terrorism. We interviewed dozens of Moroccan lawyers about defending clients in politically sensitive cases. The conclusion was clear: once the police obtained a signed statement &#8212; no matter how they got it, how improbable the wording, or how slim the other evidence in the file &#8212; the defendant was on a fast track to "guilty." </p>

                <p>"It is as if the trial has already taken place at the police station," one lawyer told us. "Almost nothing you can do at trial can undo your statement."</p>

                <p>Moroccan law offers defendants some strong protections by criminalizing torture and obliging judges to exclude any evidence obtained through "violence or coercion." But other laws need reform. The law granting defendants in initial custody the right to contact a lawyer should be improved to ensure prompter, face-to-face access. Few of the defendants in the cases we examined saw a lawyer until after the police had finished their interrogation and presented them with their statement for signature.</p>

                <p>Another problem is that the <a href="http://www.menafatf.org/images/UploadFiles/Moroccan_AMLCFT_system_law_13_10.pdf">Code of Penal Procedure</a> [PDF] instructs the court to consider statements prepared by the police trustworthy unless there is evidence to the contrary. Legislators should amend this article, which applies only to offenses carrying a sentence of five years or less of prison, to require the court to treat a police statement like any other piece of evidence, rather than placing the burden on the defendant to disprove it.</p>

                <p>Reforming the judiciary depends not only on revising laws but also on training and instructing judges to respond diligently to claims of police abuse. Defendants may be telling the truth when they say they were tortured, threatened, or tricked into signing false statements. </p>

                <p>A judge should question a defendant who makes these claims about his experience in police detention, and, where warranted, order an impartial medical examination and summon the police officer who took the statement. The need to investigate is even more acute when the case hangs on a contested statement alone, with no prosecution witnesses or forensic evidence.</p>

                <p>It is rarely easy for a judge to determine what really happened when the defendant was alone with the police. But <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/training8Rev1en.pdf">international norms</a> [PDF] provide guidance on how to question alleged torture victims to assess their credibility, even in the absence of visible wounds. Judges need to fulfill their legal duty to exclude evidence extracted through "violence or coercion."</p>

                <p>By taking this duty seriously, judges will strike a blow not only for fair trials but also against torture and ill-treatment, by signaling to the police that they must collect evidence through licit means &#8212; or risk seeing the court toss it out.</p>

		<title>The Supreme Court Rules There Is No One Left Standing To Appeal Prop. 8</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.lls.edu/aboutus/facultyadministration/faculty/facultylistl-r/levinsonjessica/">Jessica Levinson</a> of Loyola Law School, Los Angeles, examines the US Supreme Court's recent decision in <em>Hollingsworth v. Perry</em>...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/jessicalevinson.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n a 5-4 <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-144_8ok0.pdf">opinion</a> written by Chief Justice John Roberts, the US Supreme Court has ruled that there is simply no one left standing to appeal California's infamous 2008 ballot initiative, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=proposition+8">Proposition 8</a>. Prop 8, as the entire world now knows, amended the <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/const-toc.html">California State Constitution</a> to define marriage as between a man and a woman to the exclusion of <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriages</a>. </p>

<p>In the much-anticipated case, <em>Hollingsworth v. Perry</em>, the Court avoided the larger, and more politically charged issue potentially presented by the case: whether the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Equal Protection Clause</a> of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits California from defining marriage as between a man and a woman. This question raises the issues of whether gays and lesbians are members of a so-called "suspect class" and whether there is a "fundamental" right to marry. </p>

<p>Chief Justice Roberts ruled on narrower grounds, finding that proponents of ballot initiatives lack the "standing" under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii">Article III, &#168; 2</a> of the Constitution. Standing, the Court reiterated, is necessary to appeal a case in federal court. </p>

<p><strong>How did we get here?</strong></p>

<p>Back in 2009, two same-sex couples residing in Los Angeles and Alameda counties sued, among others, then-Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and then-Attorney General, current Governor, Jerry Brown in federal court, along with other state and local officials, contending that Prop 8 violated the US Constitution. Schwarzenegger, Brown, and the other government officials opted not to defend the suit, and former District Court Judge Vaughn Walker <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=proposition+8">allowed</a> petitioners, the official ballot measure proponents, to intervene and defend the measure. </p>

<p>In a broad ruling, Judge Walker concluded that Prop 8 violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">Due Process</a> and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Schwarzenegger and Brown both opted not to appeal the ruling. <br />
Proponents of Prop 8, however, sought to appeal Judge Walker's decision to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. But just because Judge Walker ruled that petitioners could intervene in the suit did not mean that they had standing to appeal. </p>

<p>The Ninth Circuit temporarily punted the issue, asking the California Supreme Court whether, under state law, proponents of ballot initiatives have standing to defend and appeal those initiatives in court. The California Supreme Court answered that question in the affirmative, and so the case went back to the Ninth Circuit.</p>

<p>The Ninth Circuit upheld Judge Walker's decision, but on somewhat narrower grounds. In a 2-1 ruling, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit found that Prop 8 was invalid because it took away rights previously granted under the California State Constitution. Prior to the passage of Prop 8, the California Supreme Court ruled that marriage is a fundamental right under the California State Constitution.</p>

<p><strong>What is standing? </strong></p>

<p>Essentially the doctrine of "standing" refers to a party's ability to demonstrate an injury that will be remedied by a favorable resolution of the case. In the words of the Court today, standing requires that parties have "suffered a concrete and particularized injury that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct, and is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision." The Court then expanded its explanation by stating that parties "must seek a remedy for a personal and tangible harm."</p>

<p>In the key portion of today's decision, Chief Justice Roberts found that petitioners lacked a "direct stake" in the outcome of their appeal to the Ninth Circuit. Roberts concluded that "[t]heir only interest in having the District Court order reversed was to vindicate the constitutional validity of a generally applicable California law." And that, as we now know for certain, is not enough.</p>

<p>In what may be the money quote in Roberts' opinion, he wrote, "[w]e have never before upheld the standing of a private party to defend the constitutionality of a state statute when state officials have chosen not to. We decline to do so for the first time here." With this quote, Roberts frames this decision as one that was all but a fait accompli &#8212; were the Court to rule the other way, it would go against the weight of history.</p>

<p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p>

<p>Because the Court concluded that ballot initiative proponents lack the standing necessary to appeal the decision by the US District Court, that decision becomes the final word on the constitutionality of gay marriage in that jurisdiction. Here is the final line from the opinion: "[b]ecause petitioners have not satisfied their burden to demonstrate standing to appeal the judgment of the District Court, the Ninth Circuit was without jurisdiction to consider the appeal. The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded with instructions to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction."</p>

<p>Put another way, Judge Vaughn Walker, you get the final word, at least for now.</p>

<p><strong>What does this mean for ballot initiatives?</strong> </p>

<p>This ruling has important implications for jurisdictions that have the ballot initiative process. It appears that this decision means that if a ballot initiative is successfully challenged in court and the state or local officials opt not to appeal that ruling, there could be no one left standing to appeal that decision. For lack of anyone left standing, the ruling becomes final. Critics of the Supreme Court's decision will argue that one district court judge overturned a ballot initiative passed by a majority of the voters. </p>

<p>It is important to remember, however, that the judiciary stands as an important check against majoritarian over-reaching. One of the problems with direct democracy is that it can lead to tyranny of the majority. Judges should check that power, just as one did here.</p>

<p><strong>What does the ruling mean for the legality of gay marriages? </strong></p>

<p>By avoiding the larger issue presented by this case the Court is allowing time for the legality of same sex marriage to continue to play out through the legislative process in states throughout the nation.</p>

<p>One can view the Court's decision as a victory for both sides. At least if one's definition of "victory" is "first do no harm." Both proponents and opponents of same sex marriage have avoided a potentially damaging decision on Equal Protection grounds.</p>

<p>The arc of history seems pointed quite firmly in favor of proponents of same sex marriage. For now we will watch this issue play out in state legislative houses throughout the nation</p>

		<title>Knowing the Numbers: How Bad Sex-Offender Data Could Cause More Harm</title>

                <p>It is astounding that in this age of widespread information and access to research, the Court is relying on inaccurate statistics. The commonly repeated statistic of 100,000 missing sex offenders is often erroneously attributed to the <a href="http://www.missingkids.com/">National Center for Missing and Exploited Children</a> or the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/marshals/">US Marshals Service</a>, both of which continue to proclaim on their websites that 100,000 sex offenders are missing &#8212; despite published evidence to the contrary. This misinformation is frequently included in congressional testimony and in media reports, influencing social policy, public opinion and funding allocations.</p>

                <p>A <a href="http://cjp.sagepub.com/content/23/3/375">study</a> published in 2012 disputed the claims that 100,000 registered sex offenders in the US are "missing." The study, conducted by <a href="http://www.uml.edu/">University of Massachusetts Lowell</a> criminologist <a href="http://www.uml.edu/FAHSS/Criminal-Justice/faculty/Harris-Andrew.aspx">Andrew Harris</a> and myself, was published in the scientific journal <a href="http://cjp.sagepub.com/">Criminal Justice Policy Review</a>. It analyzed data downloaded directly from online sex offender registries in 2010 and also surveyed states' registry managers.</p>

                <p>The study utilized a sample of more than 445,000 registered sex offenders listed on public registries. Harris and I were able to identify sex offenders designated by states to be transient, homeless, absconded, non-compliant or whose address or whereabouts were otherwise unknown. Nationwide, about 2.4 percent were officially listed as absconded, unable to be located or non-compliant with registration mandates. When including those designated as homeless or transient, the rate grew to slightly over four percent.</p>

                <p>Using the more liberal four percent figure to estimate the number of sex offenders living in the community whose whereabouts could not be verified, the count was calculated to be somewhere between 23,000 and 30,000. The study emphasized that these numbers included technical non-compliance as well as true absconding. Ultimately, no evidence was found to support the frequently repeated statistic that 100,000 (or about fourteen percent) of the nation's sex offenders are missing or unaccounted for.</p>

                <p>Harris and I also reported on data obtained in 2010 via e-mail and telephone surveys of state registry managers. Rates of registration non-compliance among registrants living in the community varied greatly, ranging from about one percent in some states (e.g., Florida, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, North Dakota, Vermont and West Virginia) to approximately thirteen percent in others (California, Hawaii and Oklahoma). Nationally, the median rate of non-compliance is about 2.7 percent. The variation in how state systems defined and categorized offenders made it difficult to estimate exactly how many sex offenders have truly gone missing.</p>

                <p>Policymakers and courts should make decisions armed with current, published, peer-reviewed research utilizing appropriate methodologies. Those providing testimony (especially federally funded agencies) should be expected to inform legislative bodies, courts and media with current and credible data. To do otherwise breaches the public trust.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Brice Biggins, <a href="http://www.law.gmu.edu">George Mason University School of Law</a> Class of 2014, discusses the rarity of treason charges in the US and argues that Edward Snowden should be charged with violating the Espionage Act of 1917...<br />
<hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="BriceBiggins.jpg" src="/dateline/BriceBiggins.jpg" width="120" height="200" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>A</strong></font>fter leaking the existence of the National Security Agency's (NSA) <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/prismfactsheet0608.pdf">PRISM program</a> [PDF] and the collection of communications metadata through the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-lawmakers-urge-review-of-government-surveillance-activities.php">Edward Snowden</a> has been called many things. Speaker of the House <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/transcript-exclusive-interview-house-speaker-john-boehner-nsa/story?id=19370792#.UbcYyOuhC5K">John Boehner</a> (R-OH) and others have called him a traitor. Wikileaks' <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/internet/7909793/Profile-Wikileaks-founder-Julian-Assange.html">Julian Assange</a> and some members of the press have called him a hero. Rushing to label someone a hero does a great injustice to those whose actions have stood the test of time beyond the fleeting opinions of the instant. Similarly, calling an unconvicted man a traitor does great violence to the presumption of innocence and militates against the intent of the founders of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/">US Constitution</a>. Instead, it is better to call Snowden what he is; he is a fugitive from justice, charged with violating the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-37">Espionage Act of 1917</a>.</p>

<p>While it would be easy to dismiss Boehner's remark as a misnomer, a more informative path would be to ask in a world of NSA leakers and domestic terrorists, why the crime of treason is not invoked more often. Black's Law Dictionary defines the word traitor as "a person who commits treason against his or her country." The crime of treason has the distinction of being the only criminal offense defined within the US Constitution. <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii#section3">Article III, Section 3</a> of the US Constitution defines treason as "levying War against [the United States], or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort." Section 3 also states that a treason conviction requires either the testimony of two witnesses or confession by the accused in open court. Although the evidentiary requirements may not have been so difficult in the past, the growing integration of computers and the continual decline in interpersonal interactions within modern society have made satisfying the witness requirement considerably more difficult.</p>

<p>Irrespective of the evidentiary requirements, historically <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/treason.aspx">indictments for treason</a> have been a rarity, numbering somewhere below 40, with convictions even more rare. Of those convicted of treason, most have actively aided an enemy engaged in hostilities with the US. Some of the better known individuals convicted of treason include Benedict Arnold, who sold military intelligence to the British, Mildred Gillars, better known as Axis Sally, who participated in the Nazi's radio propaganda campaigns aimed at demoralizing American troops, and Herbert Hans Haupt, who was apprehended during a failed sabotage mission on American soil for the Abwehr, a Nazi military intelligence organization.  </p>

<p>The rarity of treason charges is made even more clear in light of the fact that since <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14270191881160802490">Kawakita v. United States</a>, where the US Supreme Court reviewed the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit's treason conviction against Tomoya Kawakita for his involvement in torturing American prisoners of war in Japan during World War II, there has been only one treason indictment. In 2006, based on his giving direct aid and participating in the actions of Al Qaeda, a federal grand jury indicted Adam Yahiye Gadahn for treason, marking the first treason indictment since <em>Kawakita</em>. With the exception of Benedict Arnold, most criminals convicted of treason have not been involved in espionage. It is worth noting that between the time of Kawakita's crimes and 2006, the judicial landscape was dramatically changed by the Cold War and the increased priority and deference given to secrecy and national security interests.</p>

<p>While crimes that would technically constitute treason are unlikely to disappear, in many instances they now fall under the Espionage Act of 1917, codified under 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 792-99. The Espionage Act differs from treason in three key ways. First, rather than a broad description the act makes provisions for specific activities such as harboring or concealing persons, disclosure of classified information, and gathering or delivering defense information to aid foreign governments. Second, while many if not all of the charges under the espionage act could potentially fall under the Article III definition of treason, the act does not use the word "enemies," in its provisions, instead referring to "foreign governments," or "unauthorized persons." This textual difference prevents the act from conflicting with the constitutionally defined crime of treason and allows <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/798">18 U.S.C. &#167; 798 </a>to punish individuals and groups for disclosing classified information without having to tread into the delicate and highly restrictive realm of treason charges. Additionally, by pursuing charges under the Espionage Act, the government can in some ways limit the defense from challenging the charges on constitutional grounds. </p>

<p>The final and most significant difference between the Espionage Act and treason is that the act does not require two witnesses to the crime or confession in open court. As a practical matter, the requisite burden of proof for treason, two witnesses to the same overt act or confession by the accused in open court, are now more than ever difficult to satisfy. In the case of Edward Snowden or those charged with committing similar offenses, the two-witness requirement has become progressively more problematic. Unlike the Cold War exploits of Oleg Penkovsky or Christopher Boyce, modern espionage tends to be a faceless and solitary endeavor, often involving only an isolated individual and a computer network. Because Snowden's employment and alleged espionage activities both involved using a computer, even if someone had seen him copying the files, they probably would not have realized what they were witnessing without viewing his screen at the same time he was using it. </p>

<p>Another feature of the modern legal landscape worth noting is the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18a/usc_sup_05_18_10_sq3.html">Classified Information Procedures Act</a> (CIPA), codified under 18 U.S.C. App. I, &#167;&#167; 1-16. CIPA was enacted in 1980, at the height of the Cold War, to help balance the defendant's rights under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment">Sixth Amendment</a> and the government's need to control the flow of classified information during criminal trials. Of the provisions under CIPA, sections 3-6 are of particular importance. <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18a/usc_sec_18a_02000003----000-.html">18 U.S.C. &#167; 3</a> allows the government to issue protective orders that bar the disclosure of any classified information an order is applied to. <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18a/usc_sec_18a_02000004----000-.html">18 U.S.C. &#167; 4</a> allows the court to authorize the government "upon a sufficient showing" to remove classified items from the documents discoverable by the defendant under the standard <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp">Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure</a>. In a similar vein, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18a/usc_sec_18a_02000006----000-.html">18 U.S.C. &#167; 6(c)</a> allows the government to substitute either a summary of the document or a list of the relevant facts for the original classified material. </p>

<p>Finally <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18a/usc_sec_18a_02000005----000-.html">18 U.S.C. &#167; 5</a> requires that defendants who expect to disclose or cause the disclosure of classified information during the course of their trial notify the attorney for the US at least 30 days prior to trial unless otherwise specified. The primary purpose for this requirement is to prevent the defendant from manipulating the proceedings by threatening to reveal classified information, a practice known as graymail. Because CIPA requires that the defense disclose any potential classified information that might come into play to the prosecution, the defense is prevented from taking advantage of the trial to leak further secrets. </p>

<p>Another effect of this provision is that it potentially bars confessions outside of a simple guilty plea, essentially placing an additional restriction on the charge of treason. CIPA also enables the government to restrict what witnesses may testify about. A related judicial doctrine, the so called silent witness rule, allows the court to order the use of a code-words listed on a code-key, which is only available to the trial participants and not the public, to refer to documents, names, or other classified information during the trial.</p>

<p>The end result of CIPA and the silent witness rule is that the judicial focus has shifted from open and public judicial proceedings for crimes that previously may have been considered treason, to a more closed approach. This shift reflects both the changes in society that make producing witnesses more difficult and the government's explicit interest in information control for crimes relating to espionage. Given this, is Edward Snowden a traitor? If he is, the government seems disinclined to provide the courts with the evidence to prove it, instead casting him into the motley crew of today's spies.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.alliancealert.org/2010/03/01/about-david-hacker/">David J. Hacker</a> of the <a href="http://www.alliancedefendingfreedom.org/">Alliance Defending Freedom</a> argues that the US Supreme Court's decision in <em>Nassar</em> protects the mixed-motive framework provided for First Amendment retaliation claims...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/davidhacker.jpg" width="120" height="200" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n June, the US Supreme Court decided <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-484_o759.pdf">University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar</a> [PDF], holding 5-4 that plaintiffs must prove <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm">Title VII</a> retaliation claims with <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/but-for_test">but-for causation</a>. Ho-hum, right? Well, it turns out the Court's opinion provides an important comparison between retaliation claims brought under Title VII and those of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983">42 USC &#167; 1983</a>. The Court's opinion indicates that &#167; 1983 claims, which protect against retaliation undertaken in response to the exercise of constitutional rights, are not subject to but-for causation, but remain governed by "mixed-motive" causation. This difference ensures robust protection of academic freedom and free speech for students and faculty and is essential to preservation of the "marketplace of ideas" on campus. </p>

                <p>Students and faculty are regularly censored on today's public school and university campuses. Administrators empowered by explicit or implicit campus speech codes regularly retaliate against students and faculty who advocate views in conflict with campus orthodoxy. Savvy administrators often cloak their retaliatory actions in seemingly benign critiques of educational or professional incompetence. As a result, students and faculty who look for justice in the courts often resort to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> retaliation claims brought under &#167; 1983 in which they need show only that their speech was a "substantial" or "motivating" factor for the punishment. <em>Nassar's</em> adoption of a but-for standard for Title VII retaliation claims will not alter the mixed-motive framework for First Amendment retaliation claims, and courts should avoid the unjustified temptation to do so.</p>

                <p>The jurisprudential background leading up to <em>Nassar</em> is complicated, but here it is in a nutshell: In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=price+waterhouse+v+hopkins&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=780752418377134939&scilh=0">Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</a>, a plurality of the Court adopted the mixed-motive framework for Title VII status-based discrimination claims. Congress later codified this standard into Title VII, but did not include it for Title VII retaliation claims, which are governed by a different section of the statute than status-based discrimination claims. Thus, when presented with the question of the proper causation standard for Title VII retaliation, the <em>Nassar</em> Court concluded, although not without strong dissent, that the plain language and statutory history of the retaliation section show Congress intended but-for causation to be the standard.</p>

                <p>Long before <em>Nassar</em> and <em>Price Waterhouse</em>, the mixed-motive standard was used to provide vigilant protection to constitutional and civil rights. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Mt.+Healthy+City+School+District+Board+of+Education+v.+Doyle&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=6018754848095127298&scilh=0">Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle</a>, the Court adopted the mixed-motive framework in First Amendment retaliation cases. There a public school declined to rehire a teacher after he told a disc jockey about a new school dress code. The teacher previously had several disciplinary problems: run-ins with co-workers, profane descriptions of students, and obscene gestures while at school. The school justified its rehire denial by citing the teacher's "notable lack of tact in handling professional matters," particularly, the radio station incident and the obscene gestures. The Court reasoned the burden was on the teacher to show that his conduct was constitutionally protected and that the conduct was a "motivating factor" for the schools decision not to rehire him.</p>

                <p>For decades, <em>Mt. Healthy's</em> mixed-motive framework has provided crucial constitutional protection for students and faculty at public universities who dissent from the dominant campus orthodoxy. As the Third Circuit said in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=DeJohn+v.+Temple+University&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=11228923807186121497&scilh=0">DeJohn v. Temple University</a>, "free speech is of critical importance" on public university and college campuses throughout this country "because it is the lifeblood of academic freedom."</p>

                <p>Broad protections for student and faculty speech are supported by a mixed-motive framework, which uncovers retaliatory conduct threatening to fundamental rights. Often, the evidence surrounding punishment of a student on campus or a faculty member in the workplace contains several justifications for the adverse action. In the case of a professor, a college may deny her tenure because of a less than preferred number of publications and the viewpoints she expresses in existing publications. Rarely is any decision made for one reason alone.</p>

                <p>During the congressional debates on the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/civil_rights_act_of_1964">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a>, <a href="http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=c000220">Clifford P. Case</a> famously stated: "If anyone ever had an action that was motivated by a single cause, he is a different kind of animal from any I know of." Senator Case was responding to Senator <a href="http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=M000332">John McClellan's</a> amendment to the bill that would have required Title VII plaintiffs to prove an adverse employment decision was "solely because of" an impermissible motive, such as race or religion. In the end, Case's quip and underlying theory of civil rights jurisprudence carried the day, at least for Title VII status-based discrimination and First Amendment retaliation claims.</p>

                <p>As <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/justices/oconnor.bio.html">Justice O'Connor</a> said in concurrence in <em>Price Waterhouse</em>: "[T]he [but-for] test demands the impossible. It challenges the imagination of the trier to probe into a purely fanciful and unknowable state of affairs. He is invited to make an estimate concerning facts that concededly never existed."</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, some lower courts have interpreted <em>Price Waterhouse</em> and later cases as giving mixed messages on the proper causation standard for civil rights retaliation. Thus, at least one federal appellate court has applied but-for causation to First Amendment retaliation claims brought under &#167; 1983. The Court's decision in <em>Nassar</em>, however, shows clearly that the exacting statutory language and congressional intent contained in Title VII do not translate into binding or even persuasive reasoning for altering the mixed-motive framework provided for First Amendment retaliation claims.</p>

                <p>Academic freedom and campus free speech depend on opportunities for students and faculty to challenge the entrenched orthodoxy. Too often public schools and universities censor and retaliate against dissenters for their speech and cloak those adverse actions in seemingly benign and multivariable justifications. A but-for standard would facilitate punishment of disfavored speakers and thus imperils the marketplace of ideas. <em>Nassar</em> indicates that the mixed-motive framework lives on and will continue to provide critical protections for civil and constitutional liberties on campus.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.lclark.edu/faculty/tung_yin/">Tung Yin</a> of the Lewis &#38; Clark Law School says that the key issue in assessing the espionage charge against Edward Snowden is whether his disclosure of the gathering of call data harmed the US or helped a foreign nation...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/tungyin.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>S</strong></font>everal weeks ago, <em>The Guardian</em>'s Glenn Greenwald broke a <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-citizen-charged-with-espionage-over-nsa-leaks.php">story</a> that the National Security Agency (NSA) has been gathering Verizon telephone records, including those of US customers, on a daily basis pursuant to a secret order by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC). Along with Greenwald's story, <em>The Guardian</em> published the "top secret" FISC order, which had been provided by an unnamed source. This was followed by additional revelations of secret NSA surveillance programs covering web searches, email traffic, and other Internet traffic. Shortly thereafter, the source of the classified information revealed himself to be Edward Snowden, an employee of Booz Allen Hamilton, a consulting company contracted to provide IT services for the NSA.</p>

<p>On June 14, FBI Special Agent John Kralik filed a criminal complaint against Snowden, alleging violations of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/641">18 U.S.C. &#168; 641</a> (theft of government property), <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/793">18 U.S.C. &#168; 793(d)</a> (unauthorized communication of national defense information), and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/798">18 U.S.C. &#168; 798(a)(3)</a> (willful communication of classified communications intelligence information to an unauthorized person). The latter two charges are part of Title 18, Chapter 37, which is labeled "Espionage and Censorship."</p>

<p>Since Snowden has publicly admitted to being the source of the classified information obtained by <em>The Guardian</em>, the essential facts are not in dispute. Snowden has been called a "hero" by some and a "traitor" by others. Some Snowden supporters have argued that the US Department of Justice (DOJ) must consider the American public to be the enemy, as Snowden's goal was to expose the NSA surveillance program so that Americans would know that their own government was spying on them. While there is no doubt some rhetorical force to this argument, it finds little support in the actual statutory language of section 793 and none in that of section 798.</p>

<p>Section 793(d) states in relevant part: <blockquote>Whoever, lawfully having . . . access to [or] control over . . . any document or information relating to the national defense which information the possessor has reason to believe could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation, willfully communicates . . . the same to any person not entitled to receive it . . . [s]hall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both. . . .</blockquote><br />
Section 798(a)(3) states in relevant part:<blockquote>Whoever knowingly and willfully communicates . . . to an unauthorized person any classified information . . . concerning the communication intelligence activities of the US or any foreign government . . . shall be fined under this title or imprisoned . . .</blockquote></p>

<p>To begin with, it seems undisputed that Glenn Greenwald is "an unauthorized person" "not entitled to receive" classified information, and that the existence of the Verizon FISA order, PRISM, and other surveillance programs concerning "communication intelligence activities." That term is statutorily defined as "all procedures and methods used in the interception of communications and the obtaining of information from such communications by other than the intended recipients," which unquestionably covers the NSA's activities.</p>

<p>Thus, Snowden's defense to section 793 and 798 charges must focus on the <em>mens rea</em> elements. But section 798(a)(3) is a particularly hostile battlefield for him. The government need not prove that the defendant disclosed the classified information to an "enemy;" all it needs to do is to prove that the defendant knew and intended to disclose the classified information to some unauthorized person. On that, Snowden has already admitted as much in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/09/edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower-surveillance?CMP=twt_gu">written statements</a> to <em>The Guardian</em>: "My sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them."</p>

<p>Under section 793(d), the government must prove a slightly more complex mental state: that the defendant disclosed the "national defense" information with "reason to believe [it] could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation." Based on his public statements, one could anticipate that Snowden will argue that he merely intended to inform the American public about allegedly unlawful government activity. The problem for Snowden is that even if his motives were pure, section 793(d) looks at the effects of the information disclosure, not the leaker's motivation. For example, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7270320357784472945">United States v. Morison</a>, a district court agreed with the government interpretation of section 793(d) that the statute is violated when a defendant "willfully transmits photographs relating to the national defense to someone who is known by the defendant not to be entitled to receive it ... no matter how laudable his motives."</p>

<p>So the key issue is whether disclosure of the gathering of Verizon call data and PRISM harmed the US or helped any foreign nation. According to unnamed <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/06/26/virtually-every-terrorist-group-in-the-world-shifting-tactics-in-wake-of-nsa-leaks-u-s-officials/">US intelligence officials</a>, it has: "members of virtually every terrorist group, including core al-Qaeda, are attempting to change how they communicated, based on what they are reading in the media, to hide from US surveillance." If true, this is hardly an unforeseeable outcome, as there are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/20/politics/20fact.html?_r=1&">reports</a> that Osama bin Laden stopped using his satellite phone after a newspaper printed a leaked tip that the NSA was tracking that phone.</p>

<p>No analysis of Snowden's potential legal liability can ignore the cases of Daniel Ellsberg, who delivered the secret Pentagon Papers to the <em>New York Times</em> and the <em>Washington Post</em> at the height of the Vietnam War, and Private Bradley Manning, who <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/us-soldier-formally-charged-for-leaking-information-to-wikileaks.php">gave</a> WikiLeaks classified videos of military attacks, a quarter million diplomatic cables, and a half million Army reports concerning Iraq and Afghanistan. Given Ellsberg's pivotal role in the chain of events that would culminate in the US Supreme Court's landmark freedom of the press case, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17571244799664973711">New York Times Co. v. United States </a> (<em>Pentagon Papers Case</em>), and his stature as perhaps the preeminent American whistleblower, his public lauding of Snowden carries significant moral weight.</p>

<p>Yet, one must remember that Ellsberg surrendered himself to federal authorities (unlike Snowden, who, at present is reportedly hiding in Russia while seeking asylum in South America) and stood trial on espionage and theft of government property charges; he was not convicted because the district court dismissed the charges due to government misconduct. As for Manning, he too is being prosecuted in a court-martial presently on military charges, several of which are based on the by-now-familiar sections 641 and 793; earlier, he <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/wikileaks-defendant-pleads-guilty-to-lesser-charges.php">pleaded guilty</a> to 10 of the 22 charges against him (mostly related to misuse of classified government information).</p>

<p>To be sure, the government may be tempted to overstate the harm from disclosure of classified information (not to mention, to over-classify in the first place). In the <em>Pentagon Papers</em> case, for example, the government argued that it would suffer irreparable harm from the continued publication of the Vietnam War study, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/04/13/reviews/papers-injunction.html?_r=1&oref=slogin">because</a> "serious injuries are being inflicted on our foreign relations, to the benefit of other nations opposed to our foreign relations, to the benefit of other nations opposed to our form of government." Yet, years later, upon seeing the entire document for the first time, President Nixon's then-Solicitor General <a href="http://www.airforcemag.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2007/February%202007/0207pentagon.aspx">said</a> there was no "trace of a threat to the national security" from what had been published. It may also be the case with Snowden's disclosures. But if nothing else, Snowden has given away information about the intelligence gathering capabilities of the government. Indeed, Snowden's subsequent <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1266875/exclusive-us-hacked-pacnet-asia-pacific-fibre-optic-network-operator">disclosure</a> to the <em>South China Morning Post</em> that "hundreds of computers in Hong Kong and mainland China [have] been targeted by the NSA over a four-year period," even providing specific "dates, domain names, Internet protocol numbers and other operational details," seems to fall squarely within the scope of the Espionage Act.</p>

<p>It is, of course, far from certain that Snowden's story will end in convictions and a lengthy prison sentence. He might never stand trial if he disappears, if he is granted asylum by another country, or if he escapes to a non-extradition nation. He might prevail at trial, particularly if he were to draw a jury sympathetic to his asserted motivation of exposing government wrongdoing. But based on what he has already admitted in his interviews with <em>The Guardian</em>, Snowden's conduct does appear to describe violations of 18 U.S.C. &#168;&#168; 793 and 798.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Andrea Miller, <a href="http://www.law.umn.edu/">University of Minnesota Law School</a> Class of 2015, explains how Judge Korman's decision in <em>Tummino v. Hamburg</em> creates solid policy and legal precedent...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="AndreaMiller.jpg" src="/dateline/AndreaMiller.jpg" width="120" height="200" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>U</strong></font>S District Judge Edward Korman recently brought some much-needed closure to a 12-year legal debate over the <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/federal-judge-rules-emergency-contraceptive-is-for-all-ages.php">regulatory status of emergency contraception</a> (EC or what many call the "morning after" pill). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has spent those 12 years trying to avoid transferring EC from prescription-only to over-the-counter status. In 2011, the FDA <a href="http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/ucm282805.htm">finally agreed</a> to allow women and girls of any age to access EC over the counter, but Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2011pres/12/20111207a.html">stepped in and overruled</a> the FDA's decision. In <a href="https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions/Tummino%20SJ%20memo.pdf">Tummino v. Hamburg</a> [PDF], Judge Korman struck down Sebelius' ruling, which would have maintained the onerous requirement that girls under 17 have a prescription for EC. He <a href="https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions/Tummino%20SJ%20memo.pdf">concluded</a> [PDF] that "it is hardly clear that the Secretary had the power to issue the order, and if she did have that authority, her decision was arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable." </p>

<p>On June 10, 2013, the federal government <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/doj-drops-appeal-of-plan-b-contraceptive-ruling.php">announced</a> that it would drop its appeal of the decision. Some <a href="http://www.adfmedia.org/News/PRDetail/8092">have criticized the court's ruling</a> and urged the government to fight it. Many others recognize that continuing to defend age restrictions on access to EC is a losing battle that only harms women and girls who need access to birth control. </p>

<p>As a matter of justice, Judge Korman made the right decision. Women and girls must have control of their bodies and their sexuality if they are to be autonomous, full-fledged members of society. </p>

<p>As a matter of policy, widespread access to emergency birth control is desperately needed. EC is most effective during the <a href="http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/021998lbl.pdf">first 24 hours</a> [PDF] after sexual intercourse, and can be taken up to 72 hours afterward. With such a short time window, any delay in a woman's access to EC can <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc052810">make the difference</a> between preventing a pregnancy or not. Before Korman's ruling, girls under 17 were required to get a prescription for the drug. For girls who were too young to drive, did not have their parents' permission to go to a doctor, or experienced sexual abuse by the very people who could get them to a doctor, the prescription requirement made access to EC <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/26/us-contraception-emergency-idUSBRE8AP04420121126?feedType=RSS&feedName=healthNews&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FhealthNews+%28Reuters+Health+News%29">very difficult in practice</a>. Furthermore, the age restriction meant that even women and girls who were older than 17 needed to show a government-issued ID to prove their age. This made access to EC difficult for women who did not have driver's licenses or passports (who were also more likely <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1114439">to have low incomes and lack convenient transportation</a>). Finally, researchers <a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1357835">discovered</a> that it often takes multiple pharmacy trips to find EC&151#; some pharmacists either refuse to stock the drug or lie about whether customers can legally access it. Together, these factors create huge obstacles for women and girls who need to prevent a pregnancy and do not have very much time to do so. Judge Korman's ruling takes a big step toward eliminating these barriers.</p>

<p>Political matters aside, however, Judge Korman's opinion is actually a gem of legal analysis and decision-making. While the ruling represents a major step forward in emergency contraception policy, and is a huge victory for women's rights, it manages to be judicially restrained and narrow in scope.</p>

<p>First, Judge Korman took a complicated issue and rooted out the messy political factors that threaten a coherent legal discussion about emergency contraception. It is a difficult conversation to have in a public forum. Many people are uncomfortable with the idea of young teenagers having sex or being sexually assaulted, and that is understandable. Further <a href="http://pharmacypractice.org/vol09/pdf/148-155.pdf">complicating the discussion</a> [PDF] is the fact that opponents of emergency contraception sometimes falsely associate EC with abortion or falsely imply that the drug is harmful to women or their future babies. </p>

<p>Research studies <a href="http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Abstract/2005/09000/The_Effect_of_Increased_Access_to_Emergency.8.aspx">have demonstrated</a> that all of these claims are unfounded myths. However, they inevitably appear in discussions of EC, and Judge Korman artfully dug his way through the political quagmire and <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/17/of-judges-and-judging/">homed in on the issue</a> at hand in <em>Tummino</em>. As he <a href="https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions/Tummino%20SJ%20memo.pdf">put it</a> [PDF], "the issue in this case involves the interpretation of a general statutory and regulatory scheme relating to the approval of drugs for over-the-counter sale. The standards are the same for aspirin and for contraceptives."  </p>

<p>Second, the <em>Tummino</em> decision is judicially restrained. The crux of the holding is that the FDA must either follow its own procedures, or have a rational explanation when it deviates from its procedures. The case turns on a provision of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/706">Administrative Procedure Act</a> that allows a court to overturn a federal agency decision that is "arbitrary, capricious," or "an abuse of discretion." Previous courts <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/519/26/case.html">have interpreted</a> this statute to mean that when an agency deviates from its own policies and procedures without a rational explanation,  the agency's decision becomes a strong candidate for being overturned.</p>

<p>In this case, the evidence of the FDA's departure from its own policies is staggering. The FDA concluded, based on a large body of scientific evidence, that Plan B (a particular brand of EC) was safe for women and girls, and that customers could be trusted to follow the directions and take the drug safely without a doctor's supervision. In fact, Plan B has been <a href="https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions/Tummino%20SJ%20memo.pdf">shown to be safer</a> [PDF] than acetaminophen, laxatives, cough syrups, and heartburn medication, all of which are sold over the counter without age restrictions. The <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1114439">only side effects</a> are nausea and the delay of menstruation by a few days. In spite of all of this evidence, the FDA denied the application to make Plan B available over the counter, based on Secretary Sebelius' ruling. </p>

<p>Other deviations from agency policy <a href="https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions/Tummino%20SJ%20memo.pdf">include</a> [PDF] the fact that Sebelius refused to extrapolate the usage data from older teenagers and apply it to younger teenagers (which the FDA does regularly). The FDA also <a href="https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions/Tummino%20SJ%20memo.pdf">ignored</a> [PDF] the recommendations of its own advisory committee, which voted 23-4 to approve over-the-counter status. Furthermore, in cases where a drug is actually shown to be unsafe for certain ages, the FDA <a href="https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions/Tummino%20SJ%20memo.pdf">typically uses the product label</a> [PDF] to warn consumers that it should only be used by people of certain ages&#8212;it does not put the drug behind the counter and require an ID. Finally, the FDA <a href="https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions/Tummino%20SJ%20memo.pdf">usually does not create</a> [PDF] dual marketing systems under which the drug is prescription-only for some ages and over-the-counter for others &#8212; drugs either require a prescription or they don't. </p>

<p>Given this body of evidence, Judge Korman had almost no choice but to <a href="https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions/Tummino%20SJ%20memo.pdf">find</a> [PDF] that the denial of over-the-counter status for Plan B was "arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable." Despite the fact that he overturned the FDA's decision, his ruling is actually quite narrow and restrained. He does not question the FDA's policies or how the FDA gathers and uses evidence. He also does not impose his own evaluation of the evidence on the agency. He simply demands that the FDA follow the policies and procedures that it created for itself and adopt the decision that it originally made before Sebelius intervened. <em>Tummino's</em> legal legacy is the simple requirement that agencies work reasonably consistently within their own procedures&#8212;a very modest request from the courts.</p>

<p>Third, the <em>Tummino</em> decision reaffirms the purpose of the FDA. The FDA is supposed to make its decisions based on science. To fulfill its purpose, the agency must be free from political influence. Of course, some amount of values will enter the government's decision-making about some drugs, and that <a href="http://www.thehastingscenter.org/pdf/publications/hcr_nov_dec_2004_at_law.pdf">may be a good thing</a> [PDF]. But the government <a href="http://www.venable.com/files/Publication/b1cd2e7e-467b-43cf-b86e-f747176c4bbb/Preview/PublicationAttachment/a12f25e6-858e-4057-a439-f761bb837678/Plan_B_A_Politically_Toxic_Drug.pdf">must prioritize the use of empirical data</a> [PDF] and should not ignore the results of data that it has collected, simply because the findings are politically inconvenient. Judge Korman noted that the Secretary of Health and Human Services rarely has technical or scientific training, while the Commissioner of the FDA <a href="https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions/Tummino%20SJ%20memo.pdf">must be qualified</a> [PDF] to deal with scientific data. In fact, Congress <a href="https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions/Tummino%20SJ%20memo.pdf">altered</a> [PDF] the job description of the Commissioner in 1988 so that he or she would no longer serve at the pleasure of the Secretary. Congress made this change because it recognized that leading the FDA requires scientific expertise and insulation from political pressure. </p>

<p>In this case, the FDA has allowed the over-the-counter application for Plan B to languish for 12 years, <a href="https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions/Tummino%20SJ%20memo.pdf">amounting to</a> [PDF] "an administrative agency filibuster." The FDA has also used Plan B as a political football in its relationship with presidents and their cabinets. Sebelius' ruling was the first time a cabinet member has ever dared to overrule a determination by the FDA. It occurred during a presidential election and was an obvious effort on the part of the Democratic Party to "avoid riling religious groups." Judge Korman's decision is important because it holds both the Secretary and the FDA accountable for allowing important FDA decisions to be politically tainted. </p>

<p>All in all, the decision in <em>Tummino v. Hamburg</em> is good for both policy and legal precedent. The ruling protects the fundamental right of women and girls to control their own reproductive choices. It also manages to be judicially restrained and narrow in its scope. Despite the fact that the decision overturns an action by the FDA, it is actually quite deferential to the agency. It merely requires that the FDA follow its own procedures and operate free from political pressure by the president's cabinet. Even those who oppose emergency contraception should be comforted by the fact that the courts will require the FDA to make policy decisions based on scientific evidence, unaffected by which party happens to be in office. <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Maxwell Slackman, <a href="http://www.law.gmu.edu">George Mason University School of Law</a> Class of 2014 discusses US Internet privacy standards, the economic ramifications of national security leaks and why the US should compete for foreign Internet consumers...<br />
<hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="Slackman.jpg" src="/dateline/Slackman.jpg" width="129" height="213" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>E</strong></font>dward Snowden's <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/09/nsa-secret-surveillance-lawmakers-live?INTCMP=SRCH">recent leaks</a> exposing the National Security Agency's (NSA) PRISM program have prompted a national civil rights debate over the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> and its modern application. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), and Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/aclu-challenges-nsa-surveillance-measures.php">attempt to sue</a> the government while President Barack Obama and Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-OH) advance the constitutional theory that security must be balanced with privacy. Though the constitutional debate takes center stage, there are also important economic ramifications that could stifle the US Internet economy. Lax privacy protections and mistrust of the US government's surveillance programs incentivize foreign Internet consumers, who make up the majority of demand, to abandon US Internet companies. The government can implement privacy legislation, private self-regulation, and minor changes to its surveillance programs in order to restore trust without damaging national security.</p>

<p>US Internet companies have long competed for consumer trust. Google's official motto, <a href="http://investor.google.com/corporate/2004/ipo-founders-letter.html">Don't Be Evil</a>, helped convince consumers that the <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/google-to-modify-search-displays-in-europe-in-response-to-antitrust-concerns.php">search engine's ranking system</a> was accurate and unbiased. Mozilla and Google have already begun privacy-centered campaigns to distance themselves from the surveillance programs and their corresponding <a href="http://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/page/courts_special_fisc.html">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court</a> (FISC) orders. However, trust campaigns that are not enforceable through national privacy laws may not curb mistrust created by the NSA leaks.</p>

<p>EU-based Internet companies may capture the consumers of US companies due to heavier privacy statutes and isolation from FISC authority. On June 21, 2013, Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Alan Davidson stated that <a href="http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/CaucusonP">consumers prefer services that they trust</a>. He believed that the current lack of FISC transparency and oversight may embolden foreign companies to compete for US consumers. Foreign consumers comprise the <a href="http://www.kpcb.com/insights/2013-Internet-trends">majority of demand</a> for US Internet company services, with Google <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324798904578531672407107306.html?mod=wsj_share_tweet">serving more than 1.1 billion</a> unique, foreign visitors per year. Foreign consumer may shift to companies and countries capable of protecting their privacy, fundamentally changing the global Internet economy at the expense of US companies. Cloud computing firms are already <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-nsa-spying-fuels-eu-concerns-about-cloud-providers-20130705,0,386347.story">facing financial fallout</a> due to the recent rise in foreign mistrust. Additionally, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/10/nsa-duckduckgo-gabriel-weinberg-prism">consumers are switching</a> from large US search engines to smaller, privacy-oriented companies.</p>

<p><strong>EU Law Encourages Consumer Trust</strong></p>

<p>Why do European-based companies pose a threat to a traditionally US-dominated industry? European law views privacy as a fundamental right of its citizens. The EU's <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:en:HTML">Data Protection Directive</a> (Directive), updated in 2009 with the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/">ePrivacy Directive</a>, sets out a series of mandates designed to protect European Internet consumers from data mining and profiling.</p>

<p>Companies that store or analyze personal data in an EU member state may only collect the data if, among other criteria, the data is collected for a pre-defined, specific purpose and if it is kept only as long as necessary. Data may only be processed if the company secures consumer consent or if it meets a pre-defined exception.</p>

<p>The regulation also prohibits the processing or storage of sensitive personal information, including data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership, health and sexual orientation. With some exceptions, data collectors must notify consumers of the specific information being collected, its intended use, and the identity of the collecting entity.</p>

<p>Under EU law, Internet consumers have the right to access collected data, object to its uses, and even erase or block data collection. The Directive does allow Member States to restrict these rights for national security purposes. However, limits on data storage periods and the Member States' <a href="http://www.harvard-jlpp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/36_2_605_Rotenberg_Jacobs.pdf">perceived self-restraint</a> [PDF] placate consumer fears.</p>

<p><strong>Current US Privacy Laws are Inadequate</strong></p>

<p>The US has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/technology/eu-privacy-proposal-lays-bare-differences-with-us.html?_r=0">no such privacy law</a>, nor does it incentivize the creation of corporate best practices that would limit collection and profiling of consumer data. The US instead relies on a "patchwork" of statutes that do not fully protect Internet users.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-121">Stored Communications Act</a> (SCA) protects stored files and subscriber information held by service providers from immediate access by the government. The SCA <a href="http://www.cybertelecom.org/security/ecpacontent.htm">originally mandated</a> that law enforcement secure subpoenas, special court orders, and warrants depending on the sensitivity of the data it sought. However, the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ56/pdf/PLAW-107publ56.pdf">PATRIOT Act</a> [PDF] and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/chapter-36">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act</a> (FISA) amendments <a href="https://it.ojp.gov/default.aspx?area=privacy&page=1285">eased restrictions</a> on law enforcement access to stored communications, thus allowing for the NSA's current surveillance programs.</p>

<p>The US' second best-known act, the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/chapter-91">Children's Online Privacy Protection Act</a> (COPPA), requires that websites that knowingly collect personal information from children under thirteen years old obtain verifiable parental consent and allow parents to view and delete to collected information. While COPPA is enforceable by states and several federal agencies, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) generally enforces COPPA though <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/45">Section 5</a> of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair and deceptive trade practices. However, the FTC's case history focuses on security breaches rather than privacy breaches. The FTC may be wary of enforcing numerous COPPA breaches due to the high resource costs and low marginal benefits of COPPA cases and a corresponding chilling effect on child-focused website entrepreneurship. This has resulted in heavy criticism of COPPA as an ineffective privacy protection.</p>

<p>Although Section 5 grants the FTC broad authority over online data protection, the FTC <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/speeches/brill/101019proskauerspeech.pdf">encourages self-regulation</a> [PDF] in lieu of formal rulemaking. Further, the FTC's general authority <a href="http://www.paulschwartz.net/pdf/Schwartz-harvard-pdf.pdf">only extends</a> [PDF] to companies that make assertions of privacy protection. The FTC did publish a <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/2010/12/101201privacyreport.pdf">new privacy framework</a> [PDF] in 2010, <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/speeches/leibowitz/101201privacyreportremarks.pdf">focusing on</a> [PDF] privacy by design, transparency, and consumer choice. However, this framework is only enforceable when a company voluntarily adopts it. This framework does not protect Internet consumers from US surveillance.</p>

<p><strong>Potential US Legislation</strong></p>

<p>While the government does not have broad reaching privacy statutes on the book, multiple bills have been introduced in response to the NSA leaks.</p>

<p>Senator Mark Udall (D-CO) and Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) have <a href="http://www.markudall.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=3497">proposed a bill</a> that would require a demonstrated link to terrorism or espionage before allowing collection of American data. While the legislation has <a href="http://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/support-builds-for-udall-wyden-proposal-to-limit-the-federal-governments-ability-to-collect-vast-amounts-of-data-on-americans">growing bipartisan support</a>, it does not contemplate foreign data and would thus do little to reassure foreign Internet consumers.</p>

<p>Senator Jeff Merkley (D-OR) and Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) <a href="http://www.merkley.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/?id=5d5997d9-4ba1-46c3-ba86-d208ec82a31e">proposed a bill</a> that would declassify FISC opinions and also enjoys bipartisan support. This would allow "Americans to know how broad of a legal authority the government is claiming to spy on Americans under the PATRIOT Act and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act."</p>

<p>Senator Bernie Sanders (D-VT) proposed the <a href="http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=82a4c254-19f7-4b40-beb9-25bb5dc13a18">Restore Our Privacy Act</a>. According to Senator Sanders' <a href="http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=82a4c254-19f7-4b40-beb9-25bb5dc13a18">statements</a>, the bill would require reasonable suspicion to justify searches, "to put an end to open-ended court orders." The bill would expand oversight by requiring the US Attorney General to report to all members of congress.</p>

<p>Senator Patrick Leahy's (D-VT) <a href="http://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/the-fisa-accountability-and-privacy-protection-act-of-2013">FISA Accountability and Privacy Protection Act of 2013</a> would require that the government show relevance to an authorized investigation and link the targeted individual to a foreign power. The act would also accelerate the FISA Amendment Act's sunset date from 2017 to 2015, "to ensure timely re-examination of how these authorities are being utilized." Finally, the Act would broaden oversight by mandating the review of privacy and civil rights concerns created by the FISA Amendments Act.</p>

<p>While all of these bills would create safeguards to protect US Internet users, only Leahy's bill proposes to review the PATRIOT and FISA Acts in a manner that could ease foreign Internet consumers' fears. The administration should consider supporting any of these bills if their enactment would increase consumer trust while not overly hindering constitutional surveillance.</p>

<p><strong>Other Government Actions that may Satisfy Foreign Consumers</strong></p>

<p>The Obama Administration can also reassure foreign consumers by broadening FISC oversight without legislation. The ACLU <a href="http://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/checks-balances-and-national-security-agency">criticizes FISC's limited oversight</a> of the orders it grants and demands that FISC opinions Fourth Amendment protections be declassified.</p>

<p>While the Obama administration could declassify these opinions, the opinions' interweaving of sensitive facts and constitutional analysis makes this difficult.  Instead, the administration should consider adding adversarial mechanisms within the FISC process, expanding the congressional oversight committee, create white papers describing the constitutional analyses of past FISC orders, and mandating that future FISC opinions be written with declassification in mind. At a recent hearing, Judge James Robertson, a former FISC judge, also <a href="http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/313822-1">suggested</a> [video] that the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board take a more direct position overseeing the FISC process.</p>

<p>Outside of direct changes to the NSA programs, the Obama Administration may be able to assuage consumer fears by creating a joint stakeholder process aimed at strengthening US company data and privacy practices. A self-regulatory framework, enforced by the FTC, can mimic the protections created by the EU's Directive by designating best practices and rules for collection, use, storage, and sharing of personal information.</p>

<p>The National Telecommunications and Information Agency (NTIA), an executive agency that informs the White House on Internet policy issues, has experience promoting privacy-related self-regulation through its joint stakeholder initiatives. Unlike legislation, self-regulation is designed by the companies themselves and should be accompanied by federal enforcement in order to ensure consumers that the framework is followed. Such a framework could be adopted by companies and enforced by the FTC via its Section 5 enforcement powers, in exchange for safe harbors from potential data breaches and suits.</p>

<p>Due to the recent NSA leaks, foreign Internet consumers, a large user base with little allegiance to US companies, may move to companies whose countries implement competitive privacy regulations. The US may lose its dominant position in one of the largest world markets if it is unwilling to meet the privacy statutes and standards of its competitors. But the US need not hobble national security through its efforts to regain trust. The expansion of FISC oversight, institution of privacy laws, and self regulation of private entities can meet the government's critics half-way, ensuring that the NSA programs continue without losing our market dominance.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.missouri.edu/wells/">Christina Wells</a> of the University of Missouri - Columbia School of Law says that the broad provisions of the Espionage Act raise significant First Amendment concerns, mainly that government officials can control all debates by allowing favorable leaks while punishing embarrassing or critical ones ...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/christinawells.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>L</strong></font>ast month, Edward Snowden, a former government employee and contractor, <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-citizen-charged-with-espionage-over-nsa-leaks.php">disclosed</a> to newspaper reporters information about US intelligence activities that he obtained during the course of his work. Specifically, he revealed that the NSA engaged in widespread, warrantless surveillance of domestic and international telephone and Internet communications and also engaged in cyber spying on other governments, including allies. The revelations caused a public stir, especially given the <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/aclu-challenges-nsa-surveillance-measures.php">questionable constitutionality</a> of the NSA's domestic surveillance. But far more press, much of it hyperbolic, has focused on Snowden himself. Many officials and observers have called him a traitor while others labeled him a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/26/steve-wozniak-edward-snowden_n_3505727.html">hero</a> and a whistleblower who exposed massive government wrongdoing. The federal government recently brought criminal charges against him for theft of government property and violations of sections <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/793">793(d)</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/798">798(a)(3)</a> of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-37">Espionage Act</a>. These crimes carry possible prison sentences of up to thirty years and signal that the government does not view Snowden as a whistleblower. What are the implications of these particular charges for Snowden, especially in light of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a>, which exists largely to protect public criticism of government and serve as a check against government wrongdoing? </p>

<p>Although officials have referred to Snowden as a traitor, he was not charged with treason. Nor should he be. The <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2381">crime</a> of treason <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2809896451252158562">requires</a> that a person actually levy war against the US or act to aid enemies with whom the US is at war while showing allegiance to those enemies. Snowden's disclosure of confidential information does not rise to the level of treason, especially given that his apparent motive was to inform the general public about a surveillance scheme he <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/09/edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower-surveillance">viewed</a> as "an existential threat to democracy." In fact, the crime of treason is purposefully difficult to prove against defendants like Snowden precisely because it was historically abused, often used to punish those who did nothing more than criticize the government.</p>

<p>Snowden has also been charged with crimes under the Espionage Act for intentionally revealing secret national security information. Once these charges became public, newspapers immediately <a href="http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/06/21/19079389-us-charges-nsa-leaker-snowden-with-espionage?lite">claimed</a> that he was charged with espionage. Such claims are not quite accurate. Espionage is <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/espionage">generally defined</a> as "the practice of spying ... to obtain information about the plans and activities especially of a foreign government."  Although there has been <em>speculation</em> regarding whether the countries to which Snowden has fled (Russia and China) have seized his files, there is not yet any evidence that he acted on their behalf or willingly cooperated with them as would be the case with classic espionage.</p>

<p>More worrisome regarding the Espionage Act provisions under which Snowden is charged, is that he need not "spy" for another government to fall under them. Sections 793(d) and 798(a)(3) are broadly written and arguably extend to many kinds of disclosures. Section 793(d) prohibits intentionally communicating national defense information to unauthorized persons if one has reason to believe the information could hurt the US or help a foreign nation. Section 798(a)(3) prohibits intentionally communicating classified information concerning communications intelligence activities to an unauthorized person or using it in any manner prejudicial to the interests of the US or for the benefit of a foreign nation. In other words, these laws make it a crime to disclose to almost anyone (most of us are "unauthorized persons") secret government information if there is a possible scenario in which disclosure could harm us or help another nation. Surely, the US government could make a case that Snowden's disclosures fit these crimes as described. Such broad criminal provisions, however, essentially ignore the deliberate hurdles placed in the way of treason prosecutions. Why bother prosecuting Snowden with treason when you can label him a "traitor" in the news, charge him under the Espionage Act and throw him in jail for decades simply for communicating information to the public?</p>

<p>Which brings us back to the First Amendment. As with those early and often abused-treason prosecutions, the broad provisions of the Espionage Act raise significant First Amendment concerns. The laws give officials nearly unfettered discretion to determine when a release of confidential information may cause damage to US interests. Thus, officials can retaliate against certain leakers by charging them with crimes while ignoring other leaks. And leaks occur, often purposefully and at the behest of senior administration officials. As Professor David Pozen has <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2223703">explained</a>, the executive branch "leaks like a sieve" and likely always will. Prior to the last decade, the federal government did not aggressively pursue criminal charges against government employees who leaked information to the press; rather, it punished such leaks if at all, via internal disciplinary actions. In recent years, however, government officials have increasingly used the Espionage Act against employees who leaked information embarrassing to the Executive Branch, such as disclosures that the US spied on the Israeli embassy and <a href="http://www.wikileaks.org/cable/2009/07/09STATE80163.html">on UN leaders</a>. The very breadth of the Espionage Act provisions allows just such abuse and gives officials the incentive to punish its critics while continuing to leak information favorable to it.</p>

<p>Such one-sided punishments under the Espionage Act undermine the First Amendment's checking function, which assumes that the strongest restraints on government power come from popular opinion. Secrecy about government activities is especially corrosive to the checking function. The public simply cannot have an opinion on government activities when it is unaware of them. The US government can legitimately argue that secrecy of some sort is necessary to its intelligence operations. But when the very constitutionality of those operations is questionable and involves violating the rights of its own citizens, complete secrecy weakens not just the First Amendment but democratic principles as well. Courts faced with individuals criminally charged with leaking information about actual, significant government abuses of power or illegal government activity should account for this important function of the First Amendment.  </p>

<p>None of this means that government employees should have license to freely disclose information that is legitimately kept secret and critical to our national security. The US Supreme Court recognizes that government employees working with national security issues sit in positions of trust that <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13078129483334213249">limit their First Amendment</a> right to disclose information. But it also recognizes that arbitrary criminal prosecutions of speech can <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3619318963793570251">chill public discussion</a> on important political and social issues. We must come to some sort of balance in <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2071265">determining</a> whether and how to punish public employee disclosures of confidential information while still allowing the checking function of the First Amendment to operate. Absent that balance, government officials have complete power over all debates by allowing favorable leaks while punishing embarrassing or critical leaks. As <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-judge-denies-request-for-information-on-targeted-killings.php">one court recently noted</a>, once this happens we enter an "Alice-in-Wonderland" world where everything is upside down, "effectively allowing our Government to claim as perfectly lawful certain actions that seem on their face incompatible with our Constitution and laws."</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.savannahlawschool.org/facultystaff/elizabeth-megale/">Elizabeth Megale</a> of Savannah Law School examines Florida's "Stand Your Ground" law in the context of the recent acquittal of George Zimmerman</em>...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/elizabethmegale.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n terms of the law, the verdict in <em>State of Florida v. George Zimmerman</em> is legally sound; it is the "correct" verdict of a jury bound by the requirements of the <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/florida-begins-its-investigation-into-self-defense-law.php">law</a>. Attorneys on both sides committed errors, as one might expect during the course of a trial, but based on the evidence adduced at trial, the jury lawfully acquitted Zimmerman. Importantly, even had the trial been "perfect," the evidence in this case would have required an acquittal under Florida law. </p>

<p>Even so, the verdict has inspired community outrage. To many, it feels like Zimmerman "got away with murder." After all, he killed an unarmed teenage boy. To complicate it even more, that teenager was black. The facts of this case shine a light on the pervasive racism endemic to America, and the resultant outrage surges from the frustration of those who feel like they are in the middle of a crowded room screaming about the problem. Can anyone hear? Does anyone care? </p>

<p>Those angry about the George Zimmerman verdict surely can understand how the law in Florida mandated this result. Florida law has a broad <a href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0700-0799/0776/Sections/0776.012.html">self-defense statute</a>. The law permits me to use deadly force against another person if I subjectively fear that other person will cause me great bodily harm or commit a forcible felony. It doesn't matter if I was wrong. It doesn't even matter whether my reaction was reasonable. It certainly's doesn't matter whether my reaction was based on my racial prejudice. What's more, Florida law makes a negligible exception for first aggressors or cases of retreat. If I start a fight with someone, that person would be entitled to respond against me with force. Once that person's defensive act triggers my fear, I can respond with deadly force too.  Even worse, there is no statutorily-recognized shut-off valve to defuse the situation. Florida law condones the use of deadly force against someone who is in the process of retreat. So, even if I decide to abandon the fight and run away, the other person is authorized to chase and kill me out of simple fear.  </p>

<p>Due to the underlying facts, many legal scholars might question how Zimmerman was ever charged and why his attorneys did not move to dismiss the case early on. Although Zimmerman might plausibly be characterized as the initial aggressor in this case, there is little question that he, too, suffered great bodily harm (as defined in Florida) based on the injuries to his face and head. Whether we like it or not, under Florida law, these injuries alone evidence a legal basis for reacting with deadly force against Trayvon Martin regardless of who initiated the encounter. </p>

<p>Even assuming the prosecution could have overcome the high burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that George Zimmerman committed second-degree murder, it could hardly disprove that Zimmerman acted in self-defense. As we all know, a prosecutor must prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt, and a defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty. Even when a defendant has been proven guilty, though, that defendant may assert an affirmative defense, essentially admitting the prosecutor has met the burden but offering a legally justifiable reason for the actions and seeking acquittal. The defendant is not required to prove the defense beyond a reasonable doubt; rather, there need only be a basic (<em>prima facie</em>) showing of plausibility. In other words, could the facts supporting the affirmative defense be true? If so, the burden shifts to the prosecution to disprove the theory of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. Otherwise, Florida law requires the jury to acquit the defendant. Based on the physical and photographic evidence of injury, this burden would have been insurmountable for the prosecutors in the Zimmerman case. </p>

<p>From a physical evidence perspective, the prosecution's case was impossible from the beginning. Even if the state could establish evidence of first degree murder, Zimmerman's physical injuries were consistent with his theory of self-defense, and the prosecution had no way of disproving his theory beyond a reasonable doubt. So, in a sense, the Zimmerman trial actually represents a victory for the criminal justice system in that the jury, rather than being swayed by emotions, evaluated the facts and evidence under Florida law to make a legally sound decision. We may not like it, but that is what Florida law requires.  </p>

<p>As a reflection of society, though, the Zimmerman verdict reveals a tragic image of a country still deeply marred by racial tensions. The requirements of the law are incongruous with our expectations in a case like this. By any standard, the death of a seventeen-year-old boy is tragic. Under some versions of the events, it appears Zimmerman profiled Trayvon Martin and engaged in aggressive behaviors likely to produce the shooting that ultimately occurred. To many on the outside looking in, it seems like Trayvon was shot because he was a black teenager walking in a suburban neighborhood. In a society that calls itself "free," how is it possible that a young man could be shot because of the color of his skin or the clothes he was wearing? </p>

<p>The fact is George Zimmerman made a deadly assumption about Trayvon Martin. He categorized him as someone who did not belong in Zimmerman's suburban neighborhood. He lumped Trayvon in with the "unknowns" who had been committing crimes in that neighborhood, and Zimmerman did not want to let him get away "again." Never mind that Trayvon did nothing wrong. Never mind that Zimmerman had no idea who had committed the crimes in the past. As Trayvon walked down the street, Zimmerman plugged Trayvon into the category of "criminal," and all the assumptions that go along with that category affected every action from that moment forward. </p>

<p>Would there have been a different result if Florida had a duty to retreat? Almost certainly, and in several potential ways. First, a "duty to retreat" statute normally deters confrontations, whereas "stand your ground laws embolden aggressive tendencies. If Zimmerman had been bound by a duty to retreat, he might have heeded the 911 operator's instructions to avoid an encounter with Trayvon. Second, Zimmerman would have had a much more difficult time establishing that he acted in self-defense because he would not have been justified in approaching Trayvon or initially engaging in the scuffle. Rather, he would have been required to retreat to safety in the face of a potential threat. Note that prior to being pinned underneath Trayvon, Zimmerman had other opportunities to safely retreat. So, the duty to retreat would have required both Trayvon and Zimmerman to walk away. Third, if Florida recognized that primary aggressors may not claim self-defense absent evidence of an attempt to retreat, Zimmerman would not have been able to claim self-defense at all. These are just three ways justice might have been served differently in this case. </p>

<p>At their core, Florida's self-defense statutes permit individuals to label others, categorizing them as different. Florida law encourages people to rely on preconceived notions to fill in the gaps about who these "others" really are. These laws give us a license to let our imaginations run wild with prejudice, and therefore to kill anyone who might trigger a fear within us (rational or not). The tragedy of Trayvon's death is much larger than George Zimmerman and any personal prejudice he might have had. </p>

<p>Florida's "Stand Your Ground" laws not only encourage individuals to respond violently when in fear, whether real or imagined, they also endorse prejudice and bias. These laws rationalize irrational prejudices and biases by permitting individuals to "shoot first and ask questions later." We cannot expect to overcome prejudice and racism at an individual level until our laws no longer condone the xenophobic categorization of people based on their race. Only then can meaningful strides be made toward deconstructing entrenched categories of hate related to racism and prejudice and reconstructing new ones rooted in the recognition of individuality.</p>

		<title>Importance of Fairness and Due Process: A Tribute to Lahore High Court</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Rana Rizwan Hussain of Hussain &#38; Associates argues that a recent decision by the Lahore High Court is significant for various reasons, most notably for motivating judicial impartiality and strengthening the rule of law...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/rizwanhussain.jpg" width="120" height="200" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>"I</strong></font>n a country governed by laws where the rule of law reigns supreme, no public functionary, who is a trustee on behalf of the people, has the power or the authority to bestow personal [favors] or largesse at the expense of the institution. Higher the office of the public functionary, higher the responsibility in discharging the sacred trusteeship. All the judges of this court are public functionaries and hold their post as trustee on behalf of the people of Pakistan in terms of the oath under Article 194 of the <a href=http://www.na.gov.pk/publications/constitution.pdf">Constitution</a> [PDF] which provides that they will not allow their "<em>personal interest to influence their official conduct</em> or official decisions and in all circumstances will do right to all manner of people according to law without fear, [favor], affection or ill-will..."</p>

                <p>These remarks have been passed by <a href="http://whoiswhoinlahore.blogspot.com/2011/02/justice-syed-mansoor-ali-shah.html">Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah</a> in a division bench comprised with Justice Ijaz ul Ahsan in a case <a href="http://lhc.gov.pk/appjudgments/2013LHC7.pdf">Tanveer Ahmad Khan v. Registrar Lahore High Court and others</a> [PDF], while setting aside the appointment order of an employee passed by the Honorable Chief Justice of Lahore High Court in 2009. A distinct element of this decision is that it relates to an administrative order and not to a judicial order of a member of the judiciary. The Chief Justice, while passing this order, was acting as the competent authority to make appointments under <a href="http://www.lhc.gov.pk/">Lahore High Court</a> Establishment <a href="http://lhc.gov.pk/downloads/rules_and_orders/volume5.pdf">Rules on Appointment and Conditions of Service</a> [PDF]. This is an admirable decision which is likely to set new foundations of justice, equity and fairplay in society. It will be a torchbearer for many administrative and judicial authorities for deciding matters on merits. This decision is also significant as there have not been many decisions in the legal history of Pakistan in which the bench of two judges passed a decision against the order of the Chief Justice of the High Court. Although, there have been decisions in which <em>vires</em> of the orders passed by the Chief Justices of various High Courts have been discussed, none of the decisions effectively gave a relief to the party against the order of the Chief Justice. In the case, <em>Manzoor Hussain and others v. Muhammad Ashraf and another</em>, the bench of two judges of the High Court gave the following remarks while dealing with the powers of the Chief Justice of the Provincial High Court:<blockquote>It is [a] well‑settled principle of law that all authorities, executive or judicial, should exercise discretion conferred upon them through law, in [a] most reasonable, fair, judicious and equitable manner. The power to exercise discretion does not [authorize] them to act arbitrarily, discriminately and with <em>mala fide</em>. This principle is equally applicable to the Chief Justice of a Provincial High Court upon whom the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme [c]ourt is equally binding. But this is not the case of the appellants ... Unless it is shown that the exercise of discretion by the Chief Justice is [colorable] exercise, motivated with <em>mala fide</em>, it will not be fair and just to interfere with the same ... However, for the present, we would not like to touch the merits of the case as we are inclined to dispose of these appeals on the short ground that the impugned orders are not appealable.</blockquote><br />
                The High Court, while passing these remarks, dismissed the appeal for lack of any substantive right of appeal available in the rules. Before parting with the judgment, the court directed the Office of the Registrar to place the rules before the  Chief Justice of the High Court for the inclusion of a provision relating to the right of appeal. Likewise in another case, <em>Shahnawaz Baloch and others v. Kazi Muhammad Taqi and another</em>, a similar matter came up for hearing before a bench of two judges of the Provincial High Court and that appeal was also dismissed with the following remarks:<blockquote>Since the decision was taken by the [honorable] Chief Justice in exercise of his power under Rule 7 read with section 26 of the said Rules, the appeals being not maintainable are dismissed. Before parting with this order we feel that to appreciate the proper working of the employees and to avoid heart burning which may cause inefficiency amongst the employees it will be proper to direct the Registrar of this Court that, in future whenever any post is required to be filled by promotion all the employees of High Court Establishment who are eligible for promotion be considered for selection/promotion and then matter be submitted to the [honorable] Chief Justice for his decision.</blockquote><br />
                Keeping in view the findings given in the past judgments, another distinct element of the recent judgment which manifestly comes before is that the court while passing this decision kept the obligation under oath of a judge prime to the powers enjoyed by him under the High Court rules. </p>

                <p>In addition, this decision is significant in various other respects. First of all, it is a warning to all the competent authorities functioning in the civil services to make their decisions strictly in accordance with law, complying with due process, as there is no authority which enjoys non-justiceable powers. Moreover, it eliminates every iota of doubt pertaining to the judicial bias or lack of impartiality and independence of judges towards each other. It further establishes that the judiciary is a venerable organ of the state with most solemn and esteemed functions to perform. Therefore, the members of the judiciary are obligated to be free from any type of bias, partiality or nepotism. The timing of this decision, decrying institutional bias, is also significant as the debate is already going on in various circles of society. In these circumstances the decision of the Lahore High Court is commendable and warmly welcomed as it promotes the administration of justice and strengthens the rule of law.</p>

                <p>Every society which has achieved welfare and prosperity has achieved it through a strong and neutral judicial system. No society can progress until its <em>Munsifs</em> (lower court civil judges) render decisions which are not only just but also look to be just. In order to achieve this goal an intense responsibility lies on the shoulders of the judiciary to keep themselves dispassionate in all their judicial and administrative decisions. The judges undertake a divine duty of providing justice to the people who knock at the doors of the courts in stricken circumstances. The duty of providing justice comes directly from the attributes of Allah Almighty, and therefore, any deviation from the honest use of powers conferred through it amounts to the abuse and misuse of the position, contravening the injunctions of Islam. The image of a judge in the eyes of the public is that of a savior who is kind and passionate to the oppressed and wronged, dealing iron-handedly with the culprits. In this image lies the godliness which distinguishes the judiciary from other organs of the state. Also this image carries the features which make this institution dignified and prestigious in the eyes of the public. This image is sustainable only by performing judicial functions in a most truthful and revered manner. </p>

                <p>At the end, a tribute must be paid to the Lahore High Court, a division bench which has set an example of impartiality and independence, encouraging those who pursue justice. By passing this decision the Lahore High Court has also demonstrated the lack of any speck of institutional bias in the minds of the judges. The office of Chief Justice of Lahore High Court deserves a special salute insofar as this decision relates to, and has maintained, the principle of supremacy of law as paramount. This is an example to follow for the officials of all other institutions in the country to set themselves free from any type of bias and take all their decisions strictly in accordance with law, as the supremacy of law is the only road to welfare and betterment of the society. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Steven Aiello, LLB Candidate, <a href="http://www.lon.ac.uk/">University of London</a>, considers foreign aid and how it applies to Egypt in a two-part series. Here, he examines whether or not the situation is a coup and how this affects foreign aid ...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="Aiello.jpg" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Aiello.jpg" width="120" height="200" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>J</strong></font>uly 3, 2013 was a momentous day for Egyptians, but its impact has been far broader than just Egypt, or even North Africa. One of the more intriguing legal repercussions of the latest transition of executive power in Egypt has been the focus on the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/chapter-32">1961 Foreign Assistance Act</a> (and its various subsequent amendments). Specifically, Section 508, which calls for the suspension of any assistance under the act (i.e. foreign aid) in the event of a military coup d'&#233;tat or decree, or following a coup in which the military plays a "decisive role" has generated a heated debate, with politicians and legal scholars voicing their opinions and even the <a href="http://www.lawfareblog.com/2013/07/will-obama-administration-cut-off-foreign-assistance-to-egypt/">White House</a> referencing the need to clarify the status of Egyptian President Morsi's ouster from office. </p>

<p>With $1.5 billion dollars in annual aid and a <a href="http://securityassistancemonitor.wordpress.com/2013/07/12/egypt-aid-breakdown-whats-on-the-table/">bi-national relationship</a> key to American foreign policy interests, to say nothing of the more than 80 million Egyptians suffering from an economy <a href="http://www.tradingeconomics.com/egypt/gdp-growth">whose growth rate has sputtered</a> in the last two years, this is more than an esoteric legal fine point. Whether the circumstances which saw Morsi replaced by Constitutional Court President Adly Mansour constitute a coup <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/07/coup-or-not-egypt-aid-can-continue/">will determine</a> whether, under American law, the US can legally continue to provide the aid it had pledged and intended to supply the Egyptian government. </p>

<p>Notable figures, such as Republican Senator John McCain and Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/15/us-egypt-protests-usa-aid-idUSBRE96E0SC20130715">have already vocalized</a> their belief that aid should be cut. As some have <a href="http://www.usnews.com/debate-club/should-us-foreign-aid-to-egypt-be-cut/theres-no-dancing-around-the-law-on-aid-to-egypt">argued</a>, regardless of the policy implications whether one likes the outcome, the law is the law, and if it looks, sounds and smells like a coup, then it is a coup. I believe that the situation is more nuanced than that. The July 3 case falls into a gray area not well covered by the existing legislation, and thus the application of Section 508 (and its 2012 manifestation in Section 7008 of the 2013 Foreign Appropriations Bill) is questionable. There are compelling arguments for both constructive and substantive interpretations of the Foreign Assistance Act to allow aid to Egypt to continue. In such a case, the situation in Egypt should be seen as simultaneously <em>sui generis</em>, and yet paradigmatic of a series of related cases triggered by the Arab Spring uprisings beginning in 2011.</p>

<p>American foreign policy has long since chosen the disingenuous approach in abiding by the Foreign Assistance Act, providing aid to numerous regimes despite poor human rights records and dubious electoral processes. Given that reality, it remains to be considered whether the ousting of an elected leader which is initiated by a substantial proportion of the population and supported by a clear majority, fits the letter or the spirit of the law (i.e. Section 508).</p>

<p>From the formalistic interpretative perspective, there are several points to be made. Firstly, the key question is whether the head of government can be said to have been <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr5857/text">deposed by the military</a>. While some have claimed that is a straight-forward affirmative, the situation may be more complicated when, as in Egypt, it is the people themselves who initiate the ouster, and the military acts in response to a devolution of control. Even the 2011 addition of "a coup d'&#233;tat or degree in which the military plays a decisive role" requires additional clarification as to the precise meaning of a "decisive" role. Certainly the military played an important and arguably key role in Morsi's removal, but was it "decisive?" Considering the last few years in Egypt and the region, is it certain that the public protests themselves would not have sufficed to remove Morsi from power? That is unclear. What is certain, is the ordinal and causal nature of Morsi's fall&#8212;the military's involvement was both preceded and triggered by a massive mobilization of the Egyptian population, including an online petition, record-setting attendance protests, and an unthinkable convergence of the Christian, Muslim, liberal, youth and Islamist leadership. In fact the event which occurred immediately prior to the removal of Morsi from office was actually a non-event, the failure of Morsi's Brotherhood-led government to reach an agreement with its opponents and put an end to the massive nation-wide protests. In light of those facts, and the fact that the military <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/07/201371145513525182.html">first offered a two-day window</a> for the political forces to reach an understanding, there is a strong argument to be made that the army merely acted to stabilize what was devolving into a conflict between the people and its central government.  </p>

<p>In addition to the claim that Egypt does not constitute a case of the military playing a decisive role in a coup, there are two other loopholes which might be exploited to continue aid. Firstly, as Section 7050 of the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr5857/text">2013 bill</a> supports, it is possible to continue aid in the event of a coup by distributing the aid directly to nationals and local businesses and NGOs, essentially bypassing the central government. In Egypt's case this would have a relatively limited effect given that the overwhelming majority of US aid to Egypt is military. A more expansive case hinges on the clause which adds that "provisions of this section shall not apply to assistance to promote democratic elections or public participation in democratic processes." Depending upon how this clause is interpreted, aid to the Egyptian military could be justified under the argument that Egyptian security is vital to facilitating new elections, the rise of a democratically elected government and a constitutional committee, by providing the necessary stability and support for such a process.</p>

<p>Additionally, assistance itself may be resumed "if the President determines and certifies to the Committees on Appropriations that subsequent to the termination of assistance a democratically elected government has taken office." Thus the temporary suspension (or termination) of aid followed by immediate elections, even for a transitional government, would allow the White House to reestablish aid.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the aforementioned claims, the strongest arguments lie in a more substantive interpretation of the Foreign Assistance Act. Section 508 is quite clearly designed to prevent the US from aiding or supporting anti-democratic regimes, and in so doing is consistent with other limitations imposed (and often ignored) by the act. From that perspective, the better argument lies with the anti-coup position. President Morsi had repeatedly breached <a href="http://www.fairobserver.com/article/did-anti-morsi-protesters-violate-principle-legality">constitutional limitations</a> on his own power as president, most notably <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/06/26/looming-protests-aimed-at-removing-egypt-president-raise-question-legitimacy">preventing the courts from reviewing his actions.</a> The opposition allegedly <a href="http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/tamarod-petition-has-22-million-signatures">collected signatories</a> from more than a quarter of the population, well more than had voted for Morsi, and <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/30/us-egypt-protests-idUSBRE95Q0NO20130630">protests to Morsi's rule</a> were unprecedented in volume. Opposition to Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood included virtually all cross-sections of Egyptian society. And as previously noted, it was in response to a looming confrontation between protesters and the Morsi-led government that the military acted, and even then, not to hold control over the country, but to transfer it to the head of the judiciary with the intent to hold new elections. </p>

<p>The situation in Egypt challenges the typical understanding of a coup. While some have argued that a military ouster of an elected leader is a straightforward coup, the particular details and the manner and order in which Morsi was removed from power belie such a simplistic conclusion. If this is a coup, it could be the first time that the military seized power from an executive leader acting <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/ultra_vires"><em>ultra vires</em></a> only to cede power to the judiciary branch. The stronger claim in this author's opinion is that Egypt constitutes a <em>sui generis</em> situation, one for which Section 508 was neither drafted, nor should be applied. </p>

Section 508 of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/chapter-32">1961 Foreign Assistance Act</a> and its 2013 manifestation (Section 7008 of the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr5857/text">2013 Foreign Operations and Related Programs Appropriations Act</a>) prevent the US State Department from continuing aid to countries whose "duly elected" leader "is deposed by military coup d'etat or decree or, after the date of enactment of this Act, a coup d'etat or decree in which the military plays a decisive role." The 1.5 billion dollar question has been whether the US will find that the Egyptian Armed Forces role in removing Morsi from power constituted a coup. The better legal question is how the Foreign Assistance Act can be reformed so as to allow US foreign policy goals and interests to be advanced while still respecting and adhering to the rule of law.</p>

<p>Some <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/07/03/law-says-the-u-s-is-required-to-cut-aid-after-coups-will-it/">recent reports</a> on the act have implied that the age of the statute (passed in 1961) is at fault. There is some merit to this argument. In 1961 the US, and American foreign policy were focused on the Cold War. The Cold War mindset is hardly suitable for addressing policy challenges in 2013. On the other hand, the 2011 addition of "a coup d'etat or decree in which the military plays a decisive role" indicates that the passing of a half century is not the only issue with this statute. </p>

<p>This is certainly not the first time that the US has found itself in a tricky situation due to the Foreign Assistance Act requirements, nor will it be the last, at least until the act is amended. It is hardly reasonable to expect US foreign policy to reverse itself solely on the basis of whether a coup has taken place&#8212;certainly not when we continue to work with dictatorial regimes and provide aid to governments who care little for human rights. The fact that the aid agreement with Egypt was a vestige of the oppressive, dictatorial Mubarak regime lends a clue as to how rigidly Section 508 has been adhered to in the past. </p>

<p>There are two main challenges to the restrictions of Section 508. Firstly, while the ostensible goals of abiding by its commitment to liberal democratic values are laudable, they are equally impractical. By setting standards which the executive branch has neither intent nor the political will to keep, Congress makes a mockery of the law. The law is either ignored or stretched beyond any reasonable point. In the Middle East and North Africa alone, dictatorial regimes were given US foreign aid despite consistent human rights abuses. Having sham elections were a show for despots including Mubarak in Egypt, Ben Ali in Tunisia and Saleh in Yemen who each ruled for decades. It can also be argued that the prevention of all aid to those living under oppressive regimes harms civilians with little say in their government's affairs. Regardless, it is clear that the ideals of the statute present a standard which the government cannot live up to; it would be more prudent to amend the law to something that the state department could actually adhere to rather than making a mockery of our justice system.</p>

<p>The second challenge comes from the US foreign policy perspective. US aid should be a foreign policy tool. It is reasonable to expect that US aid is used in a way that seems to advance American national interests best; the American government is answerable to its citizens as a national government, not a charitable organization. As such, placing these limitations on whom we can provide aid to significantly prejudices and hinders the advancement of US foreign policy interests and the efficiency of how we use our foreign aid. Once again Egypt is a good example of a situation in which a strict adherence to the Section 508 could seriously undermine American national interests, but <br />
there are many other such examples, and sans statutory changes we can expect future examples as well.</p>

<p>The combination of these two arguments is clear. Section 508 sets a wonderful ideal, at the expense of pragmatism. It is wholly unrealistic to expect the US State Department to set aside all American foreign policy interests on the basis of who is in power and how they came to power. There are decades of American foreign policy to prove this; the recent debate and continuation of aid to Egypt bear this out. At the same time, by failing to acknowledge this reality, the act harms the US's reputation for adherence to its own laws, domestically and internationally. </p>

<p>The act requires more than a simple amendment. It requires a complete overhaul; an utter shift in the legal and policy paradigm by which American aid is viewed and measured. Rather than setting strict, un-nuanced and impractical bars on aid to countries on the basis of "democratic" or "non-democratic," the statutory requirements of aid should be based upon trends and American national interests. If it is truly to promote liberal democratic values, then the act should call for evaluations of each potential aid recipient as to their trends&#8212;which national governments have shown improvements and taken clear steps to improve their civil and human rights levels and which have not. Both official US data and metrics provided by credible non-governmental organizations might be useful towards this end. At the same time, the act should include clauses recognizing that there would still be exceptions and loopholes for certain situations in which American national interests could be seriously undermined by the complete withdrawal of aid. It is reasonable to expect to provide more aid to countries which are progressing towards more liberal democratic governance, and to penalize those which are regressing. </p>

<p>It is reasonable to call for reduced military aid (as one example) to a country which has undergone a coup. But the absolute, un-nuanced measures of Section 508 in its current form&#8212;all aid must be completely stopped once a coup has occurred, is of little benefit and arguably, is in fact detrimental. A coup is one of the least expectable events in international relations, and to expect the US government to summarily suspend all aid, of any kind, to a post-coup country, is impractical. It harms American interests as well as making a mockery of the law. A systematic change to the Foreign Assistance Act's Section 508 would address all of these concerns and could pave the way for a more effective US foreign policy, one simultaneously conscious of American policy needs and respectful of the credibility of the law. </p>

Hamburg</em> and concludes that the district court correctly decided the case...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="Schwartz.jpg" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Schwartz.jpg" width="120" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>A</strong></font>lthough it has been years since I was an teenager, I have been unable to forget the frantic desperation of racing against the clock to climb over unnecessary obstacles to simply have my doctor's office call in a prescription. It is validating to know now what I had already concluded as a teen: none of those barriers contributed to my health, safety or ability to administer emergency contraception.</p>

<p><strong>I. District Court Determination of Agency Departures</strong></p>

<p>The US Department of Justice and the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) recent decision not to appeal a ruling that allows women of all ages to access emergency contraception (EC) without a prescription or point-of-sale restriction was a decision sound in health policy and law.<br />
 <br />
The <a href="http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/Transparency/Basics/ucm214416.htm">FDA</a>, an expert scientific  agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, is <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1805862575525118388">responsible for scientific and medical decisions</a> under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/chapter-9">Federal Food and Drug Cosmetic Act</a> (FDCA). While the FDA has undoubtedly made substantial strides in protecting America's health and well-being, their previous denial of requests for the removal of age and point-of-sale restrictions for emergency contraception represents a harmful and substantial departure from the FDA's own agency precedent. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/706">Administrative Procedure Act</a> (APA) governs such departures and empowers a district court &#8212; such as the Eastern District of New York &#8212; to examine case law and set aside an agency's actions if they are "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law." In order for a district court <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1805862575525118388">to find</a> an agency's decision "arbitrary and capricious," the agency must have "...relied on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise." In addition, the agency's decision can also be held "arbitrary and capricious" if there is an irrational departure from an adopted general policy or subjective bad faith.</p>

<p><strong>II. The FDA clearly acted in such a matter by relying on factors that Congress had not intended it to consider and offering explanations for its decision that directly contradicted the evidence before the agency.</strong></p>

<p>The FDA cited medically inaccurate and scientifically disproven defenses in explaining why EC should not be available over-the-counter and without point-of-sale restrictions, thus making a conscious decision to ignore clear scientific and clinical evidence that was provided.</p>

<p>Despite the FDA's claims, EC is a safe way to prevent unintended pregnancy. EC <a href="http://bixbycenter.ucsf.edu/">poses</a> no risk of serious health consequences if taken in greater quantities than the directed amount. The only criteria the FDA utilizes in determining if a drug should be available over-the-counter is whether a consumer can understand how to use the particular drug "safely and effectively." Because FDA over-the-counter approval standards do not differ among types of drugs, whether it is as basic as aspirin whose overdose, unlike that of EC, could result in death or as complicated as contraceptives, the peculiar standard the FDA applied to EC would make it impossible for any drug to be approved for over-the-counter use. Therefore, it is obvious that the FDA did not single out EC for safety reasons.</p>

<p>Upon further analysis, the district court <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1805862575525118388">concluded</a> that the FDA's opposition was based on a teen's ability to make decisions about whether or not to have sex, rather than their ability to understand how to use EC. The FDA ignored evidence that would have dismissed their opposition, showing that EC has no effect on risky sexual behavior. <a href="http://www.acog.org/Resources%20And%20Publications/Committee%20Opinions/Committee%20on%20Health%20Care%20for%20Underserved%20Women/Access%20to%20Emergency%20Contraception.aspx">Studies</a> have proven that access to EC without substantial barriers does not result in an increase of unprotected sex, less condom use, or less hormonal contraceptive use in either adolescents or adult women. As shown by the agency's departure from their usual review process, the FDA <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4190662947151477793">has never before considered</a> behavioral implications due to differences in cognitive development in requests for over-the-counter applications. </p>

<p>Lastly, the FDA claimed there was insufficient data to determine whether it would be safe for young females to have access to EC over-the-counter. Once again the FDA completely abandoned precedent and declined to extrapolate clinical trail data from older patients to adolescents in both prescription and non-prescription approvals. It has been common practice for the FDA to extrapolate data to younger populations; the FDA <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4190662947151477793">has approved</a> even prescription oral contraceptives through data extrapolation in the past. Extrapolating <a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/UCM049870.pdf">data</a> [PDF] is a safe and scientific method, which has been recognized as a long-standing practice, as well as recently incorporated into the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/topn/pediatric_research_equity_act_of_2007">Pediatric Research and Equity Act</a>. Therefore, the district court had no choice but to <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1805862575525118388">dismiss</a> the FDA's claim of insufficient data as a pretext, further demonstrating the FDA's bad faith. <br />
 <br />
As found in Judge Korman's decision, this evidence shows that the FDA clearly chose to prioritize behavioral myths that would gain political points, rather than permissible health and safety concerns. </p>

<p><strong>III. The decision-making surrounding EC represented an abandonment of long-standing traditions and policies of the FDA for ideological reasons, whose inconsistency could lead to a dangerous precedent. </strong></p>

<p>The controversy surrounding the FDA's departure from precedent contradicted the FDA's mission to women's health and led to medical professional resignations. Even beyond reproductive justice advocates, many were alarmed that the new path of FDA's decision-making might set a dangerous precedent leading to negative consequences for other over-the-counter drugs.  </p>

<p>The US Government Accountability Office <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d06109.pdf">found</a> [PDF] the review process to be "unusual" and a significant departure from typical FDA review procedures. For instance, the Department of Health Secretary Sebillius's decision to override the FDA's determination that EC was safe and effective as an over-the-counter drug without age or point-of-sale restrictions marks the first time a cabinet member has publicly revoked an FDA determination. Furthermore, throughout the review process the FDA departed from long standing policy in countless ways, including adding committee members for ideological balance, rather than scientific expertise. </p>

<p>Even after the 2006 approval of non-prescription use for females over the age of 18, the FDA mandated point-of-sale restrictions. This action was in direct contradiction to <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1351116392213803295">case law</a> that firmly states the FDA's authority over nonprescription drugs does not include point-of-sale restrictions of safe drugs. The FDA's attempt to institute point-of-sale restrictions, instead of the usual policy of relying on labeling for safe over-the-counter usage, demonstrated a continued and deliberate effort to restrict access. </p>

<p><strong>IV. Placing politics above health produces harmful effects for all females of childbearing age and disproportionately impacts teenagers, low-income women, and racial minorities who face greater risks of unintended pregnancies.</strong> </p>

<p>As Judge Korman eloquently <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4190662947151477793">stated</a>, "any system placing barriers to access would defeat the purpose of the drug and lessen its public health potential." With the FDA's defenses debunked by scientific studies and their departure from long standing agency practice exposed, there was no other conclusion for the district court to reach than the presence of impermissible political and ideological influences. At last, twelve years after the citizen petition was filed, EC is available to all &#8212; regardless of age and without point-of-sale restrictions. </p>

<p>As a former Emergency Room Rape Crisis Counselor, a cousin to two teenage girls, and a woman of childbearing age, I express my sincere gratitude to Judge Korman for his bravery and rejection of the FDA's harmful ideology. Choosing politics over health has not only insulted our intelligence, but also put our health at risk for far too long. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnists <a href="http://www.law.cuny.edu/faculty/directory/cox.html">Douglas Cox</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cuny.edu/faculty/directory/kassem.html">Ramzi Kassem</a>, Associate Professors at the City University of New York School of Law say that the National Security Council needs to return to previous levels of oversight and legal restriction... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="left" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/douglascox2.jpg" width="120" align="left" hspace="0" vspace="0"></td><td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height='1' width='5'></td></tr><tr><img src="/images/s.gif" height=1 width=1></td></tr><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height=5 width=1><br /><img src="/forum/ramzikassem2.jpg" width="120" align=left hspace=0 vspace=0></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height=1 width=5></td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n  yet another troubling illustration of government secrecy and evasion of accountability, the government is asserting that records of US officials debating whether to kill people, including US citizens, outside of recognized battlefields and without judicial process, are categorically immune from the Freedom of Information Act (<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/552">FOIA</a>) and that the president has unfettered discretion to destroy any such records.</p>

<p>These remarkable assertions are consequences of the central role that the National Security Council (<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/nsc">NSC</a>) and National Security Staff (NSS) have come to play in the process of creating the drone "kill list." In various official and unofficial statements, for example, government officials have confirmed the involvement of the NSC Principals [<a href="http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/130207/posthearing.pdf">PDF</a>] and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/the-process-behind-targeted-killing/2012/10/23/4420644c-1d26-11e2-ba31-3083ca97c314_graphic.html">Deputies</a> Committees and the NSC <a href="http://2001-2009.state.gov/s/ct/about/org/c16675.htm">Counterterrorism Security Group</a> in compiling and culling the list of individuals approved for drone killing.</p>

<p>This is significant because the government currently treats the entire NSC/NSS interagency structure as exempt from the disclosure requirements of the FOIA as well as the record keeping requirements of the Federal Records Act (<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/44/chapter-31">FRA</a>). Instead the government treats all NSC/NSS records as subject only to the significantly less stringent, and almost unenforceable, Presidential Records Act (<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/44/chapter-22">PRA</a>). This means that NSC/NSS targeting decisions take place within a "black box" where limited documentation requirements allow, if not encourage, "no notes" policies and any records created can be destroyed at the President's sole discretion.</p>

<p>The situation has only worsened given <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/plan-for-hunting-terrorists-signals-us-intends-to-keep-adding-names-to-kill-lists/2012/10/23/4789b2ae-18b3-11e2-a55c-39408fbe6a4b_story_3.html">reporting</a> that the NSC's role has even expanded in recent years. Indeed, the NSC has taken over aspects of the drone killing process that had been previously led by self-described "agencies," and therefore would have been subject to the FOIA and the FRA. Whether viewed as a "<a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2013/02/04/john-brennan-obama-s-cia-chief-nominee-could-restrain-the-agency.html">bureaucratic power grab</a>" or a responsible removal of targeting decisions from those who "<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/plan-for-hunting-terrorists-signals-us-intends-to-keep-adding-names-to-kill-lists/2012/10/23/4789b2ae-18b3-11e2-a55c-39408fbe6a4b_story_3.html">pull the trigger</a>," the expansion of NSC control has further shrouded the process in secrecy and undermined accountability.</p>

<p>For anyone tempted to view these concerns as illusory or merely theoretical, we can report that the NSC is vigorously defending the importance of the President's asserted right to destroy NSC records relating to drone killings. "Most fundamentally," the NSC argued in a recent court filing, "under the PRA, the President makes the ultimate decision whether to dispose of presidential records, and neither the Archivist, nor Congress, nor the courts may veto that decision." The quote is from a FOIA case we, along with students in the Immigrant &#38; Non-Citizen Rights Clinic at the City University of New York School of Law, filed earlier this year, <a href="http://dockets.justia.com/docket/new-york/nyedce/1:2013cv00948/339473/">Main Street Legal Services, Inc. v. National Security Council</a>. Our FOIA request was for copies of all NSC records relating to drone killings of U.S. citizens and foreign nationals, which the NSC/NSS rejected by asserting that such records were immune from the FOIA.</p>

<p>While we will leave the full details of our argument for the courtroom, treating the NSC as an agency subject to the FOIA is supported by the plain language of the FOIA, the significant independent authority exercised within the NSC/NSS structure derived from both the president and Congress and the decades during which the NSC actively complied with the FOIA. In the 1990s, however, the Clinton administration suddenly asserted, during litigation involving NSC records, that the NSC was no longer subject to the FOIA or the FRA. An incredulous district court rejected this <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8956682187997782202">position</a> as "not only contrary to law but without any reasoned explanation." In 1996, however, a sharply divided DC Circuit in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5670297020076873790"><em>Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President</em></a> reversed and upheld the government's position. Remarkably, Armstrong, which relied upon standards unique to the DC Circuit, was never seriously challenged in another circuit, until now. In the current litigation, the central issue is whether courts outside the DC Circuit should adopt Armstrong or reject it and require the NSC to comply with the FOIA once again. The issue is now fully briefed. The NSC's motion to dismiss is <a href="/forum/nscmtd.pdf">here</a>, our opposition is <a href="/forum/mslsopp.pdf">here</a>, and the NSC's reply is <a href="/forum/nscrply.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>Regardless of the ultimate outcome of the litigation, the current limited documentation requirements for the NSC's involvement in the killings of US citizens and others outside of recognized battlefields has crucial implications for transparency and executive branch accountability. As we will argue in depth in an <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2283243">upcoming article</a>, greater documentation and disclosure requirements are needed for the NSC to ensure accountability to Congress, the public, and history.</p>

After the jury found George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering Trayvon Martin, many cities erupted into <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/20/trayvon-martins-parents-protest_n_3627739.html">protests</a> of what was perceived as a fundamentally unfair and racially-biased verdict that was the result of a broken justice system. Among those protesting that Zimmerman should be punished, some admitted that the flaw was actually found within the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/07/13/zimmerman-jury-deliberations-draw-crowds/2514307/">Florida law</a> which departs significantly from the common law by allowing individuals who initiate confrontations to use deadly force to defend themselves without a duty to escape. Florida's Stand Your Ground <a href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String&URL=0700-0799/0776/Sections/0776.013.html">statutory language</a>, although not the focus of <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/30/justice/florida-zimmerman-defense">Zimmerman's defense</a>, was incorporated directly into the <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/07/12/201410108/read-instructions-for-the-jury-in-trial-of-george-zimmerman">jury instructions</a>, which stated, "[i]f George Zimmerman was not engaged in an unlawful activity and was attacked in any place where he had a right to be, he had no duty to retreat and had the right to stand his ground and meet force with force[.]"</p>

<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/george-zimmerman-juror-murder/storynew?id=19770659">One juror</a> has already come forward to admit that she felt Zimmerman was guilty of killing Martin but that the jury could not find him guilty under the law. Most <a href="http:///forum/2013/07/elizabeth-megale-zimmerman-acquittal.php">legal analysts concur</a> in that view, with many lamenting that Zimmerman could not be convicted of either second-degree murder or manslaughter under Florida law, even if he is morally responsible or might have been convicted under traditional common law standards. Zimmerman was inevitably going to be acquitted because the prosecution had not disproven his self-defense claim beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

<p>Despite the apparent, if depressing, clarity of the legal issues, however, there are those who believe that justice could have been served if the jury had <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/07/15/1223742/-Jury-Nullification-in-the-Zimmerman-Case">disregarded the law</a> and found Zimmerman guilty. This is a phenomenon known as "reverse jury nullification," and its proponents should carefully consider the consequences of what they are suggesting. Releasing juries from their duty to apply the law to the facts of a case will only increase the potential for injustice and bias.</p>

<p><a href="http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1686&context=facpubs">Jury nullification</a> [PDF] in Anglo-American law enjoys a long, documented history that is filled with references to free speech and victory over tyranny. The typical argument in favor of nullification is that juries have a right to express disapproval of a law or system of laws by refusing to convict defendants even though the prosecution has met its burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. It is a populist, grass-roots branch of the checks and balances system. Recently, and true to its legacy of invalidating "victimless crimes," jury nullification has become a popular technique for those who oppose the <a href="http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Filner-Urges-Jury-Nullification-In-Medical-Pot-Dispensary-Case-208246501.html">war on drugs</a> or laws deemed to be an excessive governmental intrusion, such as <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/business/raw-milk-trial-in-hands-of-jury-b9918480z1-208900911.html">bans against raw milk</a>. However, nullification has also been rightfully criticized due to its use by all-white juries to indemnify white defendants who committed racially-motivated crimes.</p>

<p>By comparison, reverse jury nullification receives limited press. Yet, like nullification, reverse nullification has played a role in perpetuating racial injustice. There can be no denying that all-white juries have convicted black defendants based on a belief that the defendants should be punished rather than on evidentiary proof. The shameful show trials of the Scottsboro Boys which produced, but did not culminate in, the historic decision of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=370328547336451678">Powell v. Alabama</a> should serve as a reminder that juries are susceptible to the same hate and fear that warp a legal system. While most law students study <em>Powell</em> for the rule that defendants in capital trials have a due process right to counsel, the facts of the case and the numerous, farcical trial proceedings illustrate how significantly &#8212; and how recently &#8212; the American criminal justice system could be manipulated to convict black defendants based on flimsy evidence because prosecutors could rely on the racist sympathies of their juries.</p>

<p>The most abhorrent consequence of reverse jury nullification is that it results in punishment for a defendant who has either not broken a recognized law or who has not been proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Reverse nullification licenses juries to apply their own personal prejudices and idiosyncratic values rather than the orderly, unbiased, application of fact to law. The risk is not hypothetical. An empirical <a href="http://www.niu.edu/law/organizations/law_review/pdfs/full_issues/28_3/Horowitz.pdf">study</a> [PDF] found that juries given nullification instructions spent less time considering evidence. They were also more likely to convict "unsympathetic" defendants, such as drunk drivers and more likely to acquit "sympathetic" defendants, like those who kill out of mercy. Similar to Lon Fuller's Rex in <em>The Morality of Law</em>, juries permitted to nullify can change laws to fit circumstances and characteristics of individual defendants until the results become completely unpredictable and impossible to follow, increasing the instability and lack of faith in the criminal justice system. While this charge can easily be leveled against traditional nullification, the difference with reverse jury nullification is that, instead of sending a guilty defendant home, an innocent defendant goes to jail.</p>

<p>Of course, Zimmerman wasn't altogether innocent. He admitted he shot Martin and the facts show that he ignored multiple opportunities to avoid the confrontation that ultimately led to Martin's death. Had it not been for the peculiar nature of Florida's self-defense laws, he may have been convicted. But the fact remains that, under the law as it existed then and as it exists now, the only way for the jury to convict him would be to ignore the law and the evidence.</p>

<p>Admittedly, in the case of reverse nullification, the defendant can still appeal or the trial court can set aside the verdict, but neither options are foolproof. More generally, if the argument for nullification is that the legal system is so flawed that it must be subject to an additional check by the jury, then it seems irrational to remove existing restrictions by disregarding evidentiary standards or requirements of a crime. Zimmerman has been <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/zimmerman-portrayed-vigilante-fla-shooting-204339598.html">accused of vigilantism</a> and Stand Your Ground laws of <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/ag-holder-criticizes-stand-ground-laws-234430160.html">encouraging vigilantism</a>. Both are valid claims, but the solution to vigilante justice is not to encourage vigilante juries. </p>

<p>In its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM-sOsY15rc&feature=youtu.be">closing argument</a>, the prosecution hinted that the jury could use "common sense" if they found that the evidence and witness testimony were not enough to convict. It was not a direct call for reverse nullification, but it certainly acknowledged what so many were already thinking: the prosecution had failed to make its case. Understandably, the prosecution, and those who wanted Zimmerman to be convicted, hoped that the jury would look past that infirmity and focus on the terrible prospect of finding that a man can pursue and kill an unarmed teenager without punishment. The jury, however, apparently listened to their instructions: "If you fail to follow the law, your verdict will be a miscarriage of justice. Even if you do not like the laws that must be applied, you must use them. For two centuries we have lived by the Constitution and the law. No juror has the right to violate rules we all share."<br />
 <br />
Florida's governor <a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/07/19/203594004/florida-governor-stands-firm-on-stand-your-ground-law">Rick Scott</a> has shown no interest in changing or repealing the state's self-defense laws. It is tempting for opponents to advocate any means necessary, including jury nullification, to invalidate Stand Your Ground or combat biased application of the law, but doing so will only exacerbate the belief that the American criminal justice system is broken and run amok. As the emotional interview with Juror B29 indicates, applying facts to the law can require painful discipline and can lead to equally painful outcomes. There is no reason to believe, however, that giving juries the authority to ignore the law will achieve more just results. To the contrary, as history has shown, it will accomplish quite the opposite.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Nick Byrne, <a href="http://www.law.unc.edu/">University of North Carolina School of Law</a> Class of 2015, analyzes the repercussions &#8212; both intended and otherwise &#8212; that will arise from the recent North Carolina legislation requiring government-issued IDs at elections...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="byrne.jpg" src="/dateline/byrne.jpg" width="120" height="200" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n the final hours of the North Carolina General Assembly's 2013 session, the Republican-controlled legislature passed <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2013/Bills/House/PDF/H589v8.pdf">House Bill 589</a> [PDF] (HB 589), an omnibus package of election law "reforms" aimed at further "securing the vote." A few weeks later HB 589 was signed into law by Republican Governor Pat McCrory, despite the Governor's initial admission that he <a href="http://www.wral.com/mccrory-not-familiar-with-all-of-bill-he-s-to-sign/12710852/">"doesn't know enough"</a> about certain provisions of the legislation and in the face of growing <a href="http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2013/08/north-carolinians-oppose-voter-bill.html">opposition</a> from the public. The legislation's expected effect of diminishing the ability of North Carolina voters from casting their ballots seems incongruous with the legislation's preamble stating in part: "[a]n act to restore confidence in government." In effect, this legislative effort appears to be a not-so-veiled attack on voting which will make the registration process and actual act of casting a vote more onerous, particularly for the poor, minority, college-age youth and elderly voters.</p>

<p>Until recently, 40 of North Carolina's 100 counties were covered by <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/sec_5/covered.php">Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act</a> (VRA). Prior to the US Supreme Court ruling on <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5108914727330958790">Shelby County v. Holder</a> in June, election law changes impacting any of these counties (and many others nationally) required preclearance review by the US Department of Justice. The <em>Shelby County</em> holding invalidated Section 4 (which set forth the formula for determining those jurisdictions subject to preclearance) and effectively voided Section 5 (the preclearance provision) of the VRA. It now appears that the Court's June decision prompted Republican members of the General Assembly to <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2013/Bills/House/PDF/H589v0.pdf">revisit previously filed legislation</a> [PDF] intent on further restricting ballot access and scaling back current election laws knowing that the sometimes long and arduous road of preclearance would likely not need to be traveled.</p>

<p>Like many southern states, North Carolina's suffrage history is complicated and marred by a history of disenfranchisement aimed at African-Americans. However, since the passage of the VRA, presidential voting among African-Americans in North Carolina has increased dramatically after previously standing as one of the worst in the country. In a landmark 1986 case <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17915148697925512945">Thornburg v. Gingles</a>, the US Supreme Court explicitly noted that North Carolina had discriminated against its black citizens with respect to voting for a period stretching from 1900-1970. The Court cited continued low levels of voter registration among African-Americans due, in large part, to a history of discrimination and <a href="http://www.law.unc.edu/centers/poverty/quickfacts/">low socio-economic status</a> which directly affected African-American political participation. These depressed levels of participation among African-Americans continued noticeably up <a href="http://www.protectcivilrights.org/pdf/voting/NorthCarolinaVRA.pdf">until recently</a> [PDF]. Today, North Carolina is ranked <a href="http://www.nccppr.org/drupal/sites/default/files/file_attachments/accomplishments/nc_voter_turnout.pdf">11th in voter turnout</a> [PDF] based on the 2012 election. Past voting reform efforts such as same day registration and provisional balloting intended to expand, rather than limit, access to the polls are seen as contributing factors in improving this statistic. HB 589 turns back the clock on years of reform and efforts to expand the access to the ballot and facilitate electoral participation.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2013/Bills/House/PDF/H589v0.pdf">original elections bill</a> [PDF], filed in April, was aimed largely at requiring photo identification for voters. The legislature passed similar legislation in 2011 but could not override the veto of then-Governor Beverly Perdue, a Democrat. With the GOP now armed with a veto-proof Republican majority in both houses (the first time since 1896) and a newly-elected Republican governor, Republicans cited photo ID legislation as a key legislative <a href="http://hamptonroads.com/2013/01/voter-id-bill-top-priority-nc-mccrory-gop">priority</a>. HB 589, ratified on July 25, 2013 and signed by the governor on August 12, 2013, was a nearly 60 page rewrite of state election law. The bill arrived on the Senate floor for consideration mere hours before the General Assembly adjourned for the year. Controversial provisions of the bill include: a new photo identification requirement for voting, a reduction in the early vote period, ending same-day voter registration and voter pre-registration for 16 and 17 year olds, repealing straight ticket voting, eliminating provisional voting for out-of-district voters, prohibiting local Boards of Elections from extending voting times when lines are long and repealing public financing of judicial races.</p>

<p>The new law now requires photo identification in order to vote and narrows the list of acceptable ID required for voting to include a driver license, a state-issued ID and a few additional forms such as a military or Veteran's ID. Utility bills, bank statements and property tax bills are no longer acceptable forms of ID. Most alarming is the disproportionate impact the new law's photo ID requirement is expected to have on African-American and young voters. Of the more than 6 million individuals registered to vote in North Carolina, 318,643, or 5 percent, have no photo identification in the form of a driver license the most common state-issued photo identification card available to residents  according to a <a href="http://www.democracy-nc.org/downloads/SBOE-DMVMatchMemoApril2013.pdf">recent analysis</a> [PDF] by the state Board of Elections. Among these voters without photo identification, 34 percent are African-Americans while African-Americans comprise only 23 percent of total registered voters. Given the extent to which African-Americans identify as Democrats, it is unsurprising that 55 percent of total voters without photo ID are Democrats. In 2012, the number of African-Americans who voted without photo identification was 49,261 which represents a slightly higher figure of 36 percent. The law will also <a href="http://www.nonprofitvote.org/doc_view/504-america-goes-to-the-polls-2012">prohibit</a> college-aged voters, which made up 16 percent of North Carolina's total turnout in 2012, from presenting their college-issued IDs when voting. In 2012, <a href="http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/results/president/exit-polls">exit polls</a> indicated 67 percent of young voters in North Carolina cast ballots for President Obama. </p>

<p>Though these figures might appear negligible when considering the over 4.5 million voters who cast ballots in North Carolina in 2012, they are far from it. North Carolina's recent battleground status and its growing influence in presidential contests means that this seemingly marginal number of voters &#8212; most of whom are minorities and youth who vote Democratic &#8212; can easily decide future election outcomes. In the previous two elections, President Obama won by a mere 14,000 votes in 2008 and Mitt Romney won by 92,000 votes in 2012.</p>

<p>HB 589 also reduces by one week the number of "Early Vote" days, a period in which 56 percent of all voters participated in the 2012 election. More notably, 70 percent of African Americans who voted in 2012 used <a href="http://www.democracy-nc.org/downloads/FactsheetVoterRestrictions.pdf">Early Voting</a> [PDF]. In 2007, same day voter registration was introduced in North Carolina resulting in an eight percent increase in voter participation from 2004 to 2008 &#8212; the highest increase in voter participation nationally. HB 589 eliminates same day registration entirely. The benefits of the Early Vote period and same day voter registration are obvious. Same day voter registration enables voters to register and cast their ballot simultaneously, which reduces confusion over registration deadlines and precinct locations. This opportunity is particularly useful for those who have inflexible work schedules and for young voters who might relocate within the state to enroll in college. </p>

<p>States with same day registration voting boast <a href="http://www.demos.org/sites/default/files/publications/EDR_factsheet.pdf">higher overall turnout rates</a> [PDF]. Same day registration helps to counteract seemingly arbitrary voter registration cut off dates and enables voters to register and vote all at once, rather than not being able to vote on Election Day after learning that the voter registration deadline had already passed.</p>

<p>With a substantial increase in voter participation and stories of long lines at the polls, even with early vote on the books in 2012, the reduction in Early Vote will inevitably lead to <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2012/10/18/3605252/long-lines-as-nc-early-voting.html"> longer lines and added stress</a> to voters and poll workers alike. In turn, this added demand on polling sites might lead to cases of fraud and vote count errors.</p>

<p>HB 589 also repeals straight party voting. In a state with a considerably higher number of registered Democrats and in light of the fact that precincts with greater African-American voters use more straight-party voting, the legislature's intent to hinder the ability of African-Americans to vote for their candidates of choice seems clear.<br />
Finally, for voters arriving at the polls without photo identification and whose identification and/or precinct is disputed, the new law no longer provides an on-site provisional balloting option for voters. Under the new law, provisional ballots will only be accepted at local Boards of Elections which are not always conveniently located and sometimes hard to access, particularly for voters lacking personal vehicles and/or public transportation options, and for elderly voters who might be burdened by having to travel elsewhere. Formerly, voters could cast a ballot allowing even those voters who appeared at the wrong precinct to have their votes counted in contests still applicable to the voter's current residence. The new requirement works to block voter participation.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, the effects of the <em>Shelby County</em> decision are being felt immediately in states like North Carolina where decades of disenfranchisement among African-Americans were just beginning to turnaround as African-American participation at the polls was expanding. </p>

<p>North Carolina State Senator Josh Stein, a Democratic leader who represents the state capital of Raleigh, voiced his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMZgQZwVgCM">opposition</a> [video] to HB 589 on the Senate floor during debate declaring: "The only good news about this bill is that when congress revisits Section 4, which the Supreme Court ordered them to do ... [the GOP-controlled legislature] is giving [Congress] a poster child [in North Carolina] for which states will be subject to Section 5 [preclearance] in the future."</p>

<p>With Congress unlikely to act anytime soon to rewrite Section 4 of the VRA, the current inactive status of Section 5 preclearance will remain the law indefinitely. Regardless of whether Congress acts, North Carolina's and other similar state election laws have not gone unnoticed by the Department of Justice. The Attorney General has reportedly begun preparing federal <a href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-07-28/opinions/40859025_1_voting-rights-act-texas-voter-identification-law-attorney-general-eric-holder">complaints</a> using other provisions of the VRA to contest these state laws aimed at "unraveling" years of progress in expanding ballot access. Indeed, one thing remains certain: even in light of a weakened VRA, HB 589 likely faces a long road of legal <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2013/08/04/4211520/lawsuits-expected-over-major-nc.html">challenges</a> ahead &#8212; both from the federal government and outside groups &#8212; in the months and years leading up to the 2016 elections, when the full law is expected to go into effect. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist, Igor Shleypak, <a href="http://www.law.illinois.edu">University of Illinois College of Law</a> Class of 2014, discusses Detroit's bankruptcy, pension restructuring and how Chapter 9 bankruptcy may become a more viable option for local governments in financial trouble...<hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="Shleypak.jpg" src="/dateline/Shleypak.jpg" width="129" height="213" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>G</strong></font>rowing up in the Detroit area, there are constant reminders of the situation the Motor City finds itself in: buried under massive debt, nostalgia for the glory days of the Big Three and the sad possibility that Robocop may have been right. The simple truth is that Detroit has been hurting for some time. Over the past 60 years, the city has lost more than half of its population, its major industrial support has all but abandoned it and the city has suffered chronic mismanagement and corruption. Today, the city's revenue streams are starting to run dry, yet at the same time the city finds itself in debt for <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/mikepatton/2013/07/22/detroit-files-for-bankruptcy-protection-the-facts-the-figures-and-the-fallout/">as much as $20 billion</a>. Over half of that debt is owed to underfunded employee health and pension funds, and if something is not done soon this debt will become unmanageable. Due to such burdens, it is no wonder that the city declared the largest Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy in the history of the US. Now, if Detroit hopes to successfully reorganize, it must make the hard choice between honoring its past obligations to its employees or discharging its debt in the hopes of a better financial future.</p>

<p>Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy is a unique legal construct that not only deals with the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11">Federal Bankruptcy Code</a>, but also with the federal and state constitutions. Unlike a normal Chapter 11 reorganization, Chapter 9 is limited by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/tenth_amendment">10th Amendment</a>, which reserves to the individual states those powers "not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States[.]" Consequently, while a court dealing with a Chapter 11 bankruptcy can replace the governing body of a company with a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1104">trustee</a> and then subsequently <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1112">liquidate</a> the company, when dealing with a Chapter 9 bankruptcy, the court is expressly forbidden from interfering with the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/903">political powers</a> of the debtor and is unable to liquidate the debtor's assets. Moreover, due to the dearth of Chapter 9 filings in the history of the bankruptcy code, the jurisprudence is highly undeveloped. Furthermore, it is not entirely clear how a state constitution fits into the picture. In this case, the <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(zvktpenmbbexxsjw555rnfft))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectname=mcl-Article-IX-24">Michigan constitution</a> provides that the accrued pension benefits "shall be a contractual obligation thereof which shall not be diminished or impaired thereby[.]" Finally, there has yet to be a case where a municipality sought to restructure its pension obligations when the pension was protected by a state constitution.</p>

<p>Despite these hurdles, Detroit may still be able to restructure its obligations. The purpose of Chapter 9 is to allow local governments to do under federal law what they are unable to do under state law. The states are prevented from passing any "Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts" because they are bound by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei">contracts clause</a> of the US Constitution. Therefore, once a municipality enters into a contractual obligation, it cannot unilaterally amend that obligation. While the states are not allowed to offer any sort of relief from such burdens, Congress can do so by exercising its inherent power to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei">establish</a> "uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States[.]" Congress used that very power to establish the bankruptcy code, and Chapter 9 in particular. The limitations of the 10th Amendment still prevent a local government from being forced into bankruptcy, as such action interferes with the political sovereignty of the state. However, a state can authorize its local governments to request Chapter 9 protection.<br />
￼￼￼￼￼￼<br />
Once the petition is filed, the debtor receives almost all of the protections afforded under the bankruptcy code. This includes the ability to restructure general unsecured claims against the debtor, such as the underfunded portions of a pension fund. For any debt to be restructured, a bankruptcy court must confirm the debtor's plan. A key requirement to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/943">confirmation</a>, however, is that "the debtor is not prohibited by law from taking any action necessary to carry out the plan[.]" This has been traditionally interpreted to mean that the debtor's actions, as proposed by the plan, must conform with state laws. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13650316436788081435">In the Matter of Sanitary &#38; Improvement Dist., #7</a>, for example, this meant that the debtor could not confirm a plan which would issue bonds whose provisions violated Nebraska state law. For Detroit, this could mean not being able to confirm a plan that potentially violates the Michigan constitution.</p>

<p>The real question for Detroit is whether modifying its pension obligations constitutes an action that is prohibited by law. On the surface, the answer seems unequivocally "yes." When examined further, the answer is not as clear. As the slim amount of existing jurisprudence holds, this appears to be a question of timing more than anything else. In <em>Sanitary &#38; Improvements Dist. #7</em>, the problem concerned the issuance of bonds which did not guarantee their full payment prior to payment of warrant holders, a restriction which was against state law. However, the restriction only applied to the bonds that were being issued as part of the plan, i.e. the bonds that would be issued after bankruptcy as a means to finance the court-approved restructuring plan. The restriction did not apply to the impairment of the pre-petition bonds while in bankruptcy. Following this reasoning, the court in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16440471820696467876">In re City of Columbia Falls, Mont., Special Imp. Dist. No. 25</a> held that the provision at issue there only "applie[d] to postpetition actions after confirmation of the plan[.]"</p>

<p>To analogize, between the time that the petition is filed and either a plan is confirmed or the case is discharged, the debtor enters a sort of "bankruptcy bubble." The "bubble" grants the debtor certain powers that are otherwise unavailable. One of these powers is to modify and impair contractual rights. This power can allow Detroit to modify its pension obligations while in bankruptcy. However, once a plan is confirmed, or the case discharged, the Michigan and Federal Constitutions take effect and only that which the city achieved in bankruptcy would remain. In other words, Detroit's plan can be confirmed if it proposes restructuring its existing pension debt and a plan to pay it off. However, if part the of the plan requires further reductions of pension obligations after confirmation, then such a plan would not be confirmable. Of course, this is merely one possibility extrapolated from the limited amount of case law available. The US Supreme Court has yet to interpret this provision, but under this theory, a city like Detroit could successfully restructure its pension obligations.</p>

<p>Even if Detroit can modify its pension obligations, the bigger question is whether it should do so. The effect that such a modification would have on the city and the nation as a whole is likely to be immeasurable. Detroit's other financial difficulties certainly exacerbate the problem, but the pension issue by itself is not entirely unique to Detroit. One <a href="http://www.pewstates.org/uploadedFiles/PCS_Assets/2013/Pew_city_pensions_report.pdf">study</a> [PDF] found that 61 of the largest US cities have a combined underfunded pension obligation of about $100 billion and another $118 billion in underfunded health care obligations. Another <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/02/us-usa-municipals-moodys-idUSBRE86119220120702">study</a> puts the total underfunded pension liability for all municipalities at over $2 trillion. Even a relatively financially stable city like Chicago has a pension fund that is only about <a href="http://www.pewstates.org/uploadedFiles/PCS_Assets/2013/Pew_city_pensions_report.pdf">52 percent funded</a> [PDF]. As a result, a successful pension restructuring through bankruptcy could have ripple effects throughout the nation. Specifically, Chapter 9 may become more alluring for local governments seeking creative ways to solve their budget problems.</p>

<p>Modifying its debt, particularly pension debt, is an important step in Detroit's recovery. Needless to say, the city has some difficult decisions to make in the weeks ahead. No matter the outcome, city planners and pensioners around the nation will be watching eagerly for what is to come.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Samar Warsi of the <a href="http://www.muslimclu.org/">Muslim Civil Liberties Union</a> says that police should not be permitted to perpetually contravene the strictures of the Fourth Amendment...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>A</strong></font> federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/federal-judge-rules-nypd-stop-and-frisk-policy-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> earlier this week that the New York Police Department's stop-and-frisk practices are unconstitutional. </p>

                <p>To be clear, stop-and-frisk practice has not been eradicated; it will simply be reformed to bring the practice within constitutional limits. Judge Shira Scheindlin emphasized that the litigation was strictly to "judge the constitutionality of police behavior" and not to assess stop-and-frisk's overall "effectiveness as a law enforcement tool."  </p>

                <p>As with any government measure, stop-and-frisk requires a balancing act between personal liberty and public safety. All stops must be based on reasonable suspicion. As the US Supreme Court has <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=terry+v+ohio&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=17773604035873288886&scilh=0">ruled</a>, and as Judge Scheindlin reiterated, reasonable suspicion must be supported by articulable facts that criminal activity may be afoot. The standard is objective, making the officer's subjective intent irrelevant.</p>

                <p>In reality, however, the standard for reasonable suspicion has been virtually ignored by the New York Police Department (NYPD) and as a result, thousands of law abiding citizens are being stopped and often harassed simply because of their race and location. The Center for Constitutional Rights <a href="http://stopandfrisk.org/the-human-impact-report.pdf">reports</a> [PDF] that aggressive stop-and-frisk practices often perpetuate "widespread civil and human rights abuses, including illegal profiling, improper arrests, inappropriate touching, sexual harassment, humiliation and violence at the hands of police officers." These abuses have long lasting effects on the emotional, psychological, social and economic well-being of those targeted by the police. </p>

                <p>The racial disparity of the stops is staggering and thus cannot be attributed to mere happenstance. According to the opinion, 83 percent of those stopped were either African American or Latino. Additionally, individuals who are stopped are often treated with unjustified aggression and hostility. This, once again, exceeds the parameters of an officer's power under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a>. Police officers have been found to routinely intimidate, threaten and coerce individuals, treating them more like criminals than citizens. </p>

                <p>Most concerning is the fact that the overwhelming majority of those stopped were innocent and did not possess weapons. This suggests that many were stopped solely on the basis of race, an act both unconstitutional and intolerable. Of the 2.3 million frisks that were conducted between 2004 and 2011, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/nystop0812.pdf">only 1.5 percent of those yielded a weapon</a> [PDF]. In 2009, 36 percent of all officer documentations did not even "identify any suspected crime," with the reasons listed for the stop ranging from vague "furtive movements" to simply being in a high crime area. The constitutional requirement of individualized and articulable reasonable suspicion is virtually ignored. A reason such as "furtive movements" is so vague that it fails the constitutional requirement that reasonable suspicion be "based on articulable facts that criminal activity" is occurring or is about to occur.</p>

                <p>To vilify the police officers, however, would be to oversimplify the matter. Police officers in the NYPD feel immense pressure to make a high number of stops. Although New York state law <a href="http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/nycode/LAB/7/215-a">prohibits</a> the use of quotas, a high number of arrests, summons and stops are a quick way to move up to the next rank in the police department. Officers with low numbers are often subject to disciplinary actions. This pressure to increase numbers is evident: between 2002 and 2011, the number of stops went from approximately 97,000 per year to 686,000 per year. With professional image, promotions and raises on the line, the NYPD culture directly incentivizes quantity over quality. Therein lies the problem. </p>

                <p>With a misguided focus, the NYPD showcases a deep seated apathy and fundamental indifference to the pursuit of truthful policing. Police officers should not be rewarded and praised simply for stopping and frisking some arbitrary number. Rather, officers should be awarded only on the basis of finding actual weapons. Stop-and-frisk is a narrow measure intended to get guns off the street. It was never intended as a general crime fighting tool in which police officers have authority to cast the widest possible net. </p>

                <p>Arbitrary stops based on race to meet an unofficial quota is not only unconstitutional, it is symbolic of corruption in direct contravention of a free and democratic society. Scheindlin's verdict is a positive step towards transparency. If used wisely, this can be a critical time for the NYPD to gain the trust of the communities it has alienated. Commissioner Raymond Kelly should take this time to examine what is happening on the street, and the NYPD should unequivocally commit to reforming the stop-and-frisk program to ensure racially neutral implementations of the practice, such as creating sustainable methods of accountability and creating serious consequences for police officers who abuse their power.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Patrick Brady, <a href="http://mainelaw.maine.edu/">University of Maine School of Law</a> Class of 2014, discusses Detroit's bankruptcy and pension holders' proactive defense of their rights...<hr height='1'><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size='3'><strong>A</strong></font>lthough the pension holders of the city pension funds are at the heart of Detroit's financial woes, the holders are at a severe disadvantage with respect to their ability to proactively and personally defend their rights to their pension funds. While judicial efficiency calls for the spirit of the Ingham County Circuit Court ruling to be given effect at the time of confirmation, the petitioner's desire to be proactive in defending their rights required that they use state ordered declaratory relief to protect themselves in the federal bankruptcy system. </p>

<p>In a motion filed by pension holders against the governor of Michigan, Richard Snyder, and the treasurer of the state of Michigan, Andy Dillon, the Ingham County Circuit Court issued a <a href="http://www.freep.com/assets/freep/pdf/C4208749719.PDF">declaratory relief order</a> [PDF] ruling that the City of Detroit's Chapter 9 bankruptcy filing was unconstitutional because, according to <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(jywu4fjht3uvtzn5dzh1lfvs))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-Article-IX-24">Article IX of Section 24 of the Michigan constitution</a>, no Michigan city can take any action that threatens public pension plans. Prior to filing the bankruptcy petition on July 18, the Detroit city emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, made formal recommendations to the city to file for bankruptcy and further recommended to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/us/cries-of-betrayal-as-detroit-plans-to-cut-pensions.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0">cut some, or perhaps all</a>, the city pension plans in the eventual plan. This statement prompted pension holders to file suit and they were ultimately successful at the state circuit court level in being awarded a favorable declaratory relief order.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of a declaratory relief motion in Michigan, and as a general rule, for most other courts nationwide, is for a court to state the legal rights of the parties so as to guide their future conduct. This involves a court articulating what certain parties can and cannot do. This gives the court a broad range of discretion in the scope of its ruling and in the situation at hand, it is interesting to note what the court said the parties could and could not do. The court did not say that the city could proceed with the filing as long as they did not cut the pension plans. The court did say that the filing was moot because there was possible aggression toward the pension funds and that discussion made the filing unconstitutional. While the former skirts a very dangerous line of a state court judge telling a federal bankruptcy court judge what can and cannot be in a bankruptcy plan, the latter denies the city many of the benefits conferred from simply existing in bankruptcy court. Furthermore, this litigation is far from over as the bankruptcy court, and subsequent appeals courts, have ordered that the automatic stay applies. The petitioners will most likely petition to have the stay lifted and then the declaratory relief will almost certainly be appealed as well. Should the stay be lifted and defendants lose on appeal, the petition will have to be withdrawn and the city will be forced to re-file while making some sort of express promise not to cut pensions. All of this litigation has now been created when, at the end of the day, the result would still be the same had the state court passed on the ruling and allowed the case to reach the confirmation hearing in the bankruptcy court. </p>

<p>The result would be the same and the plan could not be confirmed by the bankruptcy court because, under chapter 9, a plan cannot be confirmed if the debtor is <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/943">prohibited by law</a> from taking any action necessary to carry out the plan. As long as someone at the confirmation hearing recognizes that the Michigan constitution prohibits the city from cutting the pension plans and objects, then the result is the same and this declaratory ruling was simply unnecessary and created unnecessary litigation. Unfortunately for the pension holders, they cannot object at the plan confirmation hearing. This means that the pension holders must put all of their faith in the judge and city recognizing, and raising, the issue. This is certainly not a very comforting situation to be in when all your post-retirement financial independence rests on the astuteness of a bankruptcy judge who, while on point, resides in a state with comparatively few bankruptcy proceedings and is presiding over the largest municipal bankruptcy in history, and a city that has expressly said they wish to cut your pension plans.  </p>

<p>The reason that the pension holders cannot object is simple: chapter 9 does not let them. Under chapter 9, the only parties that have standing to challenge a plan are <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/943">"special tax payers."</a> The code further defines a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/902">"special tax payer"</a> as an owner of real property against which a special assessment or special tax has been levied and the proceeds of the tax or special assessment is the sole source of revenue for an obligation incurred as a result of an improvement on that real property. As pension holders, the petitioners would not meet this burden and would therefore not have standing to challenge the confirmation of the plan. This is in sharp contrast to a chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding where <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1109">a party in interest</a> may challenge a plan. Under the relevant chapter 11 statutes, the pension holders would be qualified to object. Unfortunately for the pension holders, this is not chapter 11. So, with no opportunity to object to the plan, the pension holders' only option was to seek declaratory relief. </p>

<p>To obtain declaratory relief in Michigan, the litigant must have standing and under Michigan law &#8212; if the litigant satisfies <a href="http://courts.mi.gov/Courts/MichiganSupremeCourt/CurrentCourtRules/1Chapter2CivilProcedure.pdf">MCR 2.605</a> [PDF], the litigant has standing. MCR 2.605 states that declaratory relief may be granted to a litigant if it is a case of actual controversy within the court's jurisdiction. The hurdle in establishing standing for declaratory relief, then becomes, assuming it is within the court's jurisdiction, whether there is an actual controversy. To satisfy this standard, Michigan requires that there be a disagreement between parties respecting their rights with reference to the subject of the litigation. It is important to note that there is no requirement of a concrete or materialized injury to invoke declaratory relief. In this way, the burden of establishing standing in Michigan to invoke declaratory relief is, with all things considered, a comparatively small and manageable burden. </p>

<p>Furthermore, when considering the stakes, it is all the more impressive that these pension fund holders can use such a relaxed standard to gain such power and traction in a chapter 9 proceeding and grind it to a halt. Even though this ruling is interesting in that a state court is causing such commotion in the largest municipal bankruptcy case in the history of the bankruptcy code, it is even more interesting as an example of the very limited role that parties as adversely effected as these pension holders who stand to lose the very ground they built their retirement on play in a chapter 9 bankruptcy proceeding and the innovative ways that those holders and other creditors must use to gain power and protect their interests. While the amount of litigation that flows from this ruling remains to be measured, the effects of giving creditors a very limited roll in municipal bankruptcy proceedings can already be seen in the form of reduced judicial efficiency that spans both state and federal courts. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.cooley.edu/faculty/corbett.html">Patrick Corbett</a> of the Thomas M. Cooley Law School says that the Fifth Circuit's decision concerning cell site location information is constitutionally sound and that, for the time being, lower courts will have to work through its related privacy implications without the Supreme Court's direct guidance...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/patrickcorbett.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n the case of <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/fifth-circuit-rules-warrant-not-required-to-track-cell-phones.php">In Re: Application of the United States of America for Historical Cell Site Data</a> (<em>In re: Application</em>), the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held, in a 2-1 opinion, that "court orders authorized by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-121">Stored Communications Act</a> to compel phone service providers to produce the historical cell site information of their subscribers [are not] per se unconstitutional." Essentially, the opinion means federal law enforcement officers (at least in the Fifth Circuit) can continue to obtain historical cell site information on a showing of less than probable cause. The officers need only provide "specific and articulable facts showing there are reasonable grounds to believe" the desired information is "relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation" in order to get an order from a court. In so holding, the Fifth Circuit quoted from <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/sixth-circuit-rules-police-tracking-of-gps-in-phone-not-an-illegal-search.php">United States v. Skinner</a>, noting that "[l]aw enforcement tactics must be allowed to advance with technological changes, in order to prevent criminals from circumventing the justice system." The quote appears to sum up the likely motivation for <em>In re: Application</em> &#8212; the government interest in obtaining the information outweighs the privacy interests presented by the facts of the case. The opinion is a predictable, and arguably reasonable, decision in light of some recent Supreme Court cases and the high government interest in enabling law enforcement to pursue criminal suspects by embracing the very technology criminals often use to avoid detection.</p>

<p>In <em>In re: Application</em>, federal criminal investigative authorities sought "historical cell site information" which has been <a href="http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/prosecutors_use_of_mobile_phone_tracking_is_junk_science_critics_say/">defined</a> as follows: "Cell tower records, also known as call detail records, are the billing records cell companies use to keep track of their customers' calls. They show the date and time of all calls made or received, the numbers called, the duration of each call, and the cell towers used to begin and end a call." Such information has proved to be highly useful to law enforcement in a variety of cases, from "<a href="http://staugustine.com/news/local-news/2013-07-07-1#.UkKDq9K2NfZ">finding a missing person to tracking 911 hang-up(s) to tracking a suspect.</a>" Some believe requiring officers to get a search warrant would "<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/03/usa-security-surveillance-idUSL1E8G3OL320120503">cripple</a>" their investigations. Nevertheless, given the potentially private nature of such records, the question arises as to the level of proof law enforcement should be required to show in order to get such information.</p>

<p>It appears that, at least in the short run, lower courts will have to work through these issues without the Court's direct guidance, as the Court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-7971.htm">recently denied</a> the petition for a writ of certiorari in <em>Skinner v. United States</em>, a case presenting a similar issue. Nevertheless, the Fifth Circuit's decision authorizing the government's request for such records under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2703">18 U.S.C. 2703(d)</a> of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-121">Stored Communications Act</a> is consistent with some of the recent decisions of the Supreme Court. What existing Supreme Court cases provide some guidance? </p>

<p>Over the last several years, the Court has maintained a trend toward issuing decisions that find ways to permit the jury to consider the evidence in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> suppression cases. In <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/supreme-court-upholds-admissibility-of.php">Hudson v. Michigan</a>, the Court declared that, because there are other remedies like a civil lawsuit and internal discipline of officers, suppression is not the proper remedy for a "knock and announce" violation. In <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/supreme-court-rules-no-evidence.php">Herring v. United States</a>, the Court held "the jury should not be barred from considering all the evidence" obtained pursuant to a Fourth Amendment error &#8212; in this case, an arrest based on a warrant that wrongly appeared as active in a police department computer database &#8212; when the error "was the result of isolated negligence attenuated from the arrest." Similarly, the Fifth Circuit in <em>In re: Application</em> found a way to permit the investigation involving cell tower information to proceed.</p>

<p>The Court has also demonstrated a desire to narrow the scope of its decisions because of the changing nature of technology. In <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-allows-reasonable-searches-of-private-texts-on-work-issued-devices.php">City of Ontario, California v. Quon</a>, in considering the Fourth Amendment rights of a government employee on a pager issued by the employer, the Court stated: "The judiciary risks error by elaborating too fully on the Fourth Amendment implications of emerging technology before its role in society has become clear .... Rapid changes in the dynamics of communication and information transmission are evident not just in the technology itself but in what society accepts as proper behavior ... A broad holding concerning employees' privacy expectations vis-à-vis employer-provided technological equipment might have implications for future cases that cannot be predicted. It is preferable to dispose of this case on narrower grounds." Similarly, the Fifth Circuit was direct in noting its decision was a narrow one: "Recognizing that technology is changing rapidly, we decide only the narrow issue before us. Section 2703(d) orders to obtain <em>historical</em> cell site information for specified phones at the points at which the user places and terminates a call are not categorically unconstitutional."</p>

<p>While <em>Quon</em> may suggest judicial caution in the context of technology, <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/supreme-court-rules-gps-tracking-of-vehicle-constitutes-search.php">United States v. Jones</a> could potentially have broad implications on the Government's use of technology. In <em>Jones</em>, the Court held that law enforcement attaching a GPS device to a car constituted a search under the Fourth Amendment requiring probable cause and a warrant. A vital fact in reaching this decision: "The Government physically occupied private property for the purpose of obtaining information." In <em>In re: Application</em>, the court distinguished <em>Jones</em> by drawing "a line based on whether it is the Government collecting the information or requiring a third party to collect and store it, or whether it is a third party, of its own accord and for its own purposes, recording the information." As a "third party's voluntarily created business record," federal law enforcement can obtain historical cell site information with a court order. Law enforcement in <em>In re: Application</em> did not physically occupy the private property of the suspects in order to obtain the information; as such, the opinion is consistent with <em>Jones</em>.</p>

<p>Citing <em>Jones</em>, however, the dissent in <em>In re: Application</em> pointed out that the Court is likely to be troubled by law enforcement's access to location information generated by cell phones. In support, the dissent quoted Justice Sotomayor's concurrence in Jones: "[In future cases] considering the existence of a reasonable societal expectation of privacy in the sum of one's public movements[,] ... it may be necessary to reconsider the premise that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties." </p>

<p>There is considerable support within the legal community for reconsidering this third party doctrine. The American Bar Association Criminal Justice Standards Committee recently promulgated "<a href="http://www.americanbar.org/groups/criminal_justice/standards/law_enforcement_access.html">Law Enforcement Access to Third Party Records</a>," urging alternatives in lieu of the third party doctrine. In a recent law review article, Professor Stephen Henderson <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2195274">argues</a> federal courts are already moving away from this doctrine. Nevertheless, unless and until the Supreme Court actually decides to reconsider the third party doctrine, it remains the law that federal courts should follow. As such, the <em>In re: Application</em> decision &#8212; while riddled with some troubling privacy implications &#8212; is constitutionally sound.</p>

<p>In the meantime, as the Fifth Circuit points out, "cell phone users [who] may reasonably want their location information to remain private" have alternatives. "[T]he recourse for these desires is in the market or in the political process: in demanding that service providers do away with such records (or anonymize them) or in lobbying elected representatives to enact statutory protections." Litigators may seek to prevent the admission of cell location information using the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13113431960853019986">federal rules of evidence</a>. After all, some have called cell tower tracking a "'<a href="http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/prosecutors_use_of_mobile_phone_tracking_is_junk_science_critics_say/">junk science</a>' that should never be admitted in any court for any reason." States like Maine have passed <a href="http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/bills/bills_126th/billtexts/SP015701.asp">laws</a> requiring state law enforcement officers to obtain a search warrant (based upon probable cause) in order to retrieve cell site information. Moreover, state courts are always free to interpret their own laws in ways that provide their citizens with greater protection from searches by police than the law as set by the US Supreme Court. In <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/new-jersey-supreme-court-rules-warrants-required-to-track-cell-phones.php">State v. Earls</a>, the New Jersey Supreme Court did just that, holding police were required to obtain a search warrant supported by probable cause in order to obtain cell site information from the defendant's cellular service provider. </p>

<p>Does the Supreme Court, as Justice Scalia <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-1332.ZC1.html">implies</a> in <em>Quon</em> ("The-times-they-are-achangin' is a feeble excuse for disregard of duty"), have a duty to give the lower courts some guidance? Will <em>Jones</em> give the Court a second chance? The prosecutors in the <em>Jones</em> case decided to reprosecute using cell site data and the US District Court recently <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2005cr0386-658">denied</a> a motion to suppress this data &#8212; so the case moves forward. Will the Court eventually reconsider &#8212; and reject &#8212; the third party doctrine? Might the Court find, in some situations, cell tower tracking as so comprehensive that it is unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment? Given the uncertainty, courts will continue to look for narrow ways to decide their cases. Meanwhile, law enforcement officers will continue to use cell site location data &#8212; as they should &#8212; to pursue the criminals.</p>

While broadening the scope of human rights protection within the EU, this development has raised a question of overlapping jurisdiction: there are now two equally binding legal texts, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU (CFR) and the <a href="http://www.hri.org/docs/ECHR50.html#Convention">European Convention of Human Rights</a> (ECHR), and two corresponding European courts, the European Court of Justice (ECJ)  and the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), concerned with human rights protection. As a result, the following questions must be considered: what are the different roles played by the ECJ and the ECtHR in human rights protection in the EU, what are the reasons for these differences and how these different roles affect the relationship between the two courts.</p>

<p><strong>CFR and ECHR: the Two EU Human Rights Protection Texts</strong></p>

<p>The enhanced role of the ECJ in human rights protection resulting from the Lisbon Treaty called attention upon the relationship between the two legal texts protecting human rights in the EU.<br />
 <br />
Art. 52(3) of the CFR states that, wherever the charter contains rights that correspond to the ECHR, "the meaning and scope of those rights shall be the same" as that granted by the convention. However, in what has been defined as an <a href="http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/ilj/vol34/iss5/11/">"unsolved paradox,"</a> Art. 52(3) also enables the ECJ to provide "more extensive protection" than that granted by the ECHR. Art. 53 of the CFR further includes a non-regression clause by which the charter must not to be interpreted as "restricting or adversely affecting" the human rights recognized in the convention.</p>

<p>The reason behind the widened scope of human rights protection granted to the ECJ by Art. 52(3) can be found in the <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2042867">different rationales</a> behind the two European courts. These distinctions in rationale can be made both on the theoretical and on the practical level. </p>

<p><strong>ECJ and ECtHR: Different Theoretical Rationales</strong></p>

<p>From a theoretical perspective, while the ECJ can be seen as an integrative agent, striving for further EU harmonization, the ECtHR's mandate is that of providing a minimum human rights standards protection, beyond which wider scope is left for pluralism and national sovereignty within the EU. <a href="http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/ilj/vol34/iss5/11/">"If the function of the ECJ is to help build unity ... [that] of the ECtHR is to help build a community."</a> This can help to understand the reason behind the "paradox" of Art. 52(3): the ECHR is merely seen as a "floor, rather than a ceiling," of EU human rights protection, while the ECJ may want to leave itself a wider margin of appreciation, given its more integrative role in the European context, and the fact that it is an institution of the EU, rather than rising from an agreement between European states, like the ECtHR is.</p>

<p><strong>ECJ and ECtHR: Different Practical Effects</strong></p>

<p>From a practical perspective, the effects of adverse ruling by the ECJ and by the ECtHR are also different. When a national piece of legislation is found to be violating EU law or the convention, national states should in principle repeal it or amend it. But while the ECJ can refer to the EU principles of supremacy, direct effect and state liability which ensure that, generally speaking, national legislation inconsistent with EU law is actually changed; these principles have no equivalent in the convention of the ECtHR. Given the lack of a well-established system of application of ECtHR judgments, which does exist for ECJ judgments, implementation of the former is much more dependent on national states discretion and on their national constitutions. Thus, an adverse ECtHR ruling will result in a <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2042867">"more gradual (and perhaps less politically costly) implementation"</a> of the decision than in the case of an adverse ECJ ruling. This practical characterization of the ECJ as an active invasive agent, directly intervening in national legislation, as distinguished from the ECtHR more passive role, which leaves wider scope to national states implementation, further explains and helps to understand the powers of expansion granted to the ECJ by Art. 52(3) CFR.</p>

<p><strong>Criticisms: the ECJ is not Primarily a Human Rights Court</strong></p>

<p>The expansion of the ECJ powers in human rights protection has nonetheless raised substantial criticism. As it has been stressed, human rights in the EU have traditionally been a <a href="http://hrlr.oxfordjournals.org/content/11/4/645.full?sid=bae3b0f1-d9a0-4a48-809b-2db14cd4d958">secondary concern</a>, "an offshoot of the EU's more central, market-led functions."</p>

<p>Hence, when the charter became legally binding, this traditional vision of the EU as an economic integrator <a href="http://hrlr.oxfordjournals.org/content/11/4/645.full?sid=bae3b0f1-d9a0-4a48-809b-2db14cd4d958">led to skepticism</a> on its genuine commitment to promote human rights rather than merely using them as means to strengthen EU law. This was also seen as an invasion of the EU in politically sensitive areas (as that of human rights often is) on which Member States are generally willing to retain their sovereignty and discretion .</p>

<p><strong>The ECJ Approach to ECtHR Rulings: Referring to ECtHR While Stepping Further</strong></p>

<p>The ECJ's delicate position in the human rights context, together with the fact that, after accession to the ECHR, the ECJ will be subject to the ECtHR external review, gave the ECJ a strong incentive to preserve its credibility in the human rights domain by trying to ensure interpretational convergence with the ECtHR. The adoption of a similar approach to the ECtHR <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2042867">strengthens</a> the ECJ's legitimacy and helps to avoid the embarrassment of its judgments possibly being overturned by the ECtHR.</p>

<p>As a consequence, cross-references between the two courts have been increasing over time, <a href="http://www.statewatch.org/news/2012/may/ep-study-ecj-echr.pdf">reaching 57 mentions</a> [PDF] of the ECHR in ECJ judgments over 2010-2011. There seems to be a determination by both EU courts to avoid conflict with and to demonstrate deference to the other court court, contributing to the creation of a <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2042867">"uniform human rights standard."</a></p>

<p>In some cases the ECJ seems indeed to have made use of the right provided by Art. 52(3) CFR, granting more extensive rights than those provided by the ECHR. In these "broadening" cases, the ECJ emphasized that its ruling was meant not in conflict with the ECtHR precedent, but beyond it. By widely referring to the ECtHR precedents, in several cases it recalled the importance of taking it as a starting point, allowing itself to expand the right at stake, but not to depart from it. </p>

<p><strong>ECJ References to ECtHR: Selected Case Law</strong></p>

<p>This attention to ECtHR case law is evident both in cases where the ECJ restricted human rights, adhering to the ECHR minimum standard, and in cases where the ECJ went further, broadening human rights protection. ECJ references to the ECtHR mostly concerned the right to privacy (Art. 8 ECHR) and the right to a fair trial (Art. 6 ECHR) . <br />
In <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62010J0400:EN:NOT">J. McB v L.E.</a> , for example, the ECtHR precedent in <a href="http://echr.ketse.com/doc/56838.00-en-20030902/">Guichard v France</a> was used by the ECJ to give a restrictive interpretation of Art. 7 CFU (corresponding to Art. 8 ECHR). The court expressly stated that "Art. 7 of the Charter must ... be given the same meaning and the same scope as Art. 8(1) of the ECHR, as interpreted by the case-law of the ECHR."  </p>

<p><a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?language=en&num=C-279/09">DEB</a> involved instead an expansion of the right of effective judicial protection. After having engaged in a thorough analysis of ECtHR case law, the ECJ eventually relied mainly on Art. 47 of the charter to expand the right to legal aid also to legal persons and not only to natural persons, thus reaching an outcome that did not clearly emerge from the ECtHR jurisprudence. Also in this case, however, the court devoted wide attention to ECtHR case law: "the meaning and the scope of the guaranteed rights are to be determined not only by reference to the text of the ECHR, but also, inter alia, by reference to the case law of the European Court of Human Rights."<br />
 <br />
In <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62009CJ0092:EN:HTML">Volker</a>, which also involved an expansion of human rights in the area of data protection, the ECJ quoted several ECtHR cases to support a broad interpretation of Art. 7 and 8 CFU, and to determine the scope of the proportionality test concerning justifications for restrictions. </p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>The consequences of the Lisbon developments in EU human rights protection still need to be fully assessed. New light can be shed on these changes, and in particular on the ECJ possibility to expand human rights protection, if they are contextualized in a broader framework of other developments, like the creation of EU citizenship. These tendencies seem to widen the very concept of EU beyond that of a mere economic community. The fact that the European Council has for the first time adopted, in June 2012, a unified Strategic Framework on Human Rights and Democracy, which includes a practical Action Plan, suggests that a general shift of the EU from a purely economic union to a political one might be taking place. If that is the case, the consequences are likely to have far-reaching implications relevant to our daily lives as EU citizens.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Nicholas Caselli, <a href="http://www.law.uchicago.edu">University of Chicago Law School</a> Class of 2015, discusses the circuit split created by <em>Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp v. Sebelius</em> and argues that the right of corporations to impose their religious beliefs was correctly denied...<hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="Caselli.jpg" src="/dateline/Caselli.jpg" width="129" height="213" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>"F</strong></font>or-profit, secular corporations cannot engage in religious exercise." With this sentence, the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit panel in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4499399880942812329">Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Sebelius</a> voted 2-1 to uphold the denial of a preliminary injunction that would have spared Pennsylvania cabinet-maker Conestoga Wood from complying with the women's preventative care provisions of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/patient_protection_and_affordable_care_act_of_2010">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010</a> (ACA). All of Conestoga's voting shares are owned by the Hahn family, Mennonites who firmly object to the use of certain post-fertilization contraceptives. The Hahns argued that portions of the ACA requiring group health insurance plans to cover these contraceptives violated Conestoga's rights under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/chapter-21B">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a> (RFRA) and the First Amendment's <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/free_exercise_clause">free exercise clause</a>. </p>

<p>The Third Circuit, however, reasoned that corporations cannot practice religion in the same way that natural persons can, making further inquiry into the merits of the Hahns' claim unnecessary. By denying Conestoga relief under the RFRA and the free exercise clause, the Third Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/third-circuit-rules-business-cannot-challenge-birth-control-mandate.php">split directly</a> with the US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit's opinion in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5727790453942018265">Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius</a> and sustained a contentious debate &#8212; one likely headed to the US Supreme Court &#8212; over which constitutional rights may legitimately be attributed to corporations.</p>

<p>The Hahns presented two theories under which the court could find corporations like Conestoga capable of exercising religion and, thus, able to escape the preventative care mandate. First, the Hahns attempted to analogize to the recent US Supreme Court decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6233137937069871624">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</a>, which held that government restrictions on corporate political expenditures violated the First Amendment's <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">free speech clause</a> by effectively suppressing political speech. Second, the Hanhs suggested that their personal religious beliefs could indirectly "pass through" to Conestoga. The Third Circuit rightly rejected both of these contentions.</p>

<p>The Hahns' first argument hinged on a tenuous connection between freedom of speech and freedom of religion. In <em>Citizens United</em>, the US Supreme Court voided federal restrictions on corporate independent campaign expenditures, reasoning that the government cannot suppress political speech solely because the speaker is a corporation. The Court relied primarily on existing precedence protecting corporate speech, especially <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3768819597963662504">First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti</a>. In <em>Bellotti</em>, the Court found that certain types of corporate speech &#8212; like natural speech &#8212; facilitate "discussion, debate, and ... dissemination of information and ideas" and are thus protected by the First Amendment.</p>

<p>Yet, <em>Bellotti</em> provided an analytical framework for distinguishing between constitutional rights that corporations can exercise and those that are "purely personal." The <em>Bellotti</em> court wrote that this distinction should flow from the "nature, history, and purpose" of the particular right at issue. For instance, the Supreme Court has held that only natural persons may invoke the privilege against compulsory incrimination or enjoy the right to privacy.</p>

<p>Applying the <em>Bellotti</em> framework, the Third Circuit adequately distinguished corporate free exercise from corporate political speech. Whereas the Supreme Court in <em>Citizens United</em> cited more than twenty cases extending free speech rights to corporations, the Third Circuit could not locate a single case preceding current ACA challenges that granted for-profit corporations free exercise rights. Further, in response to a contention by the Hahns that the First Amendment's free speech and free exercise clauses should be interpreted jointly, the Third Circuit cited case law demonstrating that courts have historically treated the two differently.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Third Circuit's discussion of the free exercise clause's nature and purpose was equally convincing. It looked skeptically on the notion that for-profit, secular corporations &#8212; apart from their owners &#8212; could ever be said to practice religion. Citing the district court's decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10390225281706554853">Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius</a>, the court emphasized: <blockquote>[Corporations] do not pray, worship, observe sacraments or take other religiously-motivated actions separate and apart from the intention and direction of their individual actors.</blockquote>The Third Circuit drew a strong factual distinction here, as recognizing corporate speech is much less unreasonable than recognizing corporate religion. Sending a message into the marketplace of ideas is something directors often accomplish under the corporate name, but praying, worshiping and believing &#8212; those are inherently personal capabilities that may only be exercised by the living.</p>

<p>Still, some may argue that the court's reasoning does not sufficiently distinguish for-profit, secular corporations from religious organizations, the latter of which the Supreme Court has recognized may bring free exercise claims. Yet, the Third Circuit pointed to <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6711345368740496870">Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & School v. EEOC</a>, a recent Supreme Court decision which emphasized that "the text of the First Amendment ... gives special solicitude to the rights of religious organizations." Further, the Third Circuit observed that a non-profit religious organization's sole purpose is to provide a means by which congregation members can practice their faith. In fact, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/501">section 501(c)(3)</a> of the Internal Revenue Code restricts the types of business activities in which religious entities seeking tax-exempt status may engage. Such organizations are restrained from: passing any net earnings onto private individuals or shareholders, attempting to influence litigation, or intervening in political campaigns. For-profit, secular corporations are, of course, not so bound.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the Hahns argued that corporations like Conestoga can vicariously assert their owners' free exercise claims. The theory that a shareholder's constitutional claims can "pass through" to a corporation originated in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5903879132000104786">EEOC v. Townley Engineering & Manufacturing Co.</a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7847571200789185002">Stormans, Inc. v. Selecky</a>. In those cases, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit specifically sanctioned advancement of the ownership group's free exercise claims by closely held corporations. Importantly, the Ninth Circuit found not that a closely held corporation has "rights of its own different from or greater than its owners' rights," but that it merely may function as "the instrument through and by which [its owners] express their religious beliefs."</p>

<p>The Third Circuit refused to adopt the Ninth Circuit's reasoning and held that the Hahns' claims could not "pass through" to Conestoga. Unlike the Ninth Circuit, the Third Circuit emphasized the basic legal distinction between a corporation and its shareholders. As the Supreme Court explained in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3836982515067515134">Cedric Kushner Promotions, Ltd. v. King</a>, "incorporation's basic purpose is to create a distinct legal entity, with legal rights, obligations, powers, and privileges" different from the natural persons who own it. The corporate owner is thus distinct from the corporation itself, even if ownership shares are highly concentrated. As the Third Circuit reasoned, just because a single investor owns all of a corporation's stock, he and the corporation are not legally the same person. Critically, the Hahns' decision to incorporate also granted them limited liability, a benefit deriving from this legal distinction between the corporation and its individual shareholders. The law does not permit the Hahns to embrace the distinction when convenient but to otherwise disregard it. By incorporating, the Hahns accepted "both the advantages and disadvantages of the corporate form." </p>

<p>Ultimately, the Third Circuit's reasoning in <em>Conestoga Wood</em> recalls Chief Justice Marshall's contention in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7985814098766481295">Dartmouth College v. Woodward</a> that "a corporation is an artificial being, invisible, intangible and existing only in contemplation of law." Allowing the owners of a closely held corporation to impose their religious beliefs through the guise of the corporate form marks an unreasonable and unprecedented extension of corporate personhood. Such a holding could potentially permit business decisions motivated by a discriminatory animus to escape unpunished under the cloak of religious freedom. Corporate free exercise claims &#8212; like that brought by the Hahns in Conestoga Wood &#8212; are rightly denied.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Drew F. Cohen, a clerk for the <a href="http://www.constitutionalcourt.org.za/">Constitutional Court of South Africa</a>, discusses the consequences of the Southern African Development Community endorsing Zimbabwe president Robert Mugabe's re-election...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/drewcohen.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>D</strong></font>espite requests from Botswana to open an investigation into voter fraud, southern African leaders closed ranks several weeks ago at a regional summit in Malawi and endorsed the controversial July 31, 2013 Zimbabwe presidential elections, which extended leader Robert Mugabe's 33-year rule by another five years. Malawi President and <a href="http://www.sadc.int/">Southern African Development Community</a> (SADC) chairperson Joyce Banda <a href="http://www.thezimbabwean.co/news/zimbabwe/67819/mugabes-sadc-comrades-endorse-disputed.html">congratulated</a> Mugabe at the SADC conference on the "peaceful and fair polls" and further continued, "We wish to offer you continued support as a member of the family." </p>

                <p>Botswana had <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqDa6sBw1LE">lobbied</a> [video] SADC &#8212; a regional economic bloc of fifteen southern African member states bound by a <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/compilation_democracy/sadcprinc.htm">treaty</a> to act in accordance with the principle of "human rights, democracy and the rule of law" &#8212; to conduct an independent audit of the results after its 80-member election observation team reported evidence of irregularities concerning voter rolls and identification requirements, "as well as credible allegations of people otherwise being denied the right to vote." The treaty empowers SADC to create "appropriate institutions and mechanisms" to support its initiatives &#8212; easily encompassing a commission to investigate instances of voter fraud &#8212; and created a binding tribunal to enforce its findings.</p>

                <p>At the outset, SADC and its tribunal gained a reputation as an effective check against human rights abuses and an important regional mechanism to enforce the rule of law. SADC heads of government relied on the treaty's founding principles of upholding the rule of law and protecting democratic initiatives as the legal basis to suspend Madagascar following a coup in 2009. </p>

                <p>Over its abbreviated lifetime, the tribunal has heard and decided sixteen individual claims of human rights abuses. Most famously, in 2009 the tribunal <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/africa-regional-court-rules-white.php">ruled</a> in favor of white Zimbabwean farmers whose land had been expropriated without compensation by the government of Zimbabwe pursuant to its land redistribution program. Despite protests from the government of Zimbabwe, this June the Constitutional Court of South Africa not only upheld the tribunal's ruling, but also developed the South African common law to empower its domestic courts to enforce rulings of any tribunal where South Africa had an international obligation.</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, SADC's resounding victory in the Zimbabwe farmers' case was short lived. In August 2010, following an effective lobbying campaign by the Zimbabwe government at a SADC leadership meeting, the tribunal was provisionally <a href="http://www.sadc.int/about-sadc/sadc-institutions/tribun/">suspended</a> and eventually stripped of its jurisdiction to hear individual human rights claims.  </p>

                <p>SADC's previous pyrrhic foray into Zimbabwe's internal policies may explain its reluctance to intervene on behalf of Botswana regarding allegations of voter fraud in Mugabe's election. With the recent spate of worrying reports of civil strife in Mozambique and the rebel violence in Bangui earlier this year fresh on their minds, regional leaders were willing to sacrifice democracy for stability and turn a blind eye to an election that, while characterized as peaceful by most accounts, was also widely viewed as marred by serious voting irregularities.  </p>

                <p>In taking this approach, southern African leaders threaten what little popular legitimacy in SADC and its tribunal remains. Consequently, the region stands to lose an important mechanism to hold states accountable to the people they govern.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Caitlin McNamara, Pepperdine University School of Law Class of 2014, shares her first-hand experience and explains the procedural issues surrounding the trials for those accused of the September 11, 2001 attacks...<hr height='1'><br /><font size='3'><strong>T</strong></font>his year will mark the twelfth anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks, yet the five men accused of planning those attacks may not go to trial for years. At Guantanamo, where a military commission has been created to try the accused, the prosecution and defense are still arguing basic procedural issues, like how the defense lawyers can communicate with their clients.</p>

<p>In August, I watched at Guantanamo as days of argument were devoted to preliminary issues such as which witnesses should be compelled to testify, to what types of information parties are entitled, and whether the military commission itself violates the US Constitution. But the proceedings were dominated by constant complaints from defense counsel about a lack of access to important information and attempts to resolve procedural issues. </p>

<p>The prosecution and defense were still arguing over proposed rules about how defense lawyers can write or send mail to their clients. Almost two years ago the defense challenged a set of rules imposed by then base commander Rear Adm. David Woods. At that time, the chief military defense counsel, Marine Col. Jeffrey Colwell, so objected to the rules that he instructed military attorneys under his command not to <a href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-01-11/world/35441313_1_military-attorneys-detainees-civilian-lawyers">comply with them</a>. The Woods orders are still in place and the defense is still abiding by Colonel Colwell's instructions not to comply. They require that the defense submit materials designated privileged attorney-client communications to a "privilege team" for review. This team consists of Defense Department lawyers and intelligence personnel. Colwell wrote in a memo at the time that abiding by the orders would be a violation of the rules of professional conduct. "You can't defend your client without being able to communicate with him confidentially," Colwell <a href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-01-11/world/35441313_1_military-attorneys-detainees-civilian-lawyers">said at the time</a>. "Without that, the system fails." </p>

<p>The issue is not just about who reviews privileged material but also what types of material and sharing of information can be prohibited. The Woods order prohibits "information contraband" that, according to the order, includes information on "[c]urrent political or military events in any country; historical perspectives or discussions on jihadist activities, including information generated or distributed by or on behalf of foreign terrorist organizations, individuals or groups engaged in terrorist activities, to include material such as 'Inspire' magazine." It also includes any information about US government personnel who have been involved in the defendant's detention, both current at Guantanamo and past when they were in secret CIA custody." In short, the Woods order prohibits defense lawyers from exchanging information by mail and discussing with clients activities and personnel that they say are at the heart of the charges against them, hindering their ability to prepare a defense.</p>

<p>Objections over how written communications should be handled have permeated every aspect of the case from the outset. Even before charges are brought in the military commissions system, defendants can argue to the convening authority &#8212; the military official who approves charges &#8212; that even though prosecutors have requested the death penalty, the maximum punishment should be life in prison. Defense teams have argued that the Woods order hampered their ability to effectively communicate with their clients and therefore make such arguments to the convening authority. All five of the 9/11 defendants were held in secret CIA custody and subjected to torture or other ill-treatment, factors that the convening authority may consider when referring charges. A prior convening authority in 2008 <a href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2009-01-14/politics/36830647_1_interrogation-harsh-techniques-qahtani">dismissed charges</a> against another defendant accused of being involved in the September 11 attacks, because he had been subjected to torture in US custody. At the end of the week, though both defense and the prosecution had proposed alternatives to the Woods order, there was still no resolution of the issue and the Woods order remained in place.</p>

<p>Beyond the written communication issue, the military commissions have been plagued with a host of other issues affecting protection of attorney-client communications. In February, defense attorneys <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/02/21/listening">discovered listening devices</a> disguised as smoke detectors in attorney-client meeting rooms. Additionally, proceedings were halted because a courtroom feed to the media and observers that supposedly only the judge was able to control was cut off by an unnamed US agency, presumably the CIA. Then in mid-April, hearings were further delayed by two months because an enormous number of prosecution and defense <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/17/us-usa-guantanamo-delay-idUSBRE93G0YT20130417">files disappeared</a> from the server that both legal teams are required to use to process the highly classified documents in the case. This prompted another instruction from the current chief defense counsel, Air Force Col. Karen Mayberry, to all military defense lawyers under her command, to stop using their government computers for sensitive information. As of last week, problems with the server had still not been fixed. The military judge in the case, Army Col. James Pohl, has warned that <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/08/23/3582084/pentagon-tech-troubles-could-stall.html">he might suspend trial preparation</a> if the government does not fix the problems.</p>

<p>With all these issues unresolved, defense attorneys contend that the current military commission system prevents them from being able to appropriately protect the attorney-client privilege.</p>

<p>These issues would never have arisen if the defendants had been prosecuted in federal court the way US Attorney General Eric Holder announced they would be in November 2009. If problems arise there, federal courts have over 200 years of precedent to rely on, and federal judges have experience trying complex cases, including terrorism cases. Although Congress has barred the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the US for trial, a new proposal to lift those restrictions will be considered by the Senate this fall. Senators considering lifting the ban would be wise to pay attention to the pre-trial proceedings in the military commissions so they can see that the government has created there a justice system that provides no justice at all.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Stephen Richer, <a href="http://www.law.uchicago.edu/">University of Chicago Law School</a> Class of 2015, analyzes the repercussions stemming from the recent New Mexico Supreme Court ruling that prohibits people from discriminating against LGBT individuals as clients, even if it contradicts their religious beliefs...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="SR Headshot.jpg" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/SR%20Headshot.jpg" width="98" height="110" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n August 22, the New Mexico Supreme Court ruled against the freedom of religion. The case, <a href="http://www.metroweekly.com/poliglot/2013/08/new-mexico-supreme-court-rules-photographer-cannot.html">Elane Photography v. Willock</a>, pitted Christian professional photographer Elaine Huguenin against Vanessa Willock and her same-sex partner. When Willock asked Huguenin to photograph her same-sex commitment ceremony, Huguenin declined, stating that the assignment would conflict with her Christian beliefs. The <a href="http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765636407/New-Mexico-photographer-loses-gay-marriage-case.html?pg=1">trial court</a> ruled that Huguenin violated the state's <a href="http://www.nmcpr.state.nm.us/nmac/parts/title09/09.001.0001.htm">Human Rights Act</a> and fined her $7,000. The appeals court <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7488101585095357430">affirmed</a>. So did the <a href="http://www.nmcompcomm.us/nmcases/nmsc/slips/SC33,687.pdf">New Mexico Supreme Court</a> [PDF], unanimously, on August 22.</p>

<p>There are many disturbing aspects of this decision: it cuts against free religious practice (the main argument made by lead defense counsel <a href="http://www.alliancedefendingfreedom.org/page/elane-photography?referral=I0813RREP">Alliance Defending Freedom</a>); it <a href="http://www.cato.org/publications/legal-briefs/elane-photography-v-willock">compels speech</a> (the argument made by Eugene Volokh, Dale Carpenter and the Cato Institute, an organization that supports gay rights and marriage equality); and it reinforces the simple but toxic idea that private businesses can't actually make private decisions.  </p>

<p>In addition to the anti-freedom consequences above, the decision also promises to hurt the gay-equality movement. This seems counterintuitive at first as the gay plaintiff won the case, but it doesn't take a novel theory to realize how such a ruling could damage the movement.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/blog/plank/110949/the-only-way-the-supreme-court-can-help-gay-marriage-staying-out-it">Jonathan Rauch</a>, one of the leading and one of the most reasonable voices of the gay-equality movement, has argued for over 10 years that the gay marriage movement is much better won through popular votes and electoral branches than it is through the courts. Why? Rauch argues that if the courts impose gay marriage on parts of the country that are not yet ready for it, opponents will solidify and lash out in retaliation.  </p>

<p>This is exactly what happened in the landmark abortion case of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12334123945835207673">Roe v. Wade</a>. In a speech at the University of Chicago Law School in May, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/11/ruth-bader-ginsburg-roe-v-wade_n_3261187.html">Justice Ginsburg</a> cast serious doubt on the wisdom of the <em>Roe</em> decision: "[t]hat was my concern, that the court had given opponents of access to abortion a target to aim at relentlessly ... [m]y criticism of <em>Roe</em> is that it seemed to have stopped the momentum that was on the side of change." Perhaps as a result, public opinion on abortion has hardly changed over the past 40 years, and many proponents of abortion rights think that the movement has lost ground recently.</p>

<p>Certainly the same thing could happen to the gay marriage movement. Gay marriage support has risen consistently over the past 40 years, but it just recently creeped <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/163730/back-law-legalize-gay-marriage-states.aspx?utm_source=google&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=syndication">over 50 percent</a>; 52 percent of Americans now support gay marriage while 43 percent oppose it. Some regions, particularly <a href="http://www.freedomtomarry.org/states/">13 states and Washington, DC</a>, might not react negatively to pro-gay marching orders from the US Supreme Court. But others would, and, as with <em>Roe</em>, this could cement opposition and prompt hostility. Support for marriage equality is <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/01/same-sex-marriage-south">below 30 percent</a> in <a href="http://www.policymic.com/articles/40967/7-states-that-may-never-legalize-gay-marriage">seven states</a>: Mississippi, West Virginia, South Carolina, Kentucky, Georgia, Utah and Tennessee.</p>

<p>Return now to the New Mexico ruling where the numbers are much more drastic. This Ramussen poll found that <a href="http://m.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/business/general_business/july_2013/85_think_christian_photographer_has_right_to_turn_down_same_sex_wedding_job">85 percent</a> of those polled "Think Christian Photographer Has Right to Turn Down Same-Sex Wedding Job."</p>

<p>Negative reaction is already all over blogs like <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2013/08/23/lawyer-for-new-mexico-photographer-forcing-her-to-work-at-a-gay-wedding-violates-her-right-of-free-expression/">Hot Air</a>, <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/08/22/New-Mexico-Court-Christian-Photographer-Cannot-Refuse-Gay-Marriage-Ceremony-Next-Stop-U-S-Supreme-Court">Breitbart</a>, <a href="http://therightscoop.com/tyranny-new-mexico-supreme-court-says-wedding-photographers-cant-refuse-gay-weddings/">The Right Scoop</a>, <a href="http://radio.foxnews.com/toddstarnes/top-stories/nm-court-says-christian-photographers-must-compromise-beliefs.html">Fox News</a> and <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/356498/nm-supreme-court-finds-refusing-photograph-gay-wedding-illegal-sterling-beard">National Review Online</a>. Much of the coverage is limited to criticism of the specific reasoning of the decision, but other pieces portray the ruling as yet another win for the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/romney-obama-waging-war-on-religion/2012/08/09/192c4e02-e213-11e1-a25e-15067bb31849_blog.html">"homosexual agenda"</a>&#8212;this supposed agenda including a whole buffet of progressive aims including, as some allege, a war on religion. Such fears could derail right-of-center and moderate voters who had previously been on the gay-equality bandwagon thus far.  </p>

<p>Others worry that gay marriage will soon be inescapable. People may support gay marriage in theory, but prefer to keep these marriages out of their own personal lives. The New Mexico decision will cause some concern among people that they may not be allowed to opt-out of performing or otherwise participating in gay marriage ceremonies, like Elane Photography, and suffer legal repercussions due to their professional and personal choices. Perhaps, they wonder, it's best to nip gay marriage in the bud. </p>

<p>Of course, courts are not pure political institutions, nor are they puppets to public opinion. But if pro-gay equality sentiment is something that motivated the court, the legislators responsible for the law or the individuals and groups bringing the case and filing in the case, then plans for equality are likely to backfire. Before they strip more private individuals of their religious liberties or private businesses of their economic liberties, these groups, legislators and judges should stop and ask themselves what backlash these hugely unpopular laws may have on the overall gay equality movement.</p>

		<title>The Use of Force Against the People of Syria Will Be a Serious Violation of International Law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://doebbler.net/about/">Curtis Doebbler</a> of Webster University and Geneva School of Diplomacy and International Relations argues that the use of military force against Syria would constitute a violation of international law...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/curtisdoebbler.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>V</strong></font>iolence has been the greatest threat to human rights throughout the past two decades. Although the cold war between superpowers ended, the illegal use of force by the US has killed an estimated 3 million people in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya. Now the US seeks to use force against Syria.   </p>

<p><strong>Threat or Use of Force</strong></p>

<p>The threat or use of force between sovereign states constitutes a serious violation of the international law enshrined in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and in customary international law that has been <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/70/9619.pdf">recognized</a> [PDF] as <em>jus cogens</em> by the International Court of Justice. </p>

<p>When, on August 31, 2013, President Barack Obama <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/08/31/statement-president-syria">said</a>, "I have decided that the United States should take military action against Syrian regime targets," the US threatened the use of force against the sovereign state of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=syria">Syria</a>. It is an imminent threat because the president said that force could be used "tomorrow, or next week, or one month from now."  The imminent threat has since been repeated by the US Secretary of State, the US Secretary of Defense, and US Admiral Jonathan Greenert, a naval operations officer in the US Navy, who <a href="http://rt.com/usa/navy-admiral-mediterranean-syria-483/">said</a> that all the military elements were in place to strike at Syria immediately.  </p>

<p>If force is used against the people of Syria in violation of international law, Syria will have the legal right to use necessary and proportional force in self-defense. Moreover, once Syria declares it has been attacked all other states will also have a legal right to aid Syria in its self-defense using all necessary and proportional means to end the attack. There is no requirement that a state aiding Syria, by, for example, attacking US military assets somewhere in the world, has been affected by the attack on Syria.</p>

<p>Under customary international law <a href="http://www.vjil.org/assets/pdfs/vol49/issue2/49_473-505.pdf">reflected</a> [PDF] in the Caroline Incident involving the US, Syria or any other state could also likely act to prevent an imminent attack by the US. Again, it is not necessary that an assisting state is affected, but merely that Syria has a well-founded fear of imminent attack. Thus a consequence the US threat to use of force against Syria is that the people of the US are in mortal danger. Moreover, the measurement of necessary and proportional in an anticipatory act of self-defense could take into account the US record of using "scorched earth" and "shock and awe" means of warfare.</p>

<p>The US might put forward several legal justifications for the use of force. The UN Charter limits these exceptions to those in Chapter VII and <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter7.shtml">Article 51</a>. To invoke the Chapter VII justification there must be both a determination by the UN Security Council that measures not involving the use of force have failed and an authorization for the use of force. For the US to claim it is acting in self-defense under article 51 of the Charter, the US or one of its allies must be the subject of an armed attack. If this is not the case, as appears to be the situation concerning Syria, this justification is not available. </p>

<p>Considering that President Obama seemed to think otherwise, it is relevant to note that it is a long-established principle of international law, that domestic law or domestic political positions can never serve as a <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/draft%20articles/9_6_2001.pdf">justification </a> [PDF] for a violation of international law. A vote by the US Congress to authorize the use of force is irrelevant under international law. Similarly, the justification of "humanitarian intervention" or the "responsibility to protect" have never been accepted as a justification for the use of force and have often rejected by the US itself. </p>

<p>It is noteworthy, that states recognizing the illegal consequences of an act of aggression or rendering assistance to use of force in violation of international law are themselves violating international law. All states, <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter1.shtml">according</a> to the UN Charter, are instead obliged to take all necessary action to prevent the violation of international law.</p>

<p><strong>Individual Responsibility</strong></p>

<p>In addition to the responsibility of states, any person ordering the use of force in violation of international law commits the international crime of aggression and should be punished by any State that can obtain jurisdiction of that person. President Barack Obama, by threatening the use of force against the people of Syria in his public address on August 31, 2013 admitted that he is committing the crime of aggression. If the US carries out an attack against Syria, Obama will not only be responsible for attempting the crime of aggression, but also of committing it. </p>

<p>The consequence of Obama's ill-chosen or merely arrogantly muttered words is that he should be treated as a war criminal by the international community. This requires many states to investigate him, and, if they find sufficient evidence, to arrest him, and eventually to try him and punish him if he is found guilty. The prospect of having not only a US President, but also a Nobel-Prize winner behind bars for international crimes, is unfortunate, but it is what the rule of international law requires when such hideous crimes have been attempted or committed. </p>

<p><strong>Chemical Weapons</strong></p>

<p>The US claims that Syria has used chemical weapons against its own people has not been confirmed. The US has refused to provide its alleged evidence to the public despite Russian requests. Instead, the US has merely called upon us to believe its assessment even before the UN inspectors have made their determinations. </p>

<p>At the same time, Carla del Ponte, a member of the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria, has <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22425058">stated</a> publicly on Swiss TV that there "strong, concrete suspicions" that rebels used chemical weapons and no evidence that the government used chemical weapons. A senior US government official <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/ap-sources-intelligence-weapons-slam-dunk-20102965">told</a> the Associated Press that the US lacked significant evidence linking Assad to chemical weapon use. On September 3, 2013, the Russian government provided the UN and the public a dossier that strongly indicates that foreign-backed Syrian rebels <a href="http://rt.com/news/chemical-aleppo-findings-russia-417/">used chemical weapons</a>. This dossier is based on film footage, tested samples containing evidence of chemical weapons, and interviews. It contains detailed examinations of the chemical weapons materials that have been collected in a variety of alleged situations of their use and concludes that the evidence is consistent with use by the foreign-backed rebels in Syria, not the government. Despite this important finding the report has been almost completely ignored by the UN weapons inspectors, the US, and the mainstream media. </p>

<p>On August 31, 2013 the Syrian government provided the UN inspectors a dossier with evidence of three chemical weapons attacks that the government claimed were carried out by the foreign-backed rebels. Nevertheless, the UN inspectors left Syria after having received this information without investigating it, although they vowed to return to investigate the information a future unspecified date.</p>

<p>As noted above, even if Syria is found to have used chemical weapons against its own people, something it strongly and consistently denies, the use of force against the people of Syria, an even more grave internationally wrongful act, cannot be justified. The <a href="http://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention/">Chemical Weapons Convention</a>, which the US has ratified, states that any disputes concerning the subject of the treaty must be resolved in accordance the UN Charter, which prohibits the use of force. The suggestion that the use of chemical weapons by Syria is a justification for the use force is wrong in law. </p>

<p><strong>What States Can Do in the Face of US Threats to Use Force Against Syria</strong></p>

<p>In the circumstances, the US (and allies) have no legal justification for the use of force. The US president did not even try to assert a legal justification, but instead asserted the unilateral right of the US to violate international law whenever it wishes to do so based on domestic interests. Such a position is a grave threat to the rule of international law.  </p>

<p>As time is running out, states can take steps to uphold the rule of international law, as Russian president Vladimir Putin and several other world leaders at the G20 Summit have done this, by demanding that there be no aggression against the people of Syria and that all efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement be exhausted. They can also call for a vote in the UN Security Council, the General Assembly or even the UN Human Rights Council to condemn the threat and use of force by the US and a very small group of allies. </p>

<p>In addition, states can move to isolate the US and to hold it accountable for its threats to violate the Charter of the United Nations as well as any act it undertakes in violation of international law.</p>

<p>And finally, all states can take steps to investigate, and if, necessary prosecute, any state official in any state that threatens, orders, implements, or otherwise facilitates the use of force against the people of Syria in violation of international law as having committed or contributed to the international crime of aggression.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://journalism.missouri.edu/staff/sandy-davidson/">Sandra Davidson</a>, of the University of Missouri School of Law, says that by failing to provide shield protection at the Federal level, the US risks both a chilling effect on investigative journalism and an increased potential for the uncontrolled release of information ...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/sandydavidson.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>J</strong></font>ournalists who are performing their watchdog function need a federal shield law. The experience of James Risen provides an <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2013/07/20/should-the-justice-department-drop-its-subpoena-of-james-risen/">example</a>. In order to gain meaningful protection, journalists arguably need a new argument to augment that of "free flow of information." </p>

<p>In May, US senators Charles Schumer (D-New York) and Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) introduced S. 987, titled "<a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c113:S.987:">Free Flow of Information Act of 2013</a>." This is another in a long line of bills introduced over the years to provide a federal shield law to protect journalists from government forcing them to reveal their sources. It proposes a qualified shield law.</p>

<p>On July 12, while announcing "revised media guidelines" for the Department of Justice, Attorney General Eric Holder <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2013/July/13-ag-783.html">said</a>: "[W]e continue to support the passage of media shield legislation." On July 17, the senators amended their bill to incorporate and expand those Department of Justice guidelines.</p>

<p>Two days later, on July 19, the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit announced in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8685665258349532825">United States v. Sterling</a> the unsurprising <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11121598123170849746">decision</a> that journalist James Risen, who had been subpoenaed to reveal a source, has no constitutional shield. Nor, of course, does Risen have a federal statutory shield. The opinion, written by Chief Judge Gregory Traxler, cited the 5-4 decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11598860258825518787">Branzburg v. Hayes</a> to overturn the lower court's ruling that Risen had a qualified reporter's privilege.</p>

<p>One of Risen's sources for his book <a href="http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=r5dCFeTbMY4C&oi=fnd&pg=PP16&dq=%22state+of+war%22+risen&ots=Brtvq5OSzI&sig=AdAX86IXZAMP3ajiz4yBnWcdex8#v=onepage&q=%22state%20of%20war%22%20risen&f=false">State of War</a> was former CIA agent <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/jud/sterling/">Jeffrey Sterling</a>. As the Fourth Circuit said, a grand jury handed down an indictment after finding probable cause that "Sterling illegally disclosed classified information about a covert CIA operation pertaining to the Iranian nuclear weapons operation to James Risen, for publication in a book written by Risen."</p>

<p>The lower court had said, in part, "Rather than explaining why the government's need for Risen's testimony outweighs the qualified reporter's privilege, the government devotes most of its energy to arguing that the reporter's privilege does not exist in criminal proceedings that are brought in good faith." The court thought Risen's testimony unnecessary, saying in <em>Sterling</em>, "Under the specific facts of this case... the government has evidence equivalent to Risen's testimony." </p>

<p>But the Fourth Circuit used <em>Branzburg</em> to side with the government that there is no qualified reporter's privilege for reporters subpoenaed to provide information to good-faith grand juries. The Court said in <em>Branzburg</em>: "[W]e cannot seriously entertain the notion that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> protects a newsman's agreement to conceal the criminal conduct of his source, or evidence thereof, on the theory that it is better to write about crime than to do something about it." As for the argument that sources might dry up without a reporter's privilege, the court said: "Estimates of the inhibiting effect of such subpoenas on the willingness of informants to make disclosures to newsmen are widely divergent and to a great extent speculative."  </p>

<p>Perhaps it is time to consider a new argument for shield law, one other than the "free flow of information" argument the Supreme Court rejected as too "speculative." The "free flow" argument says that if sources fear that journalists will renege on their confidentiality promise when faced with imprisonment, sources will clam up and information will dry up. Of course, many in government would like sources to do just that: dry up instead of leaking classified information.</p>

<p>But this "free flow of information" argument seems based on an antiquated model-on an old system of communication crushed by technology. No longer is it a question of whether the information will flow.  It is a question of how it will flow.</p>

<p>Will information flow to the public after being mediated by professional journalists? Or will sources choose to disseminate information unmediated? In short, will sources dump information onto the Internet without giving it the scrutiny and, in some cases, the careful redaction that responsible journalists give?</p>

<p>This is a problem the government should consider: If sources fear that journalists, pressured by the threat of jail, will reveal their identities, then sources may take the safer route-for them-of anonymously dumping information on the Internet. The information will flow all too freely. It is journalists who will, in a sense, dry up because they will not be bathed in information by their sources. The journalists' mediating function will be obliterated as unredacted information flows across portals not envisioned by the Supreme Court or anybody else in 1972.</p>

<p>Modern technology stands the "free flow of information" argument on its head. If the journalists' function of mediating information in responsible ways dries up, the information from sources will arguably flow even more freely; unredacted, unmediated, unleashable once loose on the Internet.</p>

<p>This creates an anomaly: Protection of government secrets might well be enhanced by giving reporters shield protection. If potential leakers (sources) have more confidence that journalists would not be forced by government to reveal sources' identities, then they might feel more comfortable going through journalists and be less likely to dump unmediated information.</p>

<p>When Daniel Ellsberg went through reporters at <em>The New York Times</em> to leak the "Pentagon Papers," he perhaps had little choice. It was not that easy to disseminate information in 1971. But now it is easy: Just a little bit of uploading, and the job is done.  </p>

<p>Determined leakers do have a choice, but many leakers have still been going through journalists, such as <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=snowden">Edward Snowden</a> did with Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald. Arguably, this is a practice that should be encouraged, given the alternative.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/classes/econ362/hallam/readings/rawl_justice.pdf">A Theory of Justice</a> [PDF], philosopher John Rawls espoused a principal that seems applicable when talking about leakers and shield protection-the "maximum minimum" or "maximin." Basically, Rawls says rational people should aim for the best possible worst-case scenario (the minimum). Here, the maximin entails using journalists as mediators.</p>

<p>The government dislikes leakers. The Obama Administration has used the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-37">Espionage Act of 1917</a> to prosecute them more than has any other administration, and it has been going after journalists such as Risen with an alacrity never before seen in this country.</p>

<p>In May 2011, Attorney General Eric Holder authorized issuance of a subpoena to Risen. The government's goal? Have Risen identify his source. Note that a federal grand jury had already returned an indictment for violation of the Espionage Act against Risen's source, ex-CIA agent Jeffrey Sterling, in December 2010 without Risen's disclosing him as a source. The indictment included details of phone conversations and email exchanges between Sterling and the unnamed journalist.  </p>

<p>Another Risen source indicted without Risen having identified him is Thomas Drake, a former National Security Agency senior executive. Late in 2005, reporters Risen and Eric Lichtblau <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/16/politics/16program.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0">wrote</a> in <em>The New York Times</em> that the NSA was violating US law through warrantless eavesdropping on US citizens' phone conversations. Reportedly, Bush Administration officials met with <em>Times</em> editors prior to publication, trying to get the story spiked. Instead, the story got delayed for a year, until after the 2004 presidential election. The published story said it omitted "some information that administration officials argued could be useful to terrorists."</p>

<p>A Maryland grand jury indicted Drake. The government sought his conviction on ten felony charges, including violating the Espionage Act, but ultimately Drake pleaded guilty to a single misdemeanor charge of exceeding authorized use of a government computer. Under the agreement, Drake received no jail time. On July 15, 2011, from the bench, Judge Richard D. Bennett called it "unconscionable" for the government to put Drake through "four years of hell" before folding on all felony charges.</p>

<p>If leakers such as Sterling, Drake, and Snowden go to journalists, that is not the best scenario from the government's perspective, but it is definitely not the worst, either. The worst scenario is leakers posting their material directly online with no professional intermediary.</p>

<p>In short, Rawls' "maximin" in this situation is leakers leaking to professional journalists instead of posting leaks directly online without mediation.  </p>

<p>To encourage leakers to go through journalists, we need absolute shield protection.</p>

<p>We need an absolute shield, not a qualified shield that lets judges do balancing. Judith Miller spent 85 days in jail when she refused to name the source in the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9102816748462448364">Valerie Plame</a> CIA-outing case. She had not even used the name in a story. Two opinions made clear Miller would have gone to jail despite balancing. Judge Thomas Hogan <a href="http://www.justice.gov/archive/osc/documents/2006_02_03_opinion.pdf">said</a> [PDF] in Miller's case: "[T]he Court of Appeals ... echoed this Court's conclusion that the Special Counsel's ex parte evidentiary submission would be able to meet even the most ... stringent of balancing tests." Professional "watchdog" journalists should be encouraged, not subpoenaed. Where the watchdog is dead or chained up so it cannot function, information will still flow. But then the flow will be more like a surge of storm water than like a more tempered flow that has been filtered through professional journalists.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://gjk-ks.org/repository/docs/enver_hasani_eng.pdf">Enver Hasani</a> of the University of Prishtina in Kosovo, argues that regime change in Syria will represent a profound geopolitical shift...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/enverhasani.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n the <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">past two years</a> we have grown accustomed to the violence in Syria. However, the latest reaction of the Western world towards the massive poisoning of Syrian citizens, <em>hors de combat</em>, seems to have awakened the dead of Dante's Purgatory. It remains to be seen if this reaction will merely be a Prayer for the Dead, a recollection, as it were, of the temporary innocence called Syrian Purgatory.  </p>

<p>It was obvious since the beginning of the violence in Syria that this fierce and permanent conflict could not continue the way it started, and that it will become more brutal and primitive. Few believed, however, that in such a short time the world would witness the heinous scene of Syrian civilians dying of asphyxiation caused by the <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-rights-chief-condemns-syria-chemical-weapon-allegations.php">chemical weapons</a> of the current regime in Damask. Others who have carefully observed the conflict recognize that this Purgatory of "Arab Spring," will also be one for Western conscience itself, whereby global leaders will wait in line, as in Dante's "Divine Comedy," to be purified of the sins of past years' erroneous policy towards Syria.</p>

<p>The current situation in Syria reflects <em>realpolitik</em> considerations, because the regime change in Syria will represent a profound geopolitical shift. This shift could, more than any other event since the end of the Cold War, finally stabilize the current, broken geopolitical parameters, both regional and worldwide. </p>

<p>As for Europe, the fall of the dictatorial regime in Syria would imply more security and less Wahhabi oxygen in the Middle East. In fact, the end of Bashar al-Assad would mark, in effect, the coronation of the "Arab Spring," measurable along parameters used for the wars for human dignity waged in Europe and worldwide. </p>

<p>After the conflict in Syria started beside serious regime tremors in Egypt, most people thought the conflict was about regime change or a change in the style of governance, easily achievable according to the tested models in other Arab-Islamic countries. Others thought, at worst, there would be a repetition of the Libyan scenario. It turned out that all views were wrong, as the entire "Arab Spring" seemed homogeneous, uniform and lacking in internal structural change. The differences within the countries covered by the "Arab Spring" were in fact very exceptional and structural, conditioned at the same time by the identity factors of the population of these countries as well as geostrategic and political factors.               </p>

<p><strong>Identity factors</strong><br />
 <br />
In the "Arab Spring" context, the identity factor implicates key lines which shape primary identities of the people and countries involved in it. As such, the lines do not essentially change under the influence of other geostrategic and political factors. In line with this, there are two delineation lines of the identities of the countries and nations involved in the "Arab Spring": the Sunni and the Shiia line of the basic identity. These identity lines were suppressed during the Cold War period, appearing as if they did not exist at all. In fact, the new balance of powers is being redefined in this part of the world, bringing back the domination of the majority Sunni in this region. This is because during the Cold War, the Arab-Islamic world countries have functioned according to the ideological recipes created not by former colonial masters but from the ex-Soviet Union.</p>

<p>The model of an Arab-Islamic state has been a mixture of the extreme left with the (ideological) teachings of Qur'an. The latter, that is the interpretation of Qur'an from the Soviet ideological point of view, along with the Palestinian issue, has served most of the time as an argument to maintain the anti-Semitic and the anti-Western agenda in the regional and global scale. Forging of this model of state by the Soviets resulted in  basic identities being "frozen" putting in the forefront ideological side of the Arab-Islamic regimes instead. </p>

<p>After the collapse of the Soviet empire, delineation of serious and profound differences of these societies gradually became more lucid along the Sunni and Shiia lines, which have outlived any ideological or other dissimilarity created by the past. This fundamental identity distinction makes the "Arab Spring" very hard to understand and to shape it in accordance with other similar "springs" which took place elsewhere in Europe. The process of democratization in Europe, however, or in Egypt and Tunisia for that matter, profoundly differs from that in Syria, Iraq, etc. In the latter cases the conflict is based on entirely opposed identities, like in the case of Yugoslavia, with an attribute of war for territory.    </p>

<p><strong>Geostrategic and political factors</strong></p>

<p>Among the political factors which have shaped the current conflicts of the "Arab Spring," it is worth mentioning the modeling of these countries after the State of Commissars of the Soviet era. In this context, the name of the Ba'ath Party in addition to other Soviet satellite parties of the region come to mind. These party-states have dominated the political life of these countries for decades. This political model, imposed in these countries, has been a result of the geostrategic factors of that time: during the process of decolonization after the World War II, the Soviet Union took the leadership in filling the vacuum created after the withdrawal of the ex-colonial masters of the West. The latter, compromised as a result of the colonial politics, remained in defensive and incapable to replenish the vacuum that they left behind. This political cover up was ruined along with the Soviet empire after the year 1990, leaving totally exposed the pro-Soviet Arab-Islamic regimes. This remained so at least until the mid 1990s, that is, throughout a time in which Russia were not able to recuperate from the trauma caused by the fall of the Soviet empire. After this period, Russia started her gradual approach to its former satellite states in the Arab-Islamic world. This return of Russia implied the return to old policies of the balance of powers and their weighing, as opposed to the old rivals of the West. </p>

<p>Countries of this region, Syria and Libya above all, approached Russia too. They opposed politics of the West in the former Yugoslavia, China, Middle East and elsewhere in order to show loyalty towards their ex-master, consolidating at the same time repressive leftist regimes (with exception of Egypt and Yemen). Afraid of intimidation by the return of Russia in regional and worldwide politics, even some pro-Western countries of the Arab-Islamic world aligned themselves with Russian policies, mainly in silence. The result was seen in their foreign policy: regionally they strove for dominance, endangering the vital American and Western interests in the region..</p>

<p>This behavior towards the world as well as the continuation of the excessive repression against their citizens forged the preconditions for the outbreak of the civil discontent and unrest in these countries. The manner in which this discontent was expressed differed widely depending on the identity fabric in these countries: as it was expected, the bloodiest expression occurred there where the minority ruled the majority.</p>

<p>While in other countries the "Arab Spring" was achieved through ideological clashes and profound ideological transformation, in the case of Syria something like that was not imaginable. This was so mainly because the ideologically charged minority in Syria holds the grip on power so that every concession would have a deep geostrategic influence in the region as whole. Ousting the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad does not represent an ideological change in the regime. It does represent a change of power over a territory and final loss of authority of the illegitimate leaders in the region for quite the time to come. As strange as it may sound, after the overthrow of the Syrian regime, Iran will experience a true "Arab Spring", on a more civilized scale than seen elsewhere until present, due to the fact that it is change in Syria, not Iran, that is key to solving the crisis in this part of the world. Hezbollah was founded in Iran but its growth and feeding was perpetuated Syria. </p>

<p>Present within Syria are intertwined age-long identity conflicts, deeply molded by Russian politics which aim to restore Russian influence in the region. The Syrian regime holds on its shoulders all these contradictions, which explains its reaction with chemical weapons against its citizens and deranged reaction to use every means at its disposal to remain in power. The Syrian regime has destroyed everyone who dares to get in its way, because compared to Gaddafi and Milosevic, Bashar al-Assad does not have a place where he can find shelter from criminal justice as he represents the epitome of the rule of minority over majority. </p>

<p>The war in Syria is not a war for regime change but for the total change of the geopolitics in the region. The "Road to Damascus" is not a road "for more light," as in the Caravaggio's painting which reflects the biblical tale on Saint Paul. This is not a road for good but a Purgatory of the "Arab Spring": the guilt of the Western countries and their allies until today might be temporary only if now, just right now, the regime in Damascus is overthrown. If this is not done, then the road to Damascus will be a real hell of the "Arab Spring" for a simple reason that the human misery which is being created in Syria will be filled for sure by the Wahhabi political Islam.     </p>

<p>Intervention against the regime in Damascus now, and only now, would bring stability to the region for many years to come, since it would generate a new geopolitical map and would give meaning to the "Arab Spring" by making it equal to other "post-Communist springs" undertaken elsewhere. Only the intervention at this moment, now and not later, would consolidate positions of the Syrian rebels, who are more open-minded towards the values of the Western liberal democracies. Above all, overthrowing of the Assad's regime would permanently close the doors to creating a political regime simulated according to the Wahhabi Islam. </p>

<p>What will be the format of intervention, alone or with other allies, it matters the least. It would be good if together and with as much allies as possible, but even without them it does not matter very much, since after all the opponents of the military intervention against the actual Syrian regime aside from the harsh words and critics have no other option or a political alternative.</p>

		<title>US Use of Limited Force in Syria Can Be Lawful Under the UN Charter</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/main.asp?PID=34">Jordan Paust</a> of the University of Houston Law Center provides several legal justifications under the UN Charter for the use of force in Syria...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/jordanpaust.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>S</strong></font>ome argue that a US use of armed force in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=syria">Syria</a> would violate the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/index.shtml">United Nations Charter</a> in the absence of a UN Security Council authorization or a valid US claim of self-defense. However, what the Charter expressly denies and permits is far more complex and there could be at least seven claims for lawful US use of force arising out of the Syrian context. </p>

<p>First, not every use of armed force is prohibited in the text of <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter1.shtml">Article 2(4)</a> of the Charter, which expressly covers only three types of force: (1) that used "against" the "territorial integrity" of a "state," (2) that used "against" the "political independence" of a "state," and (3) that which is "in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations." 	</p>

<p>In the special context of an ongoing belligerency in Syria and significant outside recognition of the Syrian National Council (SNC) as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people, a limited use of force by the US against the Assad regime's military capabilities in response to a criminal use of chemical weapons would not simplistically be against the territorial integrity of Syria or the political independence of the Syrian people. On balance, it would be consistent with major purposes of the Charter, such as the need to serve peace, security, self-determination of people, and human rights.  </p>

<p>Second, ongoing consent to US use of force by the SNC (as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people) serves as an independent but related basis for permissibility whether or not the US acts to support the SNC. Consent from the legitimate representative of a people is a critical feature of context that must be addressed for adequate and policy-serving legal decision. As <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2272291">noted</a> in a prior writing [by the author], consent by the legitimate representative of a people engaged in a self-determination struggle provides sufficient legal justification. Support of a people against armed attacks by a government can also involve claims regarding collective self-defense consistent with <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter7.shtml">Article 51</a> of the Charter: a third type of claim. A fourth claim can rest on consent from a "belligerent" in the context of a traditional civil war (as opposed to a mere "insurgent" under international law). Support of a belligerent would constitute an act of war against the other party to a civil war, but so would use of armed force by the US against the Assad regime under any of the seven possible claims identified.</p>

<p>More generally, a reading of Article 2(4) of the Charter that ignores the clearly malleable nature of the text, an express reference to what are the many purposes of the UN, and special features of context would not always serve human dignity and the needs of humanity in an ever increasingly interdependent world. Significantly, nothing in the text of the Charter prohibits "all" or "every" use of armed force, nor does the phrase "any use of force" appear in Article 2(4). For this reason, a textually-sound and policy-serving approach to interpretation of Article 2(4) would not automatically rule out every use of force in every social context. An essential focus of the UN Charter includes the duty to promote universal respect for and observance of human rights, the dignity and worth of each human being, and self-determination of peoples.</p>

<p>If NATO or the League of Arab States authorizes the use of force, Article 52 of the Charter would allow the use of "regional action" for the "maintenance of regional peace and security" when the Security Council is veto-deadlocked and is unable to control "enforcement action" under <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter8.shtml">Article 53</a>, as in the case of Kosovo under an authorization from NATO and during the Cuban Missile Crisis under an authorization from the OAS. Such an authorization would provide a fifth type of claim to use force consistently with the Charter.</p>

<p>A sixth claim can involve use of force as part of collective self-defense under Article 51 of the Charter in response to armed attacks by the Assad regime against Turkey, which began last year. A seventh claim might involve UN General Assembly authorization under a <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/dhl/landmark/pdf/ares377e.pdf">Uniting For Peace resolution</a> [PDF] if such a resolution is later approved. A UN study notes that the General Assembly had invoked such a resolution ten times by 2008.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Paul Juzdan, <a href="http://law.shu.edu/">Seton Hall University School of Law</a> Class of 2014, is the author of a series commenting on the Syrian civil war. In the first part, Juzdan explains and explores the character of the opposition groups in Syria...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="Juzdan.JPG" src="/dateline/Juzdan.JPG" width="120" height="180" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n September 5, 2013, the <em>New York Times</em> ran an article entitled "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/05/world/middleeast/brutality-of-syrian-rebels-pose-dilemma-in-west.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0">Brutality of Syrian Rebels Posing Dilemma in West</a>". The <em>Times</em> exhibited a picture above the article, showing a group of Syrian rebels with firearms standing above shirtless prisoners. In a video posted on the <em>New York Times</em> website, the rebels are heard reciting what the article refers to as "a bitter revolutionary verse." Finally all seven Syrian army soldiers are shot and buried in unmarked graves. This article hauntingly raises the question that has plagued the West since the uprisings began in March of 2011, when a group of young boys from Daraa were <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/01/world/meast/syria-crisis-beginnings/index.html">arrested</a> for writing anti-government graffiti on a school wall: who are the rebels? The US government has had difficulty identifying pro-democracy rebels versus al-Qaeda affiliated extremist groups. Numerous reports, issued by a wide range of news outlets, have suggested that al-Qaeda has been playing a strong role in the ongoing strife. For example, <a href="http://stream.wsj.com/story/latest-headlines/SS-2-63399/SS-2-194723/">The Wall Street Journal</a> issued a report on March 21, 2013, indicating that a terrorist act, which targeted a renowned Syrian scholar and top Sunni preacher, "was probably the work of Islamist groups within the opposition." <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/21/world/meast/syria-nusra-front-rise/index.html?hpt=wo_t3">CNN</a>, in early 2013, echoed a similar concern.   </p>

<p>In its primary stages the Syrian protests seemed to fall squarely within the broader Arab Spring paradigm. According to James J. Gelvin, author of <em>The Arab Uprisings: What Everyone Needs to Know</em>, the opposition consisted of five main components:<ol><br />
	<li>spontaneous, mostly peaceful crowds;<li>pro-democracy, pro-human rights and social media groups such as the Facebook Syrian Revolution 2011, <a href="http://shaam.org/">Sham News Network</a>, <a href="http://al-insan.ca/2012/04/03/the-syrian-uprising-and-the-counter-revolution/">Insan</a> and Sawasiah and Syrian Observatory for Human Rights;<li>"Local Coordination Committees;"<li>the "traditional opposition," which included a number of Kurdish and tribal leaders, dissident politicians and the Muslim Brotherhood; and<li>army deserters.</li><br />
</ol> The groups Gelvin describes formed a reasonable, pro-democracy force that, through the eyes of western democracies, would seem worthy of support &#8212; worthy enough to prompt <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20307668">meetings</a> between leaders of the Syrian National Coalition and officials from nations in the Arab world and the West. The Syrian National Council, the Coalition's predecessor, was formed in August of 2011, insisting that the opposition could flourish without violence. This hope was short-lived; in October of 2011, members of the council feared that the Syrian opposition would develop into a Libya-type military operation. The council's <a href="http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?newsId=261271">spokeswoman Bassma Kodmani</a>, stated in an interview with a Turkish news outlet, that "in Syria, the majority is concerned that the price of violent opposition is very high; the majority know that there are long-term consequences. Nobody wants a war; nobody in the opposition wants to see a bombed Damascus." Unfortunately, the council's fears have come true.  </p>

<p>On the ground in Syria the destruction is heavy and the logistics unclear. The <a href="http://www.free-syrian-army.com/en/about-us/">Free Syrian Army</a> (FSA) claims to be the "main opposition army group in Syria, composed of defected Syrian Armed Forces." The organization further claims that it rose up against Assad because its members found it impossible to stay silent while the regime continued to kill its own people. Despite its quest for justice, the FSA has been accused by the UN of committing war crimes. These accusations were accompanied by claims that the FSA has <a href="http://www.fides.org/en/news/31308?idnews=31308&lan=eng">expelled Christians from cities</a> such as Homs. These actions have prompted many Christians to fear a post-Assad Syria.</p>

<p>To further complicate the nature of the opposition, other opposition forces have taken control of a number of cities in Syria. The al-Nusra Front, recently declared a terrorist organization by the US State Department, is also an active agent within Syria. The relationship between al-Nusra Front and the FSA is murky, but recently it seems the FSA has attempted to separate itself from this radical Islamist group. These attempts, however, do not alleviate concerns that al-Nusra will take control of swaths of Syrian territory. The concerns surrounding the power struggle between Assad and these extremist groups are shared by many.</p>

<p>Of course, there are "bad" Syrian rebels and "good" ones. However, the real issue is whether the US can adequately differentiate between the two and avoid arming the "bad" ones. In cities such as Aleppo, al-Nusra Front "is widely identified as the leading force behind the Hayaa al-Sharia, which loosely translates as the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/11/world/meast/syria-terror-group-explainer">Sharia Authority</a>." The organization has implemented Sharia law and has begun to punish individuals for violating it. One such incident occurred in Aleppo when <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7nL_EVpP1c">Wael Ibrahim</a>, a veteran activist, had tossed aside a banner inscribed with the Muslim declaration of faith. Ibrahim stated in an interview with an independent senior editor at a Syrian news agency that "<a href="http://beta.syriadeeply.org/2013/03/interview-unarmed-activist-challenging-aleppos-rebels/">Nusra arrested me on the charge of insulting Islam</a>." It is unclear how many "Ibrahims" there are across Syria's rebel controlled territories or how many more there will be, as long as organizations such as al-Nusra retain control. Stories like Ibrahim's give credence to the US's initial reluctance to arm the rebels; not only is it difficult to determine who the rebels are, it is almost impossible to understand the impact they will have on a post-Assad Syria. Although Ibrahim's story may not seem striking in the face of some of Assad's brutal tactics, it remains part of a broader complex issue, an issue that troubles minority groups throughout Syria: what will happen to us if the rebels take over Syria? Senator Rand Paul is familiar with this concern, when, in an interview with NBC's Meet the Press on September 1, 2013, he stated that the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/01/rand-paul-syria_n_3852644.html">best result</a> from the Syrian civil war would be Bashar al-Assad's government without Assad. He stated that "the Islamic rebels winning is a bad idea for the Christians."</p>

<p>A <em>New York Times</em> article published on October 14, 2012 indicates that most of the arms shipped to the Syrian rebels are falling into the hands of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/15/world/middleeast/jihadists-receiving-most-arms-sent-to-syrian-rebels.html?pagewanted=all">hardline Islamic jihadists</a>. The article quotes an American official who states that "the opposition groups that are receiving most of the lethal aid are exactly the ones we don't want to have it." It is fair to say that the US does not have a clear understanding of the opposition; the recognition of the Syrian National Coalition as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people does not conform to the realities on the ground. This murky relationship between the opposition forces in and outside of Syria prompted the US to refrain from sending lethal aid to the rebels, but the events of the past couple months have forced the Obama administration to alter that stance. Pressure from pro-revolutionary governments across Europe and the Middle East has prompted nations, such as the US, to supply the rebels with weapons. Furthermore, the recent use of chemical weapons has triggered an entirely new conversation that focuses on immediate military intervention.</p>

<p>Whether or not a US strike on Syrian soil is justifiable will depend on: <ol><br />
	<li>whether the international community is prepared to invoke the emerging theory of R2P as it did in Libya;<li>whether there is clear evidence that it was in fact the Assad regime that carried out the attack; and<li>whether a clear alternative to the Assad regime exists.</li><br />
</ol> It is important to note, however, that the use of chemical weapons does not negate the opposition's frighteningly extremist nature, a point the Obama administration should take into consideration before it looks to regime change as the answer. In other words, let's hope we find out who the rebels are <em>now</em> and not the day after they take up residence in the Presidential Palace. </p>

Jalloh</a>, of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law says that Kenya's opting to withdraw from the International Criminal Court poses major risks for minimal gain ...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/charlesjalloh.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="L" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n September 5, 2013, a majority of Kenya's National Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/kenya-parliament-approves-motion-to-withdraw-from-icc.php">voted</a> in favor of a motion, introduced by the Leader of the Majority Party, Aden Duale, urging the government to "urgently undertake measures to immediately withdraw" the influential East African nation from the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a> which established the International Criminal Court (ICC). The motion claimed that there has been a "fundamental change in the circumstances relating to the governance" of the country given that President <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200109/related%20cases/icc01090211/Pages/icc01090111.aspx">Uhuru Kenyatta</a> and Vice-President <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200109/related%20cases/icc01090111/Pages/icc01090111.aspx">William Ruto</a>, both of whom are under indictment by the ICC for alleged involvement with crimes against humanity, were "lawfully elected" under the <a href="http://www.kenyaembassy.com/pdfs/The%20Constitution%20of%20Kenya.pdf">Constitution of Kenya</a> [PDF] on March 4, 2013. </p>

<p>The motion, which also resolved to soon table a law that would repeal the country's <a href="http://www.iccnow.org/documents/NL.IntCrAct.pdf">International Crimes Act</a>, which domesticated the Rome Statute, raises several important issues at the intersection of law and politics. I argue that there are compelling legal reasons why the Kenyan government should not heed what the opposition party has described as an "ill considered" recommendation urging the executive branch to make Kenya the first and only country to withdraw from the ICC.  </p>

<p>I submit that the reputational and other costs of withdrawing from the ICC regime for Kenya far outweigh the largely symbolic political benefits that might be gained from any such withdrawal. This is all the more so because such a move will have no legal effect on the ongoing cases against the three Kenyans indicted by the Court. </p>

<p><strong>Context: Kenya Failed to Investigate and Prosecute</strong></p>

<p>Before turning to my main argument, I should recall that the ICC is today involved in efforts to prosecute those allegedly responsible for fomenting the post-election violence in Kenya, from December 2007 to February 2008, because Kenyan authorities initially failed to pursue those responsible. Yet, according to the <a href="http://www.kas.de/wf/doc/kas_16094-1522-2-30.pdf">Commission of Inquiry into the Post Election Violence</a> (CIPEV) [PDF] which was tasked with investigating the crimes, over 1,100 Kenyans were slaughtered in about two months. Thousands more were injured, while over half a million others were displaced. Many of the attacks targeted innocent victims based on their ethnicity, presumed political affiliation, or both. </p>

<p>The CIPEV concluded that there was historically a chronic lack of domestic capacity, but even more importantly political will, to prosecute powerful people when they instigated such election-related offenses. It therefore recommended the establishment of a <a href="href="http://www.kenyalaw.org/Downloads/Bills/2009/The_Special_Tribunal_for_Kenya_Statute_2009.pdf">Special Tribunal for Kenya</a> (STK) [PDF], staffed by a mix of nationals and internationals, to prosecute those most responsible for the offenses. However, the government sponsored draft bill to establish the STK was defeated in parliament on January 29, 2009. A Kenyan delegation subsequently met with the ICC Prosecutor on July 9, 2009 and agreed to investigate the crimes through a special tribunal or another suitable judicial mechanism, or failing that, to refer the situation to the Court. Regrettably, it appears that the same powerful persons, among whom were those later indicted by the ICC after the Pre-Trial Chamber authorized the Prosecutor to investigate the situation on March 31, 2010, succeeded in sabotaging progress on a hybrid or domestic prosecutions option.  A valiant private members bill, aimed at resuscitating the STK idea, also failed to garner meaningful support on August 29, 2009. </p>

<p>Fortunately, besides Kenya's July 2009 agreement with the ICC Prosecutor, the CIPEV anticipated a Plan B in its final recommendations. It therefore had entrusted a sealed envelope containing names of alleged leaders behind the post-election violence to former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the chair of the African Union's Panel of Eminent African Personalities, who had helped the rival political camps reach a peaceful political settlement. The ultimate failure of the previous government to pass the law to create the STK was the trigger for Annan to transmit the list and evidence to the ICC Prosecutor who thereafter sought judicial permission to investigate the situation. </p>

<p>Though the Prosecutor eventually requested charges against six Kenyans, after his preliminary investigations, only four were approved. Summonses were issued on March 11, 2011 for Kenyatta as well as Ruto. Charges were confirmed on January 23, 2012. One case, involving Francis Muthaura, was withdrawn at the prosecution's request on March 11, 2013. Besides Kenyatta and Ruto, only one other Kenyan, Joshua Sang, is currently answering charges before the ICC. His case, along with Vice-President Ruto's, just opened in the Hague this week while that of President Kenyatta is scheduled to begin on November 12, 2013. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Kenya's attempt to invoke the complementarity principle and claw back the ICC cases was denied on August 31, 2012. The Court ruled that there had been no active investigations of the same persons for substantially the same conduct to render them inadmissible.  </p>

<p><strong>Withdrawal Now Has No Effect on Ongoing Cases in the ICC<br />
</strong><br />
Contrary to what the majority of the parliamentarians implied through their vote, Kenya's withdrawal will not stop the cases against Vice President Ruto, President Kenyatta, Mr. Sang, or for that matter, in respect of any one that might additionally be indicted by the ICC Prosecutor.  </p>

<p>First, it is true that under <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/99_corr/13.htm">Article 127(1)</a> of the Rome Statute, a State Party may, by notifying the UN Secretary-General, who is the depository of treaties, "withdraw" from the statute. So, although I hope that this does not happen, Kenya has the sovereign right to withdraw because of the consensual nature of international law. However, the withdrawal would take effect no earlier than one year after the date of receipt of the notification. More fundamentally, for our purposes, withdrawal cannot be used to undermine the ICC's ongoing investigations and prosecutions. Thus, a withdrawing state is not "discharged, by reason of its withdrawal, from the obligations arising from" the statute during the time it was a party.</p>

<p>Second, and perhaps more strikingly, even if the ICC Prosecutor were to decide to commence additional cases before the date that the one-year withdrawal becomes effective, those proceedings would also entail a continued duty for Kenya to cooperate with the court.  </p>

<p>Fortunately, the drafters of the Rome Statute also <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/99_corr/9.htm">anticipated</a> what the court could do if a withdrawing state fails to abide by its legal undertakings. Thus, where it "fails to comply with a request to cooperate by the Court" contrary to the statute, "thereby preventing the Court from exercising its functions and powers", the court, either of its own motion or at the Prosecution's request, "may make a finding to that effect and refer the matter to the Assembly of States Parties [ASP]," the guardian angel of the ICC.</p>

<p>Plainly, international law skeptics might counter that a finding of non-cooperation and reporting a matter to the ASP is hardly robust sanction. But the reasons why states obey international law, a horizontal legal system wherein reciprocity and good reputation play a strong role in inducing compliance, generally differ from the sheriff at the door logic some associate with individual compliance with laws in vertical domestic legal systems. In any case, the full ICC membership is represented in the ASP, along with other powerful and presumably interested observers such as the US, which now refreshingly plays a more constructive support role for the ICC under President Barack Obama.</p>

<p>Viewed against this backdrop, the Rome Statute empowers the ASP to prescribe measures against a recalcitrant state.  <a href="http://www.preventgenocide.org/law/icc/statute/part-c.htm">Article 112(2)(g)</a> mandates it to "perform any other function consistent with" the statute. Presumably, this would enable it to goad a non-cooperating state to act, and by analogy to <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter6.shtml">Article 33</a> of the UN Charter, to even seek creative solutions through negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, resort to international (say the UN) agencies or regional arrangements (such as the African Union), or other peaceful means of its choice. For its part, assuming follow through in the ASP, Kenya, as the anchor finance and trade hub for the East African region, would risk assuming "impunity friendly" haven status among the community of nations - a status that would also be inconsistent with its long term interests as a largely agriculture and tourism based economy. </p>

<p><strong>International Treaty Law Does Not Help Kenya Either</strong></p>

<p>The Rome Statute does not demand that a country explain its motivations for withdrawal. However, the withdrawal resolution attempted to offer a justification for the proposed termination. It asserted that there has been "fundamental changes of circumstances relating to the governance of the Republic" since the March 2013 elections. And although it is unclear whether the motion's drafters invoked "fundamental changes of circumstances" deliberately, or inadvertently, such language in the motion does not resonate with the Rome Statute but certainly does with international treaty law. </p>

<p>The background rules from the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/1_1_1969.pdf">Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties</a> (VCLT) [PDF], which entered into force on January 27, 1980, covers such situations. Kenya was one of the original signatories to the VCLT, on May 23, 1969, but much like the United States, it has not ratified it. Nevertheless, most aspects of the treaty on treaties are now widely considered customary international law. Furthermore, and in any event, the general rules of international law in the VCLT all appear to form part of Kenyan law pursuant to Section 2(5) of the 2010 Constitution. </p>

<p>Under the VCLT, every state has the duty to act properly in the performance of its treaty obligations. Thus, under the <em>pacta sunt servanda</em> rule, "[e]very treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by them in good faith." This classical principle applies per force to Kenya in relation to the Rome Statute. An important corollary is this: a state may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty, as the National Assembly seems to suggest through its motion. </p>

<p>But, even more problematic for Kenya's situation, the VCLT is unequivocal that a fundamental change of circumstances cannot be invoked as grounds for withdrawing from a treaty. This is so if the fundamental change is the result of a breach by the party invoking it of an obligation under the treaty. This rule is applicable here. The change of circumstance arising from the general elections, and any withdrawal it leads to, would entail a breach of the obligation to investigate and prosecute crimes under the Rome Statute. It is the failure to comply with that obligation that in turn triggered the ICC's jurisdiction and indictments. The country must now necessarily facilitate the work of the Court, as required by Part 9 of the treaty.<br />
 <br />
It follows that Kenya cannot, under international treaty law, rely on a fundamental change of circumstances to terminate the obligations contained in the Rome Statute; obligations to cooperate that are explicitly anticipated by the <em>lex specialis</em> rules of the ICC regime as being of a continuing nature (even after a state party decides to withdraw).  </p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>As the Kenyan Government mulls over last week's parliamentary recommendation, it should keep two things in mind. Firstly, the ICC is working for the people of Kenya, not against the people of Kenya. By that I mean the hundreds of victims of the post-election violence whose families deserve to get a measure of justice. This includes the 371 Kenyans who currently have formal victim standing and thus a voice in the ICC proceedings, rights that they would not enjoy in domestic trials. Admittedly, the court also needs Kenya, as it seeks to prove itself to the world as a fair and competent court of law. So the relationship is a mutually beneficial one, a win-win, as I have <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1431130">argued</a> more fully elsewhere in respect of the court's relations with African States.</p>

<p>Secondly, the Kenyan leadership should remember that the ICC has, in recognition of this unprecedented situation resulting from the March 2013 elections, acted both pragmatically and flexibly. As part of this, it has continued the liberty of the accused and granted the defendant requests for important accommodations for the trial phase. These would enable the president and his deputy to balance their official functions with their right to appear, consistent with the presumption of innocence, before the court to defend their good name. </p>

<p>Consequently, it is against the interests of those personally accused to at once be before the ICC protesting their innocence and pledging unconditional cooperation with the judicial process, only to subsequently endorse measures that would undermine the tribunal's adjudicative function. As demonstrated here, irrespective of whether Kenya withdraws from the ICC, its obligations to support the crucial justice process started under the Rome Statute will subsist. The cases will continue, so at best, Kenya would only score political points from any retreat from the battle against impunity at this stage.</p>

<p>Finally, stepping back to frame a bigger picture for average Kenyans, I note that Messrs. Kenyatta and Ruto enjoy fundamental fair trial rights under Article 67 of the Rome Statute. Foremost, among these, they are presumed innocent until proved guilty before the court in accordance with the applicable law. Therefore, it is not up to the accused President Kenyatta, Vice-President Ruto or Mr. Sang to prove their innocence. Rather, it is Gambian Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda's job to prove their guilt, if she can proffer convincing evidence to that effect. The burden on her is high, as the law rightly demands that a majority of three experienced judges of Trial Chamber V, presided over by Judge Chile Eboe-Osuji of Nigeria, independently evaluate that evidence to establish their guilt beyond a reasonable doubt for indirectly co-perpetrating crimes against humanity. It is only if such a finding is reached that penalties, and the provisions of the 2010 Constitution that permit the impeachment of leaders, would become an issue.  </p>

<p>By the same token, as the defendants have insisted throughout this post-election violence saga that they are innocent, they must also be very confident that they can raise a reasonable doubt about the Prosecutor's allegations. Doing so, in turn, would lead to their inevitable acquittals. Thus, Kenyans must insist that the government exercise restraint and let the ICC justice process take its natural course. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Ralph Carter, <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/academics/graduate/law">St. John's University School of Law</a> Class of 2014, is the author of the first article in a 10-part series from the staffers of the <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/academics/graduate/law/journals_activities/jcred">Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development</a>. Carter explains the need for federal legislation protecting employee's and job applicant's private online information by setting a nationwide standard that is certain and manageable...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="Carter.jpg" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Carter.jpg" width="120" height="148" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>magine that you recently submitted an employment application for a highly coveted position. You have progressed through several rounds of the interview process and a battery of tests.  The company's human resources manager has informed you that the company would like to extend you an offer of employment, subject to the results of the company's standard background investigation.</p>

<p>As part of this investigation, the human resources manager has requested that you provide the passwords to your personal Gmail account and your social network accounts on Facebook, MySpace, Google+ and LinkedIn. You are likely to be shocked that this intrusion into your personal life is a pre-condition of employment. It is also likely however, that if you follow your initial inclination and respectfully decline the employer's request for your personal account passwords, your employment application will be rejected. Therefore, you acquiesce and provide your personal log-in information.</p>

<p>A week later,  you  are informed that  you are no longer under consideration for the position without any explanation.   You rack your brain to figure out what could have caused such a reversal of fortune; you recall that your Facebook friends posted on your private "wall" certain controversial political views, which you "liked." Only then does it occur to you that the company may have decided that your political leanings are not in keeping with its corporate mission.</p>

<p>Today, as more of our professional and private interactions occur in online settings, many employers are checking job  applicants' and employees' social media account profiles on Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and LinkedIn to gauge individuals' suitability for employment. According to a <a href="http://blog.reppler.com/2011/09/27/managing-your-online-image-across-social-networks/">2011 survey</a> of more than 300 hiring professionals conducted by social media monitoring service, Reppler, "more than 90 percent of recruiters and hiring managers have visited a potential candidate's profile on a social network as part of the screening process" and "69 percent of recruiters have rejected a candidate based on [such] content."</p>

<p>Certain employers have also adopted the more intrusive practice of requiring that current or prospective employees provide access to the password-protected private confines of their online social media accounts. Employers that seek unfettered access into the private online communications of current and prospective employees do a grave disservice to these individuals' privacy rights.</p>

<p>An employer could use an employee's or applicant's private social network information to take adverse employment action based on the individual's expression of political ideology within a private group on a social network, or in response to other off-duty conduct that would otherwise not be subject to scrutiny by the employer, such as whether the employee smokes tobacco. There is also the looming specter that the information gleaned from private online accounts may be used improperly by employers to take illegal employment actions on the basis of  information  concerning current or prospective employees' protected class status: race, ethnicity, marital status, age, sexual orientation, pregnancy, religion or disability.</p>

<p>At present, no federal law explicitly prohibits employers' attempts to gain access applicants' and employees' password-protected online social network content. Instead, employees and applicants are left to seek redress under the antiquated <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/2701">Stored Communications Act</a>, the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030">Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</a> or the common-law tort of invasion of privacy. The federal laws have significant limitations in that neither of them was designed to cover the current technology used in Facebook and other social media sites. Moreover, the reported cases applying these laws and the common-law privacy tort to private social media accounts have resulted in a hodgepodge of inconsistent and at times seemingly inequitable outcomes.</p>

<p>Although federal legislation has been introduced to bar employers from requiring employees or job applicants to provide user log-in or passwords to social media and email accounts, the prospects for passage are uncertain.  In 2012 and 2013, several states enacted or proposed legislation intended to protect job applicants' and employees'  private  online information. In May 2012, Maryland became the first state to enact a password-protection statute. As of September 2013, another twelve states have enacted password-protection statutes and provisions are under consideration in some 20 other states.</p>

<p>The state statutes vary widely as to their scope in a number of key areas including:<ol><br />
	<li>what conduct is proscribed;<li>whether only social media accounts are protected, or other online accounts such as electronic mail, are also covered;<li> whether employees and applicants are afforded a private right of action;<li>what remedies are available; and<li>whether there are statutory exceptions for instances in which employers seek access to password-protected personal information in furtherance of legitimate business purposes, such as workplace harassment investigations or compliance with legal or regulatory requirements.</li><br />
</ol>The expanding lattice of state laws will present questions of applicability of the provisions between employees, applicants and employers of different states. For example, if a California-based employer improperly demands access to the social network of a Michigan resident, will it be subject to California and/or Michigan's password-protection statutes? In such a scenario, the answer could determine whether the case would proceed, as the Michigan statute provides for a private right of action, while the California statute does not.</p>

<p>In light of these challenges, a comprehensive federal statute is needed to provide employees and job applicants with the means to protect their private online information from unwarranted scrutiny by employers. The author proposes a model federal statute, the Personal Electronic Account Privacy Protection Act (PEAPPA), which would protect employee's and job applicant's private online information by setting a nationwide standard that is certain and manageable.</p>

<p>Under the model PEAPPA, employers would be prohibited from requiring or requesting that an employee or applicant provide access, allow observation or disclose information to permit access to the employee's or applicant's personal electronic accounts. Personal electronic accounts would be defined broadly to cover not only social network accounts, but also email accounts and other electronic communication channels that may emerge in the future. The PEAPPA would prevent employers from requesting users' passwords, as well as the practice of "shoulder-surfing," in which the employer reads over the employee's or applicant's shoulder while he logs in to his private online accounts.</p>

<p>The protections of the PEAPPA will also create a necessary disincentive for employers who would use employees' and applicants' private online information to make employment decisions based on otherwise protected classifications, such as gender, race, marital status, religion, disability, or sexual orientation and those that are currently unprotected like membership in disfavored political organizations.</p>

		<title>Windsor: Just the Beginning of the Supreme Court&amp;apos;s Involvement in Same-Sex Marriage</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.lls.edu/aboutus/facultyadministration/faculty/facultylists-z/setotheodorep/">Theodore Seto</a> of the Loyola Law School of Los Angeles says the US Supreme Court's decision in <span class="casename">US v. Windsor</span> will not be its last concerning same-sex marriage, due to its repercussions on federal and state law interplay...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/theodoreseto.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n <span class="casename">US v. Windsor</span>, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">struck down</a> DOMA, the federal <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/html/PLAW-104publ199.htm">Defense of Marriage Act</a>, as a "deprivation of liberty." Most news reports have focused on <span class="casename">Windsor</span>'s implications for federal tax and benefit rules. At least as important are its implications for same-sex marriage itself.</p>

<p>Technically, only Section 3 of the Act, which limited the term "marriage" to monogamous opposite-sex unions, was before the court. Nevertheless, the court's opinion, read literally, struck down the entire act: "This requires the Court to hold, as it now does, that DOMA is unconstitutional..."</p>

<p>The court thus appears to have invalidated Section 2 as well. Section 2 relieved states of their obligation to recognize same-sex marriages authorized by the laws of other jurisdictions. So, for example, it relieved Virginia of its obligation to recognize same-sex marriages celebrated in Maryland or the District of Columbia.  </p>

<p>If Section 2 is gone, however, same-sex couples in Virginia can now get married simply by driving across the Potomac. Virginia will then have to recognize their Maryland or DC marriage.  </p>

<p>Why might the court have believed it necessary to invalidate the entire Act? Consider a same-sex couple lawfully married in DC. They buy a house in Arlington. If they are not still married for Virginia purposes, then at least in theory they are no longer married for at least some federal purposes either. <span class="casename">Windsor</span>, narrowly construed, might mean that whenever same-sex married couples change domicile, they may automatically become divorced for some federal purposes. Such a rule would be completely unworkable.</p>

<p>In the language of constitutional jurisprudence, therefore, Sections 2 and 3 were interdependent. Striking down Section 3 without striking down Section 2 might have created chaos in federal law.</p>

<p>If Virginia must recognize same-sex marriages authorized by the laws of other jurisdictions, however, the fact that the court <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hollingsworth">declined</a>, in <span class="casename">Hollingsworth v. Perry</span>, to reach the question of whether same-sex marriage is a constitutional right is largely moot. The practical effect of <span class="casename">Windsor</span> is to make same-sex marriage available throughout the US.</p>

<p>Justice Anthony Kennedy reinforced this conclusion, declaring that DOMA is unconstitutional because it is a "deprivation of liberty." He could have grounded his conclusion in an argument based on states' rights, but he did not. "DOMA's principal effect," he wrote, "is to identify a subset of state-sanctioned marriages and make them unequal. The principal purpose is to impose inequality..."</p>

<p>This same language would seem to apply equally to Section 2, which does not authorize states to disregard marriages celebrated in other states generally, only same-sex marriages celebrated in other states. It identifies a subset of state-sanctioned marriages and makes them unequal for full faith and credit purposes.</p>

<p>A second non-obvious implication of <span class="casename">Windsor</span> stems from what Kennedy left out. Nowhere in his opinion are civil unions or registered domestic partnerships even mentioned. The opinion thus leaves open whether the federal government may or must treat couples who have entered into such relationships as "married" for tax, benefit, and other purposes.</p>

<p>This is a complicated question. In California, for example, older opposite-sex couples can choose between marriage and registered domestic partnership. California's purpose in allowing such couples this choice is to allow them the state-law benefits of marriage without subjecting them to the sometimes unfavorable federal tax and benefit consequences.</p>

<p>Is offering such a choice a "deprivation of liberty"? Is it discriminatory? Arguably not, at least in states that give couples a choice between the two types of relationship.</p>

<p>A number of developments since <span class="casename">Windsor</span> suggest where the law may be heading. In <span class="casename">Obergefell v. Kasich</span>, the US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/federal-judge-expands-ohio-same-sex-marriage-challenge-to-other-couples.php">ordered</a> Ohio to recognize plaintiffs' same-sex marriage performed in Maryland, notwithstanding Ohio's constitutional provisions prohibiting such recognition. The court reasoned: "[T]he Ohio scheme has unjustifiably created two tiers of couples: (1) opposite-sex married couples legally married in other states; and (2) same-sex married couples legally married in other states. This lack of equal protection is fatal."</p>

<p>In <span class="casename">O'Connor v. Tobits</span>, the US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-judge-rules-same-sex-spouse-entitled-to-death-benefits.php">held</a> that, for <a href="http://www.dol.gov/compliance/laws/comp-erisa.htm">ERISA</a> (Employee Retirement Income Security Act) purposes, the term "spouse" included a same-sex partner whose marriage in Canada was confirmed by civil union ceremony in Illinois, their state of domicile. </p>

<p>On July 24, 2013, the Registrar of Wills in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/pennsylvania-officials-challenge-same-sex-marriage-licenses.php">announced</a> that he believed that Pennsylvania's law prohibiting same-sex marriage was unconstitutional and  issued a marriage license to a same-sex couple. The state Attorney General responded that she would not defend Pennsylvania's prohibition.</p>

<p>On August 30, 2013, the IRS issued <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rr-13-17.pdf">Revenue Ruling 2013-17</a> [PDF],<a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-irbs/irb13-38.pdf"> 2013-38 I.R.B. 201</a> [PDF], holding that the law of the state of celebration of the marriage, not the law of the state of domicile, will determine whether taxpayers are married for federal tax purposes, thereby solving the divorce-by-change-of-domicile problem in the tax context. The same Revenue Ruling held that civil unions, registered domestic partnerships, and other formal relationships recognized by state law but not denominated "marriage" will not be treated as "marriage" for federal tax purposes.</p>

<p>By contrast, effective as of August 9, 2013, the Social Security Administration amended its <a href="https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/">Program Operations Manual</a> to recognize same-sex marriages for Social Security benefits purposes if such marriages are recognized by the state of domicile, leaving open whether a same-sex couple previously treated as married for Social Security benefits purposes remains married if it changes domicile.</p>

<p>Recently, in <span class="casename">Garden State Equality v. Dow</span>, the New Jersey Superior Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/new-jersey-governor-appeals-same-sex-marriage-ruling-to-state-supreme-court.php">held</a> that New Jersey's denial of marriage to same-sex couples violates the New Jersey Constitution. Prior to <span class="casename">Windsor</span>, the state supreme court had held to the contrary in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2912577675644260481">Lewis v. Harris</a>, but had held further that failure to provide same-sex couples with a status with equivalent benefits was unconstitutional. In response, the New Jersey legislature had enacted the <a href="http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2006/Bills/PL06/103_.HTM">Civil Union Act</a>, extending civil union rights to same-sex couples.</p>

<p>The <span class="casename">Garden State Equality</span> court observed that <span class="casename">Windsor</span> only extended federal benefits to "married" same-sex couples: "[T]he Office of Personnel Management, Department of State, the Department of Labor, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare, have stated that they will not be recognizing civil unions, and rather will be confining eligibility for benefits to spouses in lawful marriages." As a result, the court noted, New Jersey law now had the effect of denying same-sex couples the federal benefits of marriage. This, the court concluded, violated the <a href="http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/lawsconstitution/constitution.asp">New Jersey Constitution</a>.</p>

<p>At this point, it should be obvious that neither <span class="casename">Windsor</span> nor <span class="casename">Hollingsworth</span> is going to be the Supreme Court's final word on the subject. But <span class="casename">Windsor</span>, in particular, has reshaped the American legal landscape.</p>

The <a href="http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/supreme/">New Jersey Supreme Court</a> and the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> provided different answers to the same question: do police need a search warrant to track a person through his cell phone? New Jersey's high court said yes; the Fifth Circuit said no. These decisions expand the growing rift in courts throughout the country on the constitutionality of an increasingly popular law enforcement tool.</p>

                <p><strong>Cell Phone Tracking Explained</strong></p>

                <p>In a nutshell, here is the technology the courts were looking at: in order for a cell phone or smartphone to make a call, send a text message or browse the internet, the device must access the cellular provider's telephone network. The phone does that by connecting to cell phone towers installed throughout the country by the providers. When a phone is powered on, it searches for and connects to the nearest tower. As the phone moves, the phone constantly reconnects to the closest tower. Providers keep these records for varying amounts of time, and law enforcement can request the historical records of which towers a phone connected to. Police can also obtain real-time location information by asking the cell phone provider to identify which tower a phone is connected to at any given moment.</p>

                <p>As smartphones have taken over the cell phone market, the accuracy of this data has only grown. First, the growing demand for internet connected portable electronic devices has resulted in the installation of more towers. <a href="http://www.ctia.org/">CTIA</a>, the cell phone industry association, reports that between 2000 and 2012 the number of towers in the United States increased from 104,288 to 301,799. Second, more smartphones cause more web traffic, which grew almost four times over from 2010 to 2012. And that ultimately causes more frequent tower connection records. Naturally, police have used this tool with increasing frequency. A coordinated Freedom of Information Act request by the ACLU last year revealed that over 250 different law enforcement agencies across the country have used the technology, relying on different legal standards to access this information.</p>

                <p>In turn, the constitutionality of the practice is now being litigated in federal and state courts across the country. Ultimately, the issue really raises two Fourth Amendment questions: whether a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy concerning their physical location and, if so, whether that expectation of privacy exists notwithstanding the fact that the records are held by a third party, specifically the cell phone provider? Courts looking at the issue have reached conflicting opinions on both questions.</p>

                <p><strong>Location Privacy: An Exhaustive Snapshot of Movement and Patterns</strong></p>

                <p>For many years, two US Supreme Court cases framed the constitutionality of location privacy. First, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2281447873975736215">United States v. Knotts</a> the Court found no Fourth Amendment violation when police placed a primitive beeper in a can of chloroform and followed the can as it traveled in the suspect's car on public streets. The following year in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=495897577064781112">United States v. Karo</a>, the Supreme Court dealt with a similar situation involving warrantless police tracking of a can of ether. But in <em>Karo</em>, the can travelled not only in public streets, but also was stored in private homes too. Ultimately, <em>Knotts</em> and <em>Karo</em> came to be understood as permitting warrantless tracking in public streets, but not private homes. And of course, the technology was primitive; the beeper had to be closely followed by law enforcement and was only intended to supplement visual surveillance.</p>

                <p>In federal courts, public or private remained the dividing line and a warrant was not required for public surveillance, even as technology improved to allow police surveillance in new, unprecedented ways not previously imagined or physically possible, most notably constant, around the clock GPS monitoring. Some state courts, looking at the issue under their state constitutions, had taken a different view, with New York, Oregon and Washington all finding such surveillance &#8212; even on public streets &#8212; triggered the warrant requirement.</p>

                <p>In 2012, the Supreme Court decided <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6122276400056758151">United States v. Jones</a>, which involved warrantless GPS surveillance of a suspected drug dealer in public streets over 28 days. The <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals</a> had found the GPS surveillance unconstitutional because <em>Knotts</em> did not envision this type of prolonged surveillance. Aggregated GPS surveillance of a person's movements over an extended period of time provided a great more detail than a snapshot of individual public movements at a discrete time. Because a person could not reasonably expect that another person might actually discover this aggregated information &#8212; everywhere they'd gone for almost a month &#8212; there was necessarily a reasonable expectation of privacy.</p>

                <p>The Supreme Court affirmed, but on different grounds. Instead of looking to an expectation of privacy test, it found the government's trespass onto the defendant's private property - the car - for the purpose of obtaining information was a "search" under pre-<em>Katz</em> Fourth Amendment law.</p>

                <p>But in two important concurring opinions by Justices Sotomayor and Alito, a majority of the Court signaled its readiness to find a reasonable expectation of privacy to be free from prolonged surveillance. The justices shared the D.C. Circuit's concern with the capabilities of technology to cheaply and efficiently aggregate reams of data to create new and unknown intrusions into previously private places.</p>

                <p>Following <em>Jones</em>, federal courts however continued to hew to <em>Knotts</em> and <em>Karo</em>, hesitant to extend concurring opinions into binding precedent. But state courts have been more aggressive on the issue, and both South Dakota and Massachusetts have ruled a person has an expectation of privacy in their public movements, meaning a search warrant is required before a person's location can be tracked. State legislatures have acted too, with Maine and Montana both passing bills requiring police obtain a search warrant before accessing a person's location, and with a number of other states considering similar steps.</p>

                <p>In July, the New Jersey Supreme Court reached the same conclusion in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=287673524869383103">State v. Earls</a>. There, police looking for a defendant found him by acquiring, without a search warrant, cellphone tower data from T-Mobile. The state high court found the warrantless acquisition of the data unconstitutional under its state constitution. While <em>Earls</em> involved cell phone tracking, its rationale extends beyond that specific technique and into any form of location-based surveillance that "involves a degree of intrusion that a reasonable person would not anticipate." That is because extensive location information "can reveal not just where people go &#8212; which doctors, religious services, and stores they visit &#8212; but also the people and groups they choose to affiliate with and when they actually do so." Since "details about the location of a cell phone can provide an intimate picture of one's daily life," if the police want access to this data, they now must get a search warrant.</p>

                <p><strong>Third Party Doctrine: Voluntarily Assuming a Risk?</strong></p>

                <p>New Jersey was able to extend this constitutional protection to its citizens because it had previously abolished the major obstacle binding courts, especially federal ones: the "third party doctrine."</p>

                <p>In the 1970's, the Supreme Court decided two cases &#8212; <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15052729295643479698">United States v. Miller</a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3033726127475530815">Smith v. Maryland</a> &#8212; that collectively established that a person generally has no expectation of privacy in materials turned over to a third party. These cases involved records far more primitive than cell tower connection records. <em>Miller</em> dealt with a bank's records of a customer's transactions and deposits; Smith involved the phone numbers a person dialed. The doctrine was not at issue in <em>Earls</em> because New Jersey state law had abolished it, meaning individuals still retained their right to privacy in information turned over to third parties. Other states, including California, have done the same.</p>

                <p>But in federal court, <em>Smith</em> and <em>Miller</em> have been recited by the government time and again in resisting challenges to warrantless acquisition of a variety of records from Internet and cell phone providers, including cell tower records. The government's argument is simple: the cell tower records belong to the cell provider, not the customer. Once the customer reveals their location to the company in order to have their phone call connected, they have surrendered their Fourth Amendment protection in that data.</p>

                <p>While federal district courts have issued conflicting opinions on whether a warrant is required, federal appellate courts have only recently examined the issue.  And so far, they have issued conflicting opinions. In 2010, the Third Circuit ruled in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11947039783511865788">In the Matter of the Application of the U.S. For An Order</a> that a warrant may be required to access cell tower records in some instances because "a cell phone customer has not 'voluntarily' shared his location information with a cellular provider in any meaningful way."</p>

                <p>But just a week after <em>Earls</em> was decided, the Fifth Circuit ruled in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1902419021134613088">In re: Application of the U.S. for Historical Cell Site Data</a> that a cell phone user has no expectation of privacy in their location because that information is voluntarily turned over when the "user makes a choice to get a phone, to select a particular service provider, and to make a call." Relying on <em>Miller</em> and <em>Smith</em>, the government ultimately did not need a search warrant to access this data.</p>

                <p>There is much to quibble with this simplistic understanding of privacy expectations, particularly as the explosion in the breadth of information stored by third party Internet and telephone providers means the narrow third-party exception is threatening to swallow the rule. Even Justice Sotomayor explicitly called out the doctrine in her concurring opinion in <em>Jones</em>, noting it was "ill suited to the digital age, in which people reveal a great deal of information about themselves to third parties in the course of carrying out mundane tasks."</p>

                <p><strong>The Takeaway</strong></p>

                <p>In an age of rapidly changing technology, courts must think about privacy expectations the way that <em>Earls</em> did: by recognizing "changes in technology" affect Fourth Amendment rights because they "affect the level of detail" relayed to law enforcement. In 2001, the US Supreme Court said in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15840045591115721227">Kyllo v. United States</a> that "it would be foolish to contend that the degree of privacy secured to citizens by the Fourth Amendment has been entirely unaffected by the advance of technology." Yet, courts, like the Fifth Circuit, relying on antiquated cases involving primitive technologies &#8212; like <em>Knotts</em> and <em>Karo</em> &#8212; or far more limited records &#8212; like <em>Miller</em> and <em>Smith</em> &#8212; to defeat constitutional challenges to new forms of electronic surveillance are ignoring the realities of modern technology and its capabilities to reveal far more information about people in easy, convenient ways never before imagined. Like <em>Earls</em> noted, "cell phones are not meant to serve as tracking devices to locate their owners wherever they may be." Cell phones are an integral part of everyday life; courts must require a user do something more than merely turn on phone before finding their constitutional rights have been irretrievably surrendered.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Liesel LeCates, <a href="http://www.law.utah.edu">University of Utah - S.J. Quinney College of Law</a> Class of 2014, discusses the recent sentences by an Egyptian military tribunal against protesters supporting of the ousted president Muhamad Morsi, and whether the sentences were legitimate and fair ...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="lecates.png" src="/dateline/lecates.png" width="120" height="119" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>H</strong></font>istorically, many insurgencies have been justified with the revolutionaries hailed as heroes for standing up against oppression. Yet, in Egypt the situation is unique and the details reported regarding protest violence are limited, leading to a difficult determination of right and wrong.</p>

<p>Egypt has undergone three major changes in authority since 2011. Mobs have gathered in the streets for months to protest the ousting of President Muhamad Morsi, and the military has resorted to the use of force in order to suppress the demonstrations. Despite this turmoil, some judicial organs appear functional. For the first time since President Morsi <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypt-military-deposes-president-morsi-suspends-constitution.php">was overthrown</a> in July, a military tribunal <a href="http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/11-given-life-sentences-military-trial-alleged-morsy-supporters">convened</a> on September 3, 2013, to intervene in the chaos. This tribunal <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/morsi-supporters-sentenced-to-prison-for-assaulting-army-troops.php">sentenced</a> pro-Morsi protesters who were convicted of "<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/09/201393124436963523.html">shooting and adopting violent means</a>" against the army in Suez, after a military crackdown against the Morsi supporters resulted in hundreds of deaths in Cairo. Twelve were acquitted, several others received judgments ranging from five to fifteen years, while <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=218482627">only one man received</a> a life sentence. </p>

<p>The tribunal-imposed sentences have been criticized as harsh. However, in order to determine the legality of prison sentences received by the pro-Morsi protesters, the following must be considered: first, the legitimacy of the Egyptian government; second, whether the demonstrators received a fair trial; and third, the justification of life-prison sentences for violent protests.</p>

<p><strong>I.	Is the current Egyptian government legitimate; if not, what rights should be extended to unrecognized governments?</strong></p>

<p>There are differing views regarding the legitimacy of the Egyptian government. The Muslim Brotherhood believes that Morsi, democratically elected, was removed illegally and the resultant use of military force to control protesters was unfounded. The Egyptian military justifies its actions were necessary after Morsi failed to abide by democratic principles.  </p>

<p>According to Locke, governments become legitimate through the concept of <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke-political/#ConPolOblEndGov">citizen consent</a>. Under this theory, the Egyptian government would be considered legitimate when groups flocked to the streets challenging the authority of President Morsi. Following the public outcry, the military imprisoned Morsi and appointed an interim president in his stead. Although the Muslim brotherhood contests the legitimacy of the current leadership, if the Egyptian military overthrew President Morsi in an effort to establish a democratic government at the request of the majority, then the government is legitimate. </p>

<p>If the Egyptian government's legitimacy is not recognized by the international community, providing stability to protect the public in preparation for democratic elections gives the military a moral right to arrest and charge violent demonstrators. While the military has been accused of other crimes and overzealous use of force, based upon the isolated circumstances in Suez, these military tribunals could be a necessary step to reduce future violence.</p>

<p><strong>II. Did the protesters receive a fair trial?</strong></p>

<p>The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in <a href="http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%20999/volume-999-I-14668-English.pdf">Article 14</a> [PDF], states: "everyone shall be entitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law." In Egypt, "military courts <a href="http://www.loc.gov/law/help/egypt.php#court">do not have due process</a>" unlike civilian courts. Military courts <a href="http://www.loc.gov/law/help/egypt.php#court">have authority to prosecute civilians</a> in cases of "national security" and "terrorism." </p>

<p>While military tribunals are a favorable alternative to violence, great care should be taken when contemplating negating individuals' rights in the name of public security. An automatic prison sentence should never be justified without some form of due process. The government interests in protecting individual rights and public safety should be balanced. Extreme circumstances could necessitate minor restrictions to the western idealization of individual rights, but these exceptions should not withhold fundamental human rights such as freedom from torture. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.unodc.org/documents/commissions/CND-Uploads/CND-53-RelatedFiles/ECN72010_CRP6eV1051605.pdf">A report</a> [PDF] by the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs and the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice specifies that although "some rights (such as freedom of expression, for example) may be limited on the grounds of public safety, order, health, morals and the rights and freedoms of others, other rights may not be limited under any circumstances."</p>

<p>Superficially, the story in Egypt appears to be another unfair ruling in which the politicized judiciary was swayed by current executive leadership; however, a close analysis suggests the contrary. Details regarding the specific process afforded the imprisoned protesters is limited, but the available information implies the judiciary reasoned impartially. While this tribunal had multiple incentives and opportunity to prosecute harshly, like in June when an Egyptian court <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22750614">sentenced a man to death for drug trafficking</a>, it used restraint even though the accused allegedly shot at military personnel.  </p>

<p>Although the government has a duty to safeguard the public, individuals should always be afforded the necessary process to ensure protection from indiscriminate punishment. Judicial organs should be extremely wary not to encroach needlessly on personal rights while considering the government's need to safeguard the public. This balance is difficult and should be tailored to specific circumstances, but the use of force is never justified when peaceful alternatives are available.  </p>

<p>Even though the tribunal judgments appear fair and unbiased, the potential for prejudice without fundamental due process protections are so great, that the rights to a fair trial were likely violated.</p>

<p><strong>III. Does the punishment fit the crime?</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a20">Article 20</a> of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states, "Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association." This right to protest does not extend to violence; however, violent protests can be justified, but only when there have been extreme violations of fundamental rights and all peaceful alternatives have been explored. </p>

<p>The Egyptian government is motivated to halt the violence in order to protect the country's economic stability. Since July, oil prices have increased and the political unrest has <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/100967684">required</a> a stronger military presence in the area. These attempts by protesters to close the Suez Canal could <a href="http://www.eia.gov/countries/analysisbriefs/Egypt/egypt.pdf">significantly burden</a> [PDF] the Egyptian economy by immobilizing exports. Current instability, combined with attempts to thwart economic activities will likely lead to increased deadly protests which in turn will accelerate current uproar. Despite these motivating factors, Egypt must punish humanely.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.achpr.org/files/instruments/declaration-protection-all-persons-torture/declaration_on_the_protection_from_being_subjected_to_torture.pdf">The Declaration Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</a> [PDF] is devoid of exceptions stating: "No State may permit or tolerate torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Exceptional circumstances, including state of war, internal political instability or public emergency, may not be invoked as justification of such acts." A life-prison sentence is not inherently inhumane; therefore, the question still remains: Considering the violent acts of the Morsi-supporters, is a life prison-sentence justified, or should the international community condemn the punishment as cruel and unfitting the crime?</p>

<p>Viewed through a utilitarian lens, a life-sentence for violent protesting, absent other cruel circumstances, could be necessary punishment to prevent further death and violence. In this instance, protesters were <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23949657">accused</a> of "opening fire at soldiers during a riot." Yet, each individual protester was sentenced to a varying degree. The information distinguishing the individuals' crimes is unavailable, but the fact that twelve of the accused were acquitted, and only one received a life sentence, implies that the court attempted justice and mercy.</p>

<p>The Egyptian transition in power, and excessive use of military force to quash demonstrations, has spurred differing opinions concerning the current government's legitimacy and the legality of using military tribunals when trying civilians. Additionally, the use of military tribunals to sentence civilians infringes upon the western idealization of fundamental rights; however, considering the situation in Egypt, the life-sentence imposed on an individual for "shooting" at military personnel is a reasonable and peaceful alternative to the violent military interventions in August. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Paul Juzdan, <a href="http://law.shu.edu/">Seton Hall University School of Law</a> Class of 2014, is the author of a series commenting on the Syrian civil war. Previously, Juzdan <a href="/dateline/2013/09/paul-juzdan-syria-rebels.php">explored</a> the the difficulty of identifying who the rebels are and what their overreaching goals are in the Syrian civil war. In this part, he analyzes the consequences of using the policy of Responsibility to Protect (R2P) in an intervention in Syria...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/dateline/Juzdan.JPG" width="120" height="200" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he ambiguity surrounding the identity and aims of rebel forces in Syria has turned out to be a clear roadblock in the way of international intervention, clear evidence that intervention in the name of humanitarianism can be a troublesome proposition, especially in Syria. The formation of an international coalition aimed at ending the Syrian civil war in a military fashion would most definitely fall under the auspice of "the Responsibility to Protect." This principle, also known as R2P, emerged in 2005 as a set of principles based on the idea that sovereignty is not merely a right but a responsibility. The 2005 World Summit outlines 178 points concerning the role of the UN and sovereign states in the international community. <a href="http://www.responsibilitytoprotect.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=398">Paragraph 138</a> states in part that "each individual State has the responsibility to protect its populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity." Effectively, the General Assembly has set forth an ultimatum: either states take steps to protect all of their citizens or the Security Council will take action. The UN Secretary General's High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change put forth a list of <a href="(http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/gaA.59.565_En.pdf">criteria for intervention in R2P cases:</a> [PDF]: <ol><li>Seriousness of threat, <li>Proper Purpose, <li>Last Resort, <li> Proportional Means and <li> Balance of Consequences.</li></ol><br />
R2P has faced considerable <a href="http://www.yjil.org/docs/pub/35-2-payandeh-great-responsibility.pdf">criticism</a> [PDF] since its inception. For example, when UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon decided to appoint a "Special Adviser on the Responsibility to Protect" in 2007, nations such as Cuba, Nicaragua, Egypt, Iran and Venezuela expressed deep concerns: "[t]his criticism was clearly aimed at the attempt to embed the 'responsibility to protect' in the institutional framework of the United Nations without prior consultation of the General Assembly." </p>

<p>The civil war in Libya is probably the most striking example of the UN's implementation of the principle of R2P. In response to growing concerns of human rights violations, the UN Security Council issued <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/1973(2011)">Resolution 1973</a> [PDF] which imposed a no-fly zone over Libya and authorizing all necessary means to protect civilians and civilian-populated areas except for a "foreign occupation force." The Security Council strategically included language that would prevent any type of occupation force making it rather difficult to determine the extent to which ground forces could be used. The Security Council utilized the principle of R2P to protect civilians and end the conflict, but the outcomes of this intervention ultimately included regime change. This presents legitimate concerns, specifically, what distinguishes R2P from regime change?</p>

<p>UN Security Council <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/1970(2011)">Resolution 1970</a> [PDF] called for steps "to fulfill the legitimate demands of the population [of Libya]." This same resolution put in place a travel ban and asset freeze specifically aimed at Gaddafi, his family and other high-ranking officials of the regime. Furthermore, the aforementioned Resolution 1973 fails to elaborate on the admissible means that may be employed in order to implement and achieve the goals surrounding R2P intervention. Whether or not the goals put forth under Resolution 1973 were in fact to overthrow Gaddafi or merely to protect the citizens of Libya is of no consequence. Ultimately, protecting the population necessitated a regime change. This was, after all, one of the "legitimate demands of the population." Some would suggest that the <a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/stephen-marks/files/2012/10/r2p_jglr_2010.pdf">purpose of R2P</a> [PDF] is to "offer a middle ground between impunity for oppression and violent overthrow by strongly supporting the state to find its own way to end the oppression, backed up by outside pressure short of regime change." This may in fact be the primary motive for using the principle of R2P to protect civilians without overthrowing their government. However, it seems clear that once R2P is implicated the resulting regime change is inevitable. A request on the part of the international community to promote R2P and reject regime change constitutes an unreasonable request on the part of intervening forces and the regimes they target.    </p>

<p>R2P in its very nature encompasses more than a mere "in-and-out" operation. It fosters a responsibility to prevent, react and rebuild; the principle itself inadvertently calls for regime change. The means responding to war crimes in Libya left the international community questioning whether the rules of sovereignty remain a central component of international relations. There remains a broad consensus that "views forcible regime change of tyrannies into regimes of democratic rule as a <em>per se</em> <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2013590">illegitimate interference into the affairs of other nations</a>, a position likewise conceptualized as foundational in the United Nations Charter."</p>

<p>If the US decides to invoke the principle of R2P and invade Syria the same question would arise: is the goal of intervention in fact aimed at protecting the population or changing the regime? An article written by <a href="http://graduateinstitute.ch/files/live/sites/iheid/files/shared/executive_education/INP%202009/Syllabi/Evans%20-%20When%20Is%20It%20Right%20to%20Fight.pdf">Gareth Evans</a> [PDF], former president of the International Crisis Group, outlines the importance of properly implementing the principle of R2P. Evans points out that the poor and inconsistent argument that the invasion of Iraq was based on Saddam Hussein's record of tyranny over his own people was an "almost choked at birth" principle of R2P. A legitimate use of force on the part of the Security Council would include an application of threshold criteria, an analysis of the weight of the evidence and understanding of the full range of threats.</p>

<p>In Libya, it is clear that the measures that were employed in order to keep Gaddafi from attacking the civilian population, at the same time supported the actions of the rebels that wished to topple the regime. Some scholars argue, however, that R2P was properly applied in Libya, specifically due to the fact that no great power had special interests or close relationships with the Gaddafi regime. Furthermore, the operation was feasible on the part of the intervening coalition and supported by the UN Security Council. Syria, on the other hand, poses numerous logistical problems that Libya did not, including numerous operational challenges and a more complex ethnic, tribal and geostrategic environment. While logistics should not prevent the promotion of human rights, they should be considered, specifically in an environment where intervention may do more harm than good. A regime change in Syria that results in the institution of an Islamist government will pose a threat to minority groups such as Christians and Alawites. As a result, many Christians fear the prospects of a post-Assad Syria. Thousands have fled the country fearing that a <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2013/0906/Arab-Christians-come-out-strongly-against-US-strike-in-Syria">non-secular government will pose a serious threat</a> to their congregations, churches, religious leaders and overall quality of life. An internationally recognized, legal regime change does not ensure the institution of a "democratic" regime. Furthermore, Syria's foreign policy initiatives, under a new regime, may work against the interests of peace in the region. For example, it would not be a safe assumption that a new Islamist regime in Syria would retain stable, albeit unfriendly, relations with Israel.  </p>

<p>Whether or not R2P is being considered by the Security Council to determine what actions to take in Syria, it is clear that unilateral intervention would violate international law. If, however, an interventionist coalition was formed under the auspices of the Security Council utilizing the principle of R2P, international law would be upheld. However, serious issues concerning the means and ends of R2P would come to the forefront of international relations law. Furthermore, intervention in Syria as a result of R2P would result in serious ethno-political consequences, including a rise in sectarian violence and regional instability.</p>

		<title>Some Real Effects of Eminent Domain in New York City</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Nathaniel Chiaravalloti, <a href=" http://www.stjohns.edu/academics/graduate/law ">St. John's University School of Law</a> Class of 2014, is the author of the second article in a 10-part series from the staffers of the <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/academics/graduate/law/journals_activities/jcred">Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development</a>. Chiaravalloti discusses the negative consequences of the government exercising eminent domain in New York City ...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="Chiaravalloti.jpg" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Chiaravalloti.jpg" width="120" height="160" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>ur nation's collective indifference to the effects of gentrification, the separation by neighborhood of people based on race, ethnicity or class is well known. The "not in my neighborhood" mindset, where homeowners place their property values over the well-being of the community, is common. It is so much so that many state and local governments have begun taking affirmative steps to further the gentrification of cities and neighborhoods, and one of the most alarming steps comes in the form of economic redevelopment of poorer and more vulnerable neighborhoods. Particularly in crowded urban centers, available prime real estate has diminished to the point where urban planners and politicians are electing to simply bulldoze and rebuild neighborhoods than invest in their revitalization. </p>

<p>This issue has become more real for the people of New York City, where it was once the case that the government could use its constitutional authority to take property from private owners for public works, such as highways or water treatment facilities, but today, the city's takings authority has expanded. It has grown to include public/private partnerships where private capital drives investment in urban renewal projects. In New York City, among other places, over the past few years, private landowners have been forced to sell their property through the state power of eminent domain. Unlike the past, however, these landowners were not displaced to make room for a new highway, but instead for building projects like the Barclay's Center in Brooklyn and the northward expansion of Columbia University in Manhattan. And in both of these building projects, those who were displaced were private landowners of modest means, who saw their neighborhoods declared "blighted" by the government agency charged with authorizing these takings. </p>

<p>The US Supreme Court held in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1101424605047973909">Kelo v. New London</a> that public/private partnerships are within constitutional authority to use eminent domain to take land for a "public use" or related public good. Specifically, the government can take land from one private owner for "fair" market price, and give it over to another private party to redevelop. However, Justice Anthony Kennedy's deciding vote came with a concurring opinion, wherein he voiced concern over the possibility that favoritism in local government, unfair dealings or other corruption might arise in such public/private partnerships. His concurrence turned out to be prophetic, as some of the very ills about which he warned came to the attention of the New York State Court of Appeals in the case of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11608952048532198783">Kaur v. New York State Urban Development Corporation</a>, also known as the Columbia University Takings case. </p>

<p>The <em>Kaur</em> case raised two questions. First, whether conflicts of interest between Columbia University and the state regulators, such as retaining a mutual consultant for a "blight study" constituted unfair favoritism. And second, whether Columbia University's willful neglect of the surrounding area over a period of nearly a decade, which led to the whole area being declared "blighted," constituted bad faith. Those questions were ultimately disregarded by the New York Court of Appeals, which instead considered the case only through the lens of the campus expansion being a "public good." Therefore, I propose a more precise judicial test that is mindful of Justice Kennedy's concerns to protect the proverbial "little guy" in public/private takings cases by taking into account evidence of bribery, favoritism or bad faith on the part of the private developer, or by the government agency, which authorized the taking. By adding a layer of judicial oversight to public/private partnerships, such partnerships would avoid improper behavior. Furthermore, offering legal recourse to those aggrieved by the taking process will help make sure that only those takings that are free of bad faith, favoritism or bribery will be allowed to proceed. </p>

<p>The real effect of decisions such as <em>Kaur</em> is that formerly affordable neighborhoods are demolished or remade into something entirely different. Those lucky enough to avoid the taking find their property values increasing, which forces people of more modest means away from these neighborhoods and into poorer neighboring areas. Worse still, while people forced out are paid "fair market value" for their property, it is almost always the case that their property becomes exponentially more valuable after they have relocated, which could rightly strike many as being unfair to the outgoing owner.</p>

<p>The end result, for citizens of the perpetually crowded New York City, is that there are fewer neighborhoods where working people can afford to live. And as those neighborhoods become more crowded, the standard of living decreases with it. Instead, with takings-aided gentrification, we get shiny new stadiums and beautiful new campuses, which no doubt benefit some, but fail to provide a public benefit to the vast majority of New York citizens. We are choosing to help some to the detriment of others. If we choose to turn a blind eye to the problem, where does it stop, especially in cases where there is a conflict of interest or favoritism shown to the developer by the government authorities? Ideally, it would stop with the implementation of judicial review over public/private takings. By creating strong incentives for good behavior by developers, not only would vulnerable neighborhoods be afforded better protection, but such projects could move forward with less contentiousness than the cases cited here. Finally, the trappings of a convenient quid pro quo between developers and the state would be replaced by the watchful eye of the judiciary, ensuring the fairest and most just outcomes in future takings cases. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Nimra Azmi, <a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/">Harvard Law School</a> Class of 2015, discusses a recent vote for a bill by the North Carolina General Assembly which would ban all foreign law from the state...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="Azmi.jpg" src="/dateline/Azmi.jpg" width="120" height="154" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n August 25, 2013, the North Carolina General Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/north-carolina-governor-allows-anti-sharia-bill-to-become-law.php">passed</a> the <a href="http://ncleg.net/Sessions/2013/Bills/House/PDF/H695v4.pdf">Family, Faith, and Freedom Protection Act of 2013</a> [PDF], which forbids the use of "foreign law" in North Carolina state courts. Likely seeking to deflect criticism and circumvent recent federal precedent that has declared pointed bans of Shariah unconstitutional, the North Carolina act has replaced "Shariah law" with "foreign law." While the North Carolina bill was initially a straightforward prohibition of the use of "foreign law" in state courts, the state legislature added a lengthy provision, limiting insurance coverage of abortion and requiring "informed consent" and a 24 hour waiting period prior to performance of an abortion. Of course, there is a luscious irony in the inclusion of an anti-abortion measure in the self-same bill that ostensibly serves to stymie the infiltration of religious doctrine into American law, with the question of exactly whose freedom of faith the act protects.</p>

<p>North Carolina is certainly not the first state to introduce legislation resisting the perceived threat of "creeping Shariah." Since 2010, similar laws have been <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/08/04/states-ban-foreign-law/2602511/">proposed</a> in 25 states, including New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Minnesota. Seven other states have gone so far as to pass such laws. Proponents of anti-Shariah laws like North Carolina's claim that such laws buttress constitutional liberties. Opponents <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/27/anti-sharia-bill-north-carolina-gov-pat-mccrory_n_3823796.html?">argue</a> that the bills are redundant: the US Constitution already defends the liberties that these bills profess to protect and such acts serve only to incite anti-Muslim sentiment. The American Bar Association <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/2013/07/19/3042514/nc-senate-passes-sharia-law-bill.html">has warned</a> that these bills, in their prohibition of "foreign law," can adversely impact businesses, economic development and US foreign commerce. Not only do such measures call into question the enforceability of international agreements and awards, but they can also <a href="http://www.law.ku.edu/sites/law.drupal.ku.edu/files/docs/law_review/v61/Boyer.pdf">limit</a> [PDF] the growth and expansion of foreign companies and companies with foreign employees into states that have approved these laws.</p>

<p>Recently, the case of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4740311284453756960">Awad v. Ziriax</a> questioned the constitutionality of such anti-Shariah efforts. On May 25, 2010, the Oklahoma House of Representatives and Senate passed the <a href="https://www.sos.ok.gov/documents/questions/755.pdf">Save Our State Amendment</a> [PDF] (also known by the utterly non-alarmist abbreviation SOS) which proscribed state courts from considering international or Shariah law when deciding cases. In bringing the suit, Muneer Awad contended that the Save Our State Amendment violated his <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/free_exercise_clause">free exercise and establishment clause</a> rights under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a>. He argued that the amendment's singling out of Islam stigmatized Muslims, would prevent a court from executing his last will and testament which had been drawn under Shariah, and limit the relief Muslims could obtain from state courts. In Awad's view, the Save Our State Amendment excessively entangled government and religion.</p>

<p>In <em>Awad</em>, the US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/tenth-circuit-upholds-ruling-blocking-oklahoma-islamic-law-ban.php">held</a> that the express condemnation of Islam in the Save Our State Amendment created a direct-in-fact injury that produced standing for an establishment clause suit. Finding that the language of the amendment differentiated between religions and did so expressly, the Tenth Circuit applied the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/strict_scrutiny">strict scrutiny</a> standard from <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12805749042827101838">Larson v. Valente</a>, which holds that "if a law discriminates among religions, it can survive only if it is 'closely fitted to the furtherance of any compelling interest asserted.'" The Tenth Circuit found that although Oklahoma had expressed a valid state concern ("determining what law is applied in Oklahoma state courts"), the amendment was not seeking to solve any present problem and thus lacked the requisite "compelling interest" to survive strict scrutiny. The court held that even if Oklahoma was attempting to rectify a specific issue, a statewide ban of Shariah was not "narrowly fitted" under the Larson standard. This failure under strict scrutiny led the Tenth Circuit to grant Awad's petition for preliminary injunction.</p>

<p>The North Carolina state legislature, no doubt with an eye to the ruling in <em>Awad</em>, removed specific reference to Shariah law, instead targeting "foreign law." While in <em>Awad</em>, the Tenth Circuit found strict scrutiny particularly applicable under <em>Larson</em> based on the Save Our State Amendment's express mention of Shariah, the absence of a direct reference does not prevent a court from applying <em>Larson</em>'s standards. To wit, the act challenged in <em>Larson</em> did not mention any particular faith. Rather, it required registration and disclosure from religious organizations that received more than half of their contributions from nonmembers. This denominational preference to well-established religious groups led the US Supreme Court to find that the act violates the establishment clause. Moreover, the Court found that the act was not "tightly fitted" to any supposed legitimate public purpose. </p>

<p>Under the Supreme Court's reasoning in <em>Larson</em>, North Carolina's Family, Faith, and Freedom Protection Act may ultimately fail strict scrutiny and be overruled under the establishment clause despite the attempt to guise Shariah as "foreign law." Like the act in <em>Larson</em>, the North Carolina act would affect only certain denominations: in this case, proceedings under the laws of those faiths deemed foreign&#8212;Islam, Hinduism and potentially Judaism, among others. Whether Christianity's Middle Eastern and European roots are enough to categorize it as "foreign" remains to be seen. The absence of a specific mention of Shariah law, perhaps thought to be a coup of legislative maneuvering after <em>Awad</em>, may not suffice to preserve the act. It may also be found that the act lacks a legitimate public purpose, particularly since the US Constitution already preserves the liberties the act claims to protect. As a North Carolina state senator <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/07/03/nc-lawmaker-on-adding-abortion-ban-to-anti-sharia-bill-republicans-are-scarier-than-muslims/">noted</a>, "There's not a single instance of anything like that [Shari'ah law] appearing in the North Carolina courts. And yet, you're playing to people's base fears by promoting this." Even if courts were using Shariah law or other religious or "foreign" law in the interpretation of marriage contracts or similar, if its utilization aligned with principles of American law, then surely no indignity would be suffered by the people of North Carolina. Assuming <em>arguendo</em>, as the Supreme Court did in </em>Larson</em>, that a legitimate public purpose could be discovered, a broad-stroke prohibition against the application of foreign law may be deemed not "tightly fitted" enough to serve its purpose.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court has also previously found, in a key First Amendment case, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=975414503455261754">Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah</a> that "[f]acial neutrality is not determinative ... The Free Exercise Clause protects against governmental hostility which is masked, as well as overt." In <em>Lukumi</em>, the City of Hialeah passed an ordinance which prohibited the sacrifice of animals, directly interfering with the petitioner Santeria church's practices. Although the ordinance itself was facially neutral, the Supreme Court deemed the law to be of non-neutral applicability and thus subject to strict scrutiny. Under <em>Lukumi</em> then, despite the facial neutrality of North Carolina's act, its non-neutral application, which could disable practices of Muslims as well as of adherents of other faiths deemed to be not American enough, may lead to a finding of unconstitutionality under the free exercise clause. Furthermore, in <em>Lukumi</em>, the Court looked to the record, the language in the city council's enactments and identified deliberate machinations against Santeria. Similarly, there can be no doubt that the North Carolina General Assembly passed the Family, Faith, and Freedom Protection Act under anti-Muslim auspices. The bill's sponsor, Senator E.S. Newton, <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/2013/07/19/3042514/nc-senate-passes-sharia-law-bill.html">emphasized</a> that the legislation was directed at Islamic law during the assembly session that passed the bill. </p>

<p>Ultimately, the passage of the Family, Faith, and Freedom Protection Act was motivated by bigotry and extremism, representing an abuse of power by a narrow-minded group unabashed in its ignorance. It follows the same xenophobic vein as previously passed acts that have been accordingly struck down as unconstitutional. No true public purpose is to be found here, save for the drumming up of anti-Muslim sentiment in the name of politics and prejudice. At best the attempted passage of this bill is fear mongering and at worst, an avatar of oppression&#8212;a reminder to Muslims and those of "foreign" faiths that they are other and unwelcome. Despite North Carolina's attempt to distinguish its bill from the bill in <em>Awad</em>, these shallow reconstructions have not obfuscated the bill's malicious intent in the eyes of the public, and if precedent should guide, the reworking of the bill will not be enough to veil it in the eyes of the law.</p>

		<title>Kenya&amp;apos;s Withdrawal from ICC was Bound to Happen</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Christopher Cardona, <a href="http://www.jmls.edu/">John Marshall Law School</a> Class of 2014, discusses Kenya's recent withdrawal from the ICC and what that could mean for other ICC member states...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="cardona.jpg" src="/dateline/cardona.jpg" width="120" height="129" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n September 5, 2013, members of the Kenyan National Assembly <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-23969316">voted</a> on a measure designed to facilitate a <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/kenya-parliament-approves-motion-to-withdraw-from-icc.php">withdrawal</a> from the International Criminal Court (ICC). The vote, which passed by a comfortable margin, was followed by a similar motion in the Senate on Tuesday. These actions by the parliament have placed Kenya in the position of becoming the first country ever to withdraw from the ICC. </p>

<p>President Uhuru Kenyatta and first Deputy President William Ruto's <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/icc-grants-kenya-leaders-request-to-postpone-trial.php">trials</a> in the Hague will not be affected by this decision. Formal withdrawal from the ICC only occurs one year after a written submission has been presented to the UN Secretary General, and in any case, withdrawal does not remove a state's duty to cooperate with ongoing criminal proceedings. Both men have been charged by the ICC Prosecutor with crimes against humanity, stemming from violence that erupted in Kenya following the election in December of 2007. Inter-party <a href="http://www.irinnews.org/in-depth/76116/68/kenya-s-post-election-crisis">clashes</a> resulted in the deaths of over 1,200 people, a great number of injuries and the displacement of more than 600,000.  </p>

<p>While the parliament's votes have made news internationally, their actions are not particularly surprising. For a number of years now, African states have expressed concern and criticism of the ICC. In many ways, the votes can be seen as a logical next step in what has become a protracted criticism of the ICC, both in Kenya and across the continent. </p>

<p>There have been repeated calls by critics in Kenya for a localized resolution to the tragic post election violence. However, these calls have been undermined by the inability of Kenya's Parliament to devise a national tribunal to handle such an effort. Even with such failings, the country has resisted efforts by the ICC to fill the void, despite the fact that such procedures had been agreed upon while the situation was being mediated. The country has further shown its aversion to the ICC's efforts by rallying around President Kenyatta and deputy Ruto, and propelling them to electoral victory despite the stigma of ICC charges hovering over them. </p>

<p>Similarly, the African Union (AU) has repeatedly made calls for member states to distance themselves from the ICC. In the past the AU has <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12332563">endorsed</a> Kenya's request to delay the trials. Also, both Kenya and the AU have latched onto arguments criticizing the ICC as neocolonialist and anti-African. This criticism has been a rallying cry for AU member states that question the true purpose of a court. They contended that it is distressing that the ICC has only ever brought trials against Africans, or as the AU <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-22681894">described</a> the investigations in May, "hunting" Africans. These critics have also latched onto arguments first brought forward by the US as justification for not ratifying the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a>. These included concerns over state sovereignty and the protection of citizens from potentially political prosecutions. While these various criticisms of the ICC may not be new, the actions of Kenya's parliament have highlighted that they may continue to be major obstacles to the ICC's efforts to add additional member states. </p>

<p>The timing of the vote has been the focus of much attention. Given that it occurred only a day before deputy Ruto traveled to the Hague to begin his trial, it appears to be designed as a rebuke of the ICC. The timing has certainly not been lost on those reporting on parliament's actions, many of whom have linked the two. However, it is these protracted structural concerns which parliament has cited as the bases for their actions. If these concerns remain unaddressed, the future role of the ICC will be further jeopardized. These concerns, which have been reiterated across the continent for a number of years, may very well come back to haunt the court. </p>

<p>In the past, ICC Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda has been very direct in responding to criticism regarding the ICC's investigations of Africans by <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-is-the-international-criminal-court-picking-only-on-africa/2013/03/29/cb9bf5da-96f7-11e2-97cd-3d8c1afe4f0f_story_1.html">stating</a>, "[A]ll of the victims in our cases in Africa are African victims ... And they are the ones who are suffering these crimes." In direct response to the Kenyan Parliament's actions, the President of the Assembly of States Parties, Ambassador Tiina Intelmann, has <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/Pages/pr938.aspx">expressed</a> a more general concern regarding the state's actions, stating, "[I] hope that Kenya will remain within the Rome Statute and thus continue to contribute to the fight against impunity, which is a common endeavor of all states."</p>

<p>This action has also evoked criticism from the Kenyan government's opposition, human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and the Catholic church. These groups and others have rightly expressed disappointment and concern that Kenya was receding from its commitments to international human rights, and reducing the ability of victims of the most egregious rights violation to seek justice. This concern highlights one of the core benefits which ICC membership can provide. It is this protection of individuals' rights by facilitating an end to impunity which is a crucial aspect of the court. Furthermore, the government's actions are a major shift considering a few years ago many African states cited past failures of national structural protection of these rights as a basis for their support concerning the formation of the ICC. One of the interesting questions going forward will be whether any of Kenya's neighbors follow their lead and continue to vent their frustration over the ICC. </p>

<p>President Goodluck Jonathan of Nigeria, whose own country ratified the Rome Statute in 2001 may be one such candidate. He certainly seemed sympathetic to parliament's actions when he spoke recently to the Kenyan National Assembly. He <a href="http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/?articleID=2000093020&story_title=Kenya-nigeria-president-addresses-several-issues-fails-to-mention-drug-menace">stated</a>, "I believe that laws, whether local or international, treaties or conventions, or institutions set up to manage those laws, treaties and conventions, are set up to solve problems, not to add to the problems." While by no means an explicit endorsement of ICC withdrawal, this does highlight a continued banding together of AU states, even in spite of international criticism. </p>

<p>Only time will tell if the actions of Kenya's Parliament are merely an isolated incident or the start of a larger regional rebuke of the ICC. It is clear that the criticism leveled against the court is not going away, and the ICC still has much work to do in order to retain support within its member states. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Ginger Grimes, <a href="http://www.law.uci.edu">University of California, Irvine School of Law Class</a> of 2015, discusses the recent announcement by the Department of Justice regarding veteran same-sex couples benefits and advocates that the place of celebration rule should be adopted...<hr height='1'><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size='3'><strong>L</strong></font>ast month, a federal district court in California <a href="http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/MSNBC/Sections/NEWS/AJDocs/20130829_VA_SameSex_Ruling.pdf">struck down</a> [PDF] a law <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/federal-judge-rules-same-sex-spouses-entitled-to-veterans-benefits.php">denying veterans benefits to same-sex spouses</a>. The plaintiff, Tracey Cooper-Harris, a veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, is legally married to her wife, Maggie Cooper-Harris. The couple happens to reside in California, a state that allows same-sex couples to marry. Although Tracey was approved for disability benefits, her wife was ineligible for spousal disability benefits. The court struck down the exclusion, holding that it is "not rationally related to the military's commitment to caring for and providing for veterans benefits." It is unclear at this point whether the ruling applies to only the Cooper-Harrises or instead to all same-sex married couples applying for spousal veterans benefits.</p>

<p>In response to the decision, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/doj-will-not-enforce-law-denying-veterans-benefits-to-same-sex-spouses.php">announced</a> earlier this month that it will stop denying veterans benefits to same-sex spouses. The announcement, however, left unanswered choice-of-law questions for couples who, unlike the Cooper-Harrises, live in a state that does not recognize their marriage. These questions are not unique to the DOJ&#8212;announcements by federal agencies regarding same-sex marriage recognition have been increasingly common after the Supreme Court's June decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16984760145378489607">United States v. Windsor</a>. That ruling struck down <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1738C">Section 3</a> of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which prevented the federal government from recognizing same-sex couples' valid state-law marriages. The <em>Windsor</em> Court provided no instruction to federal agencies deciding how to move forward after DOMA. In <em>Windsor's</em> wake, the federal government needs to consider how to administer laws covering, for instance, "Social Security, housing, taxes, criminal sanctions, copyright and veterans' benefits." With no explicit guidance, federal agencies have announced their own policies for same-sex marriage recognition in a piecemeal fashion. In the context of veterans benefits, this silence leaves veterans and their spouses potentially ineligible for benefits based on factors that are, in a practical sense, out of their control. Some agencies have announced a place-of-celebration rule meaning the laws of the state in which a couple was married determines the validity of the marriage. Others have adopted a place-of-residence rule, meaning the laws of the state in which the couple lives governs whether a marriage will be recognized as valid. For veterans benefits, it is especially important that the DOJ follow the first approach. A place-of-celebration rule will reconcile the messy interplay between state and federal law and, crucially, cast a wider net of support for the families of veterans who have died or been injured in service.</p>

<p>Upon discharge from the military, veterans face a harsh reality. The US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) <a href="http://nchv.org/index.php/news/media/background_and_statistics">estimates</a> that 62,619 veterans are homeless on any given night, and over twice that number experience homelessness in a year. Around <a href="http://nchv.org/index.php/news/media/background_and_statistics">1.4 million</a> additional veterans are on the verge of homelessness due to poverty, lack of support and substandard living conditions. Although only <a href="http://nchv.org/index.php/news/media/background_and_statistics">7 percent</a> of the general population has veteran status, about <a href="http://nchv.org/index.php/news/media/background_and_statistics">13 percent</a> of the homeless adult population is a veteran. Causes of homelessness for veterans include the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other mental health issues, physical disability, substance abuse and skill sets that may not be transferable to the civilian workforce. These statistics indicate the real barriers our veterans face after their service, which hinder their ability to move freely to other states. The statistics also highlight the urgency for expanding support for veterans and their spouses, differentiating it from, for example, a need to expand rights to same-sex couples under copyright law. A place-of-celebration rule would enlarge eligibility for veteran spousal benefits, a move that is consistent with the nation's commitment to supporting veterans and their families.</p>

<p>If the DOJ chooses to adopt a place-of-domicile rule, veterans and their spouses living in states that do not recognize same-sex marriage would be ineligible for benefits. This includes states with particularly large veteran populations. Texas and Pennsylvania, for instance, <a href="http://www.va.gov/vetdata/veteran_population.asp">have veteran populations</a> of about 1,675,000 and 980,000 respectively. Spouses of veterans are entitled to a number of benefits through the Veterans Administration, including <a href="http://benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/types-dependency_and_indemnity.asp">dependency and indemnity compensation</a>, <a href="http://www.benefits.va.gov/pension/spousepen.asp">survivor's pension</a> and <a href="http://www.gibill.va.gov/benefits/other_programs/dea.html">educational assistance programs</a>. None of these benefits would be available to same-sex spouses, based simply on the fact that they live in a state that does not recognize their marriage.</p>

<p>Last month's announcement of a place-of-celebration rule by the Department of Defense (DOD) should serve as a model for the DOJ. The DOD's new policy affords military benefits to same-sex spouses while simultaneously announcing that the military will allow leave for current military personnel to travel to another jurisdiction to marry. The DOD avoids the issue of whether to provide benefits for married couples living in states that do not recognize same-sex marriages. Spousal and family benefits will be provided upon a showing of a valid marriage certificate--from any state. Thus, the DOD policy avoids the confusion caused by <em>Windsor</em> by allowing military spousal benefits to be based on the place-of-celebration rule. </p>

<p>The place-of-domicile rule may be justified by states' desire to avoid recognition of evasive marriages, in which a couple travels to another state to take advantage of the more favorable marriage law without the intention of ever residing in that state. Yet the federal government has a less concrete interest that the states in avoiding marriage recognition; there is no federal marriage law to evade. More importantly, service members do not always have the luxury of choosing their state of residence. Although service members rank their choices of terms of places to live, their placement will ultimately be determined by the needs of their branch. A service member's state of domicile is therefore often determined by the military, not by the service member's intentions, which is antithetical to the idea that couples can freely move to states with laws that better align with their needs. In fact, the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=16203">DOD's leave policy</a> was part of a recognition "that same-sex military couples who are not stationed in a jurisdiction that permits same-sex marriage would have to travel to another jurisdiction to get married. ... This [policy] will provide accelerated access to the full range of benefits offered to married military couples throughout the department, and help level the playing field between opposite-sex and same-sex couples seeking to be married."</p>

<p>A place-of-celebration rule would further the military's commitment to providing for veterans benefits by extending benefits to more veterans and their dependents who, unlike Tracey and Maggie Cooper-Harris, do not live in a state that recognizes their marriage. The rule would allow veterans and their spouses to simply show that they have, in some state, a legally valid marriage. This flexibility would allow more support for our veterans and their dependents, especially as the population of Gulf War Era veterans rises <a href="http://www1.va.gov/vetdata/docs/quickfacts/Population_slideshow.pdf">over the next few decades</a> [PDF]. Therefore, the DOJ should clarify that, like the DOD policy, same-sex spouses of veterans are entitled to benefits upon showing a valid marriage license, regardless of the licensing state. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Paul+Juzdan">Paul Juzdan</a>, <a href="http://law.shu.edu/">Seton Hall University School of Law</a> Class of 2014, is the author of a series commenting on the Syrian civil war. Previously, Juzdan explained the nature and complexity of identifying the rebels in Syria and the implications of using the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) doctrine in justifying an intervention in Syria. Here, Juzdan explores the ethnopolitical landscape of Syria and what a regime change could mean for the country and international relations...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/dateline/Juzdan.JPG" width="120" height="200" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he population of Syria is characterized by <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sy.html">strong religious and ethnic diversity</a>. Syria's population is well over 22.5 million. Sunni Muslims make up about 74 percent of the population, while other sects of Islam, including Alawites, Druze and Shia, account for about 16 percent of the population. Other religious minorities include Christians, who make up about 10 percent of the population, and Jews, who live in small communities throughout Syria, mainly in Damascus, Al Qamishli and Aleppo. About 90 percent of the Syrian population is Arab. Kurds, Armenians and other ethnic minorities account for about 10 percent of the population. <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ly.html#People">Compare</a> this to Libya's 97 percent Sunni Muslim population and two main ethnic groups, Arab and Berber. Syria has a strikingly more complex demographic structure and, as a result, regime change may cause a significant surge in sectarian violence. Furthermore, the presence of these distinct ethnic groups in Syria has led to tension between government forces and religious and ethnic groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood&#8212;a complicating factor that was not necessarily present in countries such as Libya.  </p>

<p>This ethnic and religious diversity is the result of a complex set of historical events leading up to Bashar al-Assad's presidency in 2000. Many individuals from poor rural areas saw a military career as a welcome opportunity to climb the social ladder and to lead a life that would be slightly more comfortable than what was possible within the farming sector. This contributed to the strong representation of minorities in the Syrian army resulting in <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/article/modest-post-assad-plan-7624?page=4">government policies</a> that tended to favor Christians and Alawites which, in turn, has had an enormous impact on the current conflict.  </p>

<p><strong>Assad's Politics: Reformer or Brutal Tyrant?</strong></p>

<p>During the presidency of Hafez al-Assad, Bashar's father, numerous policies were put in place to help "coup-proof" Syria, ensuring a long period of stability. Before Hafez's presidency, Syria had experienced a series of ten <em>coup d'états</em>, a record in the Arab world. However, Hafez al-Assad's economic and foreign relations policies were not as effective as his political ones. In the late 1980's, Hafez faced <a href="http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+sy0027)">numerous challenges</a>, including a declining economy, an isolated foreign policy and tensions with Israel. These circumstances would continue throughout much of his presidency, which lasted until his death on June 10, 2000. Upon his death, his son Bashar, the current president, was elected for a seven-year term and re-elected for another seven-year term in 2007.</p>

<p>During Bashar al-Assad's presidency, and under the Bush Administration, US-Syria relations gradually disintegrated. Several events led up to this <a href="http://www.uiowa.edu/~tlcp/TLCP%20Articles/20-1/Kurth.Final.JYZ.04132011.pdf">breakdown</a> [PDF], including "the Palestinian intifada of 2000, Syria's disapproval of the US-led invasion of Iraq, the US's region wide push for democracy, and US open support for regime change in Syria." It was not until Obama became president that the US sought to form closer ties with Syria. On February 16, 2010, President Obama nominated Robert Ford to be the US Ambassador to Syria, and Ford presented his credentials to President Bashar al-Assad on January 27, 2011. Unfortunately, once the "Arab Spring" protests began, the US was forced to <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/10/24/141647127/u-s-ambassador-leaves-syria-due-to-credible-threats">pull Ambassador Ford from Syria</a> over security concerns, blaming the lack of safety on President Assad's regime.</p>

<p>Today, it seems that Assad has lost legitimacy in the international community but it is rather puzzling how quickly he lost it. In attempting to reignite relations with the Syrian government, President Barack Obama appointed the first US Ambassador to Syria in five years. In February of 2010, the US sent Under-Secretary of State William Burns on a visit to Syria to meet with President Assad and improve US-Syrian relations. In July of 2010, <a href="http://damascus.usembassy.gov/media/pdf/press-releases-pdf/spector-pr.pdf">Arlen Specter</a> [PDF], a US Senator from Pennsylvania, "had a constructive and in-depth conversation about the formidable challenges facing the region and ways in which the US and Syria can overcome those challenges." These examples illustrate that the Obama administration did, at one point, see a need for strong US-Syrian relations. In addition, <a href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/syrian-president-assad-regarded-reformer-clinton-says">Hillary Clinton</a> at one point was quoted saying, "President Assad is a reformer." Once Assad began experiencing difficulty surrounding the protests, the administration began labeling him a barbaric dictator. How an individual can go from being a reformer to a barbaric dictator in under a year is a question that has remained unanswered. </p>

<p><strong>The Lasting Effects</strong></p>

<p>With this ethnopolitical landscape in mind, one can see how a sudden regime change similar to the one that took place in Libya could negatively impact millions of individuals currently living in Syria. The country stands as a strategic player in the Middle East peace process. Syria has taken steps towards mending the rivalry between Fatah and Hamas, the rival political parties within the Palestinian territories. Most importantly, the government of Syria has no ties with al-Qaeda and has repressed other Muslim fundamentalist groups, such as the Muslim Brotherhood. Allegations of chemical warfare have steered the current debate over Syria. However, history shows that President Bashar al-Assad is not another "mad dog" of the Middle East. Furthermore, the international community has a strong interest in restoring stability in Syria as soon as possible.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/syria-after-assad-heading-toward-a-hard-fall">The Washington Institute</a>, an organization aimed at improving Middle East policy, published a report which expresses the concerns associated with a post-Assad Syria: "rather than surrendering their hard-won gains to some faraway central authority, [the rebels] might prefer to forge alliances with other local leaders (including members of different ethnosectarian communities) and/or external powers, as occurred during and after Lebanon's civil war." This raises concerns that the future of minority groups such as Christians and Alawites in a post-Assad world would remain uncertain, and the events surrounding regime change may ignite a mass exodus. <em>The Washington Institute</em> also points out that the rise of Sunni's in Syria may also spark political movements in countries such as Jordan, Iraq and the West Bank, rocking the "political balance of power in these societies."     </p>

<p>Professor W. Michael Reisman, a Professor of International Law at Yale Law School, offers <a href="http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2042&context=fss_papers">ten guidelines for a successful regime change</a> [PDF] and Syria falls well outside these guidelines. The suggestions include ensuring a significant amount of domestic and internal support for the regime change, ensuring the individual or elite group that is the target of regime change does not have an effective internal base and making certain that the costs of a regime change remain low. The list goes on to recommend that "an acceptable alternative government be readily available and that the UN be responsible or prominently involved" - two impractical expectations surrounding any military intervention measure in Syria.</p>

<p>There must be alternatives to regime change. The US reacted quickly to the 2011 uprisings by rejecting the Assad regime and supporting the opposition. Instead of analyzing the situation thoroughly and determining the most efficient way to prevent an escalation, the US decided to inadvertently prolong the war by funding the rebels. The US should have instead maintained a relationship with the current regime in order to understand the complex nature of the Syrian ethnopolitical landscape and prevent further escalation. Also, the US should have accurately assessed the nature of the opposition before declaring its legitimacy. Why the US continues to aid the rebels is difficult to understand, as this aid only has the effect of prolonging the war and causing more death and destruction. </p>

<p>Furthermore, the US has been quick to recognize the Syrian Coalition as the "legitimate representative of the Syrian people." However, is this truly the case? With al-Nusra Front and the Muslim Brotherhood on the ground in Syria, it is difficult to believe that the Coalition has control over all the opposition forces. If the US wishes to end the conflict in Syria, it should take steps to do so - either maintaining an Assad type regime, albeit without Bashar al-Assad, or relinquishing aid to the rebels and assisting in the speedy restoration of order.  </p>

		<title>A Diplomatic Solution to the Crisis in Syria: Remembering the 1930s</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.syr.edu/deans-faculty-staff/profile.aspx?fac=152">David Crane</a>, of the Syracuse University College of Law, argues that the world should remember the 1930's in crafting a diplomatic solution to the crisis in Syria ...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/David_Crane.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>A</strong></font>ppeasement in the face of tyranny never works. Consider the 1930's, when the international community, (and a spineless League of Nations) bent on avoiding another war, was faced with a tyrant and his ambitions: a two-bit dictator seeking a place for a so-called Third Reich. In 1936, Adolf Hitler gambled and seized the Rhineland from France, which at the time was one of the world's super powers. Emboldened, he realized that the use of force was not a viable option for the world's democracies. In 1938, he turned east and seized the Sudetenland. </p>

<p>A peace treaty was negotiated with Germany which gave Hitler a piece of another sovereign nation in return for a promise of no further expansion/aggression. As the exultant Prime Minister of the UK, Neville Chamberlain <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/30/newsid_3115000/3115476.stm">declared</a>, "It was peace for our time." It is interesting to note hovering in the background, in league with Germany, was the Soviet Union, led by another tyrant. Within a year, the world plunged into the Second World War. These two nations would join forces, albeit briefly, to parcel out Poland and allow the Soviets to take over Finland.</p>

<p>Hitler and Stalin were not alone in their policy of aggression; Italy and Japan observed the maneuvering by Germany during this time frame and moved within their regions with impunity. China was attacked by Japan and Ethiopia fell to Mussolini's Italy. The response by the international community was to talk and to seek diplomatic solutions. Without the threat of force, these countries felt little concern for being held accountable politically, diplomatically, or legally. History tells us that tyrants only respect power and the use of force. They calculate their policies and plans based on this. If confronted they back down. </p>

<p>After the horror of the Second World War, mankind tried to limit the use of force through the advent of the UN, and its <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/index.shtml">charter</a> that said that nations should always settle their disputes peacefully, resorting to force only as a last resort. In principle, the settlement of disputes peacefully, placing the use of force on the back burner, is a laudable goal and one necessary for the maintenance of international peace and security.  </p>

<p>With all this in mind, we are at an interesting intersection of history and policy as we watch the US and Russia maneuver geopolitically for influence in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=syria">Syria</a> specifically and the Middle East generally, in light of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian civil war. Supported by Russia, President Assad stands back watching, buying time, and gaining a lost legitimacy due to these negotiations that he thought was gone forever; with the possibility of surviving a two year attempt to topple him a real expectation.  </p>

<p>The use of chemical weapons in the modern era is rare. Used only in the 1980's in the Iran/Iraq war and by Saddam Hussein against his own people, the use of this weapon system is banned and its use is illegal per se, a war crime by any measure. With the recent use of chemical weapons by Assad's forces, the international community hesitated to act with force in the hope of diplomatically resolving the matter. They stepped over the principle of the use of those weapons being illegal per se and ignored President Obama, who reminded the international community that this cannot stand and that force was needed to punish Assad for the use of a weapon of mass destruction. Hampered politically at home and abroad, however, there is little President Obama can do but to give diplomacy a chance before possibly using force to destroy Assad's chemical arsenal.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, a diplomatic solution to this illegal act could be useful and set up further dialog between the parties and their political backers to end the bloodshed in Syria. Tens of thousands of Syrians are dead. As the civil war continues, the chances of a peaceful and a gentle transition diminishes and the specter of a bloody conclusion has risen. This tentative agreement between the US and Russia may lead to a framework for a ceasefire by Assad and the Syrian resistance brokered by the UN.</p>

<p>The phenomenon of two old Cold War adversaries working together towards a peace in Syria is helpful. Yet let's not forget that an accounting must be had for the destruction of over 100,000 Syrians at the hands of their own government. There is nothing wrong in brokering a peace to stop death and destruction, yet Assad and his regime must be dealt with under law. Already, efforts by governmental and nongovernmental organizations have built the makings of a criminal case against all sides in the Syrian civil war. For a true peace to be had in the region, a full legal accounting by an appropriate justice mechanism must be had.</p>

<p>We won't have peace in our time without the rule of law, backed by a commitment to use force when current and future tyrants test the theory that the rule of law is more powerful than the rule of the gun. President Obama has it right, let's work with our partners in the UN to seek a diplomatic solution, mindful always that Assad does not respect the rule of law, only the threat and the ultimate use of force against him. With that fear of the use of that legitimate force, the international community can keep Assad in check. The shadow of the 1930's lingers in the corners of current events playing out in Syria. Lest we forget...</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.cato.org/people/simon-lester">Simon Lester</a> of the <a href="http://www.cato.org/">Cato Institute</a> says that the newly elected coalition in Australia may alter the country's current stances on certain international investment rules...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/simonlester.jpeg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he recent Australian elections were decided mostly by domestic policy issues, but their outcome will have an impact beyond the border, as the new government may rethink Australia's somewhat unique view on the international investment regime. Whereas most of the world supports a core set of investment rules, Australia has long been a skeptic. The Liberal-National coalition, however, has indicated that it is more amenable to these rules. If they decide to revise current policy, Australia will have an opportunity to refine its thinking on rules that were developed decades ago and are ripe for modernization.<br />
                <br />
                The international investment regime came to the average Australian's attention several years ago when tobacco company Phillip Morris used an obscure Hong Kong-Australia investment treaty to <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/11/philip-morris-sues-to-block-new-australia-tobacco-label-requirements.php">challenge</a> Australia's plain packaging cigarette laws before an international tribunal. This challenge helped cement Australian doubts about these treaties. </p>

                <p>In its 2004 <a href="http://www.ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/australian-fta">free trade agreement</a> with the US, Australia had objected to the inclusion of investor-state rules (rules that allow for investors to sue governments directly), and these rules were ultimately excluded from the treaty. This was a major departure from US policy, one that has not since been repeated. Australia's ability to dictate the terms to the US indicates the strength of Australian convictions on the issue. A few years later, Australia made a policy of excluding investor-state rules from trade agreements permanent, based on findings of an independent agency called the Productivity Commission. In response to these findings, Australia announced that it would no longer pursue investor-state provisions in its international agreements.<br />
                    <br />
                    Thus, as a matter of formal government policy, Australia was already wary of these rules. The plain packaging case simply brought more attention to the issue and affirmed for many Australians the correctness of this view. <br />
                    <br />
                    Now Australia might abandon its position, at least as a hard and fast rule. As noted, the Liberals have previously expressed a desire to change course on this issue. For example, rather than categorically exclude investor-state rules, Australia might now consider using them on a case-by-case basis.<br />
                    <br />
                    The obvious places to carry out a new policy would be in the <a href="http://www.ustr.gov/tpp">Trans Pacific Partnership</a> (TPP) trade negotiations and in bilateral talks with China and Korea. In these talks, Australia has previously asked to be excluded from the investment provisions that the other TPP parties are negotiating and has resisted their inclusion in the China and Korea talks. This stance may now be up for reconsideration (although the Australian Senate may resist efforts in this regard).<br />
                    <br />
                    Opponents of such rules will be seriously disappointed by such a shift; supporters, on the other hand, will cheer. The real potential here, though, goes beyond keeping score of which government is on which side of the issue. (Australia's position was particularly notable because Australia is a rich capitalist democracy, in contrast to most objectors to the investment regime, who are left-wing, authoritarian governments.) Rather, what is needed is a nuanced discussion of these rules. So far, the debate has simply been "pro" or "con." Business groups and international lawyers are strongly for such rules, whereas public health advocates are strongly against. However, we need to move past this misleading, binary debate and ask, instead, what should international investment rules say? These rules have not changed much since their origins in the early 1960s. They may be in need of revision.<br />
                    <br />
                    Some of the existing international investment rules are very useful. For example, a ban on domestic laws and regulation that discriminate based on the nationality of investors is at the core of international economic relations. Aside from national security or other legitimate reasons, we should not discriminate against others. The world is more peaceful and prosperous when we commit to equal treatment. Even rules that address compensation for expropriating private companies may be able to work, although this can be a challenging area.<br />
                    <br />
                    The real problem comes from vague and broad legal obligations such as "indirect expropriation" and "fair and equitable treatment." Such principles are common in domestic law, but there is no international consensus on what they mean. Elevating them to international legal status opens up limitless opportunities for litigation and thus makes for a great deal of uncertainty (as well as raising fears of intrusion into domestic policy-making). This can actually undermine support for more established norms such as non-discrimination and direct expropriation.<br />
                    <br />
                    Perhaps most important is the issue of whether to allow direct lawsuits by foreign investors against governments. Generally speaking, international law only allows state-to-state disputes, which helps filter out frivolous complaints and acts as a check on the system. Investor-to-state disputes open up the floodgates on litigation.<br />
                    <br />
                    Australia's change in government is an opportunity to revisit these issues. In thinking about a possible policy shift, Australia should not blindly adopt the conventional wisdom that all of the existing investment rules are necessary.  Instead, it should think about what rules makes sense and try to develop a vision for the international investment regime that can really work for the future. Much of the controversy surrounding investor-state rules arises due to specific features of the current framework: investors can bring suits directly against governments, based on provisions that are so broad as to call almost any government action into question. These rules do not seem necessary for the purpose of allowing foreign investment to flow freely. A better approach might be to focus on more established and bounded rules such as non-discrimination, through which governments could agree not to keep out investment by non-citizens without a good reason (such as national security). Such an approach would be beneficial in terms of economics and would not lead to the political difficulties that have been created by the current rules. If we can get international investment rules right, we will be able to liberalize investment without interfering with national autonomy and causing needless controversy.</p>

		<title>Pakistan has Failed to Comply with Counterterrorism Obligations under International Law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.jgls.edu.in/content/robert-p-barnidge-jr">Dr. Robert P. Barnidge, Jr. </a> of the Jindal Global Law School says that Pakistan has failed to comply with its counterterrorism obligations under international law and that this should be kept in mind when assessing the US' use of force in Pakistan...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/robertbarnidge3.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong><em>U</em></strong></font><em>bi jus ibi officium</em>. This maxim from the Latin, according to which rights involve obligations, is perhaps nowhere more relevant in contemporary international law than when it comes to questions of sovereignty. The privilege that states have to control their internal affairs without external interference is a matter of sovereign right and is reflected in <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter1.shtml">article 2(7) </a> of the UN Charter. This article insulates states from UN intervention in "matters which are essentially within the[ir] domestic jurisdiction," though this does not prejudice the UN Security Council's authority to act under <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter7.shtml">Chapter VII</a> with respect to the maintenance of international peace and security. <br />
 <br />
But sovereign right is not sacrosanct and can be displaced when a state fails to comply with its obligations under international law. Whether it be transboundary environmental pollution or cybercrime that spans multiple jurisdictions, states have a clear obligation to secure their territory and ensure that it is not used contrary to the rights and obligations of other states. This includes cases in which those other states may be across the world and when it is non-state actors that threaten transboundary harm and when the state itself is unwilling or unable to control these actors. <br />
 <br />
It is with this understanding of sovereign right and legal obligation that one should approach the US' use of force in Pakistan. Whether it be the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-forces-kill-osama-bin-laden-in-firefight.php">May 2011 raid</a> on Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad or its ongoing campaign of <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/pakistan-pm-summons-us-official-over-drone-strikes.php">drone attacks</a> in Pakistan, the US has been acting against what President Barack Obama identified in his <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/23/remarks-president-national-defense-university">May 2013 address</a> at the National Defense University as "al Qaeda and its associated forces." It is within and through international law, which includes a right of self-defense that <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter7.shtml">article 51</a> of the Charter recognizes as being "inherent" to states, that the US has made its case and secured the homeland since <a href="/feature/featured/911/">September 11, 2001</a>. <br />
 <br />
Pakistan has failed to comply with its counterterrorism obligations under international law. However, to say this, and to then go on to cite specific aspects of international treaty law and customary international law, as well as such legal instruments as <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/ctc/specialmeetings/2012/docs/United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%201373%20(2001).pdf">Security Council Resolution 1373 (2001)</a> [PDF], is not to flippantly level a charge or assert a claim unsubstantiated by evidence. The general unwillingness and inability of Pakistan to secure its sovereign space has been begrudgingly acknowledged by Pakistanis themselves. <br />
 <br />
Consider the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/spotlight/binladenfiles/2013/07/201378143927822246.html">Abbottabad Commission's Report</a>, which Al Jazeera leaked in July of this year. The government of Pakistan set up this commission of inquiry after the Abbottabad raid in response to a popular backlash against what many Pakistanis considered to be the raid's violation of Pakistani sovereignty. The report is a damning indictment of Pakistan's counterterrorism policy. <br />
 <br />
With respect to bin Laden's prolonged presence in Abbottabad, the report criticized Pakistan for its "negligence and incompetence and at some undetermined level a grave complicity may or may not have [sic] involved." There was a "collective and sustained dereliction of duty by the political, military and intelligence leadership of the country." According to the report, "the political leadership and the concerned institutions failed to provide any counter terror leadership in general, or to rigorously hunt down OBL and his network in Pakistan in particular." All of this had, unsurprisingly, "spawned further terror instead of containing and eliminating it." <br />
 <br />
In light of this sobering reality, President Obama's approach to Pakistan seems to have been reasonably sensible, involving, as it has, both "carrots" and "sticks." With respect to the drone campaign in particular, what is perhaps as significant as the technologically sophisticated nature of drones is how the Obama administration has exceeded the requirements of the laws of war in deciding when and how to target members of al Qaeda and its associated forces abroad. <br />
 <br />
For example, the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/uploads/2013.05.23_fact_sheet_on_ppg.pdf">Presidential Policy Guidance</a> [PDF], which the White House released in May, predicates the lethal targeting of members of al Qaeda and its associated forces abroad to, inter alia, "[n]ear certainty" of no collateral damage and a determination that capture would not be feasible. None of these strictures are required by the laws of war; indeed, they receive little support as legal requirements given the practice of states in wartime. <br />
 <br />
All of this should be borne in mind when assessing the US' use of force in Pakistan and in those other theaters in which the state at issue has shown itself unwilling or unable to comply with its counterterrorism obligations with respect to al Qaeda and its associated forces that threaten the US with real harm. <br />
 <br />
This is particularly relevant in light of what is expected to be the imminent release of the findings of UN Special Rapporteur on Counter-Terrorism and Human Rights Ben Emmerson's <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-expert-announces-investigation-into-use-of-drone-strikes-by-us-and-other-nations.php">inquiry</a> into the human rights implications and civilian impact of the US' ongoing drone campaign. <br />
 <br />
While the standards and procedures that the Presidential Policy Guidance puts forth may or may not always be wise when engaged with on particular facts and circumstances, it seems reasonable not to fault the Obama administration for at least making a good faith effort to comply with the laws of war, if not the Marquess of Queensberry rules. </p>

Estrada explores the implications of New York City's stop and frisk practices and offers recommendations to improve them...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="estrada2.jpg" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/estrada2.jpg" width="120" height="160" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>N</strong></font>ew York City (NYC) has eight million residents. Since Mayor Michael Bloomberg took office in 2002, the New York Police Department (NYPD) <a href="http://www.nyclu.org/issues/racial-justice/stop-and-frisk-practices">has stopped</a> more than four million NYC residents. A <a href="http://www2.nycbar.org/pdf/report/uploads/20072495-StopFriskReport.pdf">substantially large number</a> [PDF] of African-Americans and Latinos are stopped and frisked more frequently than whites. A stop is when a police officer temporarily detains an individual for questioning, and a frisk is a pat down of the outer clothing of an individual who has been stopped. The New York Civil Liberties Union's 2011 stop-and-frisk report <a href="http://www.nyclu.org/publications/report-nypd-stop-and-frisk-activity-2011-2012">indicates</a> that even when African-Americans and Latinos did not constitute a majority of residents in a particular neighborhood, they were still two or three times more likely to be stopped by the police than whites. Even more troubling is that 88.3 percent of stops did not lead to an arrest and only 0.5 percent of frisks led to the recovery of a weapon. Therefore, most of the people of color were innocently living their lives when stopped. Given the large number of stops and frisks of innocent African-Americans and Latinos, it makes members of these groups feel harassed, creating resentment and distrust among these communities.</p>

<p><strong>Stop-and-Frisk Procedure</strong></p>

<p>According to <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17773604035873288886">Terry v. Ohio</a>, the seminal stop-and-frisk US Supreme Court case, officers may legally stop and question a person if they have reasonable suspicion to believe that person has committed or is about to commit a crime and if an individual is armed or presently dangerous. Under <em>Terry</em>, officers may conduct frisks on people they have reasonable suspicion to believe are armed or presently dangerous. Frisks require a different standard from stops because they are more intrusive, allowing officers to pat down an individual's outer clothing. When conducting stops and frisks, NYPD officers are required to complete a form called <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/downloads/pdf/public_information/TR534_FINALCompiled.pdf">Unified Form 250</a> [PDF] (UF-250). Officers use the list of justifications on the form to determine when a stop and frisk is justified. These justifications include, "fits the description," exhibiting actions indicative of casing a victim or location and exhibiting "furtive movement." For frisks, justifications include "possibly" concealing a weapon, making verbal threats of violence and having a "suspicious" bulge or object.</p>

<p><strong>Floyd v. City of New York</strong></p>

<p>In a recently decided federal class-action suit, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11961454681378002252">Floyd v. City of New York</a>, several African-American and Latino plaintiffs brought suit against the city and the NYPD, alleging that the stop-and-frisk policy violated their rights under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth</a> Amendments. Based on expert testimony of statistical findings that African-Americans and Latinos are disproportionately stopped and frisked by NYPD officers and institutional evidence of the city's and the NYPD's indifference to such findings, Judge Shira A. Scheindlin of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York held that the city's stop-and-frisk policy violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. As a result of this holding, Scheindlin ordered a reform of the policy.</p>

<p>In her <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2013/08/12/floydremedial.pdf">separate remedies opinion</a> [PDF], Scheindlin ordered several reforms be made to the stop-and-frisk policy. To ensure her reforms are properly carried out and to ensure the city's and the NYPD's compliance, Scheindlin appointed an independent monitor to oversee the reform process. As a part of her reform of the stop-and-frisk policy Scheindlin ordered: <ol>	<li>the policies and training materials related to the stop-and-frisk policy and racial profiling be revised to prevent such racial profiling; <li>UF-250 be changed so that officers write a narrative explaining the basis for their stops, write a separate explanation of why a frisk was performed, provide the individual stopped with a tear-off portion stating the reason for the stop and have a simplified and improved checkbox system used to indicate common stop justifications;  <li>uniformed officers provide narrative descriptions of stops in their activity logs whenever a UF-250 is prepared to keep further record of their stops; <li>changes to supervision, monitoring, and discipline to prevent citation and/or arrest quotas; <li>the creation of a joint remedial process that allows all parties to the litigation develop remedial measures to improve stop-and-frisk; and <li>the use of body-worn cameras by one officer in one precinct of each borough for a probationary period to monitor how stops and frisks are carried out.</li></ol> These reforms were intended to prevent officers from making unconstitutional stops and frisks, involve the community in the reform of the stop-and-frisk policy and to monitor stops and frisks.</p>

<p><strong>Making New York City Stop-and-Frisk Less Discriminatory</strong></p>

<p>Although Scheindlin's plan for reform appears to be a possible solution to the unconstitutional implementation of the stop-and-frisk policy, these reforms may never be carried out because City officials recently <a href="http://rt.com/usa/nyc-stop-frisk-appeal-590/">appealed</a> Schiendlin's decision. Regardless of the ultimate result of that appeal, NYC should adopt Scheindlin's plan for reform and should incorporate a plan recently created by the city of Philadelphia to eliminate similar problems it had with its stop-and-frisk policy. NYC's plan should:<ol><li>Adopt all of Scheindlin's reforms, including her appointment of an independent monitor to oversee the reform process.</li><li>Grant civil rights groups that represent victims of illegal stops and frisks access to the NYPD's UF-250 electronic database. This access should give these organizations the ability to determine why people were stopped, in which precinct they were stopped, who stopped them, and any other pertinent information that will allow them to determine whether stop-and-frisk is being carried out constitutionally. This assures the affected communities that progress is being made.</li><li>Eliminate "furtive movement" and any other similar term on the UF-250 that does not clearly outline under what circumstances a stop or frisk may be conducted, as a circumstance that meets the standard of reasonable suspicion for both a stop and frisk.</li><li>Create an outside disciplinary body to discipline officers who are carrying out stops and frisks with less than reasonable suspicion or their superiors who are not correcting this behavior.</li><br />
</ol>Implementing these steps will curtail NYPD's discriminatory stop-and-frisk practices by ensuring that commanding officers are not implementing quotas and police officers conduct stops and frisks objectively. This may help mend the NYPD's relationship with the African-American and Latino communities that, for the most part, have lost faith and respect for the NYPD.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Jess Kyle, <a href="http://www.law.umaryland.edu/index.html">University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law</a> Class of 2015, discusses the International Criminal Court's African involvement in light of Kenya's withdrawal... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="KYLE.jpg" src="/dateline/KYLE.jpg" width="120" height="120" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>deally, the operations of the International Criminal Court (ICC) toward justice would reinforce the domestic politics of conflict and post-conflict states by promoting peace through deterrence and strengthening accountability norms. Yet, since its 2002 inception, the ICC has frequently been accused of being, on the one hand, insensitive to local political exigencies and, on the other, biased by its own invidious political agenda. Kenyan parliamentarians who recently <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/kenya-parliament-approves-motion-to-withdraw-from-icc.php">voted</a> for ICC withdrawal appealed to similar concerns for support, and Kenya's move toward withdrawal has prompted reinvigorated criticism of the ICC by a number of African countries. A hasty embrace of Kenya's withdrawal circumstances as representative of key concerns about the ICC's African involvement, however, risks undermining the productiveness of such debates, rewarding political opportunism and encouraging the institutionalization of impunity in Kenya and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Kenya President Uhuru Kenyatta, Deputy President William Ruto and radio executive and journalist Joshua Sang face <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200109/Pages/situation%20index.aspx">charges</a> of crimes against humanity at the ICC. The charges pertain to their roles in the post-2007 election violence in Kenya in which 1,200 were killed and hundreds of thousands displaced. On September 5, 2013, shortly before the trial of Ruto commenced, the Kenya National Assembly passed a motion for withdrawal from the ICC. The Senate passed an expanded version of the motion on September 10. Pending notification of withdrawal by the Kenyan government to the UN (which would take effect after one year), Kenya may be the first state to withdraw from the ICC. </p>

<p>Kenya's withdrawal vote was followed by the announcement of an African Union (AU) special <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24173557">summit</a> for discussion of a possible bloc withdrawal from the ICC. The summit is to be held October 13, 2013 and countries purportedly open to this extreme measure include Uganda, Rwanda, Zimbabwe and Eritrea. Thirty-four of a total of 54 AU members are ICC signatories. In addition to the special summit call, aggressive criticism of the ICC at the UN by some African leaders has continued.</p>

<p>One apparent thread of the withdrawal argument is that the ICC is insensitive to the need for countries to stabilize politically and move forward peacefully. The withdrawal <a href="http://justiceinconflict.org/2013/09/05/icc-and-kenya-parting-ways-what-it-means-and-what-it-doesnt/">motion</a> itself included references to "the fundamental changes in the circumstances relating to the governance of the Republic" and the fact that "the Republic conducted its general elections ... at which the President and Deputy President were lawfully elected." During his severe criticism of the ICC at the UN, Uganda's President Museveni also pointed to the status of Kenyatta and Ruto as elected leaders and <a href="allafrica.com/stories/201309260257.html">stated</a>, "Kenya is recovering. Let her recover." Further, a recent AU <a href="http://www.icckenya.org/2013/09/icc-asks-african-union-to-address-concerns-on-kenya-cases-through-legal-channels/">letter</a> to the UN cited the concern that ICC trials were impeding effective governance of Kenya.</p>

<p>There are times when weighty political considerations might point against the ICC's pursuit of justice. For example, a prominent case from the 'peace versus justice' debates that has been used to show the problem of political insensitivity in the timing of indictments was the 2003 indictment of former Liberian president Charles Taylor. His indictment occurred in the context of sensitive peace talks, and has been blamed for a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/mar/06/sudan-war-crimes1">resurgence of violence</a> in Liberia and additional deaths. Greater sensitivity to local political demands might have averted these consequences</p>

<p>In the case of Kenya, however, Kenyatta, Ruto, and Kenyan voters were aware of the ICC charges going into the March 2013 elections. Kenyatta and Ruto have consistently pledged their cooperation with the ICC, and the ICC has shown flexibility in staggering the leaders' trials and <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201309280202.html">adjourning</a> Ruto's trial so he could deal with the Westgate terror attack. The particular context of the ICC's involvement in Kenya does not seem to contribute much to arguments about the ICC's insensitivity regarding domestic political affairs. Further, it is unclear why the drastic measure endorsed by Kenyan politicians, withdrawal, is a positive step in the name of the growth and stability of Kenya's democracy. Rather than a proposal for a short-term peace-justice trade-off, it is a long-term return to impunity likely to invite future violence.</p>

<p>A much louder criticism heard in Kenya's withdrawal motion debates was the allegation of ICC neocolonialism and political selectivity. National Assembly majority leader Adan Duale <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-23969316">emphasized</a> the need to protect the sovereignty of Kenya against attempts at politically motivated interference. In the Senate, majority members characterized the ICC's involvement in Kenya as "an attempt to recolonize Africa" and portrayed the Prosecutor as a rogue actor who can destroy individuals' reputations and lives at will.  </p>

<p>There are cases, and also some plain facts, that should raise concerns about political interests promoted (intentionally or unintentionally) by the ICC or about how it chooses its cases. For example, the heat-of-conflict timing of the June 2011 indictment of Muammar Gaddafi not only played a role in thwarting peace efforts but also gave a boost to the controversial intervention by France, the UK and the US. As for facts about the ICC's case selection that have been subject to criticism, it has hardly gone unnoticed that all current ICC cases are in Africa. Criticisms of the ICC's focus on Africa are not without response, but can be expected to subject the ICC's case selection to scrutiny.</p>

<p>The ICC's cases against Kenyatta, Ruto and Sang, however, do not lend much support to accusations of the ICC's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-22681894">"hunting"</a> of Africans. The cases only ended up in the ICC as the outcome of a Kenyan government-sponsored commission and multiple failed efforts to create a Special Tribunal or other alternative to ICC prosecution. These failed efforts were the agreed upon trigger for ICC referral of the situation in Kenya. The names of those suspected most responsible for the post-election violence were provided by the Kenyan investigative commission. It is not clear, then, why the ICC's Kenya cases should raise familiar concerns about the ICC's fairness in initiating cases, even to the extent of catalyzing a movement for mass ICC withdrawal.</p>

<p>It is important to dis-aggregate the many African-based ICC cases with an eye to whether criticisms of them advance substantive debates about the ICC-Africa relationship or instead look like attempts to capitalize on these debates for political gain. Kenyatta and Ruto apparently succeeded in using their indictments to their benefit in the spring election, casting themselves as protagonists of an anti-imperialist struggle. After the election, and well before the parliamentary withdrawal motion the new Kenyan government reached out to other countries for additional support of it ICC-discrediting campaign.  </p>

<p>Although withdrawal would formally have no effect on the leaders' trials, steps toward it seem calculated to position President Kenyatta and Ruto for future non-cooperation. It has also led to increased calls, including by China, for transfer of the trials to Kenya. Any political gains secured by the two leaders from so easily moving the issue of Kenyan withdrawal to the center of much broader debates about the ICC's record of involvement in Africa will come as rewards for the dubious and opportunistic use of serious points of debate. They may also carry the cost of an institutionalization of impunity that begins with the derogation of Kenyan victims' rights to justice.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: A previous version of this piece stated that the ICC indicted Charles Taylor. Taylor was indicted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone.</p>

		<title>Use of Force Against Syria: Alternatives in the Event of UN Security Council Deadlock</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Patricio Galella of The Ohio State University <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/">Moritz College of Law</a> argues that if diplomacy with Syria fails, and the UN Security Council is deadlocked, states would face a lasting dilemma: violate international law by using force without Security Council authorization or stay still and confirm the weakness of the UN system of collective security...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/patriciogalella.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n September 4, 2013, the US Senate Foreign Affairs Committee ("Committee") <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/us-senate-committee-approves-strike-on-syria.php">approved</a> a joint resolution authorizing a limited and specified use of force against Syria as a result of its <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/un-sg-accuses-assad-of-crimes-against-humanity.php">use of chemical weapons</a> against civilian population on August 21 in Ghouta, and the brutal repression in the last two years. The Committee considered that the use of chemical weapons was in direct contravention of Syria's international obligations under the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/">UN Charter</a>, the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/publications/icrc-002-0173.pdf">Geneva Conventions</a> [PDF] and the <a href="http://cns.miis.edu/inventory/pdfs/aptgenev.pdf">Protocol to the Hague Convention</a> [PDF] on the Prohibition of the Use of War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare, and also violated the standards set forth in the <a href="http://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention/">Convention on the Prohibition</a> of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction, even if Syria is not a party in that treaty.</p>

<p>The authorization granted by the Committee is based upon core national security interests of the US and it contains four objectives: 1) to respond to the use of weapons of mass destruction by the government of Syria; 2) to deter Syria's use of such weapons; 3) to degrade Syria's capacity to use such weapons in the future; 4) to prevent their transfer to terrorist groups or non-state actors. The resolution does not authorize the deployment of troops on the ground. </p>

<p>A simple look at the language used in the resolution shows that the authorization is aimed at responding and deterring, aims that are related more with punishment than with a lawful use of military force. According to international law, a state may lawfully use force in two cases: in self-defense after an armed attack (<a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter7.shtml">article 51</a> of the UN Charter) and when an authorization has been granted by the UN Security Council (UNSC) under chapter VII of the UN Charter which regulates threats to peace and aggression. In the current Syrian crisis, there has clearly not been an armed attack against the US nor a UNSC authorization to use military force. In this context, the use of force by the US to punish and deter Syria's use of chemical weapons would likely be considered as an armed reprisal, as pointed out by Shane Darcy in a recent <a href="http://www.ejiltalk.org/military-force-against-syria-would-be-a-reprisal-rather-than-humanitarian-intervention-but-that-doesnt-make-it-any-more-lawful/">post</a>. The UN Charter does not contain a specific prohibition of reprisals but its provisions concerning the peaceful settlement of conflicts and the use of force in limited cases as well as its purposes are considered as norms that forbid armed reprisals [Ian Brownlie, Use of Force in Self-Defence, British Yearbook of International Law, Vol. 37, 1961, pp. 233-34]. This interpretation has been confirmed by the UNSC through <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/188%281964%29">resolution 188 (1964)</a> [PDF], in which it affirmed that reprisals involving the use of force were incompatible with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. Furthermore, in 1970, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) adopted the <a href="http://www.un-documents.net/a25r2625.htm">Declaration on Principles of International Law</a> concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among states in accordance with the charter of the United Nations proclaiming that states have the duty to refrain from acts of reprisal involving the use of force. </p>

<p>Recent developments in the Syrian crisis show, however, that the use of military force by the US is on hold. On September 27, 2013, the UNSC adopted <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2013/sc11135.doc.htm">resolution 2118</a>, which declares that the use of chemical weapons is a threat to international peace and security, prohibits Syria from using, developing, producing, acquiring, stockpiling or retaining those weapons, or transferring them to other states or non-state actors, and orders Syria to cooperate with the inspections by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. But what would happen if Syria does not comply with the resolution and serious violations of human rights continue? The resolution states that in case of non-compliance, the UNSC will decide on the adoption of measures under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. As is well known, these measures include, among others, economic sanctions, severance of diplomatic relations or even the use of military force. Thus, resolution 2118 does not trigger any automatic use of military force in case of non-compliance. But again, what if the UNSC cannot authorize further measures, including the use of force, because of a veto of its permanent members? This is an old but key issue that points to the Achilles heel of the system of collective security: a paralysis of the UNSC and its impossibility to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. </p>

<p>One way to overcome this paralysis could be the referral of the case to the UN General Assembly, in application of the <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/377%28V%29">Uniting For Peace resolution</a> adopted in 1950. Section A of this resolution states that where the UNSC, because of lack of unanimity of the permanent members, fails to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, the UNGA shall seize itself of the matter. The UNGA could, with the support of 2/3 of its members, recommend the UN members collective action, including the use of force.  </p>

<p>The UK has <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/uk-government-outlines-legal-justification-for-possible-strike-on-syria.php">expressed</a> that the doctrine of humanitarian intervention could be the legal basis for the use of force in the Syrian crisis. This doctrine is based on the assumption that when the UNSC is deadlocked and there are serious violations of human rights that affect the international community as a whole, the use of military force to stop these violations can be justified and legitimate. According to a recently released <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/235098/Chemical-weapon-use-by-Syrian-regime-UK-government-legal-position.pdf">memorandum</a> [PDF], the UK argues that a humanitarian intervention is lawful if three conditions are met: i) the existence of extreme humanitarian distress on a large scale; ii) there is no practicable alternative to the use of force, derived for instance from a paralysis of the UNSC; iii) use of force must be proportionate and necessary to the aim. Although this doctrine has legitimate aims (put an end to atrocities), the truth is that as international law stands today, this doctrine is still illegal and very controversial among international scholars. </p>

<p>This being said, what are the options? Let us give diplomacy a chance, hope that Syria gives up its stockpiles of chemical weapons and puts an end to the serious violations of human rights. Though late, the UNSC would have exercised its primary function for the maintenance of international peace and security. But, if diplomacy fails and, hypothetically, the UNSC cannot adopt further measures, states would face a lasting dilemma: violate international law and use military force in the face of a threat to international security without UNSC authorization or stay still and confirm the weakness of the UN system of collective security when the UNSC is deadlocked. Perhaps, it is time to seriously consider a reform of the functioning of the UNSC or, as has been recently <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2013/10/04/reformer-le-droit-de-veto-au-conseil-de-securite-par-laurent-fabius_3489782_3232.html?xtmc=fabius&xtcr=3">proposed</a> [in French] by Laurent Fabius, the French Foreign Affairs Minister in a recent article in <em>Le Monde</em>, to agree in a compromise among the permanent members to renounce to the use of the veto power when mass crimes have been committed.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.arcadia.edu/abroad/default.aspx?id=28142">Roland Adjovi</a>, Academic Director of the Arcadia Center for East African Studies says that while the Kenyan vote to withdraw from the ICC masks the greater danger of polarization in Africa opposing much needed applications of international law ... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/rolandadjovi.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n September 5, 2013, the Kenya Parliament adopted a motion for <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kenya+icc">repealing</a> their <a href="http://www.issafrica.org/anicj/uploads/Kenya_International_Crimes_Act_2008.pdf">International Crimes Act</a> [PDF], which domesticated the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a>. The long-term outcome of the motion is the subsequent withdrawal from the Rome Statute. This has been extensively covered in the news as a worrisome circumstance. However, I wish to disagree for two reasons while providing evidence that the worry should be elsewhere, less covered in the news. Before embarking on why the worry is misplaced, one needs to have a proper overview of the facts.</p>

<p>In December 2007, there were general elections in Kenya with two political coalitions in opposition: One led by the incumbent president, Mwai Kibaki; and the other led by Raila Odinga. Kibaki is alleged to have cheated and been wrongly declared the winner. That allegation, and the subsequent secret and quick swearing in ceremony, led to what is now known as the post-elections violence (PEV) in Kenya, resulting in some 1500 deaths and hundred of thousands displaced. Under the mediation led by an AU panel chaired by Koffi Annan, the parties agreed and set up various commissions among which one had the mandate to investigate the crimes committed during the crisis. That PEV Commission, or Waki Commission, issued its <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7673304.stm">report</a> with a confidential list of persons who appeared from the investigations as the most responsible for the crimes. The Commission recommended criminal prosecution before a Special Tribunal for Kenya or, preferably, at the ICC because the Kenyan judiciary could not be trusted. The Kenyan Parliament, with the support of both parties, failed to set up the Special Tribunal and the <a href="http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/28340/1/dp10.pdf">AU Mediation Panel </a>[PDF] decided to refer the matter to the ICC. As a consequence, Annan handed over to Luis Moreno-Ocampo, the then-Prosecutor of the ICC, the confidential list. After preliminary investigations, the Prosecutor successfully sought authorization from the Pre-Trial Chamber to open a situation. He later sought the confirmation of two indictments, one against Uhuru and two others on the side of Kibaki, and the second against Ruto and two others on the side of Odinga. After the confirmation hearing, one accused from each indictment was discharged. Later and upon her request, Fatou Bensouda, the new ICC prosecutor, obtained the discharge of the remaining co-accused of Uhuru: only three Kenyans remain therefore in the two cases for trial. The critical issue here is the status later on acquired by two of those three accused: in the latest elections in Kenya (March 2013), a new political coalition won with Uhuru the President succeeding to Kibaki, and, surprisingly, Ruto as the Vice-President. Since then, the Kenyan executive has been very active on two opposing ends: both Uhuru and Ruto have continuously stated that they would fully cooperate with the ICC, but their government has been militating for African States to stand with them against the ICC. </p>

<p>The move in the parliament is therefore not new but just another political step in responding to the continuation of the criminal procedure against the two heads of the Kenyan executive. But this is just a motion and not yet an act. It is just the starting point of the legislative process and there is no guarantee that any bill will be agreed upon, let alone that such a bill would ever be adopted into an act. There is therefore still a long way before we have a binding instrument for withdrawal from the ICC Statute. And the debate in the parliament has been very heavy, with the opposition strongly opposing the motion: the opposition ended leaving the meeting and only the ruling party voted for the motion. In addition, if ever that act was adopted, it would be effective only a year after having been properly notified to the UN Secretary General while it would not have any impact on the present cases which are at the heart of the move. As a consequence, this motion should not have led to any panic in the movement in support of the ICC. However there is a hidden and ongoing plan at the continental level which is more serious.</p>

<p>Indeed, a coalition of African leaders panicking on the prosecution by the ICC is growing and quite successful in a political brainwash on the continent. That coalition was composed of [President of Sudan Omar] Al Bashir, [Former Libyan President Muammar] Gadhafi and [President of Rwanda Paul] Kagame. Now, the Kenyans have joined it and have dragged their other East African fellows, especially [President of Uganda Yoweri] Museveni with them. But, their argument on political bias by the ICC is misleading and one needs to consider how these cases came to the court. The majority was referred by the African states themselves: Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Central African Republic, Côte d'Ivoire and Mali. Two were referred by the UN Security Council where none of the three African States sitting objected: <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2005/sc8351.doc.htm">Res. 1593</a> on Sudan (Algeria, Benin and Tanzania) and <a href="http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N11/245/58/PDF/N1124558.pdf?OpenElement">Res. 1970</a> on Libya (Gabon, Nigeria and South Africa). In the first instance (Sudan), Algeria abstained but did not oppose the vote, while in the second instance (Libya) even South Africa voted in favor of the resolution. Only the situation of Kenya is the result of a <em>proprio motu</em> decision of the ICC Prosecutor, but one needs to recall that the strong suggestion came from the Kenyan PEV Commission led by a Kenyan judge, Waki. In fact, in most cases, it seems that African leaders are the only to be blamed for bringing the ICC into their domestic politics. But the political campaign is so successful that many Africans are convinced that the ICC is against Africa. This week the AU will hold a <a href="http://www.iccnow.org/documents/AU_ICC_Group_Letter_Oct_4_EN_(2).pdf">meeting</a> [PDF] on the way forward with a potential concerted plan for withdrawal, boycott or alternative judicial mechanism. Any such move would be highly regrettable for the African people.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Stephanie Rainaud, <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/academics/graduate/law">St. John's University School of Law</a> Class of 2014, is the author of the fourth article in a 10-part series from the staffers of the <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/academics/graduate/law/journals_activities/jcred">Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development</a>. Rainaud exposes the controversy associated with license plate readers...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="Rainaud.jpg" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Rainaud.jpg" width="120" height="166" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>W</strong></font>hile driving your car, you approach a stoplight, which is turning yellow. You make the split-second decision to speed up to proceed through the intersection before the light turns red. Too late! You were not fast enough. The traffic camera photographed the image of your plate. In a few weeks, you'll open your mailbox and find the dreaded traffic infraction ticket. But what you might not know is that another camera also photographed your car's license plate as you passed through that light. This second image was not for the purpose of sending you a ticket, but was designed to create a database containing travel patterns of all vehicles traveling on that road. These "other cameras" are called license plate readers (LPRs), and <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443995604578004723603576296.html">more and more communities</a> throughout the US are installing them. If your city uses LPRs, every time you drive past one, your vehicle has been photographed and the photograph has cataloged your travel patterns, places of interest and trips you might have made. While there are these obvious "real-time" use benefits to LPRs, states have begun to realize the dangers of LPRs, and the potential hazards LPRs pose to citizens' privacy when used to store travel information long-term.</p>

<p>The US public has always been concerned about the government's intrusions into its citizen's private lives; there is even the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment to the Constitution</a>, affording protections from such intrusions. The case law interpreting the Fourth Amendment is expansive, and covers a plethora of surveillance technology from wiretaps to beepers to heat sensors and GPS. There is no case law interpreting how the Fourth Amendment applies to the police use of LPRs. Absent any rules and regulations, there is little guidance for law enforcement to ensure that the rights afforded to private citizens are enforced. Officials currently have little guidance or oversight into the use, and possible abuse of LPRs and the vast amounts of collected data. In all likelihood, LPRs would probably not be held as an illegal search, because the data is collected while operating a vehicle on public roadways, on which any officer might be able to follow someone. However, just because LPRs might not constitute a strict violation of the constitutional protections afforded at all Americans, does not mean that LPRs do not raise serious questions about invasions of privacy. As technology grows, states respond with protective legislation even when there is likely no constitutional violation. <a href="http://utahlegislature.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?meta_id=59356&view=&showpdf=1">Utah</a> [PDF] and <a href="http://law2.suffolk.edu/jhtl/archives/2013/04/entry_191.html">Minnesota</a> have passed bills that limit LPR data retention with certain timelines for retention and restricted database access by the police; <a href="http://www.wltx.com/video/2069270866001/1/Bill-Would-Ban-Automatic-License-Plate-Readers">South Carolina</a> has a bill up for vote which would ban LPRs altogether. More broadly, nine states have enacted other surveillance limitation statutes to protect all citizens, not just those under criminal investigation by using sanctions and excluding collected evidence from illegal seizures from court. These other states, however, restrict the use and availability of more traditional forms of government surveillance, including wiretapping and GPS; none would cover LPR data. These other statutes are applicable to police investigations and general applications of surveillance technology.</p>

<p>Legislation might be an answer to LPRs protects the public from license plate reader data review and retention. It should strive to set firm boundaries determining when the data may be stored, for how long, and for what purposes the state may review LPR data, and how and where the data would be stored. These simple points balance the interest of police by allowing access in the due course of a legal investigation supported by probable cause and a private citizens' reasonable expectation of privacy from governmental intrusion.</p>

<p>Across the US, communities have been implementing LPRs as a police assistance tool, using the system to track stolen cars and kidnapped children. The situation becomes even more complicated when the <a href="http://www.newschannel5.com/story/8568450/license-plate-recognition-system-helps-keep-roads-safe">benefits</a> of LPR use are observed. Across the country, there are <a href="http://www.mcac.maryland.gov/resources/LPR/LPR_SuccessStories">countless reports</a> of LPR assistance catching drug runners, thieves and enforcing traffic laws. Obviously LPRs help law enforcement tremendously in the ever-mobile society. And in the "heat of the moment" when a LPR scans a plate, and a violation is instantly caught, LPRs are an extremely useful tool. The problem comes when the LPR scans are saved on a system, amassing large quantities of photos, which may be pieced together to show intimate travel patterns, locations and personal preferences, of which no person would expect, or want, the government to have detailed knowledge.</p>

<p>There will definitely be new developments after LPRs, but these suggestions are timely and applicable to the current state of law enforcement mass surveillance. LPRs pose a significant threat to personal privacy. While LPR might not be a constitutional concern, LPRs are still a concern for reasonable expectations of privacy which Americans have come to embrace and expect in their lives.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Nicole Megale, <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/academics/graduate/law">St. John's University School of Law</a> Class of 2014, is the author of the fifth article in a 10-part series from the staffers of the <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/academics/graduate/law/journals_activities/jcred">Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development</a>. Megale calls for an abrogation statute to protect a wrongfully executed individual's Eighth Amendment rights...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="Megale.jpg" src="/dateline/Megale.jpg" width="120" height="177" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC) <a href="http://deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/2012YearEnd.pdf">lists</a> [PDF] ten executions since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976 in which the evidence shows that those executed were actually innocent. In addition, 142 death row inmates <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/news/past/15/2013?page=4">have been exonerated</a> while on death row since 1973. The execution of an innocent individual, therefore, is not out of the realm of possibility and, unfortunately, has likely occurred on at least ten occasions.</p>

<p>Considering that wrongful executions are a very real possibility, the following questions emerge. Does executing an innocent individual violate any law or the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/">US Constitution</a>? If so, can anything be done to remedy or prevent such a violation (other than abolishing the death penalty altogether, which would clearly end the possibility of a wrongful execution)? The answer to both of these questions is yes.</p>

<p>A wrongful execution likely violates the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendment</a>, which protects against cruel and unusual punishment. According to the concurring opinion in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15342484323761015051"><u>Herrera v. Collins</u></a>, "executing the innocent is inconsistent with the Constitution" and would be a "constitutionally intolerable event." The dissenting opinion in <u>Herrera</u> agrees, stating that it is "violative of the Eighth Amendment to execute a person who is actually innocent. Executing an innocent person epitomizes 'the purposeless and needless imposition of pain and suffering.'"</p>

<p>Because the Supreme Court recognizes the probable unconstitutionality of executing an innocent individual, those wrongfully executed should have an available remedy to protect their Eighth Amendment rights. According to the court in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9834052745083343188"><u>Marbury v. Madison</u></a>, "[t]he very essence of civil liberty consists in the right of every individual to claim the protection of the laws whenever he receives an injury." If this statement from <u>Marbury</u> refers to all laws, as it should, then something must be done with regards to the Eighth Amendment and the execution of innocent persons. Despite the permanency of an execution and the cruelty of executing an innocent individual, there is currently no remedy for a wrongful execution because states are protected from litigation through the veil of sovereign immunity. Sovereign immunity prevents the state from being sued by a wrongfully executed person's estate. This, unfortunately, makes a wrongfully executed person's Eighth Amendment rights nonexistent.</p>

<p>To protect a wrongfully executed individual's Eighth Amendment rights, Congress should utilize its <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment, Section 5</a> powers and abrogate sovereign immunity in the case of a wrongful execution. By abrogating sovereign immunity, Congress would provide wrongfully executed individuals with a legal remedy for the harm caused to them.</p>

<p>The abrogation statute should have four components. First, the statute should permit the decedent's estate to bring a survival action against the state. Second, it should lay out how innocence can be established posthumously. Third, it should create an evidentiary requirement for bringing a suit in the first place; this will prevent the courts from facing a wrongful execution lawsuit for every person executed. Finally, the statute should place a cap on the amount of recoverable damages.</p>

<p>The statute should reduce the cap on recoverable damages for states depending upon the type of evidence required by the state for a death penalty sentence. By reducing the cap for states with higher evidentiary requirements, Congress will increase states' willingness to take more precautionary measures when it comes to the death penalty, to further protect against the possibility of a wrongful execution and potential liability and damages.</p>

<p>Combining these components should result in a viable abrogation statute. Additionally, taxpayers would not bear the burden of this statutory scheme, even though a state may have to pay damages. A likely effect of the suggested abrogation statute would be that states would increase the evidentiary requirements for a death penalty sentence, thus reducing both the possibility of innocents being executed and potential state liability. This would make less people eligible for the death penalty. Since the death penalty is more expensive than life imprisonment, the state would be saving money with less people on death row. Those saved funds could be allocated to pay any potential damages a state may face; therefore, no tax raise would be necessary.</p>

<p>Without an abrogation statute in the case of a wrongful execution by the state, the harm done to those innocents executed will never be rectified. While nothing can ever fully cure the pain caused by a wrongful execution, imposing liability upon the states is at least a step in the right direction to ensure that the states' wrongs are acknowledged and that the states do something to rectify this horrific wrong.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/facultystaff/faculty/bdavis/BDavis.htm">Benjamin Davis</a> of the University of Toledo College of Law examines the recent <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-affirmative-action-suing-foreign-corporations.php">oral arguments</a> in <span class="casename">Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action<span/> ...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/benjamindavis.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>F</strong></font>rom reading the transcript of the oral argument in the <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-to-rules-on-new-affirmative-action-issue.php">Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action</a>, I was appalled at the level of the US Supreme Court's questions on such a fundamental case. Let me go through some of the pitiful scenes.<br />
 <br />
During the appellant's argument the question was raised about the decreases in the number of minorities at Michigan's law school. The appellant's response was that the numbers stayed the same the next year after <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5183084208914209139">Grutter</a> which, given that <span class="casename">Grutter</span> was decided that June 23, 2003, it would seem evident that most of the entering class at either the Michigan undergrad or law school was locked in by the time that the decision was made and so the next year numbers would be essentially under the previous year's affirmative action approach, was at best disingenuous. Then when the numbers for the later years were demonstrating declines, the point was that following the census in 2010, the numbers for minorities were modified due to people self-identifying as two or more categories as opposed to falling into one category. As Professor Meera Deo of Thomas Jefferson Law School has reminded me recently, race is a social construct and so quite normally, one might expect a followup question about the number of minorities that self-identify as a social construct as minorities having gone down and what that meaning would be.  Nothing.<br />
 <br />
During the appellant's argument, they hailed the Sander work on mismatch theory. If I hear one more person praise that work I think I will just lay down and die. I asked Sander at the AALS Annual Meeting in January 2013 about whether the minority students at the elite schools who are to be the so-called beneficiaries of being downgraded to a less elite school prefer getting the degree from the elite school or welcome the downgrade. He has no data on this focusing on what he thinks would be a better result for those minorities. Underlying this whole view is an almost antebellum and sinister undermining of minority agency. From the work of Professor Meera Deo cited in the Society of American Law Teachers <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/vp/irla/Documents/ACR%20Society%20of%20American%20Law%20Teachers.pdf">amicus brief</a> [PDF] it is patently clear that even if the environment is difficult at elite schools, persons who identify themselves as minorities understand the value of that degree and want to be at those elite schools. Put another way, assuming they had the choice of going to Michigan or "Podunk" when they were admitted, they went to Michigan even if (or especially because) it was tougher or (just as likely) the upside potential from such a degree due to the networks and resources was vastly higher than at "Podunk." That rational approach of a minority is simply missed by the members of the court. That willingness of minorities to accept the challenge and desire to accept the challenge is pooh-poohed by a court more concerned with "what is good for them" it seems than in enhancing diversity or overcoming racial discrimination.<br />
 <br />
One of the further key points in the appellant's argument is that the diversity rationale is the only rationale that can be used for affirmative action. It is not to be used (post-<span class="casename">Grutter</span> and post-<a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-rules-in-affirmative-action-case.php">Fisher</a>) to remedy past discrimination. But, and maybe I am the only one living in America who raises this question, what about affirmative action being used to remedy current day discrimination? That the kind of brutally explicit bias is not so present (but you can watch on television or social media profoundly racist exchanges that harken back to antebellum times almost every night with the talking heads), but that the research has further confirmed that implicit bias and stereotype threat are prevalent and bedevil us seems to be too subtle for the court to grasp. What about the property tax based/reduced state funding schooling systems coupled with racial segregation in housing where the majority of black and Hispanic children are going to poor and essentially all minority schools with less resources while poor whites are more likely to be going to richer schools and getting the benefits of the better quality schools? That is the real world of America today and we countenance it in our system. That such a structure is in place is simply appalling. Yet, the thinking at the court did not seem to be able to reach those fundamental structural concerns.<br />
 <br />
Shall I go on? In the respondent's argument, the respondent asserted the original meaning of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> to Scalia, and in his inimitable style, he immediately said that the Supreme Court rejected those views in all the cases since. He pushed the lawyer to name a case. Maybe I am missing the point here, but I did think that Scalia was an originalist and would welcome someone speaking to the original intent of the Fourteenth Amendment. After all, in John O. McGinnis and Michael Rappaport's new book entitled <a href="http://www.volokh.com/2013/10/13/three-important-new-books-constitutional-law/">Originalism and the Good Constitution</a> the authors "point out that <span class="casename">Brown</span> would probably not even have been necessary had the federal government effectively enforced the original meaning of the Fourteenth and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxv">Fifteenth</a> amendments between the 1880s and 1950s." The pedigree of those two as originalists is without question, and they are hailing the original intent that the BAMN respondent asserted. And Scalia, in one of those pirouettes when it comes to race that seems inevitable, jumps from his originalist vision to focus on all those decisions that were about "keeping barbarians at the gate," the newly freed slaves and their descendants in the long darkness of segregation. Well, we can see if Justice Thomas will be able to warm up his originalist bona fides and side with the respondent's position on the interpretation to properly be made to the Fourteenth Amendment. On the other hand, given these are issues that hit affirmative action, I fully expect that he will revert to his endemic concern with the slights he has experienced as opposed to the needs of racial justice. Lots of us who went to great schools do not have his hangups about having been there as an affirmative action person.  After all, one might argue that Harvard Law School is the result of decades-old privilege built on the souls of the black slaves whom the Royal family sold in Antigua to finance the first gift to create the school.  Those sugar cane stalks on the Harvard crest are not just there by happenstance.<br />
 <br />
Let me now turn to Alito. When informed that 90 percent of the black Michiganders voting decided to vote against the <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/documents/sos/ED-138_State_Prop_11-06_174276_7.pdf">Proposition 2</a> [PDF], he blithely stated that "what is popular may not be what is beneficial." Leaving to the side, as my colleague Professor Vinay Harpalani has noted, that the diversity rationale of <span class="casename">Grutter</span> and <span class="casename">Fisher</span> was the only valid rationale (benefit to whites of diverse campuses) the Supreme Court was recognizing, making benefit to blacks both central and or no moment was so very troubling. Even if one is the most ardent anti-affirmative action person, I hope that the emasculation of black agency in such a flippant statement by a justice that harkens back to an almost antebellum (or should I say ante-deluvian?) kind of disdain for what black people think. It would seem to me that if 90 percent of the black Michiganders voted against this so called beneficial law, they got what that law would portend and they are not buying that story. The fact that so many voted against it, to a simpleton like me, would carry more weight  and warrant far more than a flippant comment said with dripping sarcasm or disdain. He shows the kind of ignorance that Judge Posner is <a href="http://www.abajournal.com/mobile/article/judge_posner_has_changed_his_mind_on_this_election_issue/?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=weekly_email&utm_source=maestro&sc_cid=131016Z">regretting</a> today in his decision on the Voter ID law of Indiana back in 2007. <br />
 <br />
On the other hand, when the point is raised that one of the key initial supporters of the Proposition 2 was supporting it as it would bring back segregation, the appellant's argument that there are always a few bad apples was another amazing elision of any sense of the deadly animus in such a statement. And, of course, the lack of worry about how to think about implicit bias in this setting in all of the questions seems to demonstrate a profound difficulty for the members of the court to catch up with the social science research. That the court below found no racial animus is quite laughable but mainly points to what I would call the successful disguising of animus by the sophisticated persons who put this kind of law together. The supporters are writing to the court to make it burdensome for minorities but in a way that will pass muster with the Supreme Court. <br />
 <br />
Which of course gets us to Chief Justice Roberts and the need to "get past race." I have been watching for nigh on five years a black president in the White House. For that entire period I have had white people, yes white people, say to me that they are ashamed of the white people who are all over America and very vocal in their hate of Obama. These white people do not mince words with me. They say it is not about his policies, it is about him being a black man in the White House. Yes, white people say this to me. If white people here in Toledo can see that and openly say that, then it sure seems to me that the levels of racial animosity that undergird the violence of the rhetoric on Obama is something that should sharpen the wits of our justices. I hope the Supreme Court does not continue to narrow its vision of itself as a jurisdiction to adjudicate by not seeing what ordinary Americans understand is going on in this country today, not just for Obama but for any manner to race a topic (poverty, voting rights, etc) so as to focus intense energy on dominating the less well off. The sad thing is that the old game of encouraging poor whites to at least take solace in their being white seems to be working with still some success as it did in the nineteenth century. Not as well as back then, but still being played by the rich under the game of divide and conquer. It is like we cannot get out of these ruts. We need to get out of our comfort zones and move toward our healing zones.<br />
 <br />
So after <span class="casename">Fisher</span> and <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-key-provision-of-voting-rights-act.php">Shelby County</a>, I await a tone deaf Supreme Court gliding over the surface again. They will most likely try to stay out of the affirmative action box and move to find a question of what limiting principle and at what level up to a state constitutional referendum is it appropriate to have the concern about political burdens shifting the balance of government. It would seem to me that whatever the decisionmaking level, to the extent that level is stepping back from  affirmative action as a policy it can be challenged. If it is the faculty, it can be challenged. If it is the Dean, it can be challenged. If it is the university leadership or regents, it can be challenged. If it is the governor and legislature in legislation, it can be challenged, and if it is by a majority in a statewide referendum to change the constitution it can be challenged. The argument at each level may be different but the doctrinal result across the levels should be the same, strict scrutiny and heavy burden to support the stepping back from even these modest efforts to make sure that our schools reflect our population whether in students, faculty, or in alumni. It is not to wrangle about words, but to confront oppression and strike it out root and branch.<br />
 <br />
A black person should have rights that the Supreme Court respects, to say what they think injures them, to say what they think is invidious to their and America's progress, and to say that we are not duped by sophisticated machinations, and to say where we think we will be better off. And the Supreme Court should be able to actually hear those black persons, not through some kind of implicit negative filter of disdain, but with the open mind and heart of a person who has more than a passing in the car interest in the downtrodden.<br />
 <br />
Once when I was fly-fishing in Montana with former Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, I asked what her advice would be if she had a child in law school. She emphasized writing, but as to Supreme Court cases, she said they should look carefully at the equal opportunity jurisprudence of the court as that reveals much. I look at that emaciated Roberts Court equal opportunity jurisprudence and find the narrowness of the spirit of this Court simply appalling.<br />
 <br />
Fortunately, I work on the international plane, the plane of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CERD.aspx">International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination</a>, which the US has ratified and about which the periodic review is ongoing right now of the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination with the session next August, 2014, after <span class="casename">Schuette</span> comes out. Reading the spirit and letter of those treaty obligations, one sees how much greater we could be, but, alas, how narrowly tailored our vision of racial (and social) justice has become 50 years after the March on Washington. <br />
 <br />
Where are the great justices with vision that bestride the judicial power? Do they cabin their activism only to arbitration cases, surely the most judicially active space on the court. It is appalling that the Supreme Court shrinks from the task rather than shows a bit more grandeur and understanding of history</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Ashish Goel, an LL.M. candidate at King's College London, discusses a recent death penalty conviction and how to improve India's current system...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="goel.jpg" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/goel.jpg" width="120" height="160" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he death penalty debate in India largely centers on the same old but rephrased arguments based on deterrence and reformation. People rarely questioned the power of the Indian state to take lives. In this piece, I argue that the laws on capital punishment in India are so vague that they cannot be judiciously implemented.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/28/indian-gang-rape-victim-dies-hospital_n_2377717.html">After the brutal gang rape, attempted murder and eventual death</a> of a 23 year-old medical student in India's capital in December 2012, the collective public opinion was that any justice falling short of the death penalty was no justice at all. The Additional Sessions Judge Yogesh Khanna, who pronounced <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/167867247/State-v-Ram-Singh-Anr">death for all</a> the accused, had perhaps, succumbed to this public opinion. While the Delhi High Court begins to hear the death penalty reference against the four convicts on a daily basis, the family of the rape victim, who earlier stated that they had no <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-16/parents-of-delhi-rape-victim-have-no-room-for-mercy/4961284">"room for mercy"</a> for the accused, felt <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2421008/Delhi-gang-rape-parents-victim-say-daughters-dying-wish-rapists-hanged.html">relieved</a> by Khanna's sentencing.</p>

<p>The capital punishment sentence caused celebration worldwide, but there are a minority with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/14/world/asia/4-sentenced-to-death-in-rape-case-that-riveted-india.html?pagewanted=all&_r=2&">reservations</a> about the death penalty and its deterrent effects on sexual offences, particularly rape. For example, some women rights activists feared that the death penalty would <a href="http://www.policymic.com/articles/21544/delhi-gang-rape-death-penalty-may-not-be-the-solution-india-needs/327467">encourage</a> the offender to murder the victim to destroy the evidence against him. Others argue that the death penalty, which deviates from the <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2013/09/21/dont-cheer-death-penalty-make-voice-heard-in-polls/">core issues</a> of police reforms and improper legislative framework, is, if anything, an ad hoc, transient solution. The driving factor in both of these propositions is the <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/commentary/india-rape-death-sentence-was-more-drama-than-deterrence/article14372544/">lack of deterrence</a> in capital punishment.</p>

<p>At the time of the gang rape in December 2012, Indian laws did not use the death penalty in rape cases unless the victim was murdered. Capital punishment for homicide, however, is not unqualified. In the 1980s, the Indian Supreme Court evolved the phrase "rarest of rare cases," which guides death penalty sentencing in India. Over time, the jurisprudence progressed to show that hardened convicts must be sentenced to life imprisonment as a general rule and that the death penalty may be meted out in certain exceptional cases that could be said to be the "rarest of rare." </p>

<p>There is no definition of "rarest of rare," but the phrase insinuates an impossibility of the convicts' reformation or rehabilitation. "Rarest of the rare" analysis is guided by the nature of the crime committed, the history sheet of the convicts and the age and social status of the convicts. The determination of these factors takes place inside court rooms and, some argue that, the phrase "rarest of rare" is "judge-centric": the sentencing reflects the mood of the judges sitting on rape trials on a case by case basis. At times, the judges themselves <a href="http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=20120907291700400.htm&date=fl2917/&prd=fline&">are not confident</a> about their verdicts: some judges have admitted sentencing 13 convicts erroneously to death on an incorrect understanding of "rarest of rare." It is, perhaps, this fear of gross judicial error that led a judge to declare recently that the sentence of death penalty by judges is, after all, the <a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/rarest-of-rare-case-test-needs-societys-approval-supreme-court/1072171/">"will of the people."</a> </p>

<p>Several lives have been lost amidst this cloud of ambiguity. Take for instance, the recent execution of an alleged Kashmiri terrorist, Afzal Guru, who was supposedly involved in the December 2001 attacks on Lok Sabha&#8212;India's lower house of Parliament. Activists <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/10/hanging-afzal-guru-india-democracy">believe</a> that Afzal Guru&#8212;whom the Supreme Court found had no involvement with any terrorist group &#8212; was denied the right to a fair trial and that his secret execution was a mockery of India's rule of law. There, the Supreme Court stated that, the act of attacking the Parliament shocked the "collective conscience" of the nation and constituted a <a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/how-the-apex-court-defines-rarest-of-rare/1072728/0">"classic example"</a> of the "rarest of rare." Sadly, the court did not look at other mitigating factors while sentencing Afzal Guru.</p>

<p>Indian laws concerning sexual offences against women, particularly rape, have changed drastically after the December 2012 gang rape incident. The background facts that led to these changes in Indian criminal laws are summarized succinctly in a previous <a href="/dateline/2013/04/kim-brancato-human-rights.php">post on JURIST</a>. The <a href="http://egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/2013/E_17_2013_212.pdf">Criminal Law Amendment Act 2013</a> [PDF] expands the definition of 'rape' and section 376A punishes an act of rape which results in the death of the victim or leaves her in a "persistent vegetative state" with the death penalty. This implies that, rape does not, even today, warrant death penalty unless it is accompanied by murder of the victim or leaves her in a "persistent vegetative state." </p>

<p><a href="http://indiankanoon.org/doc/324405/">Section 354(3)</a> of India's criminal procedural law requires judges to advance "special reasons" for death penalty sentencing or to put it in perspective, "special reasons" to suggest why the case falls under the "rarest of rare" category. Khanna first took into account several mitigating factors put forth by the defense such as socio-economic status and age of the convicts but then dismissed all of them, including the fact that the convicts were under the influence of alcohol &#8212; <a href="http://www.advocatekhoj.com/library/judgments/announcement.php?WID=2916">considered to be a mitigating factor</a> by a Supreme Court judge in 2011. Thereafter, Khanna continued to describe the agony that the victim went through, prior to and after the act of rape and, stated that the incident which "shocked the collective conscience" fits the sentence of death penalty before breaking the nib of his pen.</p>

<p>The death penalty in the December 2012 gang rape incident is largely founded on the "beastly" rape and murder of the victim. The last time a rapist was sentenced to death in India was in 1994 for <a href="http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=20040827004602100.htm&date=fl2117/&prd=fline&">raping and then killing</a> a 14 year-old girl. Both these cases have one thing in common: both erupted significant public outrage which eventually guided the death penalty sentencing. And so far as the actual sentencing is concerned, a careful reading of both judgments will suggest that efforts were being made by the judges to establish why the death penalty was adequate instead of why a life imprisonment was inadequate. But unlike the 1994 rape and murder convict who was <a href="http://www.hindu.com/2004/08/15/stories/2004081509770100.htm">hanged</a> in 2004, the convicts in the 2012 incident await several appeals and, possibly, the President's clemency.</p>

<p>The Delhi gang rape incident caught worldwide attention for all the right reasons. India has a history of violence against women&#8212;from sati, to child marriage, to female foeticide, to forced prostitution and to rape. However, these deep-rooted social evils cannot be eradicated overnight through a convenient, transient alternative such as capital punishment. India needs to show that it is not soft on crimes against women by bringing about systematic changes and not solely by executing those accused of such crimes. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Gabriel Walsh, <a href="http://www.willamette.edu/wucl/">Willamette University College of Law</a> Class of 2016, analyzes the limits and protections of free speech surrounding issues of language used to encourage or promote suicide...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="walsh.jpg" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/walsh.jpg" width="120" height="198" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n September 30, 2013, <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/minnesota-court-strikes-down-law-against-advising-suicide.php">the Court of Appeals of Minnesota</a> issued a ruling declaring unconstitutional a <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=609.215">Minnesota statute</a> prohibiting a person from advising, encouraging or assisting another person in the taking of the other person's life. The case was an appeal from a ruling of a lower court, and the Court of Appeals' subsequently reversed part of the lower court's decision. Although this is an unpublished opinion, I hope that other jurisdictions implore the same reasoning in evaluating the constitutionality of overly-broad statutory restrictions on speech.</p>

<p>The trend in recent years&#8212;sometimes in the courts and sometimes through statutory enactment and voter initiatives&#8212;has been, broadly speaking, to cede deference to the wishes of terminally ill persons with respect to their choices of whether to end their own lives. Appropriately, the court in this case did not base its reasoning on those trends but rather on the bedrock American principle of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">freedom of speech</a>. The substantive issue here is not the more controversial issue of assisted suicide; it is about freedom of speech. </p>

<p>The court examined the broad language of the statute in question, and reasoned that the statute did not prohibit historically unprotected speech, but could be construed more broadly to prohibit constitutionally-protected speech. This is an appropriate application of the freedom of speech protection afforded to us by the first amendment. To "advise" or "encourage" a person in any manner is not necessarily a material assistance; holding a sign on a street corner that reads, for example, "keep your dignity&#8212;If you're terminally ill, there is no shame in choosing to end your own life," could easily be construed to "advise" or "encourage" a terminally ill person to take his or her own life, as long as the person had freely chosen to do so. This could be especially true if a terminally ill person read the sign, found the message convincing, and as a result actually took his or her own life. Few reasonable people would suggest that the person holding the sign should even have moral culpability in that situation, let alone be guilty of a crime. It should never be a crime to share any opinion. </p>

<p>When considering the well-being of society, there are some subjects which tempt us to create peculiar restrictions on speech due to the potential harm we envision from speech on that subject. American society will probably always debate where the bright line distinction between freedom of speech and protection of the public should be drawn. But such a line must only be drawn at a point where it is not so restrictive as to disallow any given opinion to be communicated. In the US, we do consider some speech to be constitutionally unprotected. For example, while pornography is generally not illegal to produce, possess, sell or share, it is (justifiably) a criminal act to involve children in the production, possession, selling or sharing of pornography. It is easy to understand the plain, consanguineous human desire to protect children from pornography, especially to protect them from being sexually exploited. Where constitutional concerns have arisen is on the issue of pornography which uses technology or theatrics to visually present persons who appear to be children engaging in sexual acts, but where in fact adult actors, or technologically-generated images that don't portray any actual person's likeness, are used.</p>

<p>Understandably, most people do not appreciate the existence of images that, although not actually featuring children, nonetheless appear to portray children in sexually explicit ways. However, the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4016009721484982910">US Supreme Court</a> has found such images to be constitutionally-protected speech. It seems that where a potential harm to society from a particular brand of speech is manifested merely in the impressions and ideas derived from that speech, it must be protected. If First Amendment rights to free speech are intended to protect anything, it is surely intended to protect speech which is in particular need of protection. Namely, it ultimately protects unpopular or otherwise unsavory speech. The ease with which one can understand and appreciate this concept is what makes it such a tempting cause to promote as the idea is transactional and very appealing. Yet, as we saw in the case of Minnesota lawmakers, perhaps acting under pressures from their constituents, can sometimes trample on the constitutional protection of free speech. However, even in the absence of a statute such as the one considered by the court in Minnesota, we must still consider on which side of the bright line we should place speech that advises or encourages a person to commit the illegal act of suicide, when the person follows through with that act.</p>

<p>The answer should be found not by evaluating the speech itself, but by evaluating the actions of the person who is producing the speech. The law should be concerned with whether a person is using mere words, or rather is assisting with or conspiring to assist with the suicide. If there is no conspiracy to assist, and if there is no actual assistance, the person who advises or encourages a terminally ill person to commit suicide should not be guilty of a crime based on her mere words.</p>

<p>Consider that in some European countries it is a criminal act to "deny the Holocaust." This sets a dangerous precedent because of the remoteness of that mere denial to any traditionally-criminal act; it codifies a requirement to accept historical truths. Regardless of how ill-conceived it is to deny the Holocaust, it should shock the sensibilities of all Americans to learn that, in some countries which we often consider to have cultural values that are similar to our own values, it is a criminal act to deny a historical fact. Whether it's that sign-holding American on a street corner or a Holocaust-denying European preaching anti-Semitic conspiracy theories in a pub, all people should be free to express any view and free to deny any fact.</p>

<p>The potential for unpopular speech to inspire intolerable acts is not a baseless concern. Speech is requisite to a conspiracy. Speech is requisite to the inciting of a riot. But speech is also germane to human civilization, and it is worth protecting; speech can raise the consciousness of a society, and start a movement. The hobgoblin of the criminal mind is not mere speech, but rather, the manifestation of speech through deplorable acts, or through conspiracies to commit such acts. My hope for western society is that we continue to protect speech, and that we focus our prohibitions on actions, not on words. <br />

In a two-day meeting, the leaders decided to request members of the UN Security Council (UNSC) to defer the cases of Kenyan and Sudanese leaders. As the AU leaders were convening, there was a move to have a mass withdrawal from the ICC by the AU member states.</p>

<p>The AU has <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/rights-group-criticizes-african-union-icc-declaration.php">determined</a> that no serving heads of state and government or high-ranking officials shall be tried by the ICC or any tribunal. One reason for all this crusading against the ICC, is that the AU leaders have long criticized the ICC for only targeting Africans, especially leaders and other senior state officials; for example, President Omar Al-Bashir [of Sudan], President Uhuru Kenyatta [of Kenya] and his deputy Willliam Ruto. More so, as <a href="http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/83746070/constitutionalization-whose-constitutionalization-africa-s-ambivalent-engagement-international-criminal-court">noted</a> by Theresa Reinold in her paper titled "Constitutionalization? Whose Constitutionalization? Africa's ambivalent engagement with the International Criminal Court," the ICC is a hegemonic tool of the neocolonialists intended to exert power on internal matters of Africans.</p>

<p>Let me analyze all the preceding issues in the light of the ICC Statute and other international law.  <br />
Earlier, on September 10, 2013, the AU had sent a <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/Documents/pr943/130910-AU-letter-to-SHS.pdf">letter</a> [PDF], which followed an earlier letter dated July 8, 2013, requesting the ICC to defer the investigations and prosecutions in connection to the 2007 post-election violence in Kenya, to allow for a national mechanism to investigate and prosecute the cases under a reformed judiciary provided for in the new constitutional dispensation. In a response, the ICC stated that "the Presidency has no legal powers under the <a href="http://www.un.org/law/icc/index.html">Rome Statute</a> or the subsidiary legal documents to consider the arguments and concerns raised in your letter (AU's letter) with respect to on-going cases before the Court, nor can the Presidency convey them to the relevant Chambers."</p>

<p>In that view, a question can be raised: in what capacity does the AU request the ICC to defer the cases under its jurisdiction? To begin with, the AU is a regional organization, and not a member of the Rome Statute. Neither has it entered an agreement with the ICC, as the UN did under Article 2 and 13(b) of the Rome Statute. In my view, even if the AU represents a collective voice of the AU member states, but is not party to the ICC Statute, any concerned AU member state, which is a state party to the ICC Statute, can legally raise such concerns.</p>

<p>Turning to the AU's request to the UNSC to in turn request the ICC defer investigations and prosecution pursuant to Article 16 of the Rome Statute; this provision does not apply to Kenyan cases, simply because the cases were not referred to the court by the UN Security Council. The Kenyan cases were initiated by the former ICC Prosecutor, Moreno Ocampo, in accordance with Article 15(1): "The Prosecutor may initiate investigations <em>proprio motu</em> on the basis of information on crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court." Article 16 can only apply to cases referred to the ICC by the UNSC. So, the Kenyan cases are not compatible with the meaning of Article 16.</p>

<p>Arguably, the ICC is not a subsidiary organ of the UN Security Council. Consequently, the UNSC cannot interfere in the court's business, whereby the court investigated Kenyan cases as provided by Article 15(1) of the ICC Statute. Equally, it can be noted that any UNSC request to the court to defer Kenyan cases to national jurisdiction, which already expressed unwillingness that triggered the matters to be entertained by the ICC, would be regarded as acting <em>ultra vires</em>. The Rome Statute establishing the ICC has treaty-based obligations, but not as an organ of the UN. The ICC, as an independent international judicial body, should strictly observe well-established core principles of independence and impartiality. The court deserves to live up its mandate, and in accordance with its statutory principles.  </p>

<p>According to Article 26 of the <a href="http://www.worldtradelaw.net/misc/viennaconvention.pdf">Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties</a> (VCLT), which provides that "Every treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by them in good Faith (<em>Pacta sunt servanda</em>)." This is one of the oldest principles of international law that has obviously become a norm of customary international law. As such, Kenya ratified the Rome Statute, and therefore bears the obligation to cooperate with the court as it should and in good faith. And as of now, the incumbent Kenyan president and his deputy have pledged to cooperate with the court, so why should there be a debate of Kenyan cases? Also, why should there be a request to defer Kenyan cases? The ICC is handling the Kenyan cases on the basis of unwillingness as posted in the recent pieces by <a href="/forum/2013/09/charles-jalloh-kenya-icc.php">Charles Jalloh</a> and <a href="/forum/2013/10/roland-adjovi-african-brainwash.php"> Roland Adjovi</a>. What the ICC is doing comports perfectly with its statutory framework.</p>

<p>In a political statement issued at the end of AU Session, the AU has resolved that no serving heads of state or government or high-ranking officials shall be tried by the ICC or any tribunal. It should, however, be noted that Kenya is a signatory to the Rome Statute, and Article 27 of the statute disregards official capacity, as provides that: </p>

<blockquote>This Statute shall apply equally to all persons without any distinction based on official capacity. In particular, official capacity as a Head of State or Government, a member of a Government or parliament, an elected representative or a government official shall in no case exempt a person from criminal responsibility under this Statute, nor shall it, in and of itself, constitute a ground for reduction of sentence. Immunities or special procedural rules which may attach to the official capacity of a person, whether under national or international law, shall not bar the Court from exercising its jurisdiction over such a person.</blockquote>

<p>Paragraph 2 of the preceding provision automatically and unequivocally removes immunities of state officials who are states parties to the ICC statute; and no exception to this provision or any preferential treatment to such high-ranking officials enjoying immunity. </p>

<p>With the case of Sudanese leader President Al-Bashir, on contrary, I have contended, in my recent paper, that the ICC arrest warrant against President Al-Bashir is invalid precisely for two reasons: Sudan is non-signatory to the ICC statute and, as a sitting head of state, Al-Bashir enjoys immunity under customary international law. Those desiring an expansion of my views on the subject, may read my <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2326370">paper</a>, "Immunity of State Officials before the International Criminal Court (ICC): the indictment of President Al-Bashir."</p>

<p>Fortunately, the move that had been politicized by a handful of AU members to have a mass withdrawal from the ICC statute has ended in vain. In fact, the majority of AU member states that are signatories to the Rome Statute are disinclined to pull out. A question can be raised: if genuinely, the AU member states seriously want to fight the reign of impunity as well as promoting human rights, why should there be a withdrawal from the Rome Statute? And why should there be immunity from prosecution of AU incumbent heads of state and government and other high-ranking state officials before the ICC or any tribunal? The two questions remain unresolved. Whatever the reasons I suppose the ulterior reason is not to have a shield from criminal justice.</p>

<p>If, in the future, some countries, from any region, decide to withdraw from the ICC or, non-signatories to the ICC statute, those who are responsible for such violations of international law will not be absolved from criminal responsibility. The UNSC, acting under Chapter VII, can refer any situation to the ICC prosecutor, as set forth in Article 13(b) of the Rome Statute. However, it is noteworthy that P-5 (Permanent Members of the UNSC), who are non-parties to the ICC Statute, will remain difficult to hold their nationals accountable by the ICC. </p>

<p>As much as one would relatively acknowledge the work of the ICC, the court should act quickly and actively when dealing with crimes committed elsewhere, as it does when crimes are committed in Africa. Lack of a consistent and uniform position in handling all these cases, will oftentimes portray nothing other than the double standard.  </p>

<p>Last but not least, the court should ensure the positive complementarity. Until recently, the ICC acknowledged the inadmissibility of Libyan cases (Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi and Abdullah Al-Senussi), although all along the ICC insisted that suspects should be transferred to its custody. If positive complementarity is at the forefront of the ICC, it will assuage the existential accusation by the AU; otherwise, truly, the court would seem singling out African leaders. As noted elsewhere, the ICC, as an independent international judicial body, should strictly observe well-established core principles of independence and impartiality. The court deserves to live up its mandate, in accordance with its statutory principles.  </p>

		<title>Guns in the Public Sphere: The Balance Between Self-Defense and Public Safety</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Andrew Beshai, <a href=" http://www.lls.edu">Loyola Law School</a> Class of 2015, discusses California's new gun laws...<hr height='1'><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size='3'><strong>T</strong></font>he gun rights discourse has occupied the media spotlight during the past several years owing to the horrific gun violence at Sandy Hook and, most recently, at the D.C. Naval Yard. On Friday, October 11, 2013, California Governor Jerry Brown <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/california-governor-signs-and-vetoes-several-gun-control-measures.php">signed</a> into law seven bills regulating various aspects of gun ownership in California. This has been the most recent development in the ongoing national debate over gun rights. </p>

<p>One aspect of the gun rights debate that was not addressed in the recent California legislative session is the ability to carry guns in public. Unfortunately, the media coverage on this issue has been rife with pundits deeply entrenched on polar ends of the political spectrum. Proponents of gun rights emphasize the need for self-defense and the long history and tradition of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/second_amendment">Second Amendment</a>. Opponents retort with arguments rooted in public safety and the negative effects of a pervasive "gun culture." Mirroring the divided rhetoric of media pundits, courts nationwide have posited divergent approaches regarding possession of guns in public.</p>

<p>The US Supreme Court addressed gun rights in the seminal case, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2739870581644084946">District of Columbia v. Heller</a>, where the major issue was whether the right to keep and bear arms was contingent on membership in a militia or whether it was a right that could be exercised individually. In reaching its decision, the court examined the historical and textual origins of the Second Amendment and held, "There seems to be no doubt on the basis of both text and history, that the Second Amendment conferred an individual right to keep and bear arms." However, while the <span class="casename">Heller</span> decision clarified the meaning of the Second Amendment to a certain extent, it also left questions unanswered. In the wake of the <span class="casename">Heller</span> decision, lower courts have struggled, often yielding conflicting opinions, to define how far the Second Amendment extends in the public sphere.</p>

<p>Some jurisdictions have interpreted the <span class="casename">Heller</span> decision to establish the right to bear arms only within the home, imposing restrictions on the right to bear arms in public. For example, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6595725860193302445">Kachalsky v. County of Westchester</a> upheld a New York law restricting the right to carry guns in public only to applicants who demonstrate "proper cause." In a similar vein, a California Appellate Court in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3738599470422953">People v. Yarbrough</a> upheld a statute imposing a categorical ban on the carrying of concealed weapons in public. </p>

<p>Other jurisdictions, have construed the <span class="casename">Heller</span> decision as granting an absolute right to bear arms without restrictions in public. For instance, the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10665754353092136977">Moore v. Madigan</a> held that an Illinois law placing a general ban on the carrying of guns in public was unconstitutional because the law undermines the policy of self-defense, which is not limited to the home. Echoing the Seventh Circuit, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16344805899800754074">Woollard v. Sheridan</a> held that a statute restricting the right to carry guns in public to applicants who demonstrated "good and substantial reason" was unconstitutional.  </p>

<p>These approaches range from an absolute restriction on possession of guns in public to an equally extreme approach that the right to bear arms extends absolutely to the public sphere. In between these two polarities there exists a reasonable middle ground - an appropriate statutory scheme that reconciles the right of self-defense with the interest of public safety.</p>

<p>One of the most important factors to consider when debating the right to carry weapons outside the home is public safety. A recent <a href="http://archinte.jamanetwork.com">study</a> by the American Medical Association has concluded that there is a strong correlation between the strength of a state's gun legislation and the number of firearm-related fatalities. There are conflicting <a href="http://www.cato.org/publications/white-paper/tough-targets-when-criminals-face-armed-resistance-citizens">reports</a> claiming that allowing concealed-carry of weapons actually leads to a decrease in crime and that more gun laws do not lead to a reduction in gun crimes. However, <a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/jlpp/Vol30_No2_KatesMauseronline.pdf">these studies</a> [PDF] only focus on the rate of crime and fail to consider that while the prevalence of guns in public may not increase crime, it does intensify the crimes that occur. Furthermore, there are <a href="http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1780&context=facpubs">studies</a> [PDF] indicating that carrying guns in public is not an effective form of self-defense.</p>

<p>While there is a strong argument for restricting guns in public, any limitations must be balanced with the right of self-defense. The fundamental policy aim behind the Second Amendment is the inherent right of self-defense. This right cannot be fully realized if there is a categorical ban on the possession of guns in public. The court in <span class="casename">Wollard</span> stated that in order to effectively secure the rights of self-defense, the Second Amendment's protection must be extended beyond the home. This same notion was articulated by the court in <span class="casename">Moore</span>, which stated, "[T]o confine the right to be armed to the home is to divorce the Second Amendment from the right of self-defense." </p>

<p>Given the need for a balanced approach, a complete ban on gun possession in public would infringe on the citizen's Second Amendment rights whereas an absolute right to carry guns in public would jeopardize public safety. Instead, states like New York and Maryland have appropriate statutory schemes that limit public possession of guns to individuals who demonstrate a "proper cause" for carrying a gun in public. These statutes require "a showing of the need for self-defense distinguishable from the greater community." An individual must demonstrate a special need for self-defense based on an objective threat to her safety. The reason such a statutory scheme provides the perfect balance is because it preserves the right of self-defense to those individuals who show a need while protecting the public by limiting the number of concealed carry permits that are issued.</p>

<p>The debate over the scope of gun rights continues on, carried out over media outlets and within courtrooms across the US. What is needed most urgently is a rational middle ground that reconciles the need for self-defense with the countervailing interest of public safety. To that end, the best solution seems to be a statutory scheme that provides individuals who demonstrate "proper cause" the right to carry guns in public.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Elizabeth Mohamad, <a href="http://law.nyu.edu">New York University School of Law</a> Class of 2016, offers insight surrounding the challenges surrounding recent "anti-foreign law" legislation and the resulting impact on the Muslim-American community...<hr height='1'><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size='3'><strong>S</strong></font>haria law, the multifaceted entity that is known as Islamic jurisprudence, is living and ever-changing. It is often mischaracterized as a single authoritative and static body of law, however it is anything but. Sharia law, like other aspects of Islam, is often modified by the cultural filter of the Islamic sect to which it is attached. The result of this is an array of ideological discrepancies where different schools of Islamic thought agree with some Sharia postulations while denying others. Each exists in an intangible medium, as there is no written or codified Sharia text that can be referenced. Despite these varying versions and ideologies, Sharia law has the common aim of providing religious guidance relating to matters of civil and criminal law, as well as personal moral conduct.  </p>

<p>As a result of the misinformed view that Sharia is a single, static and menacing authority, the overall American understanding of Sharia is informed by exposure to the most extreme form of these laws. This misinformation, coupled with preconceived judgments of the religion based on developments of Islamic terrorism, produces the kind of <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/27/anti-sharia-bill-north-carolina-gov-pat-mcrory_n_3823796.html">legislation</a> that has most recently emerged in North Carolina, aiming to <a href="http://ncleg.net/Sessions/2013/Bills/House/PDF/H522v4.pdf">ban</a> [PDF] the use of religious law for court decisions within the forum. As a country that grants its citizens freedom of religion as a constitutional right, the North Carolina legislation presents a number of interesting issues that are honeycombed upon one another to create a cluster of far-reaching consequences. This legislation neither explicitly infringes upon one's right to worship, nor does it single out Sharia law. However, surrounding circumstances of recent sensationalized concerns that Sharia law is attempting to dominate US court systems have substantiated the notion that the underlying purpose of this legislation is anti-Muslim. This development has left the Muslim-American community stunned, as it perceives the advent of this ban to be humiliating and unconstitutional. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment's</a> assertion that a group may exercise the freedom to practice their religion ultimately becomes insufficient and offended once the very medium that guarantees them that religious freedom puts forth legislation to isolate a religious group. The banning of Sharia law is thus incompatible with American constitutional ideals. Muslim-Americans should be allowed to invoke their religious laws, in terms of private religious arbitration, which govern the most intimate realm of their lives, so long as notions of constitutional compatibility still stand. In light of this, North Carolina's recent anti-Sharia legislation contradicts this long upheld notion of religious freedom by eliminating a body of law applicable to a large group of Americans who are entitled to their constitutional rights through their status as American citizens, and their religious rights through Islamic jurisprudence. </p>

<p>The First Amendment's establishment clause specifically states that the government is prohibited from creating any laws with regard to the establishment of religion. This applies not only to the government giving preferential treatment to one religion over another, but also to the prevention of the preference of religion over non-religion and vice versa. Barring religious law from the legal equation exemplifies the latter case of preference for non-religion over religion and is charged with partiality rather than neutrality.</p>

<p>Instead of pursuing this exclusionary approach, an understanding of this law might actually be beneficial in terms of better understanding the foundations of disputes involving American Muslims. Sharia law governs the very types of personal lifestyle developments that often lead parties to court, including divorces, custody battles and even breaches of contract. In each case, understanding Sharia law can grant the legal profession the ability to better understand the motivations and expectations of disputing parties. In the cases previously mentioned, acknowledgment of Sharia law can illuminate that in an Islamic divorce, the couple traditionally splits their assets asymmetrically with the wife often keeping the majority; in custody battles, it is traditionally upheld that the child support payments are enforced upon the father regardless of with which party the children live; in contract formations and breaches, it is traditionally upheld that interest rates are not applied to transactions and that remedies for breaches are restricted to only direct damages. To give an example that further implicates the resounding impact of this ban, consider a case where a Muslim-American who is not offered Halal food in an institution in which he or she attends or resides, whether it is a medical institution, a school, or even a prison. The banning of Sharia law effectively precludes any recourse for the Muslim-American to receive Halal meals at the institution, as the Sharia law requiring that Muslims maintain a Halal diet would not be considered in our courts. In light of these examples, the banning of Sharia law not only compromises the quality of representation for Muslim-American, but manifests its unconstitutionality as it can prevent Muslim-American from obtaining relief related to their First Amendment rights. </p>

<p>It is also notable to mention that in American courts, US laws maintain supremacy when considered against foreign law. In light of this, why would North Carolina, as well as <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/08/04/states-ban-foreign-law/2602511/">many other states</a>, choose to legislatively ban foreign bodies of law, when American laws will ultimately always have a hand to trump cards? This notion serves as confirmation that this legislation serves as a reactionary measure against Sharia law. There has not been one American court case that has based its holding on Islamic jurisprudence. Accordingly, the proposal of this ban as a counter to the likelihood of Sharia law infiltrating US courts is unfounded, as Sharia law has yet to even make its appearance in US courts. </p>

<p>Furthermore, a great number of young Muslims that already stigmatized as they are frequently typified as dangerous and foreign, this ban of Sharia law continues to send the message that Islam is incompatible with American principles, which further contributes to the ongoing and misguided notion that Muslims themselves are incapable of valid societal integration. This isolation can produce intense feelings of oppression and this oppression can, in turn, often become radicalizing. Such oppression hones the very ideals that contribute to extremist principles and can also lead Muslims, who would have been otherwise secular, down a more destructive or possibly even extremist path in response to feeling marginalized and isolated. In this sense, this legislation can produce the very results for which it aimed to respond and combat. </p>

<p>In light of the abundance of injurious consequences as described above, the anti-Sharia legislation that has been developing in the US is unconstitutional for a number of pressing reasons. If similar legislation continues to be adopted across the states, it would not be strained to conclude that the US has deemed it acceptable to compromise the First Amendment rights of an entire religious group as a reactionary measure against unwarranted fears. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/main.asp?PID=34">Jordan Paust</a> of the University of Houston Law Center examines the recent Amnesty International report and provides several possible justifications for drone attacks under international law ...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/jordanpaust.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he new Amnesty International report <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/amnesty-international-publishes-annual-human-rights-report.php">urges</a> the US to conduct a thorough, impartial and independent investigation whether certain CIA personnel may be guilty of "arbitrary" and "extrajudicial executions" in violation of international law. However, there are important points to recall with respect to killings that are lawful under the law of self-defense or the laws of war. First, lawful killings under either paradigm would not be "arbitrary." Second, lawful killings under either paradigm can be "extrajudicial," and that is what lawful targetings in self-defense or during war often involve. Third, lawful killings under either paradigm would not be "executions," a word that could apply to unlawful killings of persons who are actually detained but would not apply to lawful targetings.</p>

<p>With respect to human rights law, such law generally applies at all times and in all social contexts, including during war.  For example, there are no geographic or contextual limitations with respect to the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/">UN Charter</a>-based duty of all members to take joint and separate action in order to effectuate "universal respect for, and observance of human rights." </p>

<p>The preamble to the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR) affirms this universal reach. Yet, with regard to lawful targetings of (1) those who are taking a direct part in ongoing armed attacks (DPAA) (i.e, those who are DPAA and are targeted during permissible measures of self-defense in time of peace or war), or (2) those who are taking a direct part in hostilities (DPH) (i.e., those who are DPH and are targeted during an armed conflict), the general human right to freedom from "arbitrary" deprivation of life will only be applicable with respect to those persons who are within the jurisdiction, actual power, or "effective control" of the state or other entity using a drone. Therefore, it is <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1718548">evident</a> that those who are being targeted, for example, by a high flying drone in a foreign country will not be protected under the general human right to life, because they are not within the actual power or effective control of the targeting state.</p>

<p>Moreover, even if the human right to freedom from "arbitrary" killing did apply, lawful targeting of such persons in compliance with the principles of distinction, reasonable necessity, and proportionality under the law of self-defense or the laws of war will not be "arbitrary" within the meaning of human rights law (i.e., within the meaning of Article 6 of the ICCPR). Additionally, compliance with the principles of distinction, reasonable necessity, and proportionality will provide a higher form of protection than a general human rights test based merely on what is or is not arbitrary in a given circumstance.</p>

<p>The Amnesty International report states that "[k]illing a civilian who has taken no direct part in hostilities is an arbitrary deprivation of life." This statement ignores the well-recognized right to target those who are DPAA or DPH even where there will be incidental loss of life among civilians who are not targetable if the principles of distinction, reasonable necessity, and proportionality are followed. When applying principles of reasonable necessity and proportionality with respect to use of drones for targeting, one should consider all relevant features of context. Among appropriate considerations are [1] identification of the target (e.g., as a DPAA, combatant, fighter with a continuous combat function, or DPH as opposed to a non-targetable civilian); [2] the importance of the target; [3] whether equally effective alternative methods of targeting or capture exist; [4] the presence, proximity, and number of civilians who are not targetable; [5] whether some civilians are voluntary or coerced human shields; [6] the precision in targeting that can obtain; and [7] foreseeable consequences with respect to civilian death, injury, or suffering.</p>

<p>The report is incorrect when claiming that "[o]utside a situation of armed conflict, the US authorities must demonstrate, in each strike, that intentional lethal force was only used when strictly unavoidable to protect life, no less harmful means such as capture or non-lethal incapacitation was possible, and the use of force was proportionate in the prevailing circumstances." The report also alleges that "[d]eliberate killing ... without first attempting to arrest suspected offenders, without adequate warning, without the suspects offering armed resistance, and in circumstances in which suspects posed no immediate risk to security forces, would be considered extrajudicial executions." The report uses alleged "law enforcement" standards when making these claims, but targeted killing under the law of self-defense is not "law enforcement" and the alleged restrictions do not mirror the customary or treaty-based law of self-defense outside of the statement that force must be "proportionate in the prevailing circumstances."  "Law enforcement" standards would only apply during a law enforcement effort even if the alleged standards were part of customary international law.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Enkelena Gjuka, <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/academics/graduate/law">St. John's University School of Law</a> Class of 2014, is the author of the sixth article in a 10-part series from the staffers of the <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/academics/graduate/law/journals_activities/jcred">Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development</a>. Gjuka calls upon the Securities Exchange Commission and  Congress to increase diversity on corporate boards...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="Gjuka.jpg" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Gjuka.jpg" width="180" height="226" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>magine that after countless hours of studying, you graduate with honors and are offered an interview for your dream job but when you get there, the human resources director tells you "I just can't hire you, honey, even though you are more than qualified. If I put you on the floor with all those men, I would never get any work done."</p>

<p>This scenario is based on <a href="http://journals.cluteonline.com/index.php/CIER/article/view/171/164">Priscilla Berry's story</a>. She was unable to find employment&#151not because she was unqualified, but because she is a female. Priscilla's experience is certainly not unheard of. She is just one among many women who have been discriminated against in the workforce because they are women.</p>

<p>Women, especially those seeking positions on corporate boards, continue to face challenges that men do not. Although women and men currently <a href="http://www.wcwonline.org/pdf/CriticalMassExecSummary.pdf">comprise</a> [PDF] roughly equal portions of the population and 25 percent more women than men graduate from college, only 3.6 percent of Fortune 500 companies have a female CEO and only 14.7 percent of US companies have a female board member.</p>

<p>Board diversity should be increased for a number of reasons. First, increasing the number of women in boardrooms would promote equality. Second, <a href="http://www.wcwonline.org/pdf/CriticalMassExecSummary.pdf">evidence</a> [PDF] shows that corporations whose boards contain more women are more effectively and efficiently run than those that do not. Women bring a leadership style that benefits boardroom dynamics and are likely to invest better than their male counterparts. Some <a href="http://www.thestar.com/life/health_wellness/2012/01/10/women_bankers_wouldve_prevented_economic_crises_analysts_say.html">studies</a> suggest that the global financial crisis of the late 2000s to the early 2010s could have been prevented if there had been more women on corporate boards and in financial banking.</p>

<p>The importance of increasing board diversity has also been recognized by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Accordingly, the SEC amended <a href="http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2009/33-9089.pdf">Regulation S-K Item 407(c)(2)(vi)</a> [PDF] to require corporations with a diversity policy to disclose how the policy is implemented and how the nominating committee "assesses the effectiveness of its policy." However, the amended Regulation S-K alone will not dramatically increase female board membership because it does not require corporations to consider diversity and does not define the term diversity.</p>

<p>In light of the dearth of women in corporate leadership positions, I have developed a proposal which would be more effective than what the SEC has done so far. My three-step proposal provides that the SEC needs to define diversity in Regulation S-K, Congress should enact a law which would give corporations a tax credit for every female elected to their board, and corporations should implement outreach programs to increase board diversity.</p>

<p>First, the SEC must define the term diversity. To increase gender diversity on corporate boards, diversity cannot be left for companies to define "in ways that they consider appropriate." Therefore, the SEC should amend Regulation S-K to define the term diversity in the following way:</p>

<p>Diversity refers to many demographic variables, including, but not limited to, race, gender, religion, national origin, education, professional experiences, differences of viewpoint and other individual qualities that contribute to board heterogeneity.</p>

<p>Second, Congress should pass an act which would give corporations a tax credit for every female that they elect to their board. The act should be implemented as a seven-year program to encourage 20 percent female membership on corporate boards by 2020. There are two reasons for the time limit: (1) corporations will likely be more prompt in electing female board members when the tax incentive is a limited time offer, and (2) by 2020, corporations will likely realize the benefits of a larger number of female board members, so tax incentives will no longer be needed.</p>

<p>Third, corporations should take measures and implement their own programs to increase board diversity. Outreach programs are generally effective and will likely increase the number of women on boards since many women need encouragement or information to become board members. There are many methods that corporations can use to promote board diversity. For example, a corporation can implement programs where senior women reach out to younger women for encouragement to nominate themselves for board positions.</p>

<p>Some corporations argue that taking measures to increase board diversity is unnecessary because, with time, the number of female board members will increase on its own. However, we <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stacie-nevadomski-berdan/why-corporate-boards-shou_b_1751320.html">cannot wait for change</a> to occur on its own because over the past decade, "the percentage of women on boards of US companies has remained stagnant." Even if the number of women on boards will increase on its own, the US cannot afford to waste time in this difficult economy. It's more important than ever to take advantage of everyone's skills: both female and male.</p>

<p>It is time that we, just like many other countries, take additional measures to increase diversity in the workforce, and more specifically in the boardroom. My three-step proposal is likely to be effective because it would give hard-working women, like Priscilla, a better chance to get elected to a board. Thus, unless the SEC, Congress, and corporations across the country take measures, the battle to increase board diversity will continue to be a difficult one.</p>

In 1908, the United States granted a "right-of-way" to the Hahn's Peak and Pacific Railway Company to build and operate a 66-mile railway from Laramie, Wyoming to Colorado. Later, the government sold Marvin and Lulu Brandt an 80-acre tract "subject to those rights for railroad purposes as have been granted to the [railroad company]." Years later, the railroad abandoned the track, and the US <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Brandt-Petition-for-Cert.pdf">sued</a> [PDF] the Brandts, claiming ownership of the right-of-way.</p>

                <p>So, who actually <strong>owns</strong> the land?</p>

                <p>Like most good property hypotheticals, the answer is not as readily apparent as it may seem. Indeed, the court's resolution of this case could either uphold or scrap one of the most fundamental principles underlying our common law system of property ownership: the certainty of title.</p>

                <p>The <span class="casename">Brandt</span> case finds its roots in the flurry of late nineteenth century policies that drove the westward expansion and settlement&#8212;in particular, the <a href="http://congressionalresearch.com/RL32140/document.php">General Railroad Right-of-Way Act of 1875</a>, a statute that encouraged expansion of railroads by granting "rights-of-way" to railroad companies to run tracks over public lands. By the 1920s, the nation's railway system reached its peak of 272,000 miles of track, crisscrossing the nation. Since then, however, the utility of rail transport has declined. By the mid-1980s, the federal government estimated that at least 130,000 miles of track had been abandoned, with an estimated 3,000-4,000 more miles of track being abandoned every year. All across the country, there are thousands of miles of abandoned track running through private lands, like the Brandts' acreage.</p>

                <p>This new reality resulted in competing claims for the land. Homeowners and farmers sought to make use of their property free of the disused railways. But the federal government had different plans for the land; it <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/chapter-27">adopted</a> a "rails-to-trails" program with the goal of converting old tracks into recreational trails. The problem with the government's plan was that it did not intend to compensate the underlying property owners for the land, contrary to the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment]">Fifth Amendment's command</a>.</p>

                <p>Unsurprisingly, the government quickly found itself defending its rails-to-trails program before the US Supreme Court, which held in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=219035289030989806">Preseault v. Interstate Commerce Commission</a> that, although the program itself was a valid exercise of federal commerce power, converting an abandoned right-of-way to a trail could "giv[e] rise to just compensation claims" under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment">Takings Clause</a>. Following that decision, the federal circuit <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1019819016294718091">developed a test</a> for determining when a rails-to-trails conversion will require compensation, and when it will not: <blockquote>[T]he determinative issues for takings liability are (1) who owns the strip of land involved, specifically, whether the railroad acquired only an easement or obtained a fee simple estate; (2) if the railroad acquired only an easement, were the terms of the easement limited to use for railroad purposes, or did they include future use as a public recreational trail (scope of the easement); and (3) even if the grant of the railroad's easement was broad enough to encompass a recreational trail, had this easement terminated prior to the alleged taking so that the property owner at the time held a fee simple unencumbered by the easement (abandonment of the easement).</blockquote><br />
                According to federal circuit precedent, all three determinative issues were present and warranted payment of compensation to the Brandts. Federal circuit courts have repeatedly concluded that railroad rights-of-way granted under the 1875 Act are easements. And, under the common law of property, an easement will extinguish upon abandonment and the title will be unencumbered by the right-of-way. If, in that circumstance, the government still wants to convert the abandoned right-of-way into a recreational trail, it must <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12506972152859548311">compensate</a> the owner. </p>

                <p>Had <span class="casename">Brandt</span> followed the normal course for a rails-to-trails case, it would have been an open and shut win for the Brandts. But <span class="casename">Brandt</span> is far from ordinary. The federal government devised a plan to circumvent the federal circuit precedents and convert the abandoned right-of-way without compensating the Brandts. Instead of commencing the trail conversion process&#8212;which would have landed the case within the jurisdiction of the federal circuit&#8212;the government filed a quiet title action in a Wyoming district court. The strategy was to take advantage of a 30-year-old summary judgment decision, <a href=http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10988700855055112293">State of Idaho v. Oregon Short Line R. Co</a> wherein an Idaho district court found that the federal government held an "implied reversionary interest"&#8212;a property interest that does not exist at common law&#8212;in rights-of-way conveyed to railroad companies under the General Railroad Right-of-Way Act of 1875. The federal government's strategy worked. The US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, in <span class="casename">Brandt</span>, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10870530664768584786&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">adopted</a> the summary judgment decision as law of the circuit&#8212;expressly rejecting decisions from the federal circuit&#8212;and held that the federal government owned a reversionary interest in the right-of-way, meaning that it could open a public recreational trail on the Brandts' land without compensating them. </p>

                <p>The US Supreme Court granted review of the Tenth Circuit's decision to settle the split of authority and, specifically, to determine "[w]hether the United States retained an implied reversionary interest in rights-of-way created by the General Railroad Right-of-Way Act of 1875 rights-of-way after the underlying lands were patented into private ownership." It would be a mistake, however, for practitioners to let the narrow scope of the question presented distract their attention from this case. <span class="casename">Brandt</span> has the potential to be a blockbuster because, underlying the seemingly parochial question about railroad rights-of-way, is a much more fundamental issue that could impact every landowner in the nation: whether the grantor of real property can impliedly reserve an interest in land after it is sold.</p>

                <p>The common law of property emphatically <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/PLF-AC-Brf-Re-In-Sup-of-PWC.pdf">says</a>, no. But the line of Tenth Circuit cases culminating in <span class="casename">Brandt</span> holds that the US government, when conveying property, can change the well-settled rules and definitions of property to best serve the government's interests&#8212;in this case, the interest in not paying just compensation when establishing a public use of private property.</p>

                <p>The federal government's desire to avoid its compensation obligation simply does not warrant such a dramatic and harmful change in our system of property ownership. The very idea that a grantor can silently retain an interest in real property conveyed in fee simple to another person is anathema to property law, which is <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6784548360476629551">predicated</a> on "certainty and predictability where land titles are concerned." Indeed, a decision that allowed a third party to hold an implied interest in land would necessarily mean that landowners cannot rely on the express language of their titles to establish ownership of property, rendering the owners' interests and expectations therein potentially worthless.</p>

                <p>The nation would reap a bitter harvest from Tenth Circuit's rule. Instead of being safe and assured, any property purchased from the United States would be subject to the fluctuating policies of the government. Any short-term fiscal benefits that judicial recognition of an "implied reversionary interest" would provide to the federal government would not be worth the long-term consequences. And, for that reason alone, the US Supreme Court should resolve <span class="casename">Brandt</span> in accordance with the common law rules and definitions of property.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Stan Cox of New England Law &#124; Boston says that the US Supreme Court should use great caution in its application of general personal jurisdiction doctrine to the facts of the Daimler AG case ... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/stanleycox.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>f the justices are not careful in their handling of the case, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=daimler+ag+v+bauman&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&as_ylo=2012&case=7536570344238361226&scilh=0">Daimler AG</a> could prove to be another personal jurisdiction disaster for the Supreme Court. On any reasonable view of what due process should permit, there should not be personal jurisdiction over Daimler (a German company) in California for a suit by Argentinian plaintiffs based on activities of an Argentinian Daimler subsidiary for conduct that occurred in Argentina many years ago. The Ninth Circuit was wrong to hold otherwise. But because the Supreme Court has not developed a principled rationale for general personal jurisdiction in prior case law, and because of the complicated posture of the <span class="casename">Daimler</span> case, there is real possibility that, if the Court reaches the merits of the personal jurisdiction issue, the justices might speak broadly about general personal jurisdiction when, frankly, they do not yet seem to be in a position to know what they should say. </p>

<p>General personal jurisdiction is all-purpose personal jurisdiction. Where you have it over a defendant, you can sue that defendant in that forum for anything the defendant has done anywhere. In prior cases, the Supreme Court has not laid down anything like a clear test for how much connection with a forum is required for general jurisdiction. Nearly thirty years ago, in the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7448020381764435101&q=466+U.S.+408&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Helicol</a> case, the Court endorsed the requirement that a company must have "continuous and systematic general business contacts" with a forum before the company can be subject to general jurisdiction. More recently, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6139328910784593631&q=goodyear+jurisdiction&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Goodyear</a>, the Court reaffirmed that language, and added the gloss that a defendant must be capable of being "fairly regarded as at home" before general jurisdiction will be appropriate. In both cases, the Court pointed to the facts of a prior case, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13417740674628945075&q=perkins+jurisdiction&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Perkins</a>, as a paradigmatic situation where general jurisdiction was satisfied. But in no case has the Court said that general jurisdiction must be restricted to situations that rise to the level of <span class="casename">Perkins</span>, where a corporation is doing all the business it can do at the time in that forum. </p>

<p>During <span class="casename">Daimler</span> oral argument October 15, several justices seemed either to be leaning towards or assuming that the test for general jurisdiction should restrict it to the places where a business is incorporated or has its principal place of business. I agree that general jurisdiction should be limited to the place where a company is most at home, presumptively only its states of incorporation and principal place of business. But the problem for the justices is they have no principled reason, based in prior case law, for adopting, as a matter of constitutional law, such a restrictive test for general jurisdiction. Such a test, would, as Justice Alito notes, be a "nice clear rule." But personal jurisdiction is not a matter of statutory interpretation, where the Court can fill in whatever ambiguity Congress hands it and then let Congress change the rule to something else if displeased with the Court's line drawing. That was appropriate in the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11481058059843290042&q=hertz+corp+v+friend&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Hertz</a> case of 2010, construed the principal place of business in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1332">28 USC 1332</a> to be its nerve center headquarters. A constitutional restriction on state ability to hear cases needs something more than the Court's desire for a clear rule and the certainty that nothing unfair could happen if the line were drawn so restrictively. If the Court goes such <em>ipse dixit</em> route, Justice Black's worst fears about justices' subjective judgments driving due process personal jurisdiction doctrine, expressed at the very beginning of the Court's passage down the minimum contacts road in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5514563780081607825&q=international+shoe&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">International Shoe</a>, would be realized.</p>

<p>The Court would not be inscribing its "because-we-say-so" definitions upon a clean slate, either. The Court has hardly always assumed that general jurisdiction should be limited to place of incorporation and principal place of business. Nor are these contrary prior Court assumptions only in ancient pre-<span class="casename">Shoe</span> opinions. For example, in the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5549901652912762936&q=%22allstate%22+%221981%22+%22minnesota%22&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Allstate</a> case, in 1981, every member of the Court assumed that defendant Allstate was subject to personal jurisdiction in Minnesota. For some of the justices this assumption was necessary to their conclusion that there would be no unfair surprise to Allstate in applying Minnesota law to insurance coverage issues for a policy issued elsewhere that was triggered by an accident that occurred elsewhere. For the other justices, the fact that Allstate was subject to personal jurisdiction in Minnesota was irrelevant to the choice of law issue before the Court. But all the justices assumed, not arguendo but as a background factual matter, that the amount of business Allstate did in Minnesota subjected it to personal jurisdiction there, without regard to what the underlying lawsuit was about. Since Minnesota was neither Allstate's principal place of business nor state of incorporation, Allstate would be similarly subject to personal jurisdiction everywhere else it had offices and did business. </p>

<p>To move to the constitutional conclusion that general jurisdiction must now instead be limited to where a corporation is most present requires underlying rationales rather than evolving assumptions. In its two general jurisdiction cases, however, the Court provided no rationales for the general personal jurisdiction doctrine, only data points along a continuum. We know that general jurisdiction exists when a corporation is doing all the business it can do in the forum (<span class="casename">Perkins</span>). We know it doesn't exist if the corporation is making purchases in the forum (Helicol), nor if some of its products are distributed into the forum (<span class="casename">Goodyear</span>). Between those "yes" and "no" data points is the huge land of who knows. For example, what if there is a physical office? Or full-time employees? What if the company directly sells a majority or very substantial portion of its products in the forum? Are these activities sufficiently "continuous and systematic" such that the corporation can fairly be considered "at home" where they occur? </p>

<p>We do not know exactly what the restrictions on general jurisdiction should look like, because the Court has never explained why, as a matter of jurisprudence, instead of merely counting contacts, the doctrine should exist. My own belief (the subject of an in-process law review article), not shared by most (any?) other academics, is that general jurisdiction should be limited to the place where a company is most present, because only that sovereign can legitimately impose its own laws on that company's conduct wherever that conduct occurred. Others may believe general jurisdiction is justified by a kind of necessity principle, the need for one sure place you are able to sue. Perhaps the doctrine is supported by ideas of all-purpose submission being required before there can be all-purpose litigation exposure. Perhaps due process fairness requires not exposing a company to unrelated litigation liability unless one is sure there would be absolutely no physical inconvenience to the defendant by such suits. I will not clutter this posting with the many possibilities. The point is that the Court should be wrestling with the "why" arguments for a restrictive approach to general jurisdiction, but only in a case that presents the issues squarely, where those issues become the focus of the argument and briefing to the Court.</p>

<p>The "why" of general jurisdiction has not been the focus of the briefs or arguments in <span class="casename">Daimler</span>, partly because the parties and ninth circuit assumed (incorrectly) that general jurisdiction existed over the Daimler subsidiary doing substantial business in California. The issues in Daimler became one step additionally removed from those personal jurisdiction issues, since jurisdiction was disputed only over the parent, not the sub. The focus of briefs and arguments in <span class="casename">Daimler</span>, and also the issue granted cert on, was attribution. Would it violate due process to attribute the contacts of the German parent's US seller, MBUSA, to Daimler, such that Daimler is subject to general jurisdiction, when the parent concedes that the subsidiary is subject to general jurisdiction in that forum. </p>

<p>The Court could reverse the Ninth Circuit for using an attribution test too easily satisfied, and which failed to give meaningful consideration to corporate separateness. The Court's pronouncements would then become constitutionally required in attribution situations. Such a ruling could be confined merely to chiding the Ninth Circuit for not taking into account the right factors. The instruction on remand would be to take the proper factors into account and then decide, for contacts that could be attributed, whether these contacts satisfy general jurisdiction requirements. The Court would not have to specify in any more detail what those general jurisdiction requirements are.</p>

<p>A better solution would be simply to vacate and remand for reconsideration in light of <span class="casename">Goodyear's</span> requirement that a corporation must be found "at home" in the forum. Some additional brief comments could be added that it is never automatic for a parent to be found "at home" just because a subsidiary might be conceded to be at home in the forum. The Court could emphasize that the individual contacts of the parent, even if through the subsidiary, have to satisfy the "at home" test, without explaining exactly what that test requires. </p>

<p>But if the Court instead finds itself unable to resist the temptation to describe in more detail than it so far has what are the dimensions of general personal jurisdiction, watch out! Putting the cart of general jurisdiction description prematurely in front of the horses of harder cases and strongly briefed rationales risks producing yet more ruts on the minimum contacts highway.</p>

Canada</span> and its impact of physician-assisted suicide...<hr height='1'><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size='3'><strong>T</strong></font>he case <a href="http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcsc/doc/2012/2012bcsc886/2012bcsc886.html">Carter v. Canada</a> is bringing the issue of physician-assisted suicide back to the Canadian courts. In 2011, Lee Carter, Hollis Johnson and the late Gloria Taylor launched a challenge to the provision in the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/">Criminal Code of Canada</a> that bans physician-assisted suicide. </p>

<p>Taylor, the lead plaintiff in the case, suffered from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disease. ALS causes individuals to become paralyzed, and most individuals who suffer from this disease die within two to five years of diagnosis. Taylor was concerned that her illness would leave her in a state where she would not be able to take her own life. Taylor <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/assisted-suicide-crusader-gloria-taylor-dies-in-b-c-1.1164650">died from a severe infection</a> in October 2012, before her case was heard on appeal.</p>

<p>Carter and Johnson <a href="http://bccla.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/20110426-BCCLA-Legal-Case-Carter-et-al.pdf">traveled</a> [PDF] with Kathleen "Kay" Carter, Lee's mother, to the Dignitas Clinic in Forch, Switzerland, in order to have a physician assist her to die with dignity. Kay had suffered from spinal stenosis, which caused her chronic pain and limited movement in her limbs. She required help to eat, sit up in bed and go to the bathroom. Upon their return to Canada, Lee and Hollis were concerned that they could be held to be criminally liable for aiding with Kay's death.</p>

<p>The plaintiffs challenges 241(b) of the Criminal Code of Canada, which states: "Every one who ... aids or abets a person to commit suicide ... is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years." The plaintiffs argue that this provision prevents them the freedom to choose to end their lives, once they do not have the physical capacity to do so themselves, or to help others who want to end their lives. Grace Pastine, Litigation Director at the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association (BCCLA), has said: "the government has no place at the bedside of seriously ill Canadians, denying the right to decide to those who have made firm decisions about the amount of suffering <a href="http://bccla.org/news/2013/10/court-of-appeal-denies-canadians-right-to-choose-assisted-death/">they will endure at the end of life</a>."</p>

<p>The British Columbia Supreme Court found that the laws were unconstitutional, as they violated the plaintiffs' rights to life, liberty and security of the person, and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice, as guaranteed by section 7 of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-15.html">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a>. The court found that the provisions violated Taylor's right to life, as she would have to end her own life while she was still able to do so, thus shortening her lifespan. Taylor also claimed that the laws violated her right to equality, as found in section 15 of the charter which protects individuals from discrimination based on, among other grounds, disability. The court agreed with her, claiming the provision had a disproportionate burden on those with physical disabilities.</p>

<p>The issue of physician-assisted suicide came before Canada's courts in 1993 when Sue Rodriguez <a href="http://csc.lexum.org/decisia-scc-csc/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1054/index.do">challenged</a> the provisions of the Criminal Code based on her charter rights. In a complex decision, Canada's highest court refused to strike down the provisions, finding that although they might infringe on Rodriguez's rights to liberty and security of the person, this infringement was in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. As well, the court found that although the provisions might infringe on Rodriguez's equality rights, this infringement was justified, as per section 1 of the charter, which allows reasonable limitations that could be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. </p>

<p>The court was divided on the issue, however, in 1993. Justice McLaughlin (as she then was) wrote a dissenting opinion on the case, claiming that the provisions banning physician-assisted suicide violated the plaintiff's right to security and that this infringement could not just be justified under section 1 of the charter.</p>

<p>The plaintiffs decided to bring the issue back to the court, despite the ruling in <span class="casename">Rodriguez</span>. They argued that (1) the social acceptance of physician-assisted suicide has increased since the 1993 decision, (2) the constitutional doctrines of overbreadth and proportionality has not been developed at the time of the decision in 1993, but would be applicable to the case today, and (3) that the court can now rely on evidence from jurisdictions that have legalized physician-assisted suicide.</p>

<p>The British Columbia Supreme Court found that both public opinion, and the professional opinion of doctors were divided on the ethics of the issue. The court also looked at evidence coming from jurisdictions that have legalized physician-assisted suicide, such as Washington, Oregon and Switzerland. The court noted that these jurisdictions have safeguards to protect vulnerable parties, and the practice of physician-assisted suicide has not had either a negative or a positive impact on the availability of palliative care or on the physician-patient relationship. The court found that although there were risks, specifically those associated with patients' ability to make well-informed decisions, ensuring patients' freedom from coercion or undue influence, and with physicians' ability to assess patients' capacity and voluntariness, the evidence showed that the risks could mostly be avoided through carefully-designed, well-monitored safeguards. This meant that the prohibition in the Criminal Code was overbroad, as it prohibits activity that falls outside its aim, and that the effects of an absolute ban were grossly disproportionate to the legislative objective.</p>

<p>The British Columbia Supreme Court also held that the law was discriminatory against Taylor, as it perpetuates the disadvantage of physically-disabled people. The court found that this infringement could not be justified, since the government could achieve its purpose of protecting vulnerable parties, while allowing competent individuals who are grievously and irremediably ill to consent to a physician-assisted death. Safeguards could be put into place to protect the vulnerable, and thus achieving the government's purpose. The court also found that the detriments placed on Ms. Taylor were very severe, and were not outweighed by the benefits of the legislation. </p>

<p>The court declared section 241(b) to be unconstitutional, but suspended the declaration for one year to allow the legislature to "permit Parliament to take whatever steps it sees fit to draft and consider legislation". The court did, however, give Taylor a constitutional exemption, allowing her to seek out a physician-assisted suicide under specific conditions. Taylor, however, passed away before being able to use her exemption.</p>

<p>The Attorney General of British Columbia appealed the trial court's decision, bringing the case to the British Columbia Court of Appeal, which allowed the appeal and reversed the decision of the British Columbia Supreme Court. Two of three judges on the court based their decision on the doctrine of <em>stare decisis</em>, or binding precedent. The court declared they were bound by <span class="casename">Rodriguez</span> and could not declare the provision unconstitutional due to the precedent.</p>

<p>Because of the Court of Appeal did not decide on the merits of the case, they are leaving it open for the Supreme Court of Canada to decide whether it should overrule its previous decision. The BCCLA has already announced its plan to request leave to appeal to Canada's highest court.</p>

FEC</span> could upend a central element of campaign finance doctrine but even if the court's judgment is less radical than that, the erosion of restrictions on the electoral role of great private wealth will likely continue ...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/richardbriffault.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n October 8, 2013, the US Supreme Court heard oral argument in <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-campaign-finance-case.php">McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission</a>, in which a wealthy individual donor and the Republican National Committee (RNC) challenged the longstanding federal law placing an "aggregate" limit on the amount of money an individual can give to all federal candidates, political parties and political action committees (PACs) in an election cycle. </p>

<p>The case could upend a central element of <a href="/feature/featured/campaign-finance-1/">campaign finance</a> doctrine since the seminal <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11397892430187334248">Buckley v. Valeo</a> decision in 1976&#8212;the distinctive and relatively deferential judicial treatment of restrictions on campaign contributions as opposed to campaign expenditures. Even if the court's ultimate judgment is less radical than that, the erosion of restrictions on the electoral role of great private wealth will likely continue, if not accelerate. Whatever the result in <span class="casename">McCutcheon</span>, the future of campaign finance reform will require measures that "level up"&#8212;like public subsidies that match small donations&#8212;rather than "level down" restrictions that try to curb the ability of the very affluent to spend their money in elections.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/chapter-14">Federal law restricts</a> the amount of money an individual can donate to federal candidates. That limit, adjusted biennially for inflation, is currently $2,600 per election. With primaries and general elections treated as separate elections, the amount an individual can give to a federal candidate in an election cycle is capped at $5,200. Federal law also curbs the amount an individual can give to a national political party committee at an inflation-adjusted $32,400 per calendar year; and places a ceiling of $10,000 per calendar year on an individual's contributions to state and local party committees and a $5,000 per calendar year limit on donations to a PAC. These limits are not being challenged in the <span class="casename">McCutcheon</span> litigation. But federal law also imposes inflation-adjusted "aggregate" caps: an individual donor may not give more than $123,200 during a biennial election cycle to all federal candidates and parties and PACs active in federal elections; and the law also sets sub-caps of a maximum of $48,600 in contributions to all federal candidates; a maximum of $48,600 to all PACs; and a maximum of $74,600 to all PACs and parties together.  </p>

<p>The aggregate cap on donations to candidates meant that in 2012 plaintiff Shaun McCutcheon was unable to follow through on his plan of making a patriotic $1,776 donation to each of 27 candidates for Congress. Nor was he able to give as many donations to political party committees and PACs as he wanted because of the $74,600 limit. So, joined by the RNC, he challenged these restrictions as violative of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a>.</p>

<p>Since <span class="casename">Buckley</span>, the Supreme Court has consistently taken a bifurcated approach to restrictions on campaign money. It has treated campaign expenditures&#8212;that is, money spent on activity intended to communicate with or mobilize voters&#8212;as the highest form of campaign speech, subjecting restrictions on expenditures to strict judicial scrutiny. As a result, limits on spending by candidates and by independent groups that support or oppose candidates have been invalidated. By contrast, contributions&#8212;that is, money given to a candidate, party or political committee&#8212;are, although protected by the First Amendment, less protected because in the court's view they have less speech value than expenditures. Restrictions on contributions have been subject to the more deferential "exacting" review, and have been held to be justified by the important public interests in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption. The court has consistently sustained dollar limits on contributions to candidates and committees that give to or collaborate with candidates, except when the limits were so low they were found to interfere with political competition.</p>

<p>Aggregate limits arguably do not directly address a corruption concern. If an individual can give $2,600 to one candidate without raising a danger of corruption, why can't she give $2,600 to each of 435 candidates for the House of Representatives, and 34 candidates for the Senate? <span class="casename">Buckley</span> upheld the predecessor to the current aggregate limits, although that law simply had one overall aggregate limit and not the sub-limits for candidates and non-candidate committees which were added when the aggregate limit was raised in 2002. The court found "this quite modest restriction upon protected political activity serves to prevent evasion of the [individual] contribution limitation by a person who might otherwise contribute massive amounts of money to a particular candidate through the use of un-earmarked contributions to political committees likely to contribute to that candidate, or huge contributions to the candidate's political party."  </p>

<p><span class="casename">McCutcheon</span> raises two issues. First, the RNC contends that contribution limits, like expenditure limits, should be subject to strict judicial scrutiny as contributions are both a form of speech for donors and essential for candidates, parties and other political groups to finance their constitutionally protected expenditures. Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas have already embraced that position in prior opinions. If the court were to adopt this position it would be its most significant departure from <span class="casename">Buckley</span> in nearly four decades. That would probably be the end of federal, state, and local contribution limits. Even if the court were to conclude that preventing corruption is a compelling governmental interest, it could be argued&#8212;as Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas have contended&#8212;that dollar limits are not narrowly tailored to that anti-corruption end because bribery and disclosure laws could do the job with less of a burden on speech. In any event, governments would be held to a far more demanding standard of proving that a particular dollar limit, and not a higher one, is necessary to prevent corruption.</p>

<p>Second, even if the court leaves <span class="casename">Buckley's</span> more deferential standard for contribution restrictions alone, it could decide the aggregate limits are not justified as an anti-circumvention measure. That would be a less drastic, but still significant, departure from precedent. In many cases, the court has determined that preventing evasion of the limits on contributions to candidates is a sound constitutional justification for other limits, and it has deferred to Congress's judgment concerning what campaign finance practices provide opportunities for evasion of the basic limits. In recent years, however, the court has been much more skeptical about the anti-circumvention argument, which Chief Justice Roberts once dismissed as a "prophylaxis-upon-prophylaxis" approach. </p>

<p>Most of the <span class="casename">McCutcheon</span> oral argument focused on circumvention, with Justice Breyer and Justice Kagan repeatedly suggesting scenarios in which, without the aggregate limits, a donor could direct millions of dollars to a particular candidate via contributions to other candidates and committees, and Justice Alito acidly dismissing these as unrealistic "wild hypotheticals." Chief Justice Roberts seemed somewhat sympathetic to the need to impose aggregate limits on donations to parties&#8212;the focus of the court's analysis in <span class="casename">Buckley</span>&#8212;but seemed more troubled by the idea that an individual could be blocked from giving the "modest" maximum contribution to as few as ten candidates. Conceivably, the court could strike down the aggregate limit on donations to candidates while leaving the other aggregate limits in place. This would extend the court's practice of displacing congressional judgments concerning what campaign finance activities give rise to the corruption and appearance of corruption dangers that the court has said Congress may address. </p>

<p>Such a decision would be less radical than formally overturning <span class="casename">Buckley</span>'s rejection of strict scrutiny for contribution limits but would surely signal a closer court review of whether corruption dangers actually justify a contribution restriction whatever standard the court formally employs. It would also allow a small number of very wealthy individuals who already provide a significant portion of the funds in federal election to play an even bigger role. According to the <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2013/06/24/1pct_of_the_1pct/">Sunlight Foundation</a>, a little more than 30,000 people&#8212;or 1% of the 1%&#8212;provided $1.7 billion or 28 percent of all disclosed federal contributions in 2011-12. And a small subset of this elite&#8212;fewer than 4,000 people&#8212;each contributed at least $100,000. This is the group with demonstrated political interest and financial capacity most likely to contribute more if the court invalidates the aggregate limits.</p>

<p>Of course, even if the court sustains the challenged limits, great private wealth is likely to continue to play a significant role in financing our elections. In 2011-12, there were nearly 2,000 donors who already contributed more than the aggregate cap in federal elections. Due to lower court decisions in the aftermath of the Supreme Court's 2010 <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-eases-restrictions-on.php">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</a> decision, donations to Super PACs&#8212;committees that engage only in independent expenditures for or against a candidate&#8212;are not subject to any limits. As a result there were nearly six hundred individuals who gave $250,000 or more, and 95 people who gave more than $1,000,000 each&#8212;mega-donations they were able to make even though the aggregate caps on the books.</p>

<p>The rise of Super PAC donations and spending was repeatedly invoked in the <span class="casename">McCutcheon</span> oral argument by Justice Scalia and, to a lesser extent Justice Kennedy, for the point that with unlimited independent spending, the aggregate contribution limits can do little to curb the influence of big money on our politics. Given the central role of the court, particularly Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy, in striking down limits on independent spending and thereby undermining the effectiveness of contribution limits, the technical legal term for this argument is chutzpah. But the justices have a point. Even if the court is willing to accept Congress's judgment that aggregate contribution limits are needed to prevent evasion of the direct limits on donations to candidates, the court has already authorized a far greater circumvention of those limits.</p>

<p>With contribution limits effectively sidestepped by the unlimited spending of Super PACs, political nonprofits, and other campaign finance vehicles, the old reform strategy of using dollar limits to curb the influence of big money is unlikely to succeed. Even if the court rediscovers judicial modesty, decides to check its tendency to second-guess Congress, and instead reaffirms <span class="casename">Buckley</span>'s validation of both contribution limits and aggregate caps, such a decision will have at best a modest effect in constraining the role of great private wealth in our elections. That goal is more likely to be achieved by mechanisms that dilute the role of great private wealth by increasing the share of campaign money coming from small donors. As a number of states and cities have demonstrated, small-donor matching systems, in which small contributions are matched by public funds, often at a greater than one-to-one ratio, are one way to do this. </p>

<p>In other words, whatever the outcome in <span class="casename">McCutcheon</span>, the future of campaign finance reform, if it is to succeed, is likely to depend more on the adoption of public subsidies and other measures that empower small donors, and inspire candidates to pursue their donations, than on the limits at issue in the case.</p>

EPA</a> [PDF] (<em>certiorari</em> granted October 15, 2013), the Supreme Court must decide whether the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) acted permissibly when it determined that its regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/supreme-court-to-rule-on-greenhouse-gas-cases.php">triggered a statutory requirement</a> to additionally set emissions for greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources such as power plants. Industry parties, along with several state petitioners claim these regulations will cost billions of dollars. On the other hand, if this challenge is successful it could effectively topple a large portion of EPA's emissions limiting regulatory regime. However, the nature of the EPA's action creates a situation in which the industry and state petitioners lack standing, as the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9604564908496987747">opined</a>, to challenge the controversial rulemaking.</p>

<p>The EPA acted to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources in response to the Supreme Court's holding in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16923241216495494762">Massachusetts v. EPA</a>, and the agency's interpretation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/chapter-85">Clean Air Act</a>. The court's holding in <span class="casename">Massachusetts v. EPA</span> required the agency to <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/supreme-court-endorses-epa-authority-to.php">regulate</a> greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles if the agency determined that greenhouse gases endanger public health or welfare. EPA subsequently found that greenhouse gases indeed pose a danger to public health and welfare, setting emissions limits for new motor vehicles.</p>

<p>Accordingly the EPA, the Clean Air Act, together with the <span class="casename">Massashusetts v. EPA</span> holding, required the agency to set greenhouse gas emissions limits on stationary sources such as power plants. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5965664274709162335">Coalition for Responsible Regulation, Inc. v. EPA</a>, the court stated that: <blockquote>[the] EPA has long interpreted the phrase 'any air pollutant' in ... [the Act's] provisions to mean any air pollutant that is regulated under the CAA ... And once the Tailpipe Rule set motor-vehicle emissions standards for greenhouse gases, they became a regulated pollutant under the Act, requiring [stationary source] permitting.</blockquote> On this authority, EPA created the "<a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-07-12/pdf/2012-16704.pdf">Tailoring Rule</a>" [PDF], now in contention before the court, which granted <em>certiorari</em> to industry and state petitioners, in part, earlier this month.</p>

<p>The petitioners presented three main arguments. First, petitioners assert that the agency does not adequately support its endangerment finding for greenhouse gases. Second, the petitioners maintain that there are fatal flaws in the new motor vehicle regulations. Third, petitioners contend that the Clean Air Act does not authorize EPA to regulate emissions from stationary sources. The Supreme Court only accepted on <em>certiorari</em> the question of "whether the agency 'permissibly determined that its regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles triggered permitting requirements under the Clean Air Act for stationary sources that emit greenhouse gases.'" Because the court declined to hear challenges to the evidentiary support for endangerment finding and the motor vehicle regulations, these rules will stand.<br />
	<br />
According to Adam Liptak's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/16/us/politics/supreme-court-to-hear-challenge-to-epa-emissions-rules.html">article</a> for the <em>New York Times</em>, industry groups challenging the stationary source standards claim that EPA has undertaken "the most sweeping expansion" of its own authority ever. In extending agency authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources, rules may now reach millions of industrial, commercial and residential facilities across the US industry parties contend that costs could reach into the tens of billions of dollar per year. Liptak also acknowledged that environmental groups received the partial <em>certiorari</em> grant as a partial victory. These parties focused on the court's decision to deny further challenge to EPA's well-founded endangerment finding for greenhouse gases, and the denial to hear further challenge to the agency's clean car emissions standards. <br />
	<br />
The issue now before the court focuses on the agency's statutory interpretation. Lyle Denniston notes in his recent <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2013/10/analysis-greenhouse-gases-case/">post</a> on SCOTUSblog, that the court posed the question presented on its own, borrowing language from the US Department of Justice brief in the case. The court, however, changed the department's use of the word "correctly" to "permissibly." This word choice frames the way the court will employ the deference due to an agency in interpreting its own enabling statute.</p>

<p>This case comes with a serious threat to EPA's current regulatory regime. This threat is a double edge sword with possible significant implication for the challenging parties as well as the agency.  <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7479">42 USC &#167; 7479</a> states that large stationary sources that emit more than 250 ton of a pollutant per year must obtain permits from the EPA for these emissions, and that smaller sources that emit greater than 100 tons of a pollutant must obtain a permit. After making the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2010-06-03/pdf/2010-11974.pdf">endangerment finding</a> [PDF], EPA decided that using that low threshold would go beyond Congress' intentions and tip any reasonable cost-benefit balance within the statute. Therefore, EPA set the thresholds for greenhouse gas emissions at 100,000 tons per year for larger sources, and 75,000 tons per year for small sources. </p>

<p>As Denniston notes, if the court finds that EPA acted improperly, this could create major complications. For example, if the agency misinterpreted the act's "triggering" provision, a large portion of EPA's regulatory structure could prove an unconstitutional use of authority that Congress has not delegated to the agency. Moreover, if EPA must follow the thresholds of the act in implementing its provisions, the act would require EPA to regulate emissions sources as small as hospitals and apartment buildings. This would cost the agency billions of dollars in added paper work, and would cost industry parties billions to comply with the rules.</p>

<p>Still, only a rare case would allow the court to find such an agency action permissible, despite EPA's intentions to reduce regulatory burdens to a manageable level. In the case below, EPA asserted three justifications for its Tailoring Rule. First, EPA determined that implementing the greenhouse gas emissions permitting program at the statutory levels would create absurd results. Second, the agency justified its actions based on administrative necessity. Third, EPA asserts its authority to implement large regulatory programs in a piecemeal fashion. Importantly, the D.C. Circuit never addressed these justifications for EPA's actions because the court found that the challengers lacked standing.</p>

<p>The D.C. Circuit found industry and state challengers to lack standing because they "were regulated ... not because of anything EPA did in the Timing and Tailoring Rules, but by automatic operations of the statute." Thus, these rules did not cause the alleged injury of having to comply with EPA regulations. Additionally, the state challengers contended that the climate change caused by greenhouse gases causes their injury and that they actually wanted greater and quicker regulation. The D.C. Circuit, however, held this argument as "completely without merit" for two reasons. First, the state challengers never stated this alleged injury before their reply brief, making the argument invalid. Second, unlike the injury asserted in <span class="casename">Massachusetts v. EPA</span>, these state challengers "fail to cite any record evidence to suggest they are adversely affected by global climate change." In the end, the lower courts sound reasoning will demand the court affirm the D.C. Circuit's holding and find the petitioners to lack standing here. Thus, the Tailoring Rule will stand. </p>

<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/people/full-time-faculty/anthony-c-infanti">Anthony Infanti</a></a> of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law argues that a coalition in favor of abolishing income tax joint filing may soon emerge... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/anthonyinfanti.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>W</strong></font>ith the government shut down and debt ceiling crisis now behind us, the federal government has turned its attention to the budget and taxes. But given the deep divide in Congress, there is little optimism that anything approaching real improvement in the tax laws will be achieved anytime soon. However, following the Supreme Court's same-sex marriage <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">decisions</a> this summer, there is one piece of fundamental tax reform that everyone should be able to agree upon and that would make our tax system fairer: abolition of joint income tax return filing.</p>

<p>For decades, commentators have critiqued joint filing for married couples. They have pointed out that joint filing does not comport with the changing nature of the American family because it leaves out nontraditional families, families of choice, and singles. Being premised on the notion that married couples are a single economic unit, it also fails to reflect the reality that not all married couples pool their income. In addition, joint filing can leave a spouse who did not earn or even benefit from income reported on the joint return with an onerous tax liability, a problem that has led to the enactment of "innocent spouse" relief that has proved far from adequate. And joint filing creates a bias against secondary earners, historically thought of as women, because their first dollar of income is taxed not at the lowest tax rates but at their spouse's marginal tax rate. </p>

<p>Despite the numerous critiques, conventional wisdom has held that it is politically impossible to abandon joint filing in favor of an individual filing system because of the importance of marriage to American society. But what was previously unthinkable now looks eminently achievable as the interests of the different stakeholders in this debate start to converge. </p>

<p>Naturally, those who have been critiquing joint filing all along, including me, will support a move to an individual filing system. Such a move would both address the critiques outlined above and allow the flexibility to let taxpayers identify their families for themselves, rather than having to fit into a prepackaged family form. Individual filing would allow us to make our tax laws relationship neutral.</p>

<p>Those who view joint filing as a means of encouraging or rewarding marriage, but who oppose same-sex marriage, should now likewise be open to abolishing joint filing. In the wake of the Supreme Court's same-sex marriage decisions, the IRS has now issued <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rr-13-17.pdf">guidance</a> that recognizes many (though, it seems, not all) same-sex marriages for federal tax purposes. Individual filing would certainly take the federal government out of the business of using the tax laws to reward or encourage marriage, the very political problem that made individual filing seem like a pipe dream. But as the list of states recognizing same-sex marriage grows, individual filing would now also take the federal government out of the business of encouraging or rewarding same-sex marriage through the tax laws. As an added benefit, of course, individual filing would eliminate the hated "marriage penalty." So, those opposed to same-sex marriage may finally have reason to see individual filing as an attractive option.</p>

<p>Those who support legally recognizing same-sex relationships also have reason to favor an individual filing system. The recent IRS guidance for same-sex couples does not seem to cover all same-sex marriages. In particular, it seems to leave at least some couples in "evasive" marriages out in the cold. For instance, it appears to deny legal recognition to couples in Pennsylvania who cross the border into New York or Maryland, who marry there, and who then return to Pennsylvania to live, because their attempt to evade Pennsylvania's same-sex marriage ban may render their marriages legally invalid. The recent IRS guidance also leaves same-sex couples in states with civil union or domestic partnership regimes out in the cold. With no explanation, the IRS refuses to recognize civil unions and domestic partnerships even if these relationships are legally equivalent to a marriage under state law. Furthermore, the IRS guidance leaves open a number of other important questions regarding the tax treatment of same-sex couples and lays some dangerous traps for the unwary. Thus, for the foreseeable future, the tax situation facing same-sex couples will be challenging, to put it mildly. Individual filing would resolve many of these issues by taking marital status out of the tax equation. At the same time, it would accommodate the large segment of the LGBT community that has questioned the push for marriage equality. So, those who support legally recognizing same-sex relationships should similarly be open to abolishing joint filing.</p>

<p>Strange bedfellows can sometimes make for salutary change in the law. The time is ripe to consider a move to an individual filing system as part of the tax reform debate. This might be the only piece of "real" tax reform that people of all political stripes will be able to get behind in these otherwise divided times.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Leslie Esbrook, Yale Law School Class of 2015, shows how the current international framework applies to recent international conflicts...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="Esbrook.jpg" src="/dateline/Esbrook.png" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>H</strong></font>uman Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/hrw-syria-rebels-have-committed-war-crimes.php">released</a> a report documenting war crimes committed by Syrian rebels on August 4 and urged the Security Council to refer the rebel groups to the International Criminal Court (ICC). The solution proposed by Human Rights Watch is a telling look at the current international legal regime: the world has infinite legal options available to stem the tide of the Syrian war, but the lack of political will among actors stymies any potential successes. Novel legal voices have forged a path to peace, repeatedly, but they remain out of touch with political realities that are not quick to use the war as a means to create new international law precedents.</p>

<p>We live in a world whose international legal structure has been informed by two major world wars in the past century that have led to a verbal repudiation of the traditional system of warfare as a means of resolving disputes. Embodied in the famous <a href="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imt/kbpact.htm">Kellogg-Briand pact</a>, this new system envisions courts as the first arbiter-to assign rights, but also as the final arbiter-to mete out retributive justice for wrongdoing. The latter feature, by its very nature, concedes that violence among and inside nation states cannot be permanently abolished. Indeed, it comes as no surprise that the rebels have committed war crimes; such acts of indiscriminate killing have been committed time and time again in war. That is not to say that the acts will not go unpunished. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, most well known for prosecuting Serbian and Croatian war criminals like <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/karadzic/4">Radovan Karadzic</a> and <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/slobodan_milosevic/4">Slobodan Milosevic</a>, has also prosecuted several of the persecuted <a href="http://www.serbianna.com/columns/savich/076.shtml">Bosnian Muslim leaders</a> for war crimes. Even now, the <a href="http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/sarajevo-shuns-recognition-of-bosniak-war-crimes">Bosnian government</a> remains hostile towards turning over Bosnian Muslims who, targeted for genocide and crimes against humanity themselves, stand accused of retaliating in kind. </p>

<p>The example of the Bosnian war serves as an example of the realities of wartime justice. Both sides acted wrongly, both sides continued fighting as international actors balked at intervention, and post-conflict perpetrators were tried for their acts. Not only is the insistence to refer the rebels to the ICC misguided as an impossible political maneuver, it treats possible ICC investigation as an immediate solution to war that it was never intended to embody. If certain members of the Security Council <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/09/25/why-us-should-back-icc-role-syria">refuse to recommend Assad</a> to the ICC, tit-for-tat their counterparts will not serve up the rebels. Yet the larger problem remains&#8212;an emphasis on retributive justice when civilians continue to perish in wartime is like putting the cart before the horse. Documentation of war crimes is essential to ensure judicial and swift prosecution of perpetrators, but the prosecution of perpetrators will not occur until the conflict itself abates. </p>

<p>A similar claim can be made in response to Human Rights Watch's assertions that Turkey is not doing enough to exercise its universal jurisdiction to prosecute rebel war criminals who are camping out on its south-eastern border. A focus on the possibility of exercising universal jurisdiction&#8212;which <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/international-justice/issues/universal-jurisdiction">only 15 nations</a> have exercised since the end of World War II&#8212;again misses Turkey's more pressing humanitarian problem of protecting the half a million refugees it houses and affording them rights designated by the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html">Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees</a>. These rights include free exercise of religion, legal assistance and access to courts, access to elementary education, and access to housing, all of which present difficulties to grant in the southeastern region of Turkey that was largely farmland and open vistas just a few years ago. Turkey is not currently a member of the ICC. Though Turkey has dabbled in the application of universal jurisdiction, it has done so only in the very politically-charged context of seeking to prosecute <a href="http://www.middleeastmonitor.com/reports/by-silvia-nicolaou-garcia/54-universal-jurisdiction-against-israeli-officials">alleged Israeli crimes</a> against humanity, in 2009. If those complaints stalled in the wake of renewed diplomatic efforts to build bilateral goodwill, the prospects of Turkey poking its nose in the affairs of amorphous groups who it generally supports in the fight against Assad seem improbable. Alienating Turkey with accusations of its ineffective border patrol or its devolution into a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/node/119717">"safe haven for human rights abusers"</a> risks jeopardizing the protections the country now grants to refugees, protections which others have praised in comparison to camps on Syria's other borderlands. The changing shape and nature of the opposition rebel groups also means that border patrols who return asylum seekers feared to be engaged in war crimes without sufficient evidence may themselves be liable for violation of Article 33 of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, which prohibits <em>refoulement</em> in cases where a refugee's life or freedom would be threatened in his home country. </p>

<p>It is understandable that the Human Rights Watch report is grasping at the last straws of judicial possibilities to quash the Syrian conflict, unfeasible as they may be. Governments, academics and experts have run through several ideas to end the Syrian conflict, all blessed by under the umbrella of "legal" by international law standards, and the world has bypassed all of them. We could have unraveled the fuzzy concept of right to protect to justify intervention. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/world/middleeast/obama-tests-limits-of-power-in-syrian-conflict.html?pagewanted=all&_r=2&">US</a> and the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2013/08/world/syria-documents/index.html">UK</a> officially maintain that unilateral intervention would be legal, either under humanitarian standards or under reprisal principles for Syria's violation of the international <a href="http://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention/">Chemical Weapons Convention</a>. Several commentators have suggested the possibility of a <a href="http://www.undemocracy.com/A-RES-377%28V%29.pdf">"Unite for Peace"</a> [PDF] resolution passed by the General Assembly to grant authorization to intervene. Turkey has even <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/16/us-syria-crisis-turkey-idUSBRE98F0K920130916">shot down Syrian planes</a> that have entered Turkish airspace, and could have used those incidents as justification for intervention under their right to self-defense. The world had come to the brink of intervention, but we refused to take the leap. Faced now with a chemical weapons withdrawal plan that is patchwork to cover up the hole of declaring chemical weapons a "red line," legal commentators must bow to the political realities that reign supreme. </p>

<p>Does the impotence of the international legal framework (international law of war, Geneva conventions, international tribunals, customary international law) to prevent senseless loss of life in Syria signal a failure on the part of law? It surely indicates the difficulties of abiding by laws that have weaker enforcement mechanisms than domestic law, and enforcement that hinges on strong political considerations which look not only to correcting a current wrong but also extrapolate to future consequences. However, gaming out the possible scenarios for international action in Syria also revealed how expansive our current set of international norms is. Intervention could be justified by at least three different theories of international law. International courts will still have a role to play in post-conflict justice and truth and reconciliation efforts. Even the embattled differences of the P5 did not present an insurmountable roadblock to international legal sanction. International law from the perspective of theory did its part. Now, as the world waits for international actors to pick which of the many legal tools they will use after the chemical weapons retreat experiment, history may serve as a guide. Punishment of war crimes perpetrators will come post-conflict, and in the interim protections must be given to displaced persons who are accessible to ensure that their fundamental rights and freedoms are not lost in the shuffle. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Srishti Miglani, <a href=" http://www.slu.edu/law.xml ">St. Louis University School of Law</a> Class of 2015, discusses the impact of Medicare Expansion...<hr height='1'><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size='3'><strong>T</strong></font>he uninsured cried and the states rejoiced as the "gun to the head" was removed by the US Supreme Court when it held that Congress could not penalize the states by removing all funding for the existing Medicaid programs if the states did not participate in the Medicaid Expansion (Expansion) provision of the <a href="http://http://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/rights/law/patient-protection.pdf">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (PPACA) [PDF]. By clipping the wings of the Expansion provision, the Court left the fate of those Americans, who are too poor to afford health insurance but not poor enough to meet the Medicaid eligibility requirements, to the 50 states.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/rights/law/patient-protection.pdf">expansion provision of the PPACA</a> [PDF] has two main requirements: (1) the states have to expand their Medicaid programs to cover all individuals who are under the age of 65 and earn incomes that fall below 133 percent of the federal poverty level (up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level) and (2) the states have to provide the new Medicaid beneficiaries an "essential health benefits package," which will meet the obligations imposed under the individual mandate. </p>

<p>The controversial section in the provision was <a href="ww.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title42/pdf/USCODE-2010-title42-chap7-subchapXIX-sec1396c.pdf">Section 1396c</a> [PDF], which gave the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) the power to take away all federal Medicaid funds from a state if the state chose not to carry out the PPACA-required Expansion. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf">National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius</a> [PDF], the US Supreme Court saw this penalty as a form of "coercion," leaving the states with no choice but to comply, and held it to be unconstitutional.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that Justice Scalia would have struck down the entire PPACA, he correctly pointed out the crucial role Expansion would play in the lives of 15 million uninsured Americans when he said that the goal of the Expansion, to "provide at least a specified minimum level of coverage for all Americans," was dependent on the participation of all the states and "[i]f any State&#8212;not to mention all of the 26 States that brought this suit&#8212;chose to decline the federal offer, there would be a gaping hole in the ACA's coverage." He noted that there was no other provision in the PPACA that would provide insurance to these Americans and prevent them from "being left out in the cold."</p>

<p>As of October 22, 2013, <a href="http://kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/state-activity-around-expanding-medicaid-under-the-affordable-care-act/">26 states</a> have decided to expand their Medicaid programs and <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2013/10/23/4410230/gov-mccrory-says-north-carolina.html">North Carolina</a> is starting to lean towards Expansion. Besides the noble goal of expanding access to health care to millions of uninsured Americans, there are several other reasons why states have chosen to expand Medicaid or should if they have not done so yet. </p>

<p>First, the <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&id=3801">federal government</a> will pick up the tab for the newly eligible adults enrolling in the state Medicaid programs from 2014 until 2016, followed by 95 percent federal assistance in 2017, 94 percent in 2018, 93 percent in 2019 and 90 percent in 2020 and subsequent years. With the federal government providing a huge incentive for the states to provide health insurance to their poorest segments, many states have joined the bandwagon of the PPACA's goal of reducing the number of uninsured. </p>

<p>Secondly, this influx of money will boost many states' economies by promoting job and income growth. This boost will be further magnified by the money states will save by reducing the amount of uncompensated care. <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/documents/reinvent/medicaid-factsheet-final-2_410672_7.pdf">Michigan</a> [PDF] predicts savings of $320 million in uncompensated care costs and $206 million in General Fund costs in 2014, and these savings will continue to rise as more Michigan residents gain health insurance coverage pursuant to the Expansion. </p>

<p>Third, Expansion will help the safety net of rural hospitals, physicians and urban centers that serve the low-income segments while decreasing cost-shifting. The problem of cost shifting that plagues our health care system starts with emergency room usage by the uninsured, which results in hospitals shifting the cost of that care to the insurance-bearing users, which results in higher premiums borne by taxpayers and businesses. In states like <a href="http://www.acponline.org/about_acp/chapters/nm/medicaid.pdf">New Mexico</a> [PDF], where state and local government pay for 30 percent of the cost of uncompensated care, Expansion will help ease this monetary burden by taking some of the uncompensated care out of the equation. In addition, with the decreasing federal disproportionate share hospital (DSH) <a href="http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20130913/NEWS/309139937">payments</a>, the extra strain on the hospitals serving an inordinate number of low-income Americans will be eased in the states expanding Medicaid. </p>

<p>Lastly, states like North Carolina are contemplating Expansion because of the presumptive eligibility options available to hospitals and other entities under the PPACA. Presumptive eligibility has been used by many states since the 1980s, but the PPACA gives the states the option to allow Medicaid-participating hospitals to conduct presumptive eligibility determinations, even if the state is not using this method for any other populations or settings in the state. Since hospitals will bill the state for caring for patients from the time of the presumptive eligibility determination to the final assessment, there is a fear that in the case of a Medicaid-ineligible person, the state would have to incur the cost of care during that time period. This flawed fear is, for now, driving some states to lean towards Expansion. Whatever the ultimate reason might be, reducing the number of uninsured is every state's goal and Expansion is the means by which states can realistically achieve that goal. </p>

<p>Every great idea has its opponents and so does the PPACA's Expansion provision. The opponents of Expansion argue, among other things, that there is no guarantee that Congress will be able to keep its promise and pay for the newly eligible beneficiaries, thereby leaving the states to bear the costs which they cannot even accurately predict. The Republican ideology and the general attitude of the Red states towards the PPACA&#8212;evident by the stalemate that caused the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/19/us/shutdown-to-cost-us-billions-analysts-say-while-eroding-confidence.html">federal government shutdown</a>, and ironically cost billions of dollars&#8212;have added to the unsubstantiated fears. The states are also afraid that the huge surge in Medicaid enrollment will overburden their budgets despite the federal aid. Only 61.7 percent of the people currently eligible for Medicaid have <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1010866">enrolled</a>, which leaves the other 38.3 percent either not wanting to or unable to enroll. Additionally, states that have the largest numbers of people who will be eligible for Medicaid if the states chose to expand are the ones who traditionally have been the worse at "finding and keeping eligible adults enrolled in Medicaid," and it is even worse in states that require annual eligibility verification. Realistically, the states' fears of newly eligible adults coming "out of the woodwork" to overburden the states' Medicaid programs might be a little exaggerated.</p>

<p>The law does not exist in a vacuum. There exists a constant interplay between law, politics and policy. The law that made it mandatory for states to expand their Medicaid programs was struck down as unconstitutional. The political ideology that divides our nation has traditionally made it difficult for much-needed health care reform to occur and the same politics continues to voice its opposition towards Expansion. Medicaid expansion is a sound policy decision that should be adopted by the states. The indigent segments in many states that lack health insurance and therefore lack affordable health care are waiting to see if their states will put politics aside and start to care about matters of life and death. Let us hope that common sense, sound policy making and a unified goal of giving millions of Americans affordable access to health care will trump the anti-Expansion rhetoric.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.ispu.org/people/Samar%20Warsi">Samar Warsi</a>, a legal fellow at the <a href="http://www.ispu.org/default.aspx">Institute for Social Policy and Understanding</a>, says that courts must closely scrutinize the reach and access the government has to information when crafting Fourth Amendment jurisprudence in the digital age...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n a legal system where <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> protections seem to be eroding, there is hope yet. </p>

                <p>The US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=us+v+katzin&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&case=11853284873538161357&scilh=0">US v. Katzin</a> that police need a warrant before attaching a GPS tracking device onto an individual's vehicle. In 2010, police had a strong suspicion that the Katzin brothers were involved in a number of robberies. To verify this suspicion, police affixed a GPS tracking device onto Harry Katzin's minivan to monitor the vehicle's movement. Shortly thereafter, the tracking device revealed the car was parked for an extended period of time next to a Rite Aid pharmacy. When the van began moving, police followed and stopped the vehicle. All three brothers were found inside along with a number of stolen items from the pharmacy. </p>

                <p>The court emphasized that "a warrantless search is not rendered reasonable merely because probable cause existed that would have justified the issuance of a warrant." In other words, absent highly specialized circumstances, police officers cannot bypass the warrant requirement by later showing that probable cause existed at the time of action. The court dismissed the government's argument that requiring a warrant would improperly burden police work: <blockquote>The government contends that requiring a warrant prior to GPS searches would "seriously impede the government's ability to investigate drug trafficking, terrorism, and other crimes." We fail to see how such a conclusory assertion suffices to except GPS searches from the requirements of the Fourth Amendment's Warrant Clause. Doubtless, we are aware of the dangers posed by terrorism and comparably reprehensible criminal activity. However, we would work a great disservice by permitting the word "terrorism" (in the absence of any other information or circumstance) to act as a skeleton key to the liberties guaranteed under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/">Constitution</a>.</blockquote>Prior to <span class="casename">Katzin</span>, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=us+v+jones&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&case=6122276400056758151&scilh=0">US v. Jones</a>, upon suspecting that a nightclub owner was dealing narcotics, police planted a tracking device on the suspect's car and monitored the vehicle's movement for an entire month without a warrant. The Supreme Court held that using a GPS tracker constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment. However, whether the search required police to obtain a warrant was unclear until now.</p>

                <p>Nowadays, police can collect a vast amount of information without showing probable cause that an individual has likely committed a crime, and they can do it in a perfectly legal manner. Police have access to information that customers voluntarily give to corporations; information through online social networking sites such as Facebook, MySpace and Twitter (in fact, the government can get your tweets even after you delete them through a subpoena) and any files, photos or documents stored on a cloud. In essence, the police can create a legitimate narrative about who you are, what you do and who you associate with through piecing together fragments of your online presence. </p>

                <p>You may be thinking why is the GPS decision important if the government has access to such a wealth of information anyway?  </p>

                <p>It's a matter of principle and autonomy. When it comes to voluntary information, an individual can theoretically choose not to have a cloud, abstain from social media and refuse to give corporations any information. Those choices would be perfectly within an individual's rights and would at least mitigate (not eradicate) the government being able to accumulate information about that individual. If we choose not to leave a digital footprint, the police should not be able to bypass the warrant requirement by collecting that information by simply tracking our movements. </p>

                <p>The <span class="casename">Katzin</span> decision is an important step in establishing ascertainable limits and constraints to Fourth Amendment protections. Given the broad scope of GPS surveillance, warrantless searches have the potential to garner limitless information about individuals. Through a GPS tracker, the police can collect information about who your friends are, where you like to eat, what schools your children attend, your hobbies, which doctor you go to and much more. A warrant requirement provides oversight and curbs the danger of police stockpiling information. </p>

                <p>As technology continues to evolve and become ever expansive, our Fourth Amendment rights are vulnerable to unwarranted government intrusion. In a world where "reasonable expectations of privacy" are constantly changing, how to balance privacy and technology is and will remain an important question. It is precisely the reach and access that the government has to information in the digital age which makes critical examination of privacy laws an important ongoing process. </p>

And, most prominently, a majority of the en banc US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, in its deeply divided and fragmented 165 page opinion in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5727790453942018265">Hobby Lobby Stores Inc. v. Sebelius</a> held to the contrary. <span class="casename">Hobby Lobby</span> is presently before the US Supreme Court on a petition for writ of certiorari filed by the Solicitor General on behalf of Kathleen Sebelius, the Secretary of Health and Human Services. In its response filed October 21, 2013, Hobby Lobby agreed that the Supreme Court should grant the writ and hear the case. With the split in the circuits, numerous district court cases in litigation, and both parties contending it is a matter of great public importance, odds are that the court will grant certiorari for the current term.</p>

<p><span class="casename">Hobby Lobby</span>, <span class="casename">Conestoga Wood</span>, <span class="casename">Autocam</span> and <span class="casename">Eden Foods</span> all involve challenges to the portions of the 2010 <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/rights/law/">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (PPACA) requiring that employers with 50 or more employees provide health care coverage including certain contraceptive methods. While the PPACA does exempt religious employers, these secular for-profit corporations with businesses that many would not identify as religiously-affiliated are not included in that exemption. Instead, these corporations claim their religious freedom rights would be infringed by providing contraceptive coverage to their employees because the corporations&#8212or their shareholders&#8212have Christian beliefs inconsistent with some types of contraception. They argue these beliefs are entitled to protection by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> or by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/chapter-21B">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a> (RFRA). </p>

<p>The standards and history of the First Amendment and RFRA are intertwined. Passed by Congress in 1993 in reaction to the court's opinion in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10098593029363815472">Employment Div., Dept. of Human Res. of Oregon v. Smith</a>, RFRA's purpose was to "restore the compelling interest test" that the court had abandoned in <span class="casename">Smith</span>. When RFRA was challenged as exceeding Congressional power under section 5 of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a>, the court concluded in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8746804851760570747">City of Boerne v. Flores</a> that RFRA was not congruent and proportional to the court's interpretation of the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause as applicable to the states through the liberty clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This means that state laws must be measured by the less rigorous <span class="casename">Smith</span> standard, but federal laws&#8212such as the ACA&#8212may be challenged under RFRA's strict scrutiny standard.   </p>

<p>Yet in order for courts to scrutinize the merits of either a First Amendment or RFRA claim, the entity raising the claim must have the capacity to do so. The First Amendment, unlike the Fourteenth, does not contain the word "person," but instead begins "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," with a subsequent clause protecting "the right of the people peaceably to assemble." The First Amendment also prohibits Congress from "abridging the freedom of ... the press," a provision that has long been applied to corporate media such as newspapers. Additionally, the court's controversial 2010 decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6233137937069871624">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</a>, held that corporate campaign expenditures were protected free speech under the First Amendment. </p>

<p>The text of RFRA, on the other hand, is explicit that it covers "a <em>person's</em> exercise of religion." But this does not mean the statute is necessarily limited to natural persons. Indeed, in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/1/1">1 U.S.C. &#167; 1</a>, Congress has several definitions to apply to all statutes, including "person" (and "whoever") as including "corporations, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies, as well as individuals."  But 1 U.S.C. &#167; 1 is not absolute: its caveat for all definitions is "unless the context indicates otherwise."  </p>

<p>Thus, whether or not the claim is limited to RFRA, as is the question presented by both parties in their petition for writ of certiorari briefs to the US Supreme Court in <u>Hobby Lobby</u> or includes the First Amendment, as in <span class="casename">Conestoga Wood</span>, there are fundamental&#8212and perhaps even existential&#8212quandaries regarding corporatism and religiosity.   </p>

<p>The portrait of a corporation as possessing a religion has several puzzling pieces. First, there is profit. While religious entities such as those involved in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7036734975431570669">Gonzalez v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao Do Vegetal</a> or <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=975414503455261754">Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah</a> were corporations accorded religious rights, they were decidedly nonprofit. Indeed, religious entities are often deemed nonprofit by definition, in common parlance as well as tax codes. But this is a distinction that the majority in the en banc US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit opinion in <span class="casename">Hobby Lobby</span> eschewed; indeed it stated that "sincerely religious persons could find a connection between the exercise of religion and the pursuit of profit." Second, the secular shape of many corporations, such as one with a chain of 150 craft supermarkets such as Hobby Lobby, or one manufacturing high-end kitchen cabinetry such as Conestoga Wood, is ill-suited to sectarianism. There is little, if anything, to alert a consumer or a job applicant that one is engaging with a religious entity. Finally, any completed puzzle balances atop a very slippery slope. If a corporation is exempt from the PPACA's requirement of insurance coverage for certain contraceptives, will it also be exempt from other types of coverage, perhaps related to the pregnancy of an unwed woman or HIV testing and treatment? And why should a corporation not also be allowed to employ only persons possessing a specific religious belief? Or terminate an employee for failure to accord by specific religious practices, as the court deemed constitutional for a religious corporation in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18010264432732834038">Corp. of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v. Amos</a>?  </p>

<p>The picture of a corporation being identical to its shareholders for some purposes but not for others is no less enigmatic. Under what the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in <span class="casename">Conestoga Wood</span> referred to as the "passed through" theory, a corporation could assert the free exercise claims of its shareholders in some circumstances. In rejecting this theory, the court noted that it rested on "erroneous assumptions regarding the very nature of the corporate form" as a distinct legal entity apart from its shareholders. This independent entity insulates shareholders from individual liability, unless the "corporate veil" can be pierced. In asserting religious rights, corporations seek to pierce their own corporate veils for the purposes of some sectarian principles such as contraception coverage for employees, but presumably to keep their protective masks in place regarding personal liability. This would not only allow a corporation and its shareholders to "have it both ways," but again raises the question of limiting principles. Could a corporation terminate an employee because she failed to comply with a religious precept of the corporation&#8212for example, submission to male authority&#8212but cocoon its owners from personal liability for damages for employment discrimination? And what is the importance of the tax status of the corporation? The concurring judge necessary to the two judge majority in the DC Circuit's opinion in <span class="casename">Gilardi</span>, wrote separately to "emphasize the importance of the Freshway Corporation's election to be taxed under subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code."</p>

<p>Ultimately, how one views the "context" of the meaning of "person" in RFRA or the ability of a corporation to assert a free exercise of religion right is not about constitutional doctrine or statutory construction. And it may not even be about religion. As the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit opinion in <span class="casename">Eden Foods</span> noted, although the corporation's founder and sole shareholder Michael Potter claimed that his "deeply held religious beliefs" prevented him from supporting "contraception, abortion, and abortifacients" as procedures that "almost always involve immoral and unnatural practices," his statements outside of litigation painted a very different portrait. The court quoted from one of the several interviews Potter gave to a reporter <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/04/15/eden_foods_ceo_digs_himself_deeper_in_birth_control_outrage/">published</a> in salon.com, in which Mr. Potter stated that he had "more interest in good quality long underwear" than "in birth control pills," although he pursued the litigation because "I'm a man, number one."  When pressed, he continued that he didn't care if the federal government was telling him to buy "Jack Daniel's or birth control," asking "What gives them the right to tell me that I have to do that?"  </p>

<p>This is not to conclude that all of the corporate shareholders involved in challenging the contraceptive coverage requirement for health insurance do not possess sincerely held religious beliefs related to attenuated participation in an employee's reproductive choices. But the statements by Eden Food's founder&#8212characterized by the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit as a "laissez-faire, anti-government screed" and which might also be described as sexist and anti-worker&#8212are important pieces of the puzzle. If a corporation can have a religion, is it a coincidence that its most deeply held and sincere beliefs are in opposition to equality and democracy?</p>

Technology has revolutionized our everyday life. Everybody is going digital. Nowadays if you have a pressing question, you just need to Google it. Facebook and Twitter are slowly overtaking the mainstream media. Organizations are leveraging on technology to differentiate themselves in the market. Lawyers should not be left behind. Law schools should not be left behind. </p>

<p>In the US, the American Bar Association amended its <a href="http://www.abajournal.com/files/20120808_house_action_compilation_redline_105a-f.pdf">model rules</a> [PDF] in 2012 to require that lawyers should keep abreast with technology as a component of competent representation. In Kenya, the <a href="http://www.judiciary.go.ke/portal/assets/downloads/reports/Judiciary's Tranformation Framework-fv.pdf">Judicial Transformation Framework</a> (2012-2016) has recognized the "harnessing of technology as an enabler of justice." The Kenyan judiciary seeks to automate judicial operations by digitizing court records, establishing an electronic case management system and ensuring the digital recording and transcription of proceedings. In fact, the judiciary would like to establish a text message-based inquiry system to inform members of the public about the status of their cases. </p>

<p>In Kenya, technology is one of the pillars set to transform the economy. The current government <a href="http://www.nation.co.ke/oped/blogs/A+sober+take+on+laptops+for+class+one+pupils/-/634/1851296/-/format/xhtml/-/gbedhdz/-/index.html">pledged</a> a laptop to every pupil joining class one. Technology is transforming various sectors including the education sector. Law schools should not be left behind. </p>

<p>Law is a research oriented course. It is said that a good lawyer is the one who knows where to find the law. However, you have to find this law somewhere. Law students can play a critical role in developing legal content. Currently, law schools and lawyers in Kenya rely on cases published by the National Council for Law Reporting. This is a semi-autonomous state agency whose role is to publish the <a href="http://www.kenyalaw.org/kl/">Kenyan Law reports</a>. Its mission is to "transform legal information into public knowledge." The mandate of this body is to publish the judicial opinions of the superior courts of record. Although the decisions of the subordinate courts and quasi-judicial tribunals have no binding value, they can play a crucial role in shaping the persuasive legal jurisprudence. The law schools can explore avenues of collaboration with the National Council for Law Reporting so that law students can assist in coming up with case briefs for previously decided cases. This will not only mould the law students into excellent legal writers but also expose them to a wide array of legal subjects. </p>

<p>It is common for law schools in Kenya to require students to write a dissertation. Every law student is assigned a supervisor who guides the student in writing the dissertation. There is a wide breadth of research which has been carried out for many years since the law schools were established. However, this dissertation requirement is just that: a requirement. Students carry out the research, print it, bind it and submit it to the law school. It is then archived and dust, rather than future researchers, becomes the dissertation's best friend. Going forward, it is imperative that this knowledge is transformed into usable form. By using technology, law schools can easily develop a legal research database where the dissertations written by the law students are deposited. This will give legal researchers and the consuming public access to wide legal literature. It will become easier for law schools to subscribe to legal databases such as Lexis Nexis to enhance the research experience of the law students. The students will have access to a wide variety of legal content including polished legal commentaries, legal journals and other secondary materials. It will minimize the risk of carrying out shallow research and over-relying on antiquated books to carry out research. It will also be easier to enforce the originality requirement since supervisors can easily track any plagiarized content. </p>

<p>The "Tablets Project" between the University of Pittsburgh and Moi University is laudable. The project aims at providing computer tablet devices to all the law students in Moi University. The first batch of computer tablets has already been shipped from Haiti (where they were being manufactured) to Kenya. The tablets will help introduce a participatory legal pedagogy where learning of the law is driven by the law students as opposed to dictation of notes by the lecturers. Law schools in Kenya mostly rely on the traditional lecturing style. It is common for law students to take the dictated notes, memorize them and then "download" them in the examinations. Technology can help transform legal pedagogy from this sorry state of affairs to a system inspired by quality legal analysis and reasoning. It will be possible for the law professors to share legal materials with the law students by for instance, using online course webs. Therefore, law students will be able to prepare well ahead and synthesize the legal materials before class room discussions.  </p>

<p>By using technology, it will be easier to administer law school examinations. It is quite tedious when a law professor has to read one thousand handwritten exam scripts with scores of arguments and previously decided cases. The professor is compelled to juggle between the legibility of the essay and the quality of reasoning in the same essay. Exam takers will immensely benefit from technology. With practice, it is far easier to type a legal essay than hand write it. Let us face the reality. The pen is mighty. However, as the Kenyan judiciary moves towards digital recording of proceedings and transcription, the pen is losing relevance in judicial circles. In the private sector, you will not find a client who would want handwritten deliverables. </p>

<p>There is an ongoing debate as to whether, in light of technological advancements, distance learning in legal education should be considered by law schools. A <a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/plp/pdf/Distance_Learning_in_Legal_Ed.pdf">blue paper</a> [PDF] by the Working Group for Distance Learning arising out of discussions held at the Harvard Law School notes that, when well designed and delivered, distance learning provides student outcomes at par or even superior to those of traditional in-class teaching. The ABA <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/legaled/standards/20072008StandardsWebContent/Chapter_3.authcheckdam.pdf">Standard 306</a> [PDF] allows credit for distance education if there is ample interaction with the instructor and other students both inside and outside the formal structure of the course. The Standard recognizes that education could be offered by way of technological transmission. All in all, law schools in Kenya should leverage on technology to improve the quality of legal education. </p>

<p>Law schools should consider carrying out transcription of all the lectures. When lectures are recorded, students will find it easier to revise the content delivered in class. Therefore, if a student missed out on something in class, he is able to listen to the transcribed lectures to catch up with the rest of his colleagues. Students have different abilities in taking notes and listening. Students could then use speech recognition software in turning the lectures into text if they so desire. </p>

<p>In conclusion, it is important that technology is ingrained in the legal curriculum right from the training stage. This initiative will require the collaborative efforts of the students, lecturers and other stakeholders. Law students are using technology to carry out most of their affairs in their lives and legal education should not be treated in a different manner.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.uiowa.edu/faculty/andy-grewal.php">Andy Grewal</a> of the University of Iowa College of Law says that the oral arguments in <span class="casename">US v. Woods</span> suggest that the Supreme Court is more interested in a jurisdictional issue, and discusses an argument, which neither party addressed, that could be dispositive of the jurisdictional question ...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/andygrewal.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>W</strong></font>hen the government filed its petition for certiorari in <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-to-rules-on-new-affirmative-action-issue.php">United States v. Woods</a>, it hoped that the US Supreme Court would reverse the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit after that court held the "basis overstatement" tax penalty does not apply to certain tax shelters. Although the Supreme Court granted the government's petition, the <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-tax-forum-issues.php">oral arguments </a>in the case suggest that the court is much more interested in another issue&#8212;whether the district court enjoyed jurisdiction to consider the penalty in the first instance. However, the court and the parties overlooked a key issue that could be dispositive of that jurisdictional question.  </p>

<p>In <span class="casename">Woods</span>, the taxpayers engaged in so-called COBRA tax shelters, engineered to create massive tax losses. As part of the shelters, the taxpayers contributed property to two partnerships, and the partnerships also assumed some of their liabilities. Under their reading of the case law, the taxpayers believed that their transactions created more than $45 million of basis in their partnership interests, even though their economic outlay was only around $1 million. That $45 million of basis was then eventually used by the taxpayers to generate deductible losses on their returns. (Basis is the measuring stick for determining whether a taxpayer has a gain or loss on the sale of property, so if a taxpayer inflates his basis in property, he can create a tax loss.)  </p>

<p>The government believed that the COBRA shelters violated the judge-made economic substance doctrine, under which courts will disregard transactions that are solely motivated by tax benefits or which accomplish nothing other than the creation of tax benefits. At trial, the district court accepted the government's arguments and denied the taxpayers' claimed losses. Because their transactions were disregarded, the taxpayers actually had $0 of basis in their partnership interests, and they could not claim losses using the $45 million basis figure.</p>

<p>Aside from the denial of their claimed losses, the taxpayers also faced the government's imposition of the basis overstatement penalty. <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6662">Section 6662</a> imposes a 20 percent penalty on any understatement of a tax liability "attributable to" a basis overstatement. The penalty increases to 40 percent for particularly egregious overstatements (that is, when the claimed basis is 400 percent or more of the property's true basis).  At trial, the government argued that the 40 percent penalty applied, because the taxpayers claimed a $45 million and their true basis was $0.</p>

<p>But following Fifth Circuit precedent, the district court rejected the government's position. In <span class="casename">Woods</span>, the taxpayers ultimately understated their tax liabilities because the transactions they undertook lacked economic substance, not because they inflated their basis. Thus, their understatement was not "attributable to" a basis overstatement, as required to trigger the Section 6662 penalty.</p>

<p>A majority of circuits, however, have found that the overstatement penalty can apply to COBRA and similar transactions lacking economic substance. In light of this circuit split, and with the hope that the Supreme Court would adopt the majority position, the government filed a petition for certiorari.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court agreed not only to address the question presented in the government's petition, but also directed the parties to address whether the district court, in a TEFRA proceeding, actually enjoyed jurisdiction to consider whether the basis overstatement applies.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, a TEFRA proceeding applies to disputes over partnership items. If, for example, 100 persons form a partnership and there is an issue about whether the partnership reported its income correctly, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) would not have to litigate the issue against every single partner individually. The TEFRA procedures allow for a unified litigation proceeding, in which a court's holding on the partnership item (the determination of the partnership's income) would bind all the partners.  </p>

<p>However, if a tax issue relates to a nonpartnership item&#8212;essentially, something specific to each partner&#8212;then litigation must proceed through separate, partner-level lawsuits, or "non-TEFRA proceedings."</p>

<p>Section 6226(f) specifically grants jurisdiction to consider penalties in a TEFRA proceeding when that penalty "relates to" a partnership item. Thus, TEFRA proceedings involve not only the determination of partnership items, but penalties that relate to those items. However, when the applicability of a penalty is determined in a TEFRA proceeding, that may impose hardships on individual partners, because they enjoy no immediate opportunity to present individual defenses to the penalty. Instead, they must pay the penalty first and then seek a refund of the penalty paid. In other words, when penalties relate to a partnership item, the TEFRA proceedings establish a "pay first, fight later" rule.</p>

<p>If, however, the applicability of a penalty does not relate to a partnership item, a court in a TEFRA proceeding cannot determine whether that penalty applies. Thus, penalties related to nonpartnership items must be determined through multiple non-TEFRA proceedings against individual partners.  </p>

<p>In <span class="casename">Woods</span>, all parties agreed that the district court enjoyed jurisdiction to determine whether the partnership must be disregarded under the economic substance doctrine. But whether the basis overstatement penalty relates to that determination&#8212;such that jurisdiction was proper&#8212;reflected a source of disagreement.  </p>

<p>Usually, a partner's basis in his partnership interest (his "outside basis") is not a partnership item, and disputes over his outside basis, or penalties related to the inflation of that basis, would be examined in a non-TEFRA proceeding. For example, if Adam bought a partnership interest, his outside basis would generally be equal to the amount he paid for that interest. If the basis overstatement penalty potentially applied to Adam (perhaps because when he sold his interest he inflated his outside basis), a determination of his true basis and the applicability of any penalty would be addressed in a non-TEFRA proceeding. The taxpayers in <span class="casename">Woods</span> argue that penalties related to the inflation of their outside bases should similarly be determined in non-TEFRA proceedings.  </p>

<p>Under the government's view, however, the basis overstatement penalty potentially applies only because the partners' outside bases were reduced from $45 million to $0, and that reduction naturally follows from the finding that the partnership did not exist.  Viewed this way, the applicability of the basis overstatement penalty "relates to" a partnership item (the existence of the partnership), and was properly considered in the district court's TEFRA proceeding. Although this view seems faithful to the statute's "relate to" language, the only two circuit courts to have considered the issue have rejected the government's arguments.</p>

<p>Oral argument in <span class="casename">Woods</span> did not provide any strong indication of the justices' views on either the jurisdictional or merits issues. Rather, the justices spent almost all of the time at oral argument simply trying to understand the statutory framework. Justice Breyer admitted that the jurisdictional question left him "genuinely confused," a feeling that anyone grappling with the TEFRA provisions is prone to experience. Justice Scalia, showing his affinity for statutory interpretation questions of even the most painful sort, repeatedly emphasized that the wording of the statute seemed to support the government's position and seemed skeptical of the taxpayers' arguments. Little time was left for either the government or the taxpayers to argue the merits question.</p>

<p>The confusion seen in the <span class="casename">Woods</span> oral arguments leaves one wondering whether the court's consideration of the jurisdictional question may have been premature. That question continues to be relevant in various ongoing proceedings, and the court might have benefited from further judicial analysis of the issues or some scholarly commentary on the subject. In fact, in <span class="casename">Woods</span>, neither the government nor the taxpayers addressed an issue that could be dispositive of the jurisdictional question.</p>

<p>Under the tax code, TEFRA proceedings generally apply only to real partnerships. Fake partnerships, like those created by the Woods taxpayers, are generally not subject to TEFRA. However, under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6233">Section 6233</a>, if a fake partnership files a partnership tax return, the TEFRA procedures will apply "to the extent provided in regulations." That is, TEFRA proceedings can apply to fake partnerships only if the US Department of the Treasury (Treasury) issues regulations under Section 6233 extending that treatment.</p>

<p>Although Congress enacted Section 6233 in 1984, no final regulations actually existed in 1999, when the taxpayers in <span class="casename">Woods</span> engaged in the COBRA shelters. That is, the extension of TEFRA to fake partnerships turns on the existence of legitimate regulations, but the Treasury did not actually issue final regulations until 2001, and those regulations apply only prospectively.</p>

<p>Before 2001, the Treasury issued had proposed regulations under Section 6233 and solicited comment on those regulations. However, although the public submitted comments on those regulations, in 1987 the Treasury decided to issue "temporary" regulations that did not respond to comments. Instead, the Treasury stated that its proposed regulations would "be finalized in due course with any changes that may be made as a result of comments received," and the temporary regulations were issued simply to provide "immediate guidance to partners and partnership."  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Treasury did not heed its promise to promptly incorporate public comments, and the 1987 temporary regulations lingered on the books until 2001. By 1999, these temporary regulations were likely invalid and could not extend TEFRA jurisdiction to fake partnerships. As the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit observed in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16630481019436283721">Tedori v. United States</a>, the government can offer "[n]o explanation ... as to why such a 'temporary regulation,' issued in 1987 shortly after enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, should remain 'temporary' well over a decade later."  </p>

<p>Although the Ninth Circuit did not squarely hold that a "temporary" regulation lacks force after sitting on the shelf for more than a decade, that conclusion seems inevitable after the Supreme Court's decision in <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/supreme-court-denies-tax-exemption-for-medical-residents.php">Mayo Foundation for Medical Research v. United States</a>. In <span class="casename">Mayo</span>, the court announced that the tax law is subject to the same administrative law doctrines and standards that apply to any other area of federal law. And in every other area of law, it is quite clear that a federal agency cannot ignore notice and comment requirements, issue a regulation in "temporary" form, and then adversely invoke that regulation against the public a decade later.  </p>

<p>The taxpayers in <span class="casename">Woods</span> thus might have been expected to, but did not, raise the argument that the procedural irregularities regarding the Section 6233 temporary regulations defeated the government's jurisdictional argument. Instead, the taxpayers accepted that validity of those regulations, even though a large body of scholarly commentary and some case law casts serious doubt on the temporary regulations. If the court accepts the assumptions of the parties, its holding could extend far beyond TEFRA matters and could scale back <span class="casename">Mayo</span>'s rejection of tax exceptionalism. This would give the Treasury significant leeway to skirt the notice and comment procedures that other federal agencies must dutifully observe.</p>

Robinson of <a href="http://www.aarp.org/aarp-foundation/our-work/legal-advocacy/">AARP Foundation Litigation</a> discuss the implications of the US Supreme Court's future ruling in <span class="casename">Heimeshoff v. Hartford Life Insurance</a>...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="left" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/maryellensignorille.jpg" width="120" height="200" align="left" hspace="0" vspace="0"></td><td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height='1' width='5'></TD></tr><tr><img src="/images/s.gif" height=1 width=1></td></tr><tr><td><img src="/hotline/katerobinson.jpg" align=left hspace=0 vspace=0></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height=1 width=5></td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><br><font size="3"><strong>E</strong></font>very <a href="http://www.dol.gov/compliance/guide/erisa.htm">RISA-covered employee benefit plan</a> must establish a process for internal appeals of adverse benefit determinations. Whenever a plan administrator rejects a participant's claim for benefits due under an ERISA plan, Congress <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/1133">requires</a> the plan to provide the participant with adequate written notice of the denial, setting forth the specific reasons for such denial and written in a manner calculated to be understood by the participant. The participant must be afforded a "reasonable opportunity" following notice of denial to seek a "full and fair review" of the denied claim in accordance with the procedures for administrative appeals spelled out in the plan document. This statutory mandate allegedly promotes a non-adversarial form of dispute resolution that allows both plans and participants to avoid the time and costs otherwise associated with litigating the issue in federal court.</p>

                <p>As a corollary to this requisite process&#8212;as applied in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16406262093337638933">Fallick v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co.</a>&#8212;virtually all courts impose an additional requirement of exhaustion on plan participants. Participants are required to exhaust the administrative remedies provided under an ERISA plan before suing for benefits wrongfully denied. Courts generally view the required process for internal review of denied claims as the statutory basis justifying the requirement of exhaustion. The judicially-created exhaustion requirement has reduced the number of benefit claims filed in the federal courts each year. A principal advantage of exhaustion is to allow the parties to develop a factual record to submit in court should internal resolution of the dispute prove impossible.</p>

                <p>The US Supreme Court is currently faced with a statute of limitations issue that could undermine the purpose and benefits of exhaustion if the justices decide to rule in favor of the respondent. In <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-affirmative-action-suing-foreign-corporations.php">Heimeshoff v. Hartford Life Insurance</a>, the court must decide when a contractual statute of limitations period for judicial review of an adverse disability benefit determination begins to run. The case concerns an accrual provision contained in an ERISA plan that sets the beginning of the limitations period near the start of the internal appeals process. When Julie Heimeshoff received her final denial letter, she had approximately one year to seek judicial review before the statute of limitations under her plan expired. The limitations period set by the plan began to run on an accrual date that had passed while Heimeshoff was in the midst of an administrative appeal. Unfortunately, she failed to file her lawsuit within the allotted time period. However, had the plan calculated the statute of limitations using an accrual date that was set at the date of the final denial letter, her lawsuit would have been timely filed.</p>

                <p>At oral argument on October 15, 2013, the petitioner and the government argued for a bright-line rule that the clock should begin to run when a participant receives a final notice of denial after exhausting the remedial procedures available under the plan. The respondent disagreed, arguing that the ourt should eschew any bright-line rule in favor of a case-by-case approach. According to the respondent, an implied "reasonableness" term should be read into ERISA plan documents. In contrast to the petitioner, the respondent urged the justices to find that the time between the accrual date and the expiration of the limitations period need only be "reasonable" as based on the facts and circumstances underlying the case.</p>

                <p>Both of these positions require a court to rewrite the plan document. Under the petitioner's argument, the court must change the accrual date; under the respondent's argument, the court must infer a reasonableness provision. We believe that there are fundamental problems with the respondent's argument and that the petitioner's position is more consistent with ERISA's policies. An important objective of ERISA is to facilitate consistent and predictable administration of plan benefits. A fundamental problem with the respondent's approach is that it contradicts this statutory goal.</p>

                <p>A reasonableness rule is unfaithful to the statutory goal of ERISA because it lacks a fixed date of accrual, leaving participants in the dark as to how long they have to file suit. Even where a plan provides for an accrual date as well as a limitations period, a participant is unable to know whether the provision will actually control since its enforceability will depend on the length of the administrative process and whether the period of time between the end of that process and the last day to file a lawsuit is adjudged as reasonable. As a result, a participant will be unable to resort to the plan document to determine exactly how long remains to file suit because a "reasonable" period of time will vary from person to person and from court to court. Participants who are aware that they have missed the contractual deadline will also be discouraged from filing suit, despite the possibility that a judge may decide to extend the limitations period to a more "reasonable" expiration date. Others will presumably decide to gamble their money on a lawsuit, crossing their fingers that the judge will agree that the complaint was filed within a "reasonable" time.</p>

                <p>An implied reasonableness term is furthermore at odds with ERISA's remedial structure and the exhaustion requirement. On the one hand, the requirement of exhaustion is designed to avoid litigation. A reasonableness term may lead to more legal fees and more litigation in the federal courts as plan administrators and participants argue over what should be deemed "reasonable" under a particular set of facts. As counsel for petitioner correctly noted, asking courts to police the enforceability of a limitations period before reaching the question of whether the benefits were properly denied will undermine the intended nature of benefits administration as a private, straightforward and streamlined process.</p>

                <p>On the other hand, a decision to adopt the respondent's approach will give employers incentives that are perverse to the spirit of exhaustion. At argument, counsel for the respondent noted that the process of internal appeal takes approximately 12 months to complete in most cases. If the court chooses to adopt a threshold test of reasonableness, there will unfortunately be those plans (not at issue here) that take advantage of this implied reasonableness by delaying resolution of benefit claims past the usual twelve months time frame in attempt to deprive a participant of his or her day in court. The plan administrator under these circumstances may be encouraged to delay a decision until the last possible day, or to make a series of superfluous requests for information to extend the administrative process as long as possible. If the plan sets the proof of loss to the initial denial of claim benefits and the mandates a one year period to file suit, then a participant may have only a period of six months or less to decide to sue, hire a lawyer and file his or her complaint.</p>

                <p>We first note that ERISA is silent on a statute of limitations for benefit claims denial in contrast to a specific limitations and accrual period for fiduciary breach claims. At the recent "<a href="http://earlemacklaw.drexel.edu/news/articles/overview/2013/October/ERISA-symposium-10292013/#.UopakdI3v3s">ERISA at 40: An Oral History of ERISA</a>" symposium at the Earle Mack School of Law at Drexel University, Robert Nagle, who was the general counsel to the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare when ERISA was enacted, was asked the reason why Congress did not include a statute of limitations for benefit claims. His simple answer: we forgot. He explained that after President Richard Nixon's resignation in August 1974, President Gerald Ford wanted to sign a "labor" bill on Labor Day; the only bill far enough along in the process was ERISA. He said that the committees had three weeks to finish the bill and did not have sufficient time to polish its provisions.  </p>

                <p>As a reminder that the facts of a case always matter, some of the justices were not sympathetic to Heimsehoff inasmuch as she had one year to timely file her lawsuit. However, other justices, particularly Chief Justice John Roberts, seemed concerned that the respondent's resolution would task courts with making determinations of reasonableness. It appeared that his preference at least would be a clean bright line test. Roberts and Justice Stephen Breyer were also hesitant to agree with the respondent that in lieu of a bright-line rule, the doctrines of equitable estoppel or equitable tolling could be invoked as a remedy by participants who miss contractual deadlines for filing suit. Breyer implied that we made up exhaustion, we can make this up too.</p>

                <p>An interesting line of questions concerned the authority of the Department of Labor (DOL) to issue a regulation specifically designating an accrual date or for that matter a statute of limitations period. Although all the parties responded in the affirmative, it would be unusual for an agency to proscribe an accrual rule which is generally a judge made rule. However, the DOL has other options. As a part of its authority to regulate full and fair claim procedures under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/29/2560.503-1">ERISA Section 503</a>, it might state that any limitations period is tolled during the time it takes a participant or beneficiary to exhaust the claim procedure. Alternatively, it could also amend the claim procedure regulations to require plan administrators to unambiguously disclose in the final denial letter the specific date by which the participant must file an action in federal court. The DOL could also state that disclosure is required only if the accrual date is other than the date of the final denial letter. More generically, but less helpful to participants, DOL could amend the summary plan description regulations to direct plan administrators to specifically and understandably disclose when causes of action accrue and the limitations period for bringing an action in federal court.<br />
                    <br />
                    Unlike most oral arguments, where the lines seem starkly drawn, this was not one of those cases. Regardless of the outcome, we predict that this issue is now on the list of issues the Department of Labor may include in a revised claims regulation. Watch that space. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.gwu.edu/Faculty/profile.aspx?id=11219">Neil H. Buchanan</a></a>, of The George Washington University School of Law, says that Congressional failure to properly address the debt ceiling puts the Executive in an impossible situation with grave risks ...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/neilbuchanan.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>L</strong></font>ast month, for the third time in a little more than two years, the US was on the brink of economic catastrophe, due to the threat that Republicans in Congress would not vote to increase the debt ceiling. Each time that the country has reached the brink of disaster, people have wondered whether there was some way for the President to <a href="/forum/2011/07/davis-duff-ware-debt-ceiling.php">prevent a default</a>, even if Republicans in Congress refused to cooperate to allow the nation to pay its bills.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, those conversations were almost universally couched in the language of having the president "act on his own," or "side-step Congress," or "freelance" in response to Republican obstructionism. The reality, however, is that the president would be forced by congressional inaction to ignore at least one of Congress's laws. He would have no choice in the matter, because Congress would have put him in the position of trying to reconcile laws that are irreconcilable. There would, under those circumstances, be no way for the president to say, "Presented with no good choices, I choose to do nothing."</p>

<p>The debt ceiling law purports to limit the government's total obligations to a specific dollar amount. The only circumstances in which that law would be relevant, however, are when the president would otherwise be required to borrow more than the debt ceiling statute allows. For example, if Congress had passed taxing laws requiring the president to collect $2 trillion this year, and it had passed spending laws requiring the president to spend $2.5 trillion, the president could only fulfill his executive duties by borrowing the five hundred billion dollar difference. If we had already reached the debt ceiling, however, then the president would be unable to obey all of Congress's dictates.</p>

<p>In research published over the last year in three articles in the Columbia Law Review (<a href="http://www.columbialawreview.org/how-to-choose-the-lease-unconstitutional-option/">one</a>, <a href="http://www.columbialawreview.org/nullifying-the-debt-ceiling-threat-once-and-for-all-why-the-president-should-embrace-the-least-unconstitutional-option/">two</a>, and <a href="http://www.columbialawreview.org/bargaining-in-the-shadow-of-the-debt-ceiling-when-negotiating-over-spending-and-tax-laws-congress-and-the-president-should-consider-the-debt-ceiling-a-dead-letter/">three</a>), Professor Michael Dorf and I analyzed what the Constitution requires the president to do if he is ever faced with such a "trilemma:" taxing, spending, and debt ceiling laws that do not add up.</p>

<p>Stated this way, it becomes obvious that the president would have no "do nothing" escape hatch. The nature of the trilemma forces him to make a choice. If he tries to honor two of the laws in question, he will necessarily violate the third law. For example, if he tried to spend as much as Congress specified in its spending laws, but he also refused to issue debt above the ceiling, he would then be forced to collect more in taxes than Congress specified.</p>

<p>Some commentators have focused on an <a href="http://www.dorfonlaw.org/2013/09/the-prompt-payment-act-meaning-of.html">argument</a> based on the "public spending clause" of Section 4 of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a>. Although I find that argument persuasive, the people who are not persuaded by it have failed to understand that, even without a Fourteenth Amendment challenge, the president would still face a trilemma, and he would thus have to choose which of Congress's laws not to execute.</p>

<p>Professor Dorf and I have argued that separation-of-powers concerns would require a president to choose what we call the "least unconstitutional option," under which the president would issue debt in excess of the ceiling. But how could this be so? How can the president simply "blow through" the debt ceiling, as some have characterized it?</p>

<p>The president, even if put into an impossible position by Congress, is still obligated to preserve Congress's role as the legislative body under the Constitution. If the president faces a trilemma, he must base his choice on two constitutional criteria: He must (1) exercise as little legislative power as possible, and (2) do so in such a way that allows Congress later to enact legislation that can undo his actions, if it so desires.</p>

<p>No other scholars have offered alternative criteria to ours, nor has anyone ever argued that our criteria are deficient in any way. And this is for good reason: The core structural innovation of the Constitution is the separation of powers. If we want to preserve the Constitution, we must require the president to act as modestly as possible, rather than allowing him to act like a "legislature of one."</p>

<p>Bizarrely, the shared assumption among Republicans and Democrats alike has been that the president must simply default on the government's spending obligations, if he is ever faced with a trilemma. That is, if we reach the debt ceiling, politicians on both sides of the aisle have simply taken for granted that the president would refuse to pay bills as they come due. As the White House put it repeatedly this fall, the only alternative to increasing the debt ceiling would be to default on spending obligations.</p>

<p>The reason that this is so bizarre is that it simply presumes that duly-enacted spending laws can be ignored by the president. They cannot. We are not talking about choosing to increase or decrease future levels of spending, after all. We are, instead, contemplating having the president refuse to honor legal claims for payment from the federal government, choosing not to pay the government's legal obligations, in full, on the date that they are due.</p>

<p>Whether the victim of such a default is the holder of a treasury bond who is owed an interest payment, or a hospital that has provided services to a Medicare patient, or a contractor that is owed a payment on a government project, the government owes the money on the date due, because Congress has previously passed spending laws that the president is required to enforce.</p>

<p>Therefore, if the president were to start to decide whom to pay, to "prioritize," in Washington parlance, he would be usurping Congress's most fundamental responsibility, which is to decide how to balance competing demands on the federal purse. When Congress passes spending laws, it does so as the result of a fragile coalition of interested parties, all of whom wish that they could have secured more funding for their favored priorities. The very essence of legislating involves making difficult choices and striking balances. For the president to substitute his priorities over Congress's is to usurp a fundamental power under the Constitution.</p>

<p>By contrast, if the president were to issue additional debt, his action would honor Congress's priorities regarding spending. He would not "spend as much as he wants," as some have tried to describe it. He would only spend exactly as much as Congress ordered, in the amounts and proportions that emerged from the legislative process. If Congress later decides that it really and truly wants the debt to be at a particular level, it retains the power to set future spending and taxation levels to achieve its goal.</p>

<p>It is possible, indeed, it is likely, that the financial markets would treat the additional debt with suspicion. That would almost surely mean that the new debt would require a higher interest rate. That, however, is not a legal argument, but rather an observation that if Republicans in Congress ever go through with their threats to create a trilemma, they will have imposed unnecessary costs on the American people. The increased interest payments will be the manifestation of an entirely political strategy gone terribly wrong.</p>

<p>Sane people understand that holding the debt ceiling hostage is no way to govern. Telling the president to rewrite the spending laws that Congress itself passed is to ask the president to take on too much power. If faced with a trilemma, he must do the least damage possible. That would mean that the president must honor Congress's will regarding taxing and spending by taking on the debt that is required to carry out Congress's orders. If Congress does not like that, it retains the power to do something about it, through the legislative process enshrined in the Constitution.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Alfred Williams, Jr., <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/academics/graduate/law">St. John's University School of Law</a> Class of 2014, is the author of the seventh article in a 10-part series from the staffers of the <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/academics/graduate/law/journals_activities/jcred">Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development</a>. Williams explores issues with New York City's current land use procedure and offers a possible solution...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="Williams.jpg" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Williams.jpg" width="120" height="114" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>D</strong></font>ecisions concerning land-use often have impacts that resonate throughout the community. These types of high-stakes decisions can be extremely difficult for local officials who are attempting to balance competing interests. In New York City, community boards are also involved in land-use decision making, adding an additional layer of complexity. These community boards emerged in the 1950s and quickly gained momentum until the city amended its <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/charter/downloads/pdf/citycharter2004.pdf">charter</a> [PDF] and created the <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/pdf/luproc/lur.pdf">Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP)</a> [PDF] to: (1) increase public participation in reviewing land-use applications; and (2) increase efficiency in processing such applications.</p>

<p>However, the ULURP has fallen short in achieving those objectives. Although the community board is involved in land-use decision making, its authority is limited to preliminary non-binding recommendations. In contrast, during the later stages of ULURP review, the City Planning Commission (CPC) and City Council are empowered to make binding project modifications.</p>

<p>Proponents of this current structure may find it appropriate in light of the duties and responsibilities designated to members of each representative body. Whereas community board members are unpaid volunteers and advocate strictly for neighborhood interests, CPC members are appointed and play a comprehensive role in the city's overall growth and development. Accordingly, proponents argue, the CPC is better situated to present binding project modifications to the City Council for final approval.</p>

<p>However, when the CPC and City Council fail to consider the input of the community board, local residents often become disgruntled, and are able and willing to challenge the legality of the ULURP determination. In fact, a number of community interest groups recently have challenged municipal land-use decisions, increasing the burden on court dockets and interfering with development efforts that stimulate the local economy. For example, community groups have recently challenged, among other development projects, the Hudson Yards, Atlantic Terminal, new Yankee Stadium and expansion of New York University (NYU)'s campus.</p>

<p>Most recently, on July 25, 2012, the City Council, by a near-unanimous vote, approved a project to allow NYU to expand its campus by six million square feet.  The project, known as NYU 2031, was estimated to add ten thousand jobs and $1.1 billion in taxes to the local economy. However, prior to approval, Community Board 2 (CB2) recommended, by a unanimous vote, that the city reject NYU 2031. Speaking on behalf of New York's historic Greenwich Village, CB2 voiced concerns about the project's impact on the historic Bohemian character of the neighborhood.</p>

<p>In response to the City Council's approval, local groups filed a petition asking the court to overturn the decision on the grounds of abuse of discretion. Such legal action will likely put the project on hold for months and cost the city and underfunded groups tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees.</p>

<p>To avoid these inefficiencies, all ULURP participants should collaborate when making binding project modifications. Working together, participants would have to consider recommendations made by all stakeholders during the decision-making process, decreasing the need for subsequent legal action. Additionally, the process would be more efficient because it would eliminate the current need for a 60-day non-binding review period designated strictly for the community board. </p>

<p>If the parties are unable to reach a collective resolution, they should be required to mediate prior to litigating the issue. An experienced mediator could: (1) help identify and understand opposing interests; (2) avoid the prospect of contentious litigation; (3) alleviate some burden on court dockets; (4) reduce and/or eliminate litigation costs; and (5) increase the ULURP's internal capacity to manage conflict.</p>

<p>With real estate development on the rise in New York's recovering economic landscape, officials are certain to make critical decisions regarding land use.  To put these officials in the best position to make such decisions, the ULURP should be reformed, according to this proposal, to increase public participation and efficiency in land-use decision making and promote growth and development favorable to the community at large.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Jason Huang, <a href="http://www1.uwindsor.ca/law/">University of Windsor Faculty of Law</a> Class of 2016, discusses recent British Columbia Court of Appeals decision, <span class="casename">Carter v. Canada</span>, upholding the ban on assisted suicide...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="huang.png" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/huang.png" width="120" height="140" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n the recent British Columbia Court of Appeal (BCCA) case <a href="http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/jdb-txt/CA/13/04/2013BCCA0435.htm">Carter v. Canada (Attorney General)</a>, the trial judge, justice Smith, had found that <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/page-118.html#docCont">s.241(b) of the Criminal Code</a> violated the right to life guaranteed by <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-15.html">section 7 (s.7) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a>, among other things. Justice Smith outlined a specific, controlled system that she believed would allow for physician-assisted suicide and minimize abuse. At the BCCA, the majority, written by justices Newbury and Saunders, found that justice Smith was bound by <em>stare decisis</em> to the <a href="http://scc-csc.lexum.com/decisia-scc-csc/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1054/index.do">1993 Rodriguez case</a>. In their final comment, the justices wrote, "In our respectful view, any review of the substantive Charter challenges . . . are beyond the proper role of the court below and of this court. If the constitutional validity of s.241 of the Criminal Code is to be reviewed notwithstanding <span class="casename">Rodriguez</span>, it is for the Supreme Court of Canada to do so." </p>

<p>While I agree that it would be the proper place for the Supreme Court to decide on this matter since this court would not be bound by its previous decision, I respectfully disagree, and am unconvinced, with how the majority reached this conclusion. There are several pitfalls in the majority's decision, specifically regarding s.7 right to life.</p>

<p>Two major contentions arose between justices Smith and Finch, the dissenting justice in the BCCA opinion, on one side and the majority decision on the other: 1) what exactly does the right to life entail? 2) and did <span class="casename">Rodriguez</span> leave it open for justice Smith to decide on the right to life? Justices Smith and Finch both agreed that the right to life should encompass one's quality of life rather than bare life. The majority, however, concluded that the right to life protects bare life when they said "those who have only limited ability to enjoy those blessings [of life] are no less 'alive', and have no less a right to 'life', than persons who are able-bodied and fully competent." While I agree that the quality of life <em>ought</em> to be the standard since there are drastic differences between the lives of people who are "able-bodied and fully competent" and those who suffer from mental or physical disability, I must concede with the majority that adopting a constitutional right to quality of life is far beyond the scope of what the law can guarantee. <br />
	<br />
Nevertheless, even under this narrow definition of the life interest under s.7, I am of the opinion that the majority has insufficiently answered the respondent's argument for how the right to life of people seeking physician-assisted suicide is engaged. The respondent posited that because of the blanket prohibition against physician-assisted suicide coupled with the knowledge that one will be incapable of ending their lives later, they end their lives preemptively. In this way, the Parliament's prohibition draws a causal connection to the premature death of citizens, thus infringing their right to life. This argument persuaded both justices Smith and Finch. The case law determined that the s.7 interests of life, liberty and security are related but independent interests. As such, both determined that <span class="casename">Rodriguez</span> left it open for justice Smith to decide on the right to life since <span class="casename">Rodriguez</span> only decided on the liberty and security interests.<br />
	<br />
The majority disagreed with this. They wrote "in <span class="casename">Rodriguez</span> although the majority did not in so many words reject the notion that s.241 constitutes a breach of the right to 'life' under s.7, we infer that the court dismissed such a notion out of hand." The majority provided no reasons for this inference. They immediately continued to state that justice Sopinka (majority in <span class="casename">Rodriguez</span>) acknowledged a societal consensus that human life is sacred and must be protected. It seems a far leap to infer from a statement that the sanctity of life must be protected to a statement that a provision of the Criminal Code does not violate the right to life. The majority in this case is further called into question by their own words when they said "even if we were wrong in this conclusion, and justice Sopinka did not consider the right to 'life.'" This statement implies anything short of full confidence in their reasoning. </p>

<p>Justices Newbury and Saunders simply relied upon <em>stare decisis</em> to find that justice Smith was bound by <span class="casename">Rodriguez</span> and could not decide on the life interest. This was their opinion even after recounting <a href="http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2010/2010onsc4264/2010onsc4264.html">Bedford v. Canada</a> which makes a similar legal argument. In that case, the motions judge was bound by the decision in the Prostitution Reference in regards to the "liberty" interest but the "security" interest was left open. The majority in this case paraphrased the Court of Appeal hearing <span class="casename">Bedford</span> who found that the motions judge "erred in equating her position with the position of a court that is asked to consider one of its own prior decisions."</p>

<p>I cannot see how this statement applies in this case. Justice Smith acknowledged the parameters of what was decided in <span class="casename">Rodriguez</span> and only decided on what he thought was left open for him. In no way did justice Smith attempt to decide something to which he was already bound. Admittedly, the majority made this statement before moving on to demonstrate, unconvincingly, how justice Smith was bound by <span class="casename">Rodriguez</span> and could not decide on the right to life. </p>

<p>By simply inferring that justice Sopinka considered the right to life in <span class="casename">Rodriguez</span>, the majority in this case failed to expressly address the respondent's actual argument. Justice Smith wrote, "The plaintiffs urge that the legislation has the effect of shortening the lives of persons who fear that they will become unable to commit suicide later, and therefore take their own lives at an earlier date than would otherwise be necessary." The silence of the majority, and their resort to an outright <em>stare decisis</em> argument based on "what was actually decided, as opposed to how it was decided" demonstrated that they had no answer to the respondent's argument. In my opinion, the respondents made a good argument for how the right to life is violated by s.241 of the Criminal Code. For the right to life to be engaged, there must be a direct causal connection between state action and citizen death. In this case, the respondents argued that "but for the impugned provisions, [the people wishing to die] would be able to have the assistance of a physician to end their life at some time in the future . . . It is because of that impediment that the choice is made to end their lives prematurely." Justice Smith cites Dr. Bentz, a physician in Oregon where physician-assisted suicide is legalized, who stated that most patients no longer wished to die after the doctor addressed their concerns. </p>

<p>It must be reiterated that the majority made the correct decision to allow the appeal so that the case may reach the Supreme Court. A series of new public opinion evidence has come forth as a result of this decision. CBC began a four part <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/player/News/TV+Shows/The+National/ID/2414736522/">documentary on Assisted Suicide</a> where former Supreme Court justice, Jack Major, who sided with the majority in <span class="casename">Rodriguez</span>, stated that Parliament needs to act on this matter. Furthermore, the<a href="http://www.environicsinstitute.org/uploads/news/environics%20institute%20fc%202013%20survey%20on%20assisted%20suicide%20-%20updated%20summary%20report%20-%20oct%2022-2013.pdf">Environics Institute</a> [PDF] published that seven percent of the Canadian public believe terminally ill or severely disabled persons should have a right to assisted suicide. If the Supreme Court is convinced that there is societal consensus for assisted suicide, then they may reverse their decision in <span class="casename">Rodriguez</span> and legalize, or at least decriminalize, physician-assisted suicide.</p>

		<title>2014 Will Be A Groundbreaking Year For Marijuana Policy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.tjsl.edu/directory/alex-kreit">Alex Kreit</a> of the Thomas Jefferson School of Law says that 2014 is going to be a truly groundbreaking year for marijuana policy in the US, when Colorado's and Washington's marijuana legalization takes effect ...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/alexkreit.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>t has been a little over a year since voters in Colorado and Washington <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/jurist-marijuana-will-become-legal.php">passed ballot measures</a> legalizing marijuana. If you will be spending your holidays in Seattle or Denver and want to legally purchase a cheer-inducing leafy green plant during the trip, however, you will have to make do with a Christmas tree. At least until January 1, 2014, when the first stores licensed to sell recreational marijuana are <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/05/at-least-100-recreational_n_4219447.html">expected to open up shop</a> in Colorado.</p>

<p>The delay is not a bug. It is a feature of the laws, both of which direct state agencies&#212;the <a href="http://www.liq.wa.gov/marijuana/proposed-rules">Liquor Control Board</a> in Washington State and the <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_24062676/colorado-first-state-country-finalize-rules-recreational-pot">Department of Revenue</a> in Colorado&#8212;to iron out the <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/11/18/131118fa_fact_keefe">regulatory details</a> of marijuana legalization. To understand why this is so, it is helpful to separate users from sellers.  </p>

<p>In both Colorado and Washington, the legal protections for users took effect more or less immediately, making it legal for anyone over twenty one to possess up to an ounce of marijuana for personal use. (In Colorado, adults may also grow up to six plants and transfer marijuana between one another "without remuneration.") Although this aspect of legalization raises some practical and legal issues&#8212;the need to <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/06/09/police-forced-to-retrain-drug-dogs-after-marijuana-legalized/">retrain drug sniffing dogs</a>, for example&#8212;it is a relatively straightforward policy to put into effect. Making it legal for someone to possess marijuana is really as simple as striking a few provisions from the state's criminal code. </p>

<p>When it comes to supplying marijuana, by contrast, legalization is a much trickier issue. Both laws aim to treat marijuana like alcohol. And as anyone who has ever tried to get a liquor license can attest, the manufacture and sale of alcohol is heavily regulated. Rather than try to develop a comprehensive regulatory system in advance, the ballot initiatives' drafters decided to include loose guidelines for regulating marijuana production and sale and leave the details to the administrative process. </p>

<p>Colorado has already finalized its <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/colorado-governor-signs-bills-regulating-recreational-marijuana.php">marijuana rules</a> and Washington officials are not far behind in completing theirs.</p>

<p>This means that 2014 is going to be a truly groundbreaking year for marijuana policy in the US. Colorado and Washington voters may have passed legalization in 2012, but 2014 is when legalization will actually take effect. It will bring the first licensed manufacturers, distributors, and retailers of recreational marijuana in the US. </p>

<p>The new year will also pose the first real test for the Department of Justice (DOJ)'s approach to state marijuana legalization laws. In August, the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/doj-will-not-challenge-state-marijuana-legalization-efforts.php">announced</a> that it does not plan to sue Washington and Colorado to block the new laws. The DOJ also released new <a href="http://www.justice.gov/iso/opa/resources/3052013829132756857467.pdf">prosecutorial guidance</a> that indicates it may limit the enforcement of federal drug laws in states that have legalized marijuana for recreational or medical purposes.</p>

<p>So far, it has been easy for federal prosecutors in Colorado and Washington to follow the DOJ's advisory memo. After all, there are not any recreational stores or manufacturers to prosecute. Whether local US Attorneys' offices will adhere to the DOJ's laissez-faire outlook once businesses are making and selling marijuana, however, remains to be seen.</p>

<p>In 2009, the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/doj-directs-prosecutors-to-end-raids-on.php">issued</a> a very similar memo concerning medical marijuana laws. It advised local federal prosecutors not to use their resources to bring cases against people operating in compliance with state medical marijuana laws. The <em>New York Times</em> even ran a front page story, boldly <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/20/us/20cannabis.html">declaring</a>: <em>U.S. Won't Prosecute in States That Allow Medical Marijuana</em>.   </p>

<p>As it turned out, federal prosecutors and Drug Enforcement Administration agents did not think much of the 2009 memo's advice. And, once they began to ignore it by going after medical marijuana providers as <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/obamas-war-on-pot-20120216">intently as they had under President Bush</a>, the DOJ did not step in to compel compliance with the memo.  </p>

<p>Will federal officials abide by the DOJ's newest memo? Or, will we see a replay of what happened following the 2009 memo? In 2014, we are likely to have an answer.  </p>

<p>Whatever approach federal prosecutors takes, however, the emergence of marijuana manufacturers and retailers in Colorado and Washington is likely to shine an even brighter light on the reality that when it comes to federal marijuana law, the status quo is not sustainable.  </p>

<p>Medical marijuana is already legal in <a href="http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/2013/aug/01/illinois_becomes_twentyfirst_med">twenty-one states</a> and activists say they hope to pass recreational marijuana legalization measures in <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/09/marijuana-legalization-states_n_3896573.html">10 states</a> by 2017. Unless this trend in public opinion and state law takes a sudden and dramatic U-turn, federal law will need to catch up. </p>

<p>The absurdity of the current state of affairs may be best encapsulated by the fact that a medical marijuana dispensary is now <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/30/washington-dc-medical-marijuana-dispensary_n_3676943.html">open and operating</a> in Washington, DC, just blocks from the capitol. Yet in California, a dispensary owner was <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/09/aaron-sandusky-sentenced-marijuana-10-years-prison_n_2433827.html">sentenced</a> to ten years in federal prison at the beginning of the year.  </p>

<p>It is impossible to square the idea that operating a medical marijuana business is a serious enough crime to warrant a ten year sentence with the reality that DOJ officials in the District of Columbia apparently don't have the will or the resources to shut down a similar business operating openly just blocks from them.  </p>

<p>There is every reason to think that 2014 will either mark a tipping point or the beginning of a reversal. If legalization opponents are proven right and legalization turns out to be a disaster, then the state reforms of recent years may soon be little more than a short-lived experiment before a return to marijuana prohibition.  </p>

<p>But if voters in other states like what they see in Colorado and Washington, it may not be long before we see a Democratic or Republican presidential nominee coming out in support of marijuana legalization. Certainly, in light of Colorado's swing state status, it is hart to imagine the 2016 contenders dismissing questions about marijuana legalization as insignificant, the way <a href="http://blogs.westword.com/latestword/2012/05/marijuana_mitt_romney_doesnt_like_your_questions_about_cannabis.php">Mitt Romney</a> and <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/03/obamamarijuana.html">Barack Obama</a> did not long ago.</p>

		<title>Second Circuit&amp;apos;s Decision Provides Unique Window Into Enemy Combatant Decisions</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.stmarytx.edu/academics/law/faculty-scholarship/faculty-staff/faculty-addicott-jeffrey/">Jeffrey Addicott</a> of St. Mary's University School of Law says that the Second Circuit's opinion upholding the conviction of alien enemy combatant Ghailani offers a unique view into how a federal appeals court grapples with the legal complexities existing between law of war concerns and domestic criminal processes ...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/jeffreyaddicott.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n October 2013, when the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/appeals-court-upholds-conviction-of-former-guantanamo-detainee.php">upheld</a> the conviction of alien enemy combatant and ex-Guantanamo detainee Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, the sigh of relief from the Obama administration could be heard throughout the Holder Justice Department. Reflecting the Obama administration's schizophrenic approach to prosecuting enemy combatants&#8212;whether to try them as criminals in a federal court or as enemy combatant war criminals in a military commission&#8212;the case was an early lightning rod. Flying in the face of common sense and the rule of law associated with warfare, President Obama had <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/us-embassy-bombing-suspect-to-be-tried.php">ordered</a> Ghailani taken from an ongoing military commission trial at <a href="/feature/featured/guantanamo/">Guantanamo Bay</a>, flown to New York, and tried as a common criminal in a federal district court. Nevertheless, whether one is a critic or admirer of Obama's penchant for the federal court process for enemy combatants, given the fact that Ghailani was <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/ex-guantanamo-detainee-acquitted-on-all-but-one-charge.php">found guilty</a> in a 2010 jury trial on only a single count (conspiracy to destroy US buildings and property, in violation of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/844">18 USC &#167; 844</a>) out of 282 counts, it was most gratifying that the Second Circuit upheld his conviction.  </p>

<p>The <span class="casename">Ghailani</span> case is particularly instructive because it not only demonstrates the levels of confusion and consternation associated with how the Obama administration strives to bring al Qaeda enemy combatants to justice, but the case reveals the obvious "discomfort" that federal judges encounter when mixing law of war concerns with domestic criminal processes.  </p>

<p>Ghailani was part of a successful 1998 al Qaeda terror attack on two US embassies in Africa. The simultaneous bomb attacks in Kenya killed two hundred and thirteen people and inured about 4,000 others. Since these al Qaeda attacks occurred prior to <a href="http://jurist.org/feature/featured/911/">9/11</a> the US operated under the rule of law which treated such "terrorists" as criminals to be arrested and prosecuted in federal court for applicable crimes. Accordingly, Ghailani and several other al Qaeda operatives were indicted on various criminal charges on December 16, 1998. While several of Ghailani's companions were convicted in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, Ghailani was able to elude arrest for six years. He was finally captured in July of 2004. Because the US was now in a state of war with al Qaeda per the 2001 <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ40/pdf/PLAW-107publ40.pdf">Authorization for Use of Military Force</a>, Ghailani was logically designated as an enemy combatant. In turn, because of his intelligence value, Ghailani was held for approximately two years by the Central Intelligence Agency at an off-site location. Then, in September 2006 Ghailani was sent to the military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  </p>

<p>In accordance with the 2004 ruling in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6173897153146757813">Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</a>, a 2007 Combatant Status Review Tribunal (CSRT) reviewed Ghailani's status and affirmed his designation as an "enemy combatant."  Understanding that under the law of war enemy combatants may be detained indefinitely until the war is concluded, it was not until March 2008 that the government formally <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/guantanamo-detainee-charged-in-1998-us.php">charged</a> Ghailani with violations of the law of war and began the process of prosecuting him before a military commission.</p>

<p>Then, on January 22, 2009, shortly after being sworn into office, President Obama <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">issued</a> three executive orders that reflected his political desire to reverse or deny the general theme that the law of war should be the predominate legal tool employed to deal with al Qaeda enemy combatants. Obama ordered: (1) the closure of Guantanamo Bay within one year; (2) the suspension of the use of new military commissions; and (3) the suspension of the CIA's enhanced interrogation program. In quick step, in June 2009, the Holder Justice Department used <span class="casename">Ghailani</span> as its test case for the notion that the military commission process should be secondary to the use of the federal court system to prosecute designated al Qaeda enemy combatants. (It is well established that the many domestic jihadists in the US are never candidates for the law of war rule of law in terms of detention, interrogation, and trial.) Indeed, this notion entered the surreal when later in 2009, Holder <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/holder-announces-federal-trials-for.php">announced</a> that five of the most senior members of al Qaeda8#212;Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Walid Muhammad Bin Attash, Ramzi Bin Al Shibjh, Ali Abdul-Aziz Ali, and Mustafa Ahmed Al Hawsawi8#212;would be transferred from military custody in the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay to stand trial in domestic federal criminal court in the Southern District of New York for their roles in the 9/11 attacks. While universal public outcry from the American people and the Democrat-controlled Congress forced Holder to <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/holder-announces-911-conspirators-to-face-military-trials.php">reverse</a> his ill-conceived decision regarding Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and the four other senior al Qaeda leaders, the <span class="casename">Ghailani</span> case went forward. At least supporters could attempt to justify the decision to send Ghailani to federal court by pointing to the fact that the Ghailani terror attacks occurred before 9/11.</p>

<p>The main thrust of the <span class="casename">Ghailani</span> appeal to the Second Circuit was that the delay outlined above was a violation of the Speedy Trial Clause of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment">Sixth Amendment</a>. In ruling that the five-year delay in bringing Ghailani to trial did not violate the Speedy Trail Clause, the court used the well-established four factor test: (1) the length of the delay; (2) the reasons for the delay; (3) whether the defendant asserted his right in the run-up to the trail; and (4) whether the defendant was prejudiced by the failure to bring the case to trial more quickly. In balancing these factors, the court acknowledged that Ghailani was not simply a common criminal but was in fact and "alien enemy combatant." This fact clearly overshadowed the analysis. Indeed, the court found that "there was no evidence that the government ever acted in bad faith" but was in fact operating under the assumption that Ghailani was to be tried by military commission until President Obama decided to pursue trial in a federal court. While the court stated that it was troubled by the length of the delay process in total, given the national security interests and the fact that the US was dealing with an enemy combatant the balance of the four factors favored the government.  </p>

<p>In conclusion, the Second Circuit's opinion provides a unique window into how a federal appeals court deals with legal issues that exist in a world set in the twilight between the law of war and domestic criminal law. As long as the Obama administration continues to use domestic criminal law to prosecute enemy combatants, the legal "no man's land" will certainly continue.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.nclplaw.org/about-us/dean-broyles/">Dean Broyles</a> of the <a href="http://www.nclplaw.org/">National Center for Law &#38; Policy</a> criticizes a California law regarding bathroom choice in public schools...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/deanbroyles.jpg" width="120" height="200" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong></strong>C</font>alifornia's latest foray into radical psycho-social experimentation with children is <a href="http://leginfo.ca.gov/pub/13-14/bill/asm/ab_1251-1300/ab_1266_bill_20130812_chaptered.htm">AB 1266</a>, known as the "bathroom bill." Unless stopped by a popular <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/opponents-of-california-transgender-law-petition-for-repeal.php">referendum effort</a>, AB 1266 will go into effect on January 1, 2014. This dangerous legislation allows boys and girls in California's purportedly enlightened K-12 public schools, regardless of their sexual plumbing, to self-identify, proclaim their "gender" and be granted access to on-campus bathrooms, locker rooms, showers and sports teams of the opposite sex. Amazingly, parental notification or consent is not required.<br />
                <br />
                Gender is an objective biological fact, not a subjective state of mind. As John Adams famously declared, "[f]acts are stubborn things." So are genes. And thus the question becomes, is it sound public policy to allow the often transient subjective personal feelings or the notoriously tumultuous proclivities of say a five-year-old boy determine his sex? Rather, should not tried and true objective biological realities determine what it means to be male or female? The answer to these questions <em>should</em> indeed be obvious. Yet clearly what it means to be a "boy" and what it means to be a "girl" is becoming confused when genetic material is dangerously dumped into the elite culture's gender-blender. What was once obvious to all has become obscured to many by postmodernism's notions of extreme personal autonomy and radical sexual liberty. The difference now is that these inappropriate social pressures are prematurely pushing the age of decision to younger ages when the brains and bodies of children are not yet fully developed to be best able to make such fundamentally important decisions.  </p>

                <p>AB 1266 and similar gender self-identification laws appear to be heavily influenced by the desire of many radical secular-progressives to completely eradicate "maleness" and "femaleness" as valid social categories and re-cast human beings as androgynous creatures. Far-fetched? Not at all!  Exhibit A is Judge Vaughn Walker's federal district court <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1984506746130471324">opinion</a> in California's Proposition 8 litigation regarding same-sex marriage. Back in 2010, I wrote an <a href="http://www.nclplaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Daily-Journal-DADT-Broyles-FINAL-Article-1.pdf">opinion editorial</a> [PDF] for the <em>Daily Journal</em>, California's largest legal newspaper, criticizing that opinion. Relying on fabricated "facts" and employing faulty logic, Walker created his own subjective alternative universe, declaring by fiat that children really do not need a father and a mother, but that, in essence, kids only need people who love them&#8212;of an indeterminate sex, say person A and person B. Contradicting 5,000 years of recorded history, common sense and social science research, Walker bizarrely announced that, indeed, any androgynous parents will do&#8212;no mother or father required. Fortunately, neither the Ninth Circuit nor the US Supreme Court affirmed Walker's extreme gender-blending approach.</p>

                <p>And as we at the <a href="http://www.nclplaw.org/">National Center for Law and Policy</a> explained to the Supreme Court in our <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/128194568/12-307-and-12-144-Brief-for-Parents-and-Friends-of-Ex-Gays-Gays">amicus brief</a> filed in both the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17941114802734225386">Hollingsworth, et al. v. Perry, et al.</a> ("Proposition 8") and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6241888197107641609">United States v. Windsor, et al.</a> ("DOMA") cases: "Far from being an immutable characteristic determined at birth like race or gender, sexual orientation is a complex and amorphous phenomenon that defies consistent and uniform definition." In other words, the scientific evidence does not support the widespread public belief in popular culture that individuals are born gay, or in this case, born transgender. This point is well documented by the fact that we were representing the organization <a href="http://pfox.org/default.html">Parents and Friends of Ex Gays & Gays</a> before the court, which has confirmed that there are tens of thousands of ex-gays now living successful heterosexual lives. If immutability were a fact, ex-gays would not exist.</p>

                <p>So back to the specific issue at hand, AB 1266. There are a myriad of practical and legal problems that have surfaced and will surface as a result of such radical political correctness run amok. What follows is only a partial list of the follies which will emerge.  </p>

                <p>First, who actually determines what the "gender" of the student is on any given day? Since biology is apparently no longer our guide, does it depend merely upon the whim, vague sense or fashion choices of the student? Must they always take the word of the student, or does the teacher, guidance counselor, principal or coach have any input into the decision? How would they know if the child is being sincere or cleverly perverted about his or her reported gender identity? And what if the child's parents instruct the school otherwise? This vague law puts educators in the nearly impossible position of figuring out whether they are actually complying with or violating the law. The statute itself provides no guidance.</p>

                <p>Second, AB 1266 severs parents, perhaps intentionally so, from the ability to do their job (i.e. parent)&#8212;disconnecting them from the important role of monitoring and guiding the sexual choices of their children. Since parents are completely left out of the loop here, what does this say about our culture's diminishment and disrespect for the ability and authority of parents to direct the care and upbringing of their children, especially on issues as fundamentally important as gender? The attitude of the state here appears to be, "parents be damned!" Apparently, the state, not father, "knows best" when it comes to making confusing sexual choices for our little ones. The state is a very poor substitute for parents and should not be the entity guiding our children's sexual development and choices.  </p>

                <p>Third, what about the legitimate privacy and safety concerns of the majority of non-gender confused students? Should boys and girls be involuntarily exposed to the genitals of the opposite sex at school&#8212;outside of the sex education classroom? And what of the sexually-charged opportunist high school boy who lies to administrators to gain full access to the girls' locker room? Can administrators tell him "no?" Do young girls and young women not deserve to have their dignity and privacy respected and protected by the state? If this law is not stopped, the future is indeed bright for plaintiff's attorneys in the Golden State! Can you not visualize them lining up to sue the school districts and the state for unwanted leering, groping and worse?  </p>

                <p>Fourth, what about public school administrators, teachers and coaches who, in spite of their religious beliefs to the contrary, will be compelled under this law to communicate active support for gender self-identification generally, and support for gender self-identifying students, or face losing their jobs? What about their rights of religious freedom and conscience which are squarely threatened by laws like AB 1266? The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that certain applications of nondiscrimination laws can infringe on cherished First Amendment freedoms, such as freedom of speech and association. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8332999881059454410">Hurley</a> the court reversed a lower court ruling against parade organizers who excluded a pro-homosexual group, declaring that the application of the "sexual orientation" nondiscrimination law violated the constitutional free-speech rights of the parade organizers by compelling them to communicate an unwanted message. Should our conscience dissenting public school teachers, administrators and coaches be less protected than the parade organizers in <span class="casename">Hurley</span> or the Scouts leaders in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6404209718401303437">Boy Scouts of America v. Dale</a>? I submit not. Alternatively, even if they do not hold contrary religious convictions, should they become the targets of litigation because they were merely "doing their job" in compliance with AB 1266?  </p>

                <p>No student should be harassed or bullied in our public schools&#8212;for any reason. Indeed, students struggling with same-sex attraction or transgender ideation deserve to be treated with love, dignity and respect. But bullying is already forbidden on public school campuses. All students deserve to be protected from bullying and harassment, regardless of how they are feeling about their gender on any given day. Schools are already handling the issue on a case-by-case basis with facilities like single-stall unisex restrooms and similar private accommodations. Such locally-controlled actions are preferable to a sweeping statewide policy. We have enough challenges in public education right now. Do we really need to radically upset the whole biological order in our public schools to protect transgender students from mean kids? Absolutely not. Punish the bullies; do not diminish or destroy the public education experience for everyone else, or trample on the privacy, religious freedom and other civil rights of other students, parents, administrators, teachers and coaches.  </p>

                <p>In conclusion, we must vigilantly resist the popular temptation to allow truth and common sense to be sacrificed on the altar of political correctness. We should never confuse change with progress. Sex is not a state of mind, it is a biological fact. Misguided far-reaching sexual orientation "anti-discrimination" laws like AB 1266 will certainly create many more social and legal problems than they will solve. Such nondiscrimination laws embody an ironic twist: while purporting to discourage discrimination, they actually create religious discrimination and threaten to trample on other important civil rights. If students are struggling with their sexual identity, they most need the loving help of their parents, pastors, physicians, counselors and others who really know them, love them and understand them, rather than the sloppy, blunt, awkward, unfeeling and overbroad solutions of the state fumbling around and interfering in personal areas where it is so obviously not competent. So the question becomes, should we further sever fundamental parent-child bonds and allow the young children, guided only by the secular state, to make potentially life-altering sexual decisions? I think not.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Meredith Kurz, <a href="http://law.hofstra.edu">Hofstra University School of Law</a> Class of 2015, discusses the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and its effects on ERISA benefits...<hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="kurz.jpg" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/kurz.jpg" width="120" height="157" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n 2010, with a majority in the Senate and House of Representatives, President Barack Obama successfully passed his signature piece of legislation, the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/patient_protection_and_affordable_care_act_of_2010">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (ACA), now known by both sides of the aisle as Obamacare. The constitutionality of the ACA was challenged in 2012, but the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-upholds-health-care-law.php">left most of the law intact</a>, including the controversial individual mandate provision. Since the law's inception, there have been concerns about how this legislation would affect other federal programs, most notably the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/erisa">Employee Retirement Income Security Act</a> (ERISA). In an effort to provide the most retirement benefits to the greatest number of employees, <a href="/feature/2013/10/the-current-state-of-the-employee-retirement-income-security-act.php">ERISA</a> ensures fiduciaries are acting in the best interest of plans, plans are adequately funded and plans provide benefits in a nondiscriminatory fashion. In exchange for compliance with ERISA's regulations, employers and employees are given a tax subsidy that makes administration of and contributions to pension plans economically viable for even "mom and pop stores." Although most Republicans oppose the ACA and have unsuccessfully voted over 40 times to repeal the law, employers and employees must comply with the ACA during its rollout period.   </p>

<p>Much of the uncertainty surrounding the ACA centers on its costs and how those may in turn affect ERISA benefits. In order to fund compliance with the ACA, employers may attempt to diminish their pension liabilities, leading to potentially underfunded plans, as well as noncompliant plans. ERISA violations may result if rank-and-file members are removed from the plan due to a forced shift from full to part-time status, leading to a <em>de facto</em> discriminatory plan.  </p>

<p>The ACA has far-reaching effects on the lives of employees. While on its face, the healthcare law seems to call only for coverage of employees under standard plans, it also affects employee benefits as a whole in its interactions with ERISA. Practitioners have <a href="http://www.law360.com/articles/464969/trying-to-avoid-aca-mandate-erisa-510-may-catch-you">commented</a> on the ACA's triggering of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/1140">&#167;510 of ERISA</a>, if employers attempt to avoid the law by reducing employees to part-time status to avoid the costs of health insurance and the Act's penalties. Such a change in status may result in a violation of &#167;510, as an attempt to disqualify employees from coverage under the ACA may also result in interference with an employee obtaining his or her rightfully vested pension rights, which the section addresses.  </p>

<p><strong>(In)voluntary Enrollment: ERISA vs. ACA</strong></p>

<p>The linchpin of ERISA at the time of its passage was its voluntary nature, incentivized instead though tax subsidies. ERISA's tax subsidies are composed of tax deferrals for both the employee, who pays no taxes until benefits are vested and distributed, and the employer, who receives a deduction when contributions are made. ERISA made it economically foolish to sponsor anything other than a qualified plan. In contrast, the ACA is characterized by its mandatory provisions, notably, the individual mandate, and employer penalties for having substandard plans or not offering healthcare to employees. A <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41159.pdf">report</a> [PDF] notes that the Congressional Budget Office predicts employers will pay $130 billion in penalties over the next ten years. These penalties will be incurred regardless of whether the employer is a governmental entity or a nonprofit that does not pay federal taxes. As ERISA is a voluntary program designed for the benefit of employees, while the ACA is a mandatory program, it is inevitable that a subset of employers will forego their pension plans in order to fund the mandated health plans or penalty taxes. Employers may also convert their defined benefit plans to defined contribution or profit sharing plans to cut costs. For the business with limited resources, the ACA may be fatal to its pension plan. Thus, while ERISA has been voluntary, employers have perceived sponsorship of qualified plans as a condition precedent to decrease turnover of qualified employees with very few transaction costs. However, the cost of the ACA's penalties (if the economics of providing coverage do not make sense), or of providing a health plan may in fact obstruct the funding of pension plans for many employers. This distinction may lead to the weakening of ERISA as an incentive for employers to provide pension plans, and once again bring about the uncertainty that catalyzed pension protection legislation in the first place.  </p>

<p><strong>COBRA & the ACA</strong></p>

<p>A notable ERISA program that may change due to the new health care legislation is <a href="http://www.dol.gov/dol/topic/health-plans/cobra.htm">COBRA</a>. COBRA, which got its moniker by happenstance from the budget legislation it was tacked onto, falls under the umbrella of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code. COBRA allows former employees (unless discharged for gross misconduct), their spouses and dependents to benefit from continued coverage under the employer's group health plan, usually at 102 percent of the normal premium cost. The length of coverage depends on the circumstances surrounding an employee's discharge. Employees can retain medical, vision, prescription drug, and flexible spending account benefits. While the concept of paying more than the original premium after losing one's job may seem painful, the costs remain much lower than individual insurance. However, the ACA may lead to lower premiums and deductibles on the marketplace than the costs of a pre-ACA COBRA-plan. The costs of supporting COBRA are allocated to the employee, and were previously overlooked because it ultimately led to cost-savings. However, COBRA may become increasingly unnecessary as employees are pointed to the marketplace, rather than insurance sponsored by the employer. </p>

<p><strong>An Opportunity for Law Students to Get in on the Ground Floor</strong></p>

<p>Health plan issues have largely been a subset of the ERISA or Employee Benefits group in many major law firms. These groups are usually small and focus on counseling and design of plans. However, the ACA will inevitably lead to the expansion of these practices, and firms may feel a need to hire ACA specialists. Due to the novelty of the ACA and the issues it poses, law students are just as equipped as any attorney to become experts in this field of law. I urge law students to educate themselves and engage in coursework devoted to this area of the law, because we are best poised to become experts on its policies, problems, and positives.  </p>

		<title>ICTY Provides Fair, Non-Political Trials</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.jmls.edu/directory/profiles/ford-stuart/">Stuart Ford</a> of The John Marshall Law School argues that the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia provides for fair, non-political trials, which are central to the success of the court  ... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/stuartford.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody><br />
</table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he fairness of the trials at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) is an important but contested issue. In a formal sense, the trials must be fair because international human rights law includes a fair trial guarantee, but there are other reasons to want fair trials. Fair trials would be a moral obligation even in the absence of the legal requirement. Moreover, having fair trials is, according to <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1907137">procedural justice theory</a>, one of the most important factors in establishing the legitimacy of a court and promoting compliance with the law, which is a goal of all international criminal justice mechanisms. In short, there are many reasons to believe that having fair trials at the ICTY is very important. And indeed, the ICTY is committed to having fair trials. For example, Article 20 of the <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/file/Legal%20Library/Statute/statute_sept09_en.pdf">ICTY Statute</a> [PDF] says that the Trial Chamber "shall ensure" that the trials are "fair and expeditious" and that the trials are conducted with "full respect for the rights of the accused ... "</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the fairness of the ICTY's trials has been a contested issue, particularly within the former Yugoslavia. Surveys of attitudes towards the ICTY conducted during the 2000s consistently showed that ethnic Serbs overwhelmingly thought the ICTY was biased and untrustworthy. This led the ICTY's Prosecutor to <a href="http://www.icty.org/sid/8633">lament</a> in 2005 that "[t]he debate on war crimes in the former Yugoslavia is not subsiding. It is present in the daily life and media, and always politicized ... [T]he public is only interested ... in politically, not judicially, defined truth." The question of the ICTY's fairness was in the spotlight again recently, when the ICTY <a href="http://www.icty.org/sid/11145">acquitted </a>Ante Gotovina, a Croat general accused of having mistreated Serbian civilians, and <a href="http://www.icty.org/sid/11159">Ramush Haradinaj</a>, the former Prime Minister of Kosovo, who had also been accused of mistreating Serbian civilians. The reaction was predictable. The ICTY was vilified in Serbia as a fundamentally political court that ignored crimes committed against Serbs and was only interested in unfairly punishing Serbs.</p>

<p>I have previously <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1908281">offered</a> an explanation for why ethnic Serbs have such a low opinion of the fairness of the court despite most independent observers having concluded that the trials were basically fair. Most ethnic Serbs identified strongly with their own ethnic group and took the Serb "side" in the conflict. Moreover, most ethnic Serbs had a common narrative about the conflict in which their group was the victim of crimes committed against them by the other groups. The ICTY directly contradicted this narrative of victimhood. The vast majority of the indictees were ethnically Serb, and Serbs were charged with the most serious crimes, including the commission of genocide at Srebrenica. In effect, the ICTY said that ethnic Serbs were the perpetrators not the victims. Unsurprisingly, given their strong identification with their "side" in the conflict, most ethnic Serbs rejected the court's narrative. This rejection was accomplished with the rationalization that the ICTY was unfair and biased against Serbs. If it was unfair and biased, then its conclusions could be rejected. I believe that this explanation is convincing, but it relies upon the assumption that the ICTY's trials are fundamentally fair and not political witch hunts.</p>

<p>Recently, I have been trying to <a href="http://www.law.unc.edu/journals/ncilj/issues/volume39/issue-1-fall-2013/fairness-and-politics-at-the-icty-evidence-from-the-indictments/">test</a> [PDF] that assumption about the court's fairness. I began by asking the question: if the ICTY's trial were political trials, how would we expect them to differ from fair trials? My answer was that in political trials we would expect the trier of fact to be extremely deferential to the prosecution's theories because of external political pressure to convict. As a result, indictees accused of more serious crimes or more numerous crimes would be more likely to be convicted and receive longer sentences. In effect, a strong correlation between the allegations in the indictment and the outcome of the trial could indicate the trials are political. Thus, my approach was to look for correlations between the content of the indictments and the outcomes of the trials.</p>

<p>The results are consistent with the ICTY's trials being fair. For example, there was no significant correlation between the seniority of the accused in their respective political and military hierarchies and either the number of counts that they were charged with or the sentences they received. If one starts with the belief that the ICTY is a political court and that its goal is to punish political and military leaders in the former Yugoslavia, then you would expect senior defendants to be accused of more crimes and receive longer sentences, but this did not turn out to be the case. Similarly, if you think the ICTY's were political, you might predict that individuals who were charged with more counts received longer sentences. This did not turn out to be true either. The total number of counts charged did not have a significant correlation with sentence length. Neither did the geographic scope of the charges. Individuals charged with crimes occurring over larger areas did not receive longer sentences than individuals accused of crimes committed over a smaller area. On the other hand, ethnic Serbs did make up the largest percentage of the accused and received the longest sentences but this is best explained by the fact that they were responsible for the largest number of violations of international criminal law and the most serious violations committed during the conflict.</p>

<p>There have also been criticisms of the ICTY arising out of its use of various modes of liability. The most serious criticism has been that superior responsibility and joint criminal enterprise (JCE) effectively turn crimes with distinct mens rea elements into strict liability crimes. My results provide little evidence for this criticism. For one thing, there is no correlation between the mode of liability alleged and the sentence received. Moreover, alleging that the accused committed the crime by participating in a JCE is correlated with acquittal, not conviction. This is hard to reconcile with claims that the ICTY's trials are political in nature, particularly given that JCE correlated strongly with seniority. Thus the use of JCE made it more likely that senior figures would be acquitted, which is not the outcome one would expect from political trials.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the data is inconsistent with allegations that the ICTY's trials are political trials. This is good news because fair trials are important. On the other hand, the fairness of the trials appears to have had relatively little impact in Serbia, where attitudes towards the court have been very negative. This is unfortunate because the population of the former Yugoslavia is an important audience for the court. Even more troubling, negative perceptions of the ICTY among ethnic Serbs are a direct result of the ICTY functioning as it was intended to function. The court was intended to identify and prosecute those who had committed serious violations of international criminal law. Its conclusion that ethnic Serbs were responsible for the largest number of violations and the most egregious violations was therefore both something it was supposed to do and what directly led to it being perceived so negatively among Serbs. </p>

<p>And this brings us back to where I started. At the beginning of this essay I argued, based on procedural justice theory, that fairness is crucial to the legitimacy of legal institutions and to compliance with the law. How can we reconcile that claim with how the ICTY has been perceived by ethnic Serbs? There are a couple of answers. First, ethnic Serbs are just a small, albeit important, part of the audience for the ICTY. Ultimately, the audience for international criminal justice mechanisms is everybody on the planet. So while ethnic Serbs were heavily invested in the question of who was indicted in ways that overrode the expected benefits from a fair process, this will not be true for the vast majority of the court's audience. For the majority of the audience that does not identify with the accused, perceptions of the court's legitimacy should be driven by the fairness of the process, as predicted by procedural justice theory. Second, even in Serbia attitudes appear to be changing. There is some evidence that over time more Serbs are coming to accept that ethnic Serbs committed atrocities at Srebrenica and other places. The reason for this change in narrative is at least partly the evidence that has been collected by the ICTY during the course of its trials. In effect, the ICTY (and other international criminal tribunals) must play a long game. Initially, they may be viewed quite negatively by groups who identify with the individuals they accuse, but if they collect convincing evidence of the guilt of the accused and present that evidence in fair trials they may, over the long haul, be able to reshape narratives that are holding back both perceptions of the court and compliance with international criminal law.</p>

		<title>Why China Doesn&amp;apos;t Really Want the Senkaku Islands</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.creighton.edu/law/faculty/kelly/">Michael Kelly</a> of the Creighton University School of Law examines the ongoing dispute between China and Japan over the Senkaku Islands ...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/michaelkelly.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>L</strong></font>ast week the US flew two B-52 bombers over the remote, uninhabited Senkaku Island group in a show of force for an audience of one. Whether he enjoyed the show from his seat in Beijing or not, Chinese president Xi Jinping was no doubt smiling. The Americans finally take the dispute between China and Japan over the Senkaku islands seriously. It took a brazen extension of China's "air defense zone" over the islands with a warning of possible military reaction against non-compliant aircraft to accomplish this. But the provocation worked.</p>

<p>Located between 123-125 degrees longitude and 25-26 degrees latitude at the maritime crux of Okinawa, Taiwan and China, the Senkakus, or Diaoyu Islands in Chinese, ride atop the same continental shelf as Taiwan. Nevertheless, they were historically seen as associated with the Ryukyu Island chain, which was incorporated into Japan in the 19th Century. For disputes such as these, adversaries tend throw maps and treaties at one another to bolster their claims.  Consequently, while Japanese and Chinese fishing and coast guard vessels have been ramming one another or playing chicken in this part of the East China Sea for the past three years, the governments in Tokyo and Beijing have been mustering their legal arguments. </p>

<p><img alt="senkakuislands.gif" src="http://jurist.org/forum/senkakuislands.gif" width="624" height="520" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>Japan has in its arsenal an 1895 <a href="http://www.taiwandocuments.org/shimonoseki01.htm">treaty</a> ending the first Sino-Japanese War in which China ceded the islands. China responds that this was superseded by the <a href="http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%20136/volume-136-I-1832-English.pdf">Treaty of San Francisco</a> ending World War II in the Pacific by which Japan re-ceded the islands. The US took possession of the islands after the war, but then returned them to Japan in 1972. Privately owned by a Japanese family, the conservative mayor of Tokyo sought to purchase them in 2012 to keep them out of the hands of the Chinese and bolster his nationalist political base, but the Japanese government preempted this move by purchasing most of them itself. China was predictably outraged. The dispute has only ratcheted up tensions from there.</p>

<p>Why has the long-simmering Senkaku dispute reached the boiling point now, in 2013? Because Mr. Xi senses a settlement. But not with respect to the Senkaku Islands. Or the East China Sea for that matter. His real focus is on the South China Sea, where the US has far fewer naval assets, smaller and more shaky allies, and the bilateral power politics are distinctly to China's advantage. China is playing the long game with respect to its maritime ambitions. It is seeking a grand bargain, and we, along with Japan, are playing into it.</p>

<p>The South China Sea dispute involves overlapping claims by China, Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines. By far the largest claim is China's, which, by virtue of its famous "nine dash line" encompasses roughly 80 percent of the waters between mainland China and Borneo. Not only is this area very rich in fishing grounds, it is also home to the largest underwater petroleum reserves in Asia, approximately the size of Saudi Arabia's. Moreover, China's quickly developing <a href="http://law.case.edu/journals/JIL/Documents/45CaseWResJIntlL1&2.22.Article.Kelly.pdf">blue water navy</a> [PDF] requires its own oceanic backyard. Hemmed in by Japan and the US in the East China Sea, the South China Sea is a much more promising pond in which the Chinese navy can operate its new submarines and aircraft carrier.</p>

<p>Indeed, China has invested far more in its South China Sea claim than its East China Sea claim. The island of Yongxing in the Paracels Group, only one square mile, has been built up with an airstrip by which mainland China supplies food, water and all other supplies to the 1,000 residents it has moved there to anchor its claim. Located 220 miles south of Hainan Island, Yongxing, China argues, is the capital of a new administrative region that includes all the other islands in the group. The Chinese also regularly patrol other island and reef claims that it must secure in order for its maritime sea claims to become legitimate under the rules of the <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf">1982 Law of the Sea Convention</a> [PDF], to which the US is not a party.</p>

<p>China became interested in the South China Sea a decade before the East China Sea. Beijing's modern claim to the former dates to 1958, while its modern claim to the latter dates only to 1970. The origins of the more recent Senkakus claim are rooted in the discovery of fossil fuel by a 1968 UN hydrographic survey. In a 1971 <a href="http://cryptome.org/2013/07/guccifer-cia-senkaku.pdf">secret report</a> [PDF], the CIA found that Chinese government and military maps immediately prior to this discovery did not include the Senkakus.  However, immediately after the discovery, new editions of the maps along with a new map issued by the Chinese National Petroleum Corporation included them.</p>

<p>Whatever the origins of the revived Senkaku claim forty three years ago, Mr. Xi knows he can get much more fossil fuel to feed his carbon-thirsty economy from the South China Sea deposits than he could from the comparatively meager East China Sea. His strategy is to create the biggest fuss possible with brinksmanship tactics over the Senkaku Islands in order to bring a frayed and twitchy Japan to the bargaining table, with the US nervously in the background pushing hard for peace. And then, he will pitch his grand bargain. In exchange for relinquishing China's claim to the Senkakus, Mr. Xi would want Japan to support China's claim to the South China Sea. Politically, the Japanese government comes home with a huge victory that costs it virtually nothing. But of course, what Japan gives China in this grand bargain is far more valuable to China than a handful of rocks near Okinawa.</p>

<p>With Japan backing it's claim in the South China Sea and the US backing off, China will be in a position to deal bilaterally with the claims of the smaller states. Unable to withstand the political, economic and military might of their vastly larger neighbor, the claims of Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines will eventually collapse through bribery, bullying and benevolence alternately applied. Long the object of Euro-Japanese grand bargains that carved up its territory and subjugated its people, China now seeks a grand bargain of its own. Mr. Xi understands that his country has the leverage to pull one off, and he is gambling that this feint to the Senkakus will get him the support from the other Great Powers to do it.</p>

<p>An increasingly deflated Obama presidency in its second term, distracted by Syria and Afghanistan, has been unable to fulfill its promised "pivot to Asia" in American foreign policy. If China gets the free hand it wants in the ocean to its south in exchange for short-term peace and stable economic relations, then Mr. Xi will have succeeded mightily in placing his country at the new gravitational center of international relations. China will no longer be a rising power. It will have risen.</p>

<span style="font-size: medium"><strong>T</strong></span>oday marks <a href="http://www.un.org/en/events/migrantsday/">International Migrants Day</a>, a day to be commemorated and celebrated by all in support of immigrants and their contributions to our communities. December 18th marks the date in 1990 that the UN adopted the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cmw/cmw.htm">International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families</a>. The Migrant Workers Convention guarantees migrant workers and their families fundamental rights including equality before the law regardless of a migrant's legal status.

The promise of dignified treatment remains far from being fulfilled for many immigrants in the US, however.

Eduardo Zuniga's case is illustrative. Zuniga, a migrant worker, was detained at the <a href="https://www.ice.gov/detention-facilities/facilities/stwrtga.htm">Stewart Detention Center</a>, the largest immigration detention center in the US located in Lumpkin, Georgia. While working at Stewart's kitchen, Zuniga crushed his toe and shattered his toenail. He was not allowed to see a doctor and was referred instead to nurse practitioners who refused to remove the shards of his nail from his toe. They gave him only over-the-counter pain medication, antibiotics and instructions to apply ice to his toe. Six and a half months later, his nail had not grown back and his toe remained infected, causing him continuous pain. He was injured a second time while working when he twisted his leg, causing swelling from his ankle to his knee. Nurse practitioners at Stewart did not allow him to see a doctor for over three months while pain and swelling persisted. During this time, they denied him the necessary medication, permission slips allowing him not to work and authorization to use physical assistance items such as a wheelchair or a second crutch. Deported to Mexico, Zuniga continues to suffer pain in his knees.

This was far from an isolated case as documented by the ACLU of Georgia in our <a href="http://www.acluga.org/files/2713/3788/2900/Prisoners_of_Profit.pdf">report</a> [PDF], "Prisoners of Profit: Immigrants and Detention in Georgia." Published in May 2012, the report is based on interviews with 68 detained immigrants and their families as well as immigration attorneys, tours of the detention centers and review of documents obtained from the government. The report covers the four immigration detention facilities in Georgia, including Stewart.

The conditions documented by the ACLU of Georgia violate the constitutional and human rights of detained immigrants, many of who are migrant workers, as well as <a href="http://www.ice.gov/">Immigration and Customs Enforcement's</a> (ICE) own standards. Findings raised serious concerns about violations of due process rights, inadequate living conditions, inadequate medical and mental health care and abuse of power by those in charge.

One of the problems documented was the inadequacy of medical care at the facilities as shown by the treatment afforded to Zuniga. Detention facilities—including Stewart—have gone years without employing a full-time doctor. Preventative care is not available, pre-existing medical needs are often ignored and emergency care is grossly inadequate.

The report recommends that ICE stop detaining immigrants at the for-profit Stewart and <a href="http://www.ice.gov/detention-facilities/facilities/irwinga.htm">Irwin County</a> Detention Centers given the extent of the documented violations and their remote locations, which isolate detained immigrants from their families and communities of support.

To date, neither ICE nor the for-profit detention centers have taken action to address the concerns highlighted in the report.

As such, the ACLU of Georgia recently submitted letters to the <a href="http://www.acluga.org/files/1713/8685/7375/IACHR_Letter-Commissioner_Gonzlez.pdf">Inter-American Commission Rapporteur on the Rights of Migrants</a> [PDF] and the <a href="http://www.acluga.org/files/6313/8685/7279/IACHR_Letter-Commissioner_Gil.pdf">Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons Deprived of Liberty</a> [PDF] requesting a meeting to discuss immigration detention conditions in Georgia.

In what could be a promising sign, the <a href="http://cca.com/">Corrections Corporation of America</a> recently announced the closing of one of its facilities in Georgia, the <a href="http://www.ice.gov/detention-facilities/facilities/ngdctga.htm">North Georgia Detention Center</a>. Unfortunately, the immigrants detained there will not be released; instead, they will reportedly be shipped to Stewart and Irwin.

Instead of shuffling immigrants between detention facilities, ICE should make greater use of effective and far cheaper alternatives to detention. Congress should also eliminate the detention bed quota that forces ICE to hold 34,000 immigrants in detention daily regardless of actual need, and repeal mandatory detention provisions in immigration law that preclude individualized assessments of the need to detain. When migrant workers are released from unnecessary detention and reunited with their families, we will be one step closer to truly celebrating the promise of International Migrants Day.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Shubhankar Dam of the Singapore Management University School of Law says that Indian Supreme Court has dangerously rolled back the clock on LGBT rights, threatening the ongoing process of progressive reform in Asia ... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/shubhankardam.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>M</strong></font>ore than four years after the Delhi High Court invalidated <a href="http://districtcourtallahabad.up.nic.in/articles/IPC.pdf">S. 377 of the Indian Penal Code</a> [PDF] the Supreme Court of India has turned back the clock. In a decision delivered recently, it upheld the constitutionality of the provision, thereby making "carnal intercourse against the order of nature" once again punishable by imprisonment for life, or for a term of ten years. India now rejoins Afghanistan, Iran, Nigeria, Sudan, Saudi Arabia and Uganda among others in officially sanctioning discrimination against LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender) people.<br />
 <br />
The court, in upholding the provision, claimed that "a minuscule fraction of the country's population" are gays and lesbians, and that no more than 200 persons have been prosecuted under the law. These claims are particularly troubling; they do not bode well for Indian democracy. It suggests that constitutional rights of minorities depend on their numbers; small minorities may not enjoy all protections afforded to "bigger" minorities. This should ring alarm bells for religious, linguistic  and other minorities, many of whom similarly constitute "a minuscule fraction of [India's] population".<br />
 <br />
Also, in emphasizing the absence of criminal prosecutions, the court overlooked the culture of fear, harassment and intimidation that the law necessarily breeds. Several NGOs (Non Governmental Organizations) have extensively documented how S. 377 has been systematically used to blackmail and torture LGBT people. These actions may not show up on official records, but they are part of the everyday reality of those who endure the wrath of S. 377.<br />
 <br />
The court also seems to have restored an understanding of morality that is grounded in the brute will of the majority. In 2009, the Delhi High Court had taken a different approach. It spoke of constitutional, not public, morality: the idea that fundamental rights take their content from the ethos of a Constitution, not the prejudiced views of the majority at any given point in time. But in restoring the idea of majoritarian morality the court, once again, imperils the rights of other minorities in India as well. <br />
 <br />
The award winning author Vikram Seth has <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/20/vikram-seth-india-supreme-court-ban-gay-sex">suggested</a> that the decision is "intellectually shallow and ethically hollow." It is also, one may add, culturally narrow. A provision similar to S. 377 was first introduced in India in 1828 by colonial Britain, and later included in the Indian Penal Code in 1860. In rejecting developments in foreign jurisdictions regarding LGBT rights, the court forgot that S. 377 was itself a foreign imposition, one designed to evangelize Indian society into Christian habits.<br />
 <br />
This is important because Hinduism's associations with homosexuality are complex, and its criminal status is rather doubtful. One of the founding texts of Hinduism, the Kama Sutra which is said to be have been compiled around 2 A.D., has an entire chapter dedicated to same-sex conduct. Similarly, Indian gods and goddesses routinely reject the hetero-normative construct. Soon after the court's verdict, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, a spiritual leader and the founder of the Art of Living Foundation, took to twitter to explain this. "Homosexuality has never been considered a crime in Hindu culture", Sri Sri wrote, "In fact, Lord Ayyappa (a popular god in southern India) was born of Hari-Hara (Vishnu and Shiva)," that is, two male gods.<br />
 <br />
This approach is far from unique. Historically, large parts of Asia were indifferent to, if not approving of homosexuality. Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos never had legal prohibitions against homosexuality; Japan legalized it in 1880, Thailand in 1956 and China in 1997. Similarly, the Nepalese Supreme Court in 2008 <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/nepal-supreme-court-approves-same-sex.php">declared</a> that LGBT persons have equal rights under the Constitution including a right to marry. Clearly, Asian societies have been far more tolerant, if not accepting, of homosexuality than is commonly presumed.<br />
 <br />
The Indian Supreme Court's judgment, for all its flaws, has spurred two developments that are worth noting. One, it has compelled political parties to shed their usual reticence on the matter. The leadership of the Congress Party has unequivocally rejected the judgment; cabinet ministers are exploring appropriate legal responses. Similarly, some regional and smaller parties have urged the government to introduce amendments to the provision. Even the more socially conservative Bharatiya Janata Party, the principal opposition, was initially hesitant to take a stand. Reports indicate that there is dissent within the party, with some objecting to the court's verdict. All this is reason for cautious hope, but it remains to be seen if political parties will eventually act on the matter.<br />
 <br />
The verdict also highlights a remarkable vacuum in India with respect to civic activism on LGBT rights. With few exceptions, there is no meaningful effort to engage with, and educate the wider population on these matters. "Gay pride" is still an alien idea in India, and a sufficiently Indian-ized version is yet to be realized.<br />
 <br />
India's Supreme Court got it wrong this time. Like many other courts around the world, perhaps it will correct itself in future. Even then, the battle for hearts and minds will continue. There is no alternative to meaningful activism, ideally in a language and form that is accessible to a broad swath of rather diverse people.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Columnist <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/people/full-time-faculty/haider-ala-hamoudi">Haider Ala Hamoudi</a> of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law says that, as its new government matures, Iraq must address critical issues left ambiguous in the initial constitution if it desires to remain revelavant and united ... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/hamoudi_edited.jpg" width="120" height="200" align="LEFT" hspace="L" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>U</strong></font>N officials have recently reported that sectarian based execution style <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/01/world/meast/iraq-killings/">killings </a>have surged in Iraq. This is a matter that requires rather urgent attention, in particular in light of the rather ambiguous legal and constitutional circumstance in which Iraq finds itself.</p>

<p>As I have argued most extensively in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Negotiating-Civil-Conflict-Constitutional-Construction/dp/022606882X">book</a>, after much debate, the Iraqi constitutional drafters ultimately determined that issues of core dispute among the country's disparate ethnic and sectarian communities simply could not be resolved all at once at a constitutional bargaining table. In fact, even to attempt such a resolution ran the risk of further national destabilization, because it would require one community to impose its vision on the others over their objection, hardly a basis on which to build a harmonious polity. As such, the drafters chose in large part to go the course of strategic ambiguity where divisions arose. Thus, matters upon which there was broad agreement (for example, the rights and freedoms that should be granted to Iraqis vis a vis their government) were drafted clearly and forthrightly. By contrast, matters over which there was much dispute, such as the role of Islam in the state or the extent to which the state would be federal in its structure, were left for future political resolution. The idea was that the disparate communities needed more time to work together, in order to develop piecemeal, incremental solutions over immediate, far reaching ones that were simply unattainable.  </p>

<p>By and large, the approach worked for a time. The once highly divisive issue of federalism was largely resolved in an incremental fashion in favor of an asymmetrical federal state, where one region, that of Iraqi Kurdistan was granted broad autonomy while no other provinces have been. Similarly, the one issue that tends to divide so many Arab states after the Arab spring, that of the role of Islam in the state, is hardly so divisive in Iraq, partly due to the decisions of Iraq's Federal Supreme Court and partly due to the increased efforts of the parties to find a way to work together to find a broadly harmonious resolution. It is therefore rather ironic that of the many issues dividing Sunni from Shi'i in contemporary Iraq, the actual role of Islam in the state is not one of them. The matter, that is, is almost entirely divorced from theology, because there is not as great a dispute over the role of religion as was once believed. It took time and extended dialogue and compromise to reach to that resolution.</p>

<p>At the same time, this type of "incremental constitutionalism," to use a term coined by the learned Hannah Lerner, has its limitations. Most particularly, when all divisive matters are not resolved in a broad constitutional drafting session, the result is that the constitution is not on its own much of a solution to festering disputes as a means to resolve such disputes gradually, over time. This means that it is critically important that the parties continue to engage in extensive dialogue and continue to work together to cobble together piecemeal solutions upon which further constructive reconciliation efforts might be made.</p>

<p>While this has been done in some respects as regards matters such as federalism and the role of Islam, it has not in many others. In particular, Sunnis do not feel as if they have a meaningful voice in state governance and their broad alienation from the state has led to widespread protests across Sunni regions. The incredible failure of the Iraqi government to improve the lives of its citizenry over the span of years has hardly helped. The result of this has been a continuing deterioration of relations across Iraq's strong ethnic and sectarian divides, after a post constitutional period, in 2008 and 2009, in which there was much promise of a brighter future.  </p>

<p>Now, with the seeming rise of sectarian killings, matters could devolve even further. It is therefore critically important that Iraq's bickering communities find a way to work together to reverse the trend, not so much  to find a permanent solution to their perduring disputes, but rather to find a means to work toward building more constructive piecemeal approaches, as they had been doing not very long ago.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/law/people/sujitha-subramanian/index.html">Sujitha Subramanian</a> of the Bristol University School of Law discusses the Indian Supreme Court's decision to uphold the constitutional validity of a statute effectively criminalizing homosexual acts ...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/sujithasubramanian.JPG" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n December 11, 2013, ironically a day after the Human Rights Day, the Indian Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/india-supreme-court-reinstates-gay-sex-ban.php">upheld</a> the constitutional validity of Section 377 Indian Penal Code (IPC) that criminalizes anyone voluntarily having carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal. In doing so, it struck down the 2009 Delhi High Court <a href="http://www.nazindia.org/judgement_377.pdf">judgment</a> [PDF] that had decriminalized consensual sex between adults in private. </p>

<p>Section 377 has been widely interpreted as specifically targeting the sexual orientation of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and trans-genders (LGBT) although it also applies to heterosexual couples engaging in non-procreative forms of sexual intercourse. Activists argue that the law forces homosexuals to live their lives in the "shadow of harassment, exploitation, humiliation, cruel and degrading treatment at the hands of the law enforcement machinery."</p>

<p>The law has its origins in 1860 in pre-colonial India. Though around 30 amendments have been made to the IPC since its adoption, Section 377 has remained unaltered despite the 172nd Law Commission Report (2000) recommending deletion of this provision. Indeed, the most recent IPC amendments were undertaken in 2013, following the infamous December 2012 Delhi <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/delhi-gang-rape">gang rape case</a>, but Section 377 was left untouched. </p>

<p>The first legal challenge to Section 377's impact on homosexuals can be traced back to 1994, when the Delhi Tihar Jail authorities <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/tihar-jail-bans-condoms/1/293411.html">refused</a> medical advice to supply condoms to its inmates in an effort to curb the spread of HIV/AIDS, allegedly because it had the potential to advance homosexual behaviour. In 2001, an NGO, Naz Foundation, approached the Delhi High Court seeking decriminalisation of consensual sex between adults because the legislation hampered HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention campaigns. The case was trigged by various incidents of arrest of homosexual persons, including activists of Naz Foundation that attracted negative media coverage exposing the conservative mind-set of the country. </p>

<p>The Delhi High Court delivered its verdict in 2009 decriminalising private sexual behaviour between consenting adults. The court held that Section 377 grossly violated the fundamental human rights to life and liberty that include the right to protection of one's dignity, autonomy and privacy, as embodied in Article 21 of the <a href="http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/welcome.html">Indian Constitution</a>. The court found that though Section 377 appears to be gender neutral, it disproportionately impacts upon the homosexuals as a "class," because it restricts homosexual orientation, which is an "innate and immutable characteristic" of a homosexual person. By criminalizing the identity of a person based wholly on the state's moral disapproval of a specific class, the court held that the law violated, under "any standard of review," the equality principles guaranteed under Articles 14 and 15 of the constitution. </p>

<p>The High Court rejected the rationale that Section 377 promoted majoritarian sexual morality as a "legitimate state interest" (<a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14901730125647575103">Bowers v. Hardwick</a>), and maintained that the law had originally sought to enforce Victorian notions of sexual morality that included only procreative sex. The court declared that the condemnation of non-procreative sex was no longer a legitimate state interest, as its objective was arbitrary and unreasonable, given that it criminalizes conduct that "fails to conform with the moral or religious view of a section of society."</p>

<p><a href="http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2009-08-03/news/28444491_1_law-minister-veerappa-moily-indian-constitution-judgement">Hailed</a> as a "well-researched and well-documented" verdict, the High Court order declared that "the sphere of privacy allows persons to develop human relations without interference from the outside community or from the State." Seen as a verdict that stood out in the judicial annals of the country, the court declared that the Bill of Rights does not "confer" fundamental human rights, but merely "confirms" their existence. </p>

<p>In delivering this verdict, the court referred to global trends in the protection of privacy and dignity rights of homosexuals, enunciated by the jurisprudence of the US Supreme Court, the Canadian, European and other courts, literature and international principles (<a href="http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/">Yogyakarta Principles</a>) relating to sexuality as a form of identity. </p>

<p>Though the then Law Minister did not assure amendment of Section 377, he clarified that the government would not appeal the Delhi High Court ruling on the basis that the pre-colonial legislation does not stand the "acid test" of the Indian Constitutional principles.</p>

<p>The High Court judgment was however appealed by various conservative individuals and groups, predominately Christian and Muslim organizations. As the government had clarified its position that sexual activity between consenting adults in private must be excluded from the privy of the section, there was a general expectation that the Indian Supreme Court was merely going to rubber-stamp the High Court ruling. As such, the Supreme Court ruling that Section 377 does not suffer from "the vice of constitutional infirmity" came as a shock to many and represented a major setback to LGBT rights in India.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court made it clear that it was empowered to declare as void any law inconsistent with the constitution, but felt bound to exercise self-restraint as the decision of the legislature to maintain Section 377 is a "manifestation of the will of the people through the Parliament" and must be favored with the presumption of constitutionality. Though the presumption of constitutionality does not in itself make a law immune from constitutional challenge, the Supreme Court held that the legislative decision to retain Section 377 has guided its understanding of the 'character, scope, ambit and import of the legislation." Unless a "clear constitutional violation is proved," the Supreme Court refused to strike down legislation merely because it has fallen into disuse or because of society's changing perceptions.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court declared that "those who indulge in carnal intercourse in the ordinary course and those who indulge in carnal intercourse against the order of nature constitute different classes and the people falling in the latter category cannot claim that Section 377 suffers from the vice of arbitrariness and irrational classification." Strangely, the court gives no indication on what would constitute 'ordinary course' as opposed to 'order of nature' and merely draws the conclusion that since the legislation envisioned Section 377 to apply regardless of gender identity and orientation, it was non-discriminatory, in that it does not criminalize a particular set of people, identity or orientation. In other words, as Section 377 criminalizes the sexual activity of both homosexual and heterosexuals, regardless of age and consent, it does not violate the fundamental principle of equality.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court criticized the High Court for extensively relying on foreign judgments in its "anxiety" to protect the "so-called rights" of LGBT persons that represented only a "miniscule fraction" of the country's population. It held that the low number of reported cases of prosecution against LGBT community does not justify declaring the section ultra vires of the Constitution, thus ruling against the High Court's reliance on the European Court of Human Rights's <a href="http://echr.ketse.com/doc/15070.89-en-19930422/">Modinos</a> which maintained that even a "consistent policy" of not bringing prosecutions under the law was no substitute for full repeal. </p>

<p>A verbose judgment about 100 pages long, with extracts from various judgments, the Supreme Court ruling taken on the narrowest possible grounds does not provide any substantive normative position or legal reasoning for its decision. The ruling is full of gaps and appears as arbitrary, because it merely dabs in broad-based principles of constitutional rights without engaging with the issue and simply points to the legislature to do the needful.  </p>

<p>The judgment marks a surprising departure from the "activist" disposition of the Indian judiciary that the courts had adopted since the post-emergency period (1977-78). The Indian judiciary has generally embraced procedural activism (letters written to judges treated as petitions; courts can themselves take <em>suo moto</em> cognizance; rules of <em>locus standi </em>relaxed to allow anyone to move court on behalf of victims) and substantive activism (expansive views of fundamental rights) as part of <a href="http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/circular/guidelines/pilguidelines.pdf">Public Interest Litigations</a> (PIL) [PDF], with an intent to reach invisible victims of injustice. Indeed, the concept of justiciability has been extended to go over and beyond compelling the state to do/or not do what is legally provided, to a position that the courts can assume the functions of the executive and legislature by encroaching in the field of policy making (right to education, policy against child labor etc.) and good governance (clear air in Delhi). Seen within the context of judicial activism, the Supreme Court views on Section 377 is a reflection of pre-colonial mind-set that has reintroduced into India the crudest form of discrimination and exclusion of sexual minorities: the criminalization of their identity.</p>

<p>Post-Script: The mal-application of Section 377 is indicative within the context of the recent on-going diplomatic <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/punish-us-diplomats-with-same-sex-companions-yashwant-sinha/articleshow/27538228.cms">incident</a> between India and US where a former finance minister and MP has called for the arrest of same-sex partners of US diplomats in India. On the positive side, the Indian government has submitted a review petition against the Supreme Court ruling on December 20, 2013.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.illinois.edu/faculty/profile/charlestabb">Charles Tabb</a> of the University of Illinois College of Law argues that the Detroit bankruptcy ruling produces a catch-22 between the federal and state courts which may ultimately be decided by the US Supreme Court ... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/charlestabb.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he first clause to the title of this comment is of course to some degree hyperbolic; nothing has happened (yet) to impair or diminish the public pensions enjoyed by Detroit pensioners. As was previously <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-court-rules-detroit-eligible-for-bankruptcy.php">reported</a> by JURIST, on December 3, Bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes held that the City of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=detroit">Detroit</a> was eligible for bankruptcy under chapter 9 of the <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/FederalCourts/Bankruptcy/BankruptcyBasics/Chapter9.aspx">United States Bankruptcy Code</a>. Two days later, he issued a 150-page opinion detailing his findings. On December 16, Judge Rhodes certified the case for direct appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. It is not yet known whether the Sixth Circuit will hear the case on an expedited basis.</p>

<p>In the course of his opinion, Judge Rhodes made clear that Detroit's pension obligations could be impaired in the chapter 9 case, notwithstanding the roadblocks of either the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/tenth_amendment">Tenth Amendment</a> (which preserves state sovereignty except as specifically given to the federal government in the US Constitution) or the provision in Article IX, section 24 of the <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(qz0thvf2otcyzwvo1enwlqac))/mileg.aspx?page=MCLconstitutionSearch">Michigan Constitution</a> that prohibits the impairment or diminishment of pension obligations. At this early stage, wherein only eligibility was on the table for decision, it was of course premature for Judge Rhodes to rule on any specific plan to cut pensions. Furthermore, he was careful to state that he "will not lightly or casually exercise the power under federal bankruptcy law to impair pensions," which I am fairly confident did not offer even the tiniest bit of comfort to Detroit's now-terrified pensioners, given Detroit's obvious and overwhelming insolvency and the reality that one of their largest debts is for pension obligations. To restructure, it would seem, Detroit would have to cut its pensions, and dramatically.</p>

<p>I think there is a substantial possibility that the case will ultimately be decided by the United States Supreme Court, given the overarching importance of the questions involved, and the festering tension between the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/supremacy_clause">Supremacy Clause </a>and the Tenth Amendment. The only Supreme Court precedent on the constitutionality of municipal bankruptcies is now three-quarters of a century old, involving a pair of Depression-era cases sitting on each side of the 1937 divide (inspired by FDR's infamous court-packing plan) in the Supreme Court's war with FDR over the New Deal. The Court first held in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2540787575983543061">Ashton v. Cameron County Water Improvement</a> that the municipal bankruptcy law that Congress had enacted did violate State sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment. After Congress passed a minutely modified law, the Court then held that the law did not violate the Tenth Amendment in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10936201341518779934">United States v. Bekins</a>. Whether <span class="casename">Bekins</span> is still good law, especially after <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9243582117703452379">New York v. United States</a>, and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10894716839911389166">Printz v. United States</a>, is at the very least a non-frivolous question, and especially given the current composition of the court. Time will tell.</p>

<p>The Detroit case is one of the most important bankruptcy cases in decades. It is the poster child for testing whether and in what circumstances financially distressed cities&#151which are legion&#151can restructure their debts under chapter 9 and, most particularly, whether and how they can restructure their pension obligations. While it is somewhat difficult to generalize as to the pension question, given the wide variety in the ways in which the states recognize, enforce, and protect public pension obligations, much can be learned from the Detroit case. Notably, Michigan (supposedly) has one of the strongest state laws for safeguarding pensions&#151it is written into the state constitution, as noted above, which provides: "The accrued financial benefits of each pension plan and retirement system of the state and its political subdivisions shall be a contractual obligation thereof which shall not be diminished or impaired thereby." Thus, in a nutshell, if Detroit's pensions can be modified in bankruptcy, then virtually no public municipal pensions are safe, no matter how structured. State pensions, though, are not affected, because there is no provision in the federal Bankruptcy Code for a state to file bankruptcy; rather, only subdivisions of states are eligible for bankruptcy relief, as a statutory matter.</p>

<p>One uninitiated in the mysterious sleight-of-hand of legal reasoning might be quite puzzled in trying to grasp how, exactly, it can be that pensions protected as sacrosanct by a state's constitution could be slashed in a bankruptcy case, especially with the Tenth Amendment lurking in the background. Perhaps to fully understand, one would need to be channeling Joseph Heller's Yossarian in Catch-22. Let me explain. For most types of debts, the constitutionality of impairing and restructuring debts in a case pursuant to a federal bankruptcy law is beyond contest, because of the specific authorization given to Congress in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei">Article I</a>, section 8, clause 4 of the US Constitution to enact "uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies." And usually, because of the Supremacy Clause, federal law plainly trumps state law. However, that logic won't carry the day for the Detroit situation, because the US government cannot cut Michigan state pensions for Detroit workers in a bankruptcy without Michigan's consent, because that would violate the Tenth Amendment. That is, the Tenth Amendment trumps the Bankruptcy Clause. So, Congress cannot just pass a bankruptcy law that would include cutting state pensions; i.e., the feds don't have the power. Nor can the Michigan state government cut the pensions, because the state constitution won't let it. So, the state also doesn't have the power to cut the pensions. A sane person (who, as we saw in the book Catch-22, would be compelled to fly dangerous combat missions, because you can only be excused from flying missions if you are crazy, and if you don't want to fly the dangerous missions, you're obviously not crazy) might thus conclude that if the feds can't do it, and the state can't do it, well, then it can't be done. Who else is there? Never fear, legal legerdemain is here.</p>

<p>The trick is, basically, for each side (the feds and the state) to pass the buck back to the other. That way neither side appears to be authorizing the actual pension-cutting, but viewed from each side, it looks like the other is doing it.  Confused? You should be. But so far, it works. Specifically, the Tenth Amendment dodge for municipal bankruptcies approved long ago by the court in is that all is copacetic if the use of federal bankruptcy for a state's municipality is specifically authorized by the state. In short, the feds aren't making the state go through a bankruptcy restructuring. It's the state's choice to do it. So no Tenth Amendment problem. Fine.</p>

<p>But if that is so, then surely, sane person (e.g., unexcused combat pilot) might protest, the state is on the hook, and (as applied to the Detroit case), Michigan is violating its own state constitution if it authorizes Detroit to file a federal bankruptcy case under chapter 9 in which Detroit pensions will be slashed. To be eligible for chapter 9 bankruptcy, the federal Bankruptcy Code requires in section 109(c)(2) that the municipal debtor be "specifically authorized ... to be a debtor under such chapter by state law, or by a governmental officer or organization empowered by State law to authorize such entity to be a debtor under such chapter." And Michigan did so authorize, in <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(1dljlaujqvs4wq552cohvj55))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectname=mcl-act-436-of-2012">Public Act 436</a> (which had just become effective in March 2013). In the Detroit case, the emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, exercised his authority under that law to recommend a bankruptcy filing and request the governor's approval for Detroit to file bankruptcy, which Governor Snyder did on July 18, 2013, without imposing any contingencies. So, that must mean, our sad sane person would reason, that the State of Michigan then is effecting the pension slash, and that must violate the pension clause in the state constitution, right? No, no, how silly, the judge would (and did) respond: the state isn't doing the cutting; that is being done under the auspices of the feds, who have the power under the Bankruptcy Clause and the Supremacy Clause to impair contractual debts. Indeed, the judge said, once the state has consented to federal bankruptcy, it cannot (because of the Supremacy Clause) tell the feds which debts are and which are not susceptible to being modified. Perhaps that is true. But the reality is that (because of the Tenth Amendment) the federal bankruptcy law, in all its apparently immutable and unchangeable glory, could only be triggered in Detroit's case if the state of Michigan gave the green light. And it is that green light signal, I submit, which then must violate the Michigan constitution. Logically, even Yossarian would complain that either the feds are violating the Tenth Amendment or the state is violating the state constitution.</p>

<p>This would all make for a fun and fascinating mind game, but for the cruel reality that the lives of many thousands of human beings, who labored dutifully in the Motor City for decades, comfortable, at least, in the belief that their constitutionally guaranteed pension would be there when they retired, are being ruined. These are not really "consensual" creditors. They trusted the state of Michigan, which supposedly guaranteed their pensions. And the feds cannot, because of the Tenth Amendment, make Michigan renege on that promise. But if Judge Rhodes' ruling stands (which I suspect it will, unless the Supreme Court has a change of heart about the continued legitimacy of its reasoning in <span class="casename">Bekins</span>), those pensioners will lose. This is a human tragedy, and it is wrong. Not only that, but if the Detroit reasoning stands, then we can expect a flood of municipal bankruptcy cases across the country, gleefully seeking to eviscerate pension rights of people who no longer can do anything about it. However you look at it, that should not happen.</p>

The first is normative: it's wrong. The second is pragmatic: by departing from the truth you weave a tangled web that may later trip you up.</p>

<p>The US government created the tangled web in which <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/appeals-court-upholds-conviction-of-former-guantanamo-detainee.php">Ahmed Ghailani</a> found himself, by departing from due process principles.  </p>

<p>Ghailani was first regarded as an accused criminal who would have been entitled to the constitutional due process protections afforded every criminal defendant. He was then treated as an <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/dod-says-14-high-value-guantanamo.php">enemy combatant</a> with no rights at all (<a href="/paperchase/2009/07/ex-guantanamo-detainee-lawyers-request.php">interrogated</a> at a black site for over two years before being transferred to <a href="/feature/featured/guantanamo/">Guantanamo Bay</a> for over two and a half years). Then the present administration switched tracks again and decided to try him on a thirteen-year old indictment <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/us-embassy-bombing-suspect-to-be-tried.php">in federal court</a>. </p>

<p>When Ghailani <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/ex-guantanamo-detainee-lawyers-seek.php">complained</a> that his <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment">right to a speedy trial</a> had been violated by the cumulative time that had passed between his indictment and his trial, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/appeals-court-upholds-conviction-of-former-guantanamo-detainee.php">unwilling</a> to conclude that the government had tripped itself up. </p>

<p>That the court rejected Ghailani's constitutional claim is not surprising, given the previous parsimonious state of constitutional speedy trial law. (See my book, <em>The Right to a Speedy and Public Trial</em> (2006) for an account of the contortions of speedy trial law.) What is novel and disturbing about this decision is that the court reconciled the different paradigms the government had employed by embracing the extralegal threads within the legal web. A departure from principle&#8212;indefinite detention for the purposes of interrogation&#8212;itself became the justification for departure from another principle&#8212;the right to a speedy trial. This is yet another way in which the notion that we are at "war" with terrorism in anything more than a metaphorical sense is wreaking havoc with our justice system. <br />
  <br />
<strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>At his 2010 trial in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, Ghailani was <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/ex-guantanamo-detainee-acquitted-on-all-but-one-charge.php">convicted</a> of conspiracy to destroy US buildings and property [<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/844">18 U.S.C. 844(f)</a>], for his role in procuring and assembling components of the explosive devices used in the 1998 bombing of the US embassy in Dar es Salaam. The jury found that his conduct caused the death of a person other than a conspirator [18 U.S.C. 844(f)(3)], and also acquitted him on 281 additional counts. </p>

<p>This was nasty business, but our due process principles have never been reserved only for nice people. <br />
 <br />
Ghailani had been indicted for these activities in 1998, along with other defendants, but he was not captured until July 2004 (after <a href="/feature/featured/911/">9/11</a>, notably). For over two years after his capture, the CIA detained him at a location the court identified only as being outside the US, subjecting him to both "standard" and "enhanced" interrogation techniques to seek intelligence from him about terrorist networks. The court did not describe the conditions of his confinement or his interrogations, blandly noting that many details of this CIA interrogation program remain classified. The court also reported that the interrogation of Ghailani had been "effective in obtaining useful information." (A less vague discussion of that assertion was available, according to the court, in a classified supplement to the opinion.)</p>

<p>In September 2006, the CIA transferred Ghailani to the custody of the US Department of Defense. He was sent to Guantanamo where, in March 2008, the government brought charges against him for war crimes in connection with both the Dar es Salaam bombing and Ghailani's alleged work with al Qaeda between 1998 and 2004, when he was captured. He was to be tried before a military commission. In May 2009, however, the Obama administration changed course and decided to try Ghailani on the 1998 indictment in the Southern District of New York. </p>

<p><strong>Speedy Trial Arithmetic</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11206207816951312495">Barker v. Wingo</a> balancing test for evaluating a constitutional speedy trial claim encompasses four factors. The first threshold question is the length of the delay. The period of time between 1998 and 2004 does not count under speedy trial law because Ghailani was not available to be tried due to his own actions. But the almost five years he spent at a black site and then at Guantanamo are a different matter. The court appropriately found that those five years are a long enough time to raise judicial eyebrows.</p>

<p>A second factor, whether the accused has demanded a speedy trial, was appropriately found to be irrelevant in the circumstances here. Throughout that time, Ghailani was demanding his release and dismissal of the indictment.</p>

<p>The third <span class="casename">Barker</span> factor is prejudice, which can mean that the accused is suffering 1) oppressive pretrial incarceration, 2) anxiety and concern about the delayed trial, or 3) prejudice to the ability to mount a defense at trial. Ghailani certainly suffered during his detention, but the court found that his detention at the black site was not caused by the pendency of his trial. His detention was not, in other words, "pretrial" incarceration, but rather detention caused by the government's desire to interrogate him rather than try him. The court found that Ghailani had not shown that he had been prejudiced in his defense at trial by the passage of time (dimming of defense witnesses' memories, loss of exculpatory evidence, etc.) and also found that any advantage the government gained against Ghailani through its interrogations was not cognizable within the speedy trial calculus.</p>

<p>The decisive factor in the analysis was the reason for the delay. Under speedy trial law, a quintessential bad reason for delay is that the government is trying to gain a tactical advantage by waiting out the clock. As the court noted, there is no prior case law on the question of whether the government's desire to hold someone for interrogation in lieu of trial should count as a good or a bad reason. The court found, setting a significant precedent for the future, that the government's decision to interrogate Ghailani for years rather than bring him to trial was reasonable because it was in the public interest. The court excused the government from choosing between national security goals and criminal justice goals, saying that the courts should be deferential to the government's policy decisions in this area. The court went on to approve the length of Ghailani's detention as reasonable&#8212;at least for speedy trial analysis purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Ab(ju)dication</strong> </p>

<p>This whitewashing of the government's course of conduct follows a string of earlier decisions where our courts have resolutely refused to sit in judgment on the legality of the government's extraordinary rendition and harsh interrogation programs. See <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1060445994998403010">Mohammed v. Jeppesen Dataplan, 614 F.3d 1070 (9th Cir. 2010)</a>, cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 2442 (2011) (claim arising out of detention and torture dismissed on the basis of the state secrets privilege); <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1089767075337028984">El-Masri v. United States, 479 F.3d 296 (4th Cir. 2007)</a>, cert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 373 (2007) (same); <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13093177374759375473">Arar v. Ashcroft, 585 F.3d 559 (2d Cir. 2009)</a> (en banc), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 3409 (2010) (claim arising out of extraordinary rendition and torture dismissed for failure to state a <span class="casename">Bivens</span> claim). These claims of shocking government misconduct have been sliced and diced so fine, and filtered through so many layers of standing doctrine, state secrets privilege, etc., that no American court has ever found an opportunity to declare that indefinite detention and "harsh interrogation" without due process, as happened to Ghailani, is morally and legally wrong.</p>

<p>Unlike the refusals to address the merits of the claims in those cases, this new Second Circuit decision actually accepts the conduct in question&#8212;over two years of detention and interrogation in a black site under undisclosed conditions&#8212;as reasonable. To be sure, this decision is bound by the limited framework of speedy trial law. The detention is only deemed reasonable enough to count as a positive justification on the government's side of the ledger. But this judicial imprimatur on deplorable government conduct, added to the disdainful opinions in the civil cases attempting to seek redress, sets an unfortunate precedent.</p>

<p>What is ironic about this decision is that the Second Circuit evidently believed it was acting in the best interests of Ghailani and others in extralegal detention: the probable result of finding this prosecution time-barred would most likely have been the continued indefinite detention of Ghailani outside the criminal justice system, either without trial or subject to a military commission trial for war crimes. Accepting the earlier period of detention as reasonable was the price of allowing the lesser evil of a due process prosecution.</p>

<p>This may be a form of empathy, but missing in this opinion, as in the earlier extraordinary rendition cases, is even a moment of articulated empathy for what our prisoners in black sites and in Guantanamo have experienced. </p>

<p>Also missing from all of these opinions is the recognition that our elected officials have shown themselves unlikely to hold investigations or hearings to assess accountability for our taking the black site/harsh interrogation path in the first place and creating this infinitely tangled web. If the courts continue to ab(ju)dicate and defer, will acceptance of our past conduct undermine our resolve to avoid such extreme departures from our principles in the future?</p>
