		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/jbalkin/index.htm">Jack Balkin</a>, Yale Law School:<br /><br />&quot;I liked Bush&#39;s <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/01/20050120-1.html">second inaugural address</a>, which argued for the cause of freedom around the world, very much.  I also liked his <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/inaugural-address.html">first inaugural address</a>, which sounded very moderate, spoke of justice, tolerance, and aid to the poor, and pledged to work together with everyone.  However, I also remember that his performance in is first term reflected very little of his pretty words.<br /><br />My view about Bush&#39;s second inaugural is quite similar.  Who could be against promoting the cause of liberty around the world?  There were phrases in this speech that could have come from Woodrow Wilson or, for that matter, Jimmy Carter.  The real questions are (1) whether Bush means what he says, and (2) whether he has the competence to carry out his promises.<br /><br />After all, we are currently in a very difficult war in Iraq because Bush insisted that he knew what he was doing in responding to a threat from Saddam&#39;s weapons of mass destruction, weapons that turned out not to have been there.  As it became increasingly clear that the weapons were nowhere to be found the President shifted gears and informed us that all along his primary and real goal had been to bring democracy to Iraq and hence to the Middle East.<br /><br />But let us assume that the President is completely sincere, and that the experience of 9/11 and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq has shown him the light, so that he truly does understand that the promotion of freedom around the world is and should be his primary goal.  Good for him.  Still, if I were to trust anyone to carry out this goal, I would not choose George W. Bush based on his first term performance, a performance that has sufficiently stretched our economic and military capacities that we are practically unsuited to make realistic threats of force anywhere else in the world that would make our diplomacy effective. The problem is that because of Iraq, all we can do is talk big, but do little.  Very much, I fear, like Bush&#39;s second inaugural itself.&quot; [January 21, 2005; <a href="http://balkin.blogspot.com">Balkinization</a> has the <a href="http://balkin.blogspot.com/2005/01/bushs-second-inaugural-address.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.tm/">Michael Froomkin</a>, University of Miami School of Law:<br /><br />&quot;I am very reluctantly coming to believe that there&#39;s  about a 50% chance that a senior administration official will face a war crime trial either for ordering or condoning torture, or for the excessive bombing and <a href="http://www.apfn.net/messageboard/11-20-04/discussion.cgi.4.html">civilian casualties in Iraq</a>.   I think it&#39;s most likely to happen after the official leaves office.  It might be in absentia.  It could be in Belgium, or in Germany, or (least likely) an international ad hoc tribunal.  Already, <a title="JURIST - Paper Chase: Rumsfeld cancels Germany trip under war crimes cloud" src="/paperchase/2005/01/rumsfeld-cancels-germany-trip-under.php">SecDef Rumsfeld has had to cancel a trip to Germany </a> to <a href="http://www.expatica.com/source/site_article.asp?subchannel_id=52&story_id=16014&name=Rumsfeld+scraps+Munich+visit+over+war+probe">avoid the risk of prosecution</a>.<br /><br />Belgium recently changed its law to make it very difficult to launch war crimes prosecutions against foreign officials, and the supreme court there <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/english/0,3367,1433_A_978973,00.html">recently dismissed an attempted lawsuit against Bush</a>.  But meanwhile, a significant segment of Belgian public opinion appears to subscribe to the sentiment symbolized by this Wanted poster issued by a Belgian activist group:<br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.motherearth.org/bushwanted/wantedposter.gif" /></center><br /><br />Recall that the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/home.html&l=en">International Criminal Court</a> <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/about/officialjournal/Rome_Statute_120704-EN.pdf">agreement (.pdf)</a>  (to which the US is not a party) would prohibit these sorts of trials against our officials so long as we set our own house in order.  But we are not doing that.<br /><br />I wonder how long it will take the new Iraqi government to join the <span class="caps">ICC</span>?  Joining would give the <span class="caps">ICC </span>jurisdiction over all actions on Iraqi soil dating after the accession.  Regardless of whether they were committed by Iraqis.  Then again, joining the <span class="caps">ICC </span>without agreeing to exclude jurisdiction against US forces would run Iraq into <a href="http://www.unausa.org/newindex.asp?place=http://www.unausa.org/policy/newsactionalerts/advocacy/icc_timeline.asp">retaliation from the US</a>: the US has <a href="http://www.amicc.org/docs/Newsday%2010-17-04.pdf">halted military assistance to several nations that have refused to sign &lsquo;Article 98 agreements&rsquo; by which they promise not to surrender US nationals to the <span class="caps">ICC</span></a>.<br /><br /><strong>Update</strong>: If I had to bet right now, I&rsquo;d bet it&rsquo;s the wanton harm to civilians (which I suspect is vastly underreported in the US) that would be most likely to trigger a trial, not the prisoner abuse.  But should <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/1/23/211712/764">these allegations of systematic rape in captivity, coupled with claims that the Pentagon is stonewalling by trying to avoid inquiries</a> prove to be true, that might alter the odds.<br /><br /><span class="caps">PS. </span> As noted in the comments, my intent in this particular post was to be positive, not normative.  Under what circumstances if any a foreign war crimes trial of a former US President or Cabinet official could ever be be a good thing is very hard for me to think coherently about, as I so passionately want the US to act in a way that makes the whole question absurd.&quot; [January 24, 2005: <a href="http://www.discourse.net">Discourse.net</a> has the <a href="http://www.discourse.net/archives/2005/01/war_crimes_trials_a_cloud_on_the_horizon.html">post</a>]<br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Anderson [American U.]: Does it matter who you are interrogating?</title>
		<link>https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2005/01/anderson-american-u-does-it-matter-who/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.wcl.american.edu/faculty/anderson/">Kenneth Anderson</a>, Washington College of Law American University:<br /><br />&quot;One thing that is missing in the whole torture-interrogation debate is the question of who you are interrogating. Can you use a different level of interrogation on Zarqawi, for example - knowing it is Zarqawi - than you could on someone who might indeed turn out to be the peasant shepherd? In my view, the answer must plainly be yes. But this would require a regime that assigned different levels of possible roughness of interrogation - while remaining above an agreed-upon standard of torture - depending upon what is known about levels of involvement in terrorism. That, in turn, would really require a separate legal and intelligence regime for dealing with terrorists. Many countries have exactly such laws, and they are found extensively in Europe. I have reluctantly come to believe that the United States should enact such a regime for dealing with non-US citizens believed involved with terrorism. For the same reasons that many European states have enacted such special regimes, I believe that the United States needs such a special regime as well - although, among other limitations, I would confine it to non-US citizens. One finding in such a system would be probable level of involvement, which would fall within a protocol for acceptable levels of pressure in interrogation.<br /><br />First and foremost, however, I think the United States needs a thorough public debate on the issue - it cannot languish buried within the Justice Department, intelligence community, Department of Defense, and so on. Those who must deal with these questions with real detainees must have guidance, so that it is both clear what they may do and what it is that crosses the line - otherwise they will tempted to do whatever they feel like or, alternatively, do nothing for fear of prosecution. It is entirely insufficient simply to refer to the Torture Convention or its homologous US legislation; the phrases provide certain standards, but that cannot substitute for judgments about particular, concrete practices.<br /><br />With respect to Gonzalez - all said and done, I support his confirmation. This despite the fact that his office made very important mistakes, both procedurally and substantively.<br /><br />Procedurally, it was wrong for the Administration to have cut its own professional military lawyers out of the loop, having a group of Administration lawyers without experience in the laws of war leafing through the Geneva Conventions for the first time. I understand the procedural problem - it only grows plainer and plainer the extent to which large swaths of the State Department and CIA believe that if they are not precisely a government unto themselves, they are at least a policy unto themselves - but there had never been an indication of that kind with respect to DOD. Those lawyers could have saved Gonzalez&#39;s office much grief by ackowledging that of course the Geneva Conventions applied to detainees - but that under those Geneva Conventions, Al Qaeda and the Taliban are unprivileged combatants - and that detainees would receive the informal, unappealable three officer hearing per 1997 DOD regulations to determine their status, but nothing more.  <br /><br />Instead, it seems to me, Administration bet the farm with a far fetched theory of the so-called unitary power of the executive in matters of war - essentially telling the Supreme Court, when it came to it, that the Court had to butt out on Constitutional grounds, not on the grounds that the Administration&#39;s view of international law was legally defensible.  When the constitutional law theory crashed and burned - it did not even garner support from Justice Scalia - it took down with it the quite defensible view of international law and applicability of the Geneva Conventions.  This was one substantive mistake that is shared by the Justice Department and the White House counsel.<br /><br />A second, of course, was the first torture memo.  It held, quite obviously wrongly, that behavior was not torture if, in effect, the Executive said it had good reasons to do it.  The Torture Convention does not tell how to draw lines about much interrogation behavior - one entirely obvious point, however, is that the purpose of even having a Torture Convention is to say that if behavior is torture, however, defined, then you can&#39;t do it even if you have good reasons to do it.  This was an extraordinarily serious error; it has been reversed, of course, by the new memo just out in recent days. <br /><br />That said, it is far too easy to forget the situation in the months after 9-11.  It is also far too easy to forget that the first torture memo was a response to questions about a detainee whose identity was only too well known; no goatherd or shepherd, he.  It is ever easy for civil liberties groups and human rights NGOs, with no responsibility for the common security and, indeed, scant regard for it, to shove all those issues to one side.  In the name of protecting the human rights of someone whose status as a terrorist is entirely established, they cannot be shoved to one side, however, which is one reason I favor having a formal legal regime of terrorist status as essentially a state of exception (as is amply permitted in international law). <br /><br />It also bears noting how we got into a situation in which standards and acceptable/unacceptable behavior were being defined for the first time.  The evisceration of clandestine services and the more than clean hands policies from the 1970s forward left the United States in a position, first, in which it had no experience in dealing with interrogations, standards, procedures, limits, permissions, nothing.  This is a <em>fault</em> arising from the desuetude of the past twenty years in intelligence matters - it is <em>not</em> a virtue to walk around in the easy times holding your hands high, Carter-like, and saying, they&#39;re clean, they&#39;re clean! if it means that in times when gathering intelligence for the protection of lives in your political community you have no idea how to do it, and are starting from scratch - including from moral scratch.  You will make mistakes in doing that - serious moral mistakes - and the Administration did so.  But its mistakes, as with so much of what led up to 9-11 and its aftermath, are at the door of previous administrations stretching back several decades. <br /><br />If I were Gonzalez, I would respond to charges of having authorized torture by retorting that there were no precedents, no best practices, no experience, nothing to go by in what should be considered acceptable and what not, because previous adminstrations and Congresses, naively believing that days requiring actionable intelligence for the protection of the American people ended with the Church hearings, had deliberately erased any institutional memory - either for what might permissibly be done and for what, at the level of actual practices, violate the law and morality.  Following the admonitions of the ICRC, Human Rights Watch, or Amnesty International to do nothing that might go beyond the POW standard of &quot;name, rank and serial number,&quot; was (is) not an option - but there was no institutional memory of what <em>was</em> - and if another major terrorist attack occurred, the watchdogs of human rights and civil liberties would - and will - shrug their shoulders and say, not our problem.<br /><br />(One might usefully think back to the first experiences of Attorney General Janet Reno.  A new, inexperienced Attorney General, tested three months into office by Waco.  She ordered the use of CS gas against unprotected infants, deliberately targeting the infants, because, as she said to the press, they could not fit into the gas masks that the adults had.  Her party fell over itself to excuse the first female attorney general; all those infant deaths conveniently forgotten.  If <em>that</em> is the standard, then Gonzalez&#39;s hearings should be quite short.)&quot; [January 5, 2005; <a href="http://kennethandersonlawofwar.blogspot.com">Law of War and Just War Theory Blog</a> has the <a href="http://kennethandersonlawofwar.blogspot.com/2005/01/does-it-matter-who-you-are.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.wayne.edu/faculty/profiles/henning_peter.html">Peter Henning</a>, Wayne State University Law School:<br /><br />&quot;With the opening statements in the trials of Bernie Ebbers and Richard Scrushy out of the way -- on the same day no less -- the question arises whether either one will testify in his defense.&nbsp; Reports on the opening arguments gave no indication one way or the other, which is not surprising because defense counsel need to keep their options open and do not want to overpromise in the opening statement.&nbsp; There is no &quot;rule&quot; regarding whether a white collar defendant should (or should not) testify at trial because so much depends on the type of evidence the government will introduce, the defendant&#39;s prior statements, and how well the person will come across to a jury.&nbsp; On the last point, a deep-pocket defendant can afford to have a mock jury observe a test-run of a cross-examination of the defendant to see how the person responds to tough questioning, although that is not fool-proof.&nbsp; Frank Quattrone came across poorly at his first trial, and was convicted in his retrial, having testified both times.&nbsp; Neither Martha Stewart nor co-defendant Peter Bacanovic testified in their trial, to no avail there.<br /><br />The opening statement in the Ebbers trial included the assertion by defense counsel Reid Weingarten that &quot;[t]here are zillions of documents in this case and their ain&#39;t one smoking gun.&quot;&nbsp; The clear focus of the defense is on the credibility of the government&#39;s main witness, former WorldCom CFO Scott Sullivan, including hints that Sullivan&#39;s marital infidelity will be used against him (earlier post <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/2005/01/crossexamining_.html">here</a>), and Ebbers&#39; lack of involvement in accounting issues.&nbsp; According to a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/26/business/26ebbers.html?oref=login">New York Times</a> article (Jan. 26), Weingarten asserted that Sullivan was the mastermind of the fraud and &quot;is more than a liar, but a poseur.&quot; [NB: I think I missed that one, and the definition of &quot;poseur&quot; is &quot;One who affects a particular attribute, attitude, or identity to impress or influence others.&quot; Did the jury pick up on it?]&nbsp; The &quot;honest-but-ignorant CEO&quot; defense that will be offered, coupled with the lack of documentation linking Ebbers to the fraudulent accounting, leads me to think that Ebbers will not be called to testify unless Sullivan comes across especially well in his testimony.&nbsp; There does not seem to be as much for Ebbers to refute or explain, and of course a defendant asserting that he was ignorant of the happenings at his company risks coming across to the jury as less-than-honest, effectively scuttling the defense.<br /><br />I think Scrushy&#39;s case presents a different calculus.&nbsp; The government intends to call a number of former HealthSouth executives who are cooperating in exchange for reduced sentences, including all five CFOs the company had since its creation.&nbsp; The sheer weight of that evidence may compel Scrushy to testify to establish his defense that they are all liars and kept him in the dark. The plea agreements alone are unlikely to undermine the credibility of that many witnesses.&nbsp; When everyone around you is claimed to be a liar, the jury may well expect that Scrushy will explain how it was possible he never knew about the fraudulent accounting, or at least how he was kept in the dark.&nbsp;<br /><br />I don&#39;t hold myself out as much of a prognosticator, and this is all armchair lawyering before any of the evidence has come in.&nbsp; I think it is more likely that Scrushy will testify than Ebbers, but it would not surprise me if both did not testify.&nbsp; Any thoughts?&quot;    [January 26, 2005: <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/">White Collar Crime Blog</a> has the <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/2005/01/will_scrushy_or.html">post.</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Attorney General is in part a prosecutor. But the Attorney General also has the duty to see that justice is done. The precise manner in which these two duties should be combined is subject to disagreement.

		<title>Tokaji [Ohio State]: The Future of Election Reform</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/faculty/facultyprofiles/tokaji.html">Daniel Tokaji</a>, Moritz College of Law, Ohio State University:<br /><br />&quot;While some advocates are looking to Congress to fix some of the problems that emerged in the 2004 election, <a href="http://www.electionline.org/index.jsp?page=Newsletter%20Jan%2013%202005">this report</a> from electionline.org suggests that they may have better luck in the states. House and Senate staffers suggest that Congress isn&#39;t in much of a mood to reopen the Help America Vote Act. The story also suggests that more legislation, even at the state level, may not be the answer:<blockquote>Legislative action, said election officials, does little to address apprehension over the lack of voting system technology standards, looming HAVA deadlines, costs incurred to meet these deadlines, and the future of funding for statewide registration databases and voting systems. It now appears that there is little possibility that any of these cost concerns will be met in the coming year.</blockquote><strong>My take:</strong> While I wouldn&#39;t rule out the possibility of federal legislative action, it&#39;s not at all clear to me that Congress is the most promising venue for improving many of the problems with our election system. There are clearly changes to be made, particularly in such areas as provisional voting and registration databases. The Election Assistance Commission, created by HAVA, has a critical role to play in addressing these problems. Part of its responsibilities include funding research and making recommendations as to best practices. <br /><br />Passing federal legislation setting specific rules could give rise to unintended and unfortunate consequences. A case in point is the proposed legislation to require that all electronic voting machines generate a contemporaneous paper record (CPR), euphemistically known as the &quot;voter verified paper audit trail.&quot; It&#39;s far from clear that this will appreciably enhance voting security, given that it will only function effectively if the integrity of the paper records can be assured and -- most important -- that the paper ballots are actually counted at the end of the day. Moreover, requiring any particular security fix will have the effect of locking that technology in place -- discouraging innovation, including the development of technologies that may turn out to be much more effective in promoting security and transparency.<br /><br />What the CPR can certainly be expected to do is to discourage counties from moving to electronic technology, as has recently happened in Ohio which passed a CPR requirement last year. That legislation precipitated Secretary of State Blackwell&#39;s decision to mandate that counties go to precinct-count optical scans. The big losers from these developments are likely to be people with disabilities, since there&#39;s no certified technology that can meet the requirements of state law and it&#39;s doubtful at best whether it can be implemented in time for HAVA&#39;s 2006 deadline for providign accessible technology.<br /><br />Congress <em>should</em> stay far away from mandating this or any other specific security fix. What it should do is to fully fund HAVA, and provide the resources that the EAC needs to accomplish the worthy goal of equal voting access for all. It would also be worthwhile to explore the possibility of giving the EAC or some other federal agency responsibility for setting standards. This might have the effect of taking away chief election officials&#39; power to engage in partisan decisinmaking. But to enact rigid election adminstration rules into federal law is a dangerous game, one that could well end up doing more harm than good.&quot; [January 14, 2005; <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/blogs/tokaji">Equal Vote</a> has the <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/blogs/tokaji/2005/01/future-of-election-reform.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.tm/">Michael Froomkin</a>, University of Miami School of Law:<br /><br />&quot;The US holds maybe hundreds of non-citizens, all captured abroad (we are told), incarcerated in Guantanamo and in other secret prisons around the world.  The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A41475-2005Jan1.html">Bush administration plans to hold them up to forever</a>.<br /><br />Of course, there is a difference between the Soviet Gulag, which was aimed at saboteurs, dissidents, or people who somehow got on the wrong end of officialdom, and the US Gulag, which is we are told aimed merely at the foreign version of the same.  <br /><br />Whether the creation of a secret archipelago of prisons and coercive questioning facilities will inevitably fail to be deployed against US citizens is a question that one is not permitted to ask in public, as it is too far outside the permitted consensus.  So put that issue aside.<br /><br />Ask instead whether from a moral, political, or even legal point of view, the fact that only foreigners are incarcerated for life without trial (or indeed any rights, it appears), at the complete and unconstrained pleasure of the super-imperial presidency, gives us much in the way of bragging rights over the former Soviet Union.<br /><br />What&rsquo;s that?  Our gulag is much smaller?  And our policy <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/01/politics/01torture.html">this week</a> is not to torture people, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/01/national/01gitmo.html">the last two years</a> notwithstanding?  And that nice Mr. Bush (with Justice Thomas&rsquo;s endorsement, to his and the Court&rsquo;s eternal shame) promises that all the people being held really deserve it, so who needs complications like a trial?  <br /><br />Well, that&rsquo;s alright then!&quot; [January 2, 2005; <a href="http://www.discourse.net">Discourse.net</a> has the <a href="http://www.discourse.net/archives/2005/01/the_american_gulag.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://anthonydamato.law.northwestern.edu/">Anthony D&#39;Amato</a>, Northwestern University School of Law:<br /><br />&quot;Although I have been very critical of the President, I write to report how thrilled I was to hear his second-term acceptance speech.  He may not have written it, but he ratified it and spoke it and that&#39;s good enough for me.  <br /><br />&quot;We are led, by events and common sense, to one conclusion: The survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands. The best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world.&quot;  <br /><br />Is there anything more important than that?  If America were an island surrounded by oppression everywhere, we could hardly hope to sustain our freedoms at home.<br /><br />&quot;Across the generations we have proclaimed the imperative of self-government because no one is fit to be a master and no one deserves to be a slave &quot;<br /><br />The best operational statement of both of the above positions was, I think, put forth by the philosopher Karl Popper.  He said that where a people can change its own government bloodlessly, we have our highest hope for freedom.  The people&#39;s ability to change their government will produce a government whose highest motivation is to act in the best interests of the people.  States go astray, and they suffer huge losses, when the government declares itself perpetual and acts by force of arms to suppress dissidents.<br /><br />&quot;The great objective of ending tyranny is the concentrated work of generations.&quot;<br /><br />I think Popper would agree that tyranny is our greatest enemy. It&#39;s not communism, or fascism, or peoples&#39; democracies, or whatever; it&#39;s just plain tyranny.  See his &quot;The Open Society and its Enemies.&quot;  <br /><br />&quot;Democratic reformers facing repression, prison, or exile can know: America sees you for who you are: the future leaders of your free country.&quot; <br /><br />On its face, this sentence is no different from American sentiments uttered during the decades of the Cold War.  In that era, we supported democratic dissidents because we were hoping that they would come to power and support our side against the Soviet Union.  Today, however, we don&#39;t have a bi-polar world.  Does the demise of the Soviet Union mean that a sentence uttered forty years ago is different in meaning from a similar sentence uttered today?  I think so.  We can no longer identify a dissident as &quot;democratic&quot; by the simple fact of his or her opposition to the regime in power which is ideologically aligned with the USSR.  Instead, we have to look more closely at the merits of the claim of being a democratic reformer.  I think that this may signal an enormous shift in our foreign policy.<br /><br />&quot;Americans move forward in every generation by reaffirming all that is good and true that came before; ideals of justice and conduct that are the same yesterday, today, and forever.&quot;   <br /><br />I don&#39;t think anyone can subscribe in any deep and committed sense to ideals of justice and morality that they think are relative to time and place.  I think that these ideals, in order to have any non-trivial meaning, must be the same yesterday, today, and forever.  I acknowledge that anti-relativism in matters of morality can lead to excesses of self-righteousness, and I can understand those who say that our invasion of Iraq was an example of such excess.  (But I would deny that shifting from absolute to relative morality is necessary to cure the Iraq problem, and I reaffirm my public position of two years ago that toppling Saddam Hussein was the morally correct thing to do.)<br /><br />&quot;We go forward with complete confidence in the eventual triumph of freedom. Not because history runs on the wheels of inevitability; it is human choices that move events. Not because we consider ourselves a chosen nation; God moves and chooses as He wills. We have confidence because freedom is the permanent hope of mankind, the hunger in dark places, the longing of the soul.&quot;<br /><br />I&#39;m a lot less confident about it than President Bush.  Enslavement could spread across the world, and we have to fight actively, to disagree, to speak out, to act, always and everywhere, eternally vigilant, to keep tyranny from spreading. Once enslavement is in place, human freedom could be lost for thousands and thousands of years.  Although I am inspired by the last of the quoted sentences, I don&#39;t believe that history happens because we have hopes, hungers, or longings.  I&#39;m not at all sure that freedom is the natural condition of mankind.  We could discover to our shock that enslavement of the few (who control the weapons) over the many is the natural default position.  &quot;Human choices move events,&quot; but we cannot afford to allow to others the hugely mistaken choice of tyrannical government.&quot; [January 21, 2005]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://anthonydamato.law.northwestern.edu/ ">Anthony D&#39;Amato</a>, Northwestern University Law School:<br /><br />&quot;Although the N.Y. Times and Washington Post have been admirably accurate in  reporting the standard legal issues, they have overlooked the single most telling point in the debate about Gonzales, perhaps because of its subtlety.<br /><br />We start by observing that whenever the Department of Justice gives any legal advice to a president about a policy that might violate US law, the DOJ attorneys are placed in a difficult position.  What they tell the president, if he continues the policy, might be quoted in a future U.S. criminal proceeding against the president personally.<br /><br />Suppose the president wants to know whether what we are doing to detainees in Guantanamo or Abu Ghraib violates the criminal laws of the United States.  If the DOJ were to write in a memo that those actions violate US law, some enterprising prosecutor and grand jury might return a criminal indictment against the President and/or his advisers for condoning those acts.<br /><br />Thus a DOJ&#39;s memo can itself change the legal landscape.  It could place the United States, through the prestige of the DOJ, on record as saying that what the Executive Branch has been doing is a crime.  Although a future court might not necessarily give great deference to that DOJ memo, we never know for sure what a court might do.  Indeed, such a DOJ memo would not only speak to the DOJ&#39;s interpretation of the law, but it would also constitute notice to the president and his advisers that what they have been doing is illegal.<br /><br />Placing the President and his advisers in personal jeopardy would clearly be one of the most important things that Albert Gonzales, as counsel to the White House, would do his utmost to prevent.  We know that Mr. Gonzales by-passed the normal channels of the DOJ for obtaining legal advice relating to the Executive Branch, he talked directly with the lawyers who were drafting the memos, he asked them questions and pointed out problems to them.  Did he urge them to change their interpretive inclination about the law relating to the POW and torture issues so that their revised legal conclusion would help shield and immunize the President and his advisers from criminal prosecution in U.S. courts?<br /><br />John Yoo, now a Professor at Berkeley Law School in California, is in a position to know.  He has admitted that, as a DOJ lawyer, he &quot;worked on and signed the department&#39;s memo on the Geneva Conventions and helped draft the main memo defining torture.&quot;  Yoo&#39;s essay of January 2, 2005, is available <a href="http://aei.org/news/newsID.21770,filter.foreign/news_detail.asp">here</a>.<br /><br />In the middle of Professor Yoo&#39;s essay, in legalistic language that most readers might not bother to parse, he reveals that &quot;Gonzales also observed that denying POW status would limit the prosecution of U.S. officials under a federal law criminalizing a grave breach of the Geneva Conventions.&quot;  What does this convoluted sentence mean?  It means that Mr. Gonzales may have made it clear to the DOJ attorneys drafting the various memos that if they were to conclude that the Taliban and Al Quaeda come within the protection of the Geneva Conventions, or that the policies or practices at Guantanamo and Al Ghraib amount to criminal torture prohibited by U.S. law, they would be placing the President of the United States and his top advisers personally at risk of criminal indictment. Indeed any indictment, irrespective of final outcome, would probably have a huge negative political impact politically and could even result in a change of administrations and a change of legal staff at the DOJ.  In other words, if a zealous prosecutor, including one within the DOJ, were to seek indictments against the President and his advisers, Mr. Gonzales&#39; position, as now revealed by Professor Yoo, was that the DOJ&#39;s legal conclusion in its memos should be modified or changed and rationalized, if necessary, not on legal grounds, but just in order to protect Mr. Gonzales&#39;s clients from prosecution.&quot; [January 6, 2005]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.wayne.edu/faculty/profiles/henning_peter.html">Peter Henning</a>, Wayne State University Law School:<br /><br />&quot;Discussed in the Wed. Jan.26th <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/2005/01/the_prosecution.html">post</a> is the prosecution opening in the case of Tyco executives Dennis Kozlowski and Mark Swartz. Yesterday, the defense responded and it sounds like mens rea, and whether the defendants had the appropriate intent, will be prominent in this case. This is not unusual in a white collar case. As reported in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/28/business/28tyco.html?oref=login">New York Times</a>, &quot;Mr. Stillman [ ] told the jury that Mr. Swartz &#39;had no criminal intent because his intentions were honest. No criminal intent means no crime.&#39;&quot; On the law.com website, is included the following line from the opening of Stephen Kaufman, attorney for Dennis Kozlowsk, who stated, &quot;You tell me how you steal when you sign a promissory note and repay it.&quot;<br /><br />According to <a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1106573741858">law.com</a> :</p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">&quot;Charles Stillman, the lawyer for Swartz, presented the same chart that Assistant Manhattan District Attorney Owen Heimer had used in his opening to detail the major payments in controversy. The prosecutor&#39;s chart had been labeled &quot;thefts.&quot; Stillman&#39;s version had the word &quot;alleged&quot; added to it.&quot;</blockquote>There is nothing better then being able to take another attorney&#39;s demonstrative piece of evidence and use it to your advantage.&nbsp; The ability to turn around opposing counsel&#39;s presentation by using their language or their exhibits can be dangerous (e.g., asking the witness to try out the glove to see if it fits in the OJ Simpson case).&nbsp; But the risk is somewhat minimized when you are not dealing with concrete factual evidence and merely the opposing sides &quot;take&quot; on what happened. We&#39;ll see if this was a good move here, when the prosecution responds come their closing argument.&nbsp;<br /><br />There does, however, appear to be differences in the approach taken from the prior trial. The NYTImes reports:<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">&quot;But lawyers for both defendants, who had appeared to soft-pedal the issue of directors&#39; credibility in the first trial, said that accusations by board members that the two men stole more than $150 million - the basis of the prosecution&#39;s case - were part of a self-serving strategy to protect themselves from shareholder lawsuits.&quot;</p></blockquote>The evidence begins on Monday.&quot;  [January 28, 2005: <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/">White Collar Crime Blog</a> has the <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/2005/01/defense_opening.html">post.</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Henning [Wayne State]: Initial Booker Musings for White Collar Cases</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Peter Henning, Wayne State University Law School:<br /><br />&quot;At the risk of speaking without thoroughly reviewing all the opinions (wading through Justice Scalia&#39;s attack, which includes a reference to &quot;Wonderland&quot;; will have to wait), a couple initial impressions (with quotes).&nbsp; For a more detailed (and learned) assessment of the decision, check out Doug Berman&#39;s postings at <a href="http://sentencing.typepad.com/">Sentencing Law &amp; Policy</a>:<br /><br />1. <em>Blakely</em> (and <em>Apprendi</em>) are real, and the sentencing judge has significant discretion restored <em>at this point in time</em>. According to Justice Stevens&#39; opinion for the majority:</p><blockquote>Indeed, everyone agrees that the constitutional issues presented by these cases would have been avoided entirely if Congress had omitted from the SRA the provisions that make the Guidelines binding on district judges; it is that circumstance that makes the Court&#39;s answer to the second question presented possible. For when a trial judge exercises his discretion to select a specific sentence within a defined range, the defendant has no right to a jury determination of the facts that the judge deems relevant.</blockquote><p dir="ltr">The &quot;defined range&quot; is the key--will Congress constrain judges by imposing more mandatory&nbsp; minimums, or for white collar crimes permit the government to prove a certain amount of loss (intended or actual) and impose a mandatory minimum?&nbsp; Any number of state crimes are based on the value of an item (e.g. larceny of more than $1000 is a felony), and transporting that into the federal statutes is certainly possible.&nbsp; While there are a number of mandatory minimums in the narcotics and weapons areas, there are none that I&#39;m aware of in the more traditional white collar statutes: the fraud statutes (mail, wire, bank, insurance, securities), public corruption, and false statements/obstruction.&nbsp; Of course, if Congress starts enacting a number of mandatory minimums, that will be the next issue the Court may revisit. Note also that prior convictions remain exempt from <em>Blakely</em>: &quot;Accordingly, we reaffirm our holding in Apprendi: Any fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot;<br /><br />2. The standard of appellate review is now &quot;reasonableness&quot;--which drew Justice Scalia&#39;s Wonderland&quot; attack--rather than the Feeney Amendment&#39;s de novo.&nbsp; Justice Breyer&#39;s opinion states: &quot;In other words, the text told appellate courts to determine whether the sentence &#39;is unreasonable&#39; with regard to &Acirc;&sect;3553(a). Section 3553(a) remains in effect, and sets forth numerous factors that guide sentencing. Those factors in turn will guide appellate courts, as they have in the past, in determining whether a sentence is unreasonable.&quot;&nbsp; This is not a constitutionally required standard, only what the statute is left with (sub silencio) after the Court excised the de novo standard.&nbsp; Congress can certainly revisit the standard of review and give some guidance to the circuit courts on how to review potentially disparate sentences.<br /><br />3. Justice Breyer&#39;s opinion used <em>inter alia</em> a mail fraud hypothetical to show why the majority (namely Justice Ginsburg switching sides) rejected the requirement that all relevant aspects of a sentence be decided by the jury.&nbsp; The opinion states:</p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><p>Consider, too, a complex mail fraud conspiracy where a prosecutor may well be uncertain of the amount of harm and of the role each indicted individual played until after conviction--when the offenders may turn over financial records, when it becomes easier to determine who were the leaders and who the followers, when victim interviews are seen to be worth the time. In such a case the relation between the sentence and what actually occurred is likely to be considerably more distant under a system with a jury trial requirement patched onto it than it was even prior to the Sentencing Act, when judges routinely used information obtained after the verdict to decide upon a proper sentence.<br /><br />This point is critically important. Congress&#39; basic goal in passing the Sentencing Act was to move the sentencing system in the direction of increased uniformity. That uniformity does not consist simply of similar sentences for those convicted of violations of the same statute--a uniformity consistent with the dissenters&#39; remedial approach. It consists, more importantly, of similar relationships between sentences and real conduct, relationships that Congress&#39; sentencing statutes helped to advance and that JUSTICE STEVENS&#39; approach would undermine. </p></blockquote><p>Many recent indictments contain <em>Blakely</em> factors for the jury to decide, and the Enron Barge trial even included a <em>Blakely</em> phase to the sentencing.&nbsp; While that is not constitutionally required, any inclusion of factual elements to increase a sentence (see #1 above) will have to be alleged in the indictment and proven at trial.&nbsp; Under the sentencing advisory system, how much disparity will there be, and can the goal of uniformity be reached?<br /><br />These are preliminary thoughts, and <em>Booker</em> will become a source of many judicial opinions plumbing its depths--pity the poor trees felled in its wake.&quot; [January 12, 2005; <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog">White Collar Crime Prof Blog</a> has the <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/2005/01/initial_booker_.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

It&#39;s not everyday that somebody gives up the security of life tenure on a federal circuit court for a political job like this.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://law.gsu.edu/directory/view.php?id=42&version=html">Ellen S.

These two witnesses provided background information, something that is necessary when dealing with a complicated case that has charges of &quot;conspiracy, fraud and making false filings with the&quot; SEC. The Wall Street Journal states:<blockquote>&quot;Douglas Webster, a group vice president at MCI, and Adam Quinton, chairman of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.&#39;s research recommendations committee, served largely as expert witnesses. Mr. Webster, who joined MCI in 1986 and went to WorldCom in 1998 when it acquired MCI, explained the technology and history behind the company and the telecom industry overall.&quot;</blockquote>But witness Adam Quinton also appears to be setting the groundwork for the upcoming testimony of former chief financial officer Scott Sullivan, a key witness in this case.&nbsp; The WSJ reports here:<blockquote>&quot;In court Wednesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney William Johnson quickly steered Mr. Webster to line costs, which the government alleges were manipulated to inflate WorldCom&#39;s earnings. Line costs, or payments to other carriers to initiate or terminate a call locally, were WorldCom&#39;s largest expense, followed by selling, general and administrative costs, said Mr. Webster.&quot;</blockquote>One of the truly difficult tasks prosecutors have in presenting white collar cases to juries is simplifying the language and concepts to a level so that jurors who may have no connection with the financial world can understand the essence of the alleged fraud.&quot;  [January 27, 2005: <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/">White Collar Crime Blog</a> has the <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/2005/01/testimony_begin.html">post.</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

The unanimous decision written by Justice O&#39;Connor found that 1956(h), the money laundering statute, was more like  drug conspiracy statutes that do not require proof of an overt act as the  language is &quot;plain and unambiguous.&quot; &quot;Because the text of s1956(h) does not expressly make the commission of an overt act an element of the conspiracy offense, the Government need not prove an overt act to obtain a conviction.&quot;<br /><br />This decision sends a message to Congress that if they want an overt act required for a conspiracy, then they had better include explicit language in the statute requiring it.&quot; [January 11, 2005; <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog">White Collar Crime Prof Blog</a> has the <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/2005/01/money_launderin.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Posner [Chicago]: Tort Reform</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.uchicago.edu/faculty/posner-r/">Richard Posner</a>, University of Chicago Law School:<br /><br />&quot;There is a movement afoot, assisted by the strengthening of Republican control over Congress, to impose federal limits on tort litigation, particularly medical malpractice; premiums for malpractice insurance have soared in the last two years and physicians are protesting vigorously.<br /><br />The costs of malpractice premiums are only about 1 percent of total U.S. health-care costs. Moreover, insofar as physicians are forced to swallow the cost of the premiums rather than being able to pass them on to their patients or their patients&#39; insurers in the form of higher prices, the premiums do not actually increase total health-care costs. There is an indirect effect, however, insofar as malpractice liability causes doctors to practice defensive medicine. But there may be offsetting benefits, to the extent that defensive medicine actually improves outcomes for patients; and surely it does for at least some. What is more, because malpractice insurance is not experience-rated&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;physicians are not charged premiums based on their personal liability experience&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;malpractice liability may have only a slight effect on physicians&#39; methods or carefulness, except insofar as physicians are pressured by their insurers to change their methods in order to reduce the amount of malpractice litigation.<br /><br />The relation between malpractice premiums and malpractice judgments is also uncertain. No doubt capping judgments, which is the principal reform that is advocated, has some tendency to reduce premiums, but perhaps not much, because there is evidence that premiums are strongly influenced by the performance of the insurance companies&#39; investment portfolios.<br /><br />A better reform would be to permit, encourage, or even require insurance companies to base malpractice premiums on the experience of the insured physician, much as automobile liability insurance is based on the driver&#39;s experience of accidents. That would make malpractice liability a better engine for deterring malpractice&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;which in turn would reduce malpractice premiums by reducing the amount of malpractice. Capping judgments, in contrast, would reduce the incentive of insurance companies and their regulators to move to a system of experience-rated malpractice insurance.<br /><br />It is always important to distinguish between financial and real costs. Insofar as malpractice liability merely transfers wealth from physicians to (some) patients, aggregate costs are unaffected. The real cost of malpractice liability is limited to the cost of the actual resources consumed by such liability, principally the time of lawyers and expert witnesses (roughly half the total amount awarded in judgments goes to pay lawyers and expert witnesses), unless defensive medicine is assumed to cost more than its benefits in improving treatment outcomes. The real benefit of malpractice liability is its effect if any in deterring medical negligence; reducing that benefit would impose a real cost. Hence it is simplistic to assume that the total annual malpractice premiums paid is a good index of the net social cost of malpractice liability, or that measures to reduce those premiums by capping malpractice liability would result in a net improvement in welfare. To repeat, part of the premiums represent simply a wealth transfer from physicians to the patients who receive malpractice judgments or settlements paid by insurers. The part (roughly half) that pays for lawyers and expert witnesses should be understood as the cost of maintaining a system for increasing medical safety; the efficacy of the system could be improved, I have argued, by experience rating, but not by capping judgments.<br /><br />In any event, there is no compelling case for federal limitations on malpractice liability. The issue belongs at the state level, and as reported in a <em>New York Times</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/14/national/14malpractice.html?oref=login">article </a>last Friday, a number of states have adopted or are seriously considering adopting the kind of caps being advocated in Congress. Federal legislation would simply stifle state experimentation with different methods of regulating physicians and prevent us from learning which is best.<br /><br />There is a stronger case for federal regulation of class actions, as in the case of suits against asbestos manufacturers. When the members of a plaintiff class are scattered across the country, the class lawyer has a wide range of places in which to sue, and there are certain counties in the United States in which judges and juries are disproportionately generous to tort plaintiffs. Most of the costs of a large judgment or settlement in such a case are exported to other states, while the benefits are concentrated in the locale where the suit was litigated, because of the business generated for local lawyers, as well as the judgments or settlements received by the members of the class in the locale. This is a formula for abuse, concretely for a tendency for such judgments and settlements to exceed an unbiased estimate of the true costs imposed on the class by the defendants&#39; misconduct. Malpractice litigation does not give rise to such an abuse to any very great extent, because patient and physician are usually in the same state, and a single plaintiff has only a limited choice of courts in which to sue. This is another reason not to make medical malpractice the principal object of federal tort reform.<br /><br />We should be cautious about tort reform. It would be unfortunate if interest-group politics, and anecdotes concerning outlandish lawsuits (such as the suit against McDonald&#39;s by the customer who spilled hot coffee in her lap), were allowed to obscure the difficult policy issues.&quot; [January 16, 2005; <a href="http://www.becker-posner-blog.com">The Becker-Posner Blog</a> has the <a href="http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/archives/2005/01/tort_reformposn.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.wcl.american.edu/faculty/anderson/">Kenneth Anderson</a>, Washington College of Law, American University:<br /><br />&quot;I have caught just bits and pieces of the Gonzales confirmation hearings for Attorney General today.  In general, he does not seem to have faced especially bitter attack - on the contrary, I thought the Democrats appeared to be pulling their punches, at least in the bits I heard.   One bit that caught my attention was a question from Senator Schumer, asking Judge Gonzales whether there had been discussion within the Administration concerning the possibility of revising the Geneva Conventions to account for the different circumstances of the war on terror.  Judge Gonzales hedged, saying there had perhaps been some general discussions as to the changing circumstances of conflict, but nothing specific.  Senator Schumer then urged him to seek advice from Congress in any such move rather than simply submitting a treaty for advice and consent.<br /><br />Revising the Geneva Conventions?  No one, inside or outside the Administration, liberal or conservative, is talking about <em>literally</em> revising the 1949 Geneva Conventions - what they mean is supplementing them in some fashion, perhaps even superceding parts of them, by means of additional agreements, protocols, treaties.  A number of academic meetings have taken place over the past two years or so, exploring the possibility.  The meetings have had a variety of motives and sponsors - the common denominator, so far as I am aware, having participated in several, has always been a concern fundamentally about US behavior and ways of constraining it.  I am not aware of any meeting in which the fundamental concern has been to make it easier for the US to conduct a war on terror.  These conversations always take place, in the abstract, from the point of view of regulating everyone&#39;s conduct - but since there is only one party in the war on terror - terror being the strategy that it is - who might conceivably agree to be regulated, the United States, the practical import is that these are meetings about constraining US behavior. <br /><br />For this reason - believing as I do that the United States should not, at this point, be subjecting itself to more international legal restraints, but should be establishing its own standards - I have taken the position that generally the United States government should not participate, nor encourage such exercises.  It should recognize that, just as happened with the International Criminal Court negotiations, the US tries and tries and tries to be a team player, only to find out that the team consists of &quot;it&quot; and &quot;them&quot; and that the only practical function of the negotiations is to constrain US action.  Eventually it all ends in tears, with many recriminations against the US, because eventually the US hits a wall - some principle, such as fundamental sovereignty, that no form of negotiation, however artful or papered over, can make go away.  The wall is a matter of principle, not something that can be finessed by a form of words.  That being the case, it would have been better had the US not given any legitimacy to the proceedings in the first place, and spelled out exactly why.<br /><br />This is quite true in regard to any possible multilateral revision of the laws of war.  A multilateral process would result only in the attempt by the Lilliputians to tie down Gulliver - and in the peculiar way consistent with the security imbalance between the international legalist states of Europe and the United States - states that have no fundamental security interests, because of the US security guarantee, arguing that the US should tie its hands in security matters to the satisfaction of European consciences.  There is nothing in this but trouble for the United States. <br /><br />Instead, the United States would be well advised to simply pursue its own vision of how the laws of war should be - asserting them publicly as law and declaring them to be the US understanding of the laws of war.  It should use its power as the leading military power to create the conditions of customary international law by asserting its state practices as expressions of international law.  It should, in effect, create legal facts on the ground. <br /><br />To do that, however, requires that the US put forth its view of how the laws of war should reflect the realities of the war on terror not merely as an expression of US <em>interests</em>, security interests, but instead as a vision of the ideals of the law of armed conflict.  At the center of this is <em>not</em> in fact US security, but instead a vision of the protection of civilians - which, at its core, terror threatens.  The US can create long term international law, or at least protect its claim that it is within international law, <em>only</em> by asserting its policies as part of a larger moral vision of the laws of war.  The US has almost entirely failed to do this, however, allowing its policies to be portrayed as nothing but mere realist interests.  I have never understood this, frankly, why the US fails to announce a moral vision, since in all my experience of US government lawyers in these areas, it is clear that they are fundamentally motivated by a moral vision and not by interests - the sad fact, after all, is that the Geneva Conventions have been seriously violated with respect to US soldiers in every post-WWII conflict.  It is not because the Geneva Conventions have done so well in protecting US soldiers that the United States remains committed to them - reciprocity was lost a long time ago - but because the US as a political community believes their core ideas are fundamentally right, which is a moral vision, rather than an assertion of interests.  And the US government should be willing to say so.<br /><br />(I discuss these ideas in a short academic paper, <em>The role of the United States military lawyer in projecting a vision of the laws of war, </em>4 Chicago Journal of International Law 445 (Fall 2003), available <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=482027">here</a> from SSRN.)&quot; [January 6, 2004; <a href="http://kennethandersonlawofwar.blogspot.com/">Law of War and Just War Theory Blog</a> has the <a href="http://kennethandersonlawofwar.blogspot.com/2005/01/gonazales-hearings-and-senator.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/jbalkin/index.htm">Jack Balkin</a>, Yale Law School:<br /><br />&quot;The hearings on the nomination of Alberto Gonzales to be Attorney General of the United States have begun.  Will no one in Congress say what should be obvious?  That Gonzales has brought shame on our country by trying to devise legal strategies and arguments to circumvent laws against torture and to define away the abuse of prisoners?  That such a man should not be the nation&#39;s chief law enforcement officer?  This is not mere cronyism or financial corruption we are talking about.  It is torture.<br /><br />How can we tell the other countries of the world that we are genuinely interested in democracy or in human rights?  Who will listen to us when our own soldiers are captured and abused?<br /><br />The public has so far been largely silent about this great injury to America&#39;s image around the world.  The feckless Democrats in Congress, humbled by their recent electoral loss, lack the courage to denounce what should be denounced, or to act on the courage of their convictions.  And the party that runs the country is all too happy to sweep the problem under the rug.  But the rest of the world is watching.  And they will not soon forget.  For years to come we will hear about America&#39;s mistreatment of prisoners, and how we failed to punish the architects of that policy, indeed, how we elevated and honored them, even after the sorry details were disclosed to a public unwilling to face them.<br /><br />Almost a year ago, President Bush stood before the United States Chamber of Commerce and waxed eloquent about <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/11/20031106-2.html">the importance of bringing human rights, the rule of law and democracy to the countries of the Middle East</a>.  He denounced the &quot;[d]ictators in Iraq and Syria [who] promised the restoration of national honor, a return to ancient glories, [but who] left instead a legacy of torture, oppression, misery, and ruin.&quot;  And he spoke eloquently of the key ingredients of successful societies throughout history, societies, he explained, who &quot;limit the power of the state and the power of the military,&quot; who &quot;protect freedom with the consistent and impartial rule of law, instead of selectively applying the law to punish political opponents,&quot; who &quot;prohibit and punish official corruption,&quot; and who &quot;instead of directing hatred and resentment against others . . . appeal to the hopes of their own people.&quot;<br /><br />In the past months we have learned that our country systematically tortured and abused prisoners.  It was not, we have learned, the work of a few bad apples, but a widespread practice.  At the same time, lawyers for the Administration spent countless hours crafting legal mystifications and specious arguments to justify abusive prisoner interrogations by the CIA and military forces, and to explain why the President of the United States, who swears an oath to make sure that the laws be faithfully executed, has no legal obligations whatsoever to abstain from torturing people.<br /><br />The question I want to know is this:  Is America still a successful society?&quot; [January 6, 2005; <a href="http://balkin.blogspot.com">Balkinization</a> has the <a href="http://balkin.blogspot.com/2005/01/to-our-great-shame.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an exclusive JURIST op-ed before his testimony today before the Senate Judiciary Committee, <a href="http://www.piercelaw.edu/deansoffice/hutson.htm">Admiral John Hutson</a> (Ret. USN), former Navy Judge Advocate General and now President and Dean of Franklin Pierce Law Center, says that Judge Alberto Gonzales&#39; reading of the Geneva Conventions on the protection of prisoners has been short-sighted and dangerous, has precipitated abuses in Iraq and Afghanistan, and renders him unsuitable for the position of US Attorney General, the country&#39;s chief law enforcement officer.<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/hutson2.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>s Americans, we have been given many gifts by our creator and our forebears.  We hold these gifts in trust for our progeny and mankind.  Among these gifts is our legacy of strong advocacy for human rights for all human beings by virtue of their humanity alone.  Another is an unwavering support and adherence to the rule of law.<br /><br />These gifts come with a string attached.  Like all gifts, there is also a responsibility to husband them.  They may not be squandered.   Rather we must nurture and refine them and pass them on in even better condition than we received them.  Generations of Americans have understood this responsibility and accepted it.  <br /><br />In the wake of World War II, Truman, Eisenhower, Marshall, Vinson, and others fulfilled their part of this sacred trust.  They had seen the horror of war, a horror the magnitude of which few of us have experienced, but have only read about.  They responded with programs like the Marshall Plan and international commitments like the Geneva Conventions.  <br /><br />I believe the Geneva Conventions are part of our legacy, not unlike the Bill of Rights, the 14th Amendment, and Brown v. The Board of Education.  The demonstrate the goodness of the United States.  They also demonstrate our strength.  Even in the midst of that most awful of human endeavors - war - we will treat our enemies humanely when we have captured them.  <br /><br />I have spoken out in opposition to the confirmation of Judge Gonzales because he appears not to understand that.  He finds the Geneva Conventions to be an impediment, a hinderence to our present effort &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; quaint and obsolete.  <br /><br />His analysis and understanding of the Geneva Conventions is short-sighted and dangerous.  It's wrong legally, morally, diplomatically, and practically.  It endangers our troops in this war and in future wars.  It makes our nation less safe.  <br /><br />His analysis of the Geneva Conventions and the applicability to the war in afghanistan and the war on terror is particularly disturbing because it indicates an utter disregard for the rule of law and human rights.<br /><br />The Geneva Conventions have protected American troops from harm by the enemy for many years.  US forces are more forward deployed than any other nation's in terms of numbers of deployments, locations, and numbers of troops thrust into harm's way. This has been the case at least since wwii and will continue to be true.  Because of that there is no country for which adherence to the rule of law is more important than it is to the us.  It's our troops that benefit.   The US proponents of the conventions saw them as a way to protect US troops from the enemy, not the enemy from US troops.  <br /><br />We cannot now throw them over the side just because they are inconvenient to the present effort.  This is only the present war, it's not the last war we'll fight, it's not even the next to last war.  <br /><br />An important aspect of the Geneva Conventions is to prepare us for the peace that will ensue.  We can't so alienate our allies that they won't fight alongside us again.  Nor should we so embitter our enemies that they fight on longer and harder than they otherwise would or are unwilling to relent even when their cause is hopeless.  <br /><br />I believe that the prisoner abuses we have seen in Iraq as well as Afghanistan and gitmo found their genesis in our decision to get cute with the Geneva Conventions.  At that point, it became "no holds barred, total warfare."<br /><br />Military doctrine has long been that "the United States abides by the laws of war&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;in spirit and letter&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;cruelty on enemy prisoners is (never) justified&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;."<br /><br />Two indispensible aspects of military good order and discipline are the chain of command and the concept of accountability.  Accountability means you can delegate the authority to act, but you may never delegate the responsibility for those actions.  Government lawyers can't hide behind their advisor role to evade accountability for the actions they recommend. <br /><br />The value of the chain of command is that what starts at the top drops like a rock down the chain of command.  Subordinates execute the orders and adopt the attitude of their superiors.   <br /><br />I'm sure Judge Gonzales would disagree.   He would discount the impact.  He would argue that it was only a draft; that it wasn't intended to be made public.  If he did that, it would indicate that he still doesn't understand why what he said was so wrong and so harmful.<br /><br />Only recently, in the face of this confirmation process, has the adminstration attempted to undo the damage.  I have three thoughts on that.  One is that it is a step in the right direction.  Two is that it is too little too late.  And last is that it is an acknowledgement of error by an administration that is generally loath to admit error.<br /><br />Damage has been done, but it is never too late to do the right thing.  If Judge Gonzales goes on to be the chief law enforcement officer of the United States after his involvment in this fiasco without hard questions and adequate answers, we will have failed to undo a wrong.  We will have only exacerbated it.  We will have failed to demonstrate that as Americans we do hold our international obligations dear, we are unwavering advocates for human rights, and we still support the rule of law.  <br /><br />We are at a fork in the road.  This nomination has given the United States Senate an opportunity to tell the world what we think about those issues.   What it does  will send a message, good or bad, to the world and, importantly, to Americans.<br /><br /><em>Admiral John Hutson (Ret. USN), is President and Dean of Franklin Pierce Law Center in Concord, New Hampshire. He is a former Judge Advocate General of the Navy.

Texas</em>, Justice Kennedy essentially said that legislatures may not base laws on moral judgments. Hence, it was unconstitutional for legislatures to ban sodomy because legislators thought it was immoral. For the majority in <em>Roper v. Simmons</em>, however, Justice Kennedy claims that its perfectly appropriate for the Supreme Court to consider morality in deciding whether something is unconstitutional. Could there be a clearer example of how judges have usurped the legislative function in our country? As Scalia put it:<blockquote>Worse still, the Court says in so many words that what our people&#39;s laws say about the issue does not, in the last analysis, matter: &quot;[I]n the end our own judgment will be brought to bear on the question of the acceptability of the death penalty under the Eighth Amendment.&quot; <strong>The Court thus proclaims itself sole arbiter of our Nation&#39;s moral standards, </strong>and in the course of discharging that awesome responsibility purports to take guidance from the views of foreign courts and legislatures. </blockquote><li>In the past, the Supreme Court has held that someone under the age of 18 can be mature enough to make the decision to abort a baby. Yet, now, the Court says a person under 18 is too immature to be executed following a fair trial. So minors are allowed to kill, but not to be killed? What kind of logic is that? As Scalia put it:<blockquote>In other contexts where individualized consideration is provided, we have recognized that at least some minors will be mature enough to make difficult decisions that involve moral considerations. For instance, we have struck down abortion statutes that do not allow minors deemed mature by courts to bypass parental notification provisions. ... It is hard to see why this context should be any different. Whether to obtain an abortion is surely a much more complex decision for a young person than whether to kill an innocent person in cold blood.</p></blockquote></ul>Once again, nine old men and women in robes have elevated themselves into a super-legislature in which they have exercised privileges they deny to our elected representatives. So much for having a democracy. Indeed, at this rate, so much for having a republic.

Virginia</a></em>, 536 U.S. 304 (2002), that the Eighth Amendment prohibited the execution of mentally retarded offenders, the Court punted a number of tough administrative issues when it left to the states &quot;the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction upon its execution of sentences.&quot;&nbsp; As noted in <a href="http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy/2005/02/the_challenges_.html">this post</a> about a recent California Supreme Court ruling, three years later the states are still sorting through post-<em>Atkins</em> administrative issues.<br /><br />Because chronological age is much easier to determine than mental retardation, the states should have a much easier time administering <em>Roper</em>.  Nevertheless, there are still, I believe, some short-term administrative challenges for states that have been applying capital sentencing systems to juvenile offenders.&nbsp; For instance, I had no ready response when a colleague today asked: &quot;Do the cases go back to the trial judge for re-sentencing or default to life?&quot;&nbsp; This question also led me to ponder whether a juvenile offender sentenced to death at a time when a jurisdiction did not have the alternative of life without parole could now claim parole eligibility.&nbsp; (I assume some of these issues have been hashed out post-<em>Atkins</em> or earlier, though I doubt definitively.)<br /><br />Moreover, I suspect there are more than a few on-going capital proceedings involving juvenile offenders that might need to be significantly adjusted.&nbsp; For example, as <a href="http://www.philly.com/mld/philly/news/breaking_news/11022513.htm">this article details</a>, there is a high-profile murder trial involving a juvenile offender on-going in Philadelphia.&nbsp; Might the defendant in this case seek a mis-trial by claiming it is now inappropriate for a death-qualified jury to determine his guilt.

Podgor</a>, Georgia State University College of Law:<br /><br />&quot;With the upcoming release of Martha Stewart from prison, the press is writing of her experiences and future. The Wall Street Journal provides a view of her life in prison <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB110980091391368649,00.html?mod=home%5Fpage%5Fone%5Fus">here</a>, AP <a href="http://www.ajc.com/business/content/shared-gen/ap/Finance_General/Martha_Stewart_Prison_Life.html">here</a>, and there have been many a story on her upcoming TV show. (see e.g. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A58853-2005Feb2.html">here</a>). Also see our post <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/2005/02/martha_stewarts.html">here</a>.<br /><br />But I keep wondering about what is happening in the background, namely, Martha Stewart&#39;s appeal.&nbsp; Normally, the appeal would be crucial - a chance to vindicate oneself.&nbsp; The brief filed by the <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/2004/12/governments_bri.html">government</a> and the defense <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/2004/11/the_latest_on_m.html">here</a> and <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/2004/12/marthas_reply_b.html">here</a> demonstrates some fascinating legal issues, including a Crawford issue. But what if Martha wins the appeal?<br /><br />Normally when the defendant wins the appeal, it can mean not going to prison. But Martha Stewart has already done her time. If the result is an out and out reversal then yes, it is clearly beneficial to vindicate her. But what if the result is a retrial? Will this assist Martha Stewart in going on with her life? Or will it keep her from putting the focus on the new TV show and her new life? Would she be better off with it being affirmed?<br /><br />No one wants a conviction on their record, but this case is challenging a basic premise in our system of justice. Does a conviction really matter? Will it be a deterrence? And more importantly, should the government have prosecuted Martha Stewart? Irrespective of where you stand on the guilt or innocence of Martha Stewart, one has to ask themselves if this was an appropriate case for the federal government to prosecute? Should this case have been handled through civil remedies?&quot;  [March 3, 2005: <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/">White Collar Crime Blog</a> has the <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/2005/03/martha_stewart.html">post.</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

How can the same GOP that says federal power should be seen through he lens of a limited Commerce Clause and shrunken 14th Amendment claim that Congress has the power to act here? How can anyone care so much more about the feeding tube in a person with a liquefied cerebral cortex than about the feeding of hungry children both at home and abroad? And what about all the people who die for lack of medical care? Is the Schiavo bill a bill of attainder? Does the insertion of the Congress into an ongoing judicial matter violate separation of powers?; but other people are asking, or will ask, all these questions. So here&#39;s my own addition to the pile: Why didn&#39;t the Senate democrats take advantage of this bill to add a rider to it?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.uchicago.edu/faculty/posner-r/">Richard Posner</a>, University of Chicago Law School:<br /><br />&quot;One of the commonest objections to President Bush&#39;s proposal for reform of social security is that there is no need to act now because there is no &quot;crisis.&quot; Yet the same people who say this are wont to say that a weakness of government is its failure to take the long view. Politicians have a short time horizon because they have limited terms of office and are therefore reluctant to address a problem that lies in the future even if the problem could be solved more easily before it assumes crisis proportions. The increasing burden of social security, owing to the declining ratio of workers to retirees, is a problem easier to solve now than when a continued decline in that ratio (it was 3.3 in 1996 and is expected to be only 2 by 2030) brings on a fiscal crisis necessitating either steep tax increases or drastic benefits cuts (one form of which would be raising the retirement age), or both. In 1983 Congress raised the retirement age for full social security benefits from 65 to 67, thus reducing liftetime benefits. But the legislation provided for phasing in the increase over a 22&#8212;year period beginning in 2003, which made the discounted present cost of the reduction in benefits negligible for prospective retirees.<br /><br />With the social security &quot;crisis&quot; still in the future, it is possible to begin now to change the system in the direction of a genuine retirement program, that is, one in which people pay for their own retirement rather than having it paid for by current workers. With that shift, it would no longer matter what the ratio of workers to retirees was.<br /><br />The shift is independently desirable. Having people pay through the tax system for other people&#39;s retirement produces a capricious redistribution of income. The elderly have disproportionate voting power: a higher percentage of elderly than of other age groups vote, and they tend to focus laser-like on issues that affect their pocketbook.<br /><br />The shift can be made painless to present and imminent retirees (anyone over 55, say) by keeping benefits at their current level. However, if younger workers are required to place a percentage of their income in a retirement fund, those who do not want to reduce their disposable income by that amount will perceive the requirement as an increase in their taxes, and will squawk. If to quiet them taxes are reduced, the federal deficit will grow because benefits are not being cut. Eventually, fiscal equilibrium will be restored, but until then, the political price paid for the reform may be high.<br /><br />Deficit spending, financed  by government borrowing, may be economically superior to higher taxes or inflation, but to the extent that the lenders are foreign, the payment of interest on the loans will transfer wealth from Americans to foreigners.<br /><br />The issue of compulsory pensions should be decoupled from that of welfare. Some people cannot save enough to be able to retire on; the government should guarantee them a decent retirement income. Those are the only people whose retirement should be financed by other people, that is, by taxpayers. All others should be required to finance their own retirement. This applies to health costs as well as to other expenses of retirement. Just as social security should be for people who can&#39;t save enough to retire on, so medicare should be for people who can&#39;t save enough to buy health insurance for their old age. It is ridiculous that people with Becker&#39;s income or my income should be receiving social security and medicare benefits, except insofar as those benefits have actually been financed by our payments of social security taxes rather than by taxes on workers.<br /><br />Extreme libertarians will challenge the assumption that people should be compelled to save for their retirement. They will say that people should be allowed to allocate their income over their life span as they choose; if they choose to allocate nothing to their old age, then let them starve. I do not agree with this position, and for two reasons. First, I believe it is plausible to model the individual as a succession of selves with different preferences. A young person may dislike the idea of growing old and may be inclined therefore to refuse to make provision for his old self. The old self&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;the self that will not emerge and &quot;take over&quot; the individual for many years&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;has no control over the decisions of the young self. Compulsory retirement saving gives the old self a &quot;voice&quot; in the decisions of the young self.<br /><br />Second&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;and a point actually consistent with libertarian thinking&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;these improvident oldsters will in fact free ride on their children and grandchildren. This, however, suggests an argument (made in my book <em>Aging and Old Age</em> [1995]) for the existing pay-as-you-go system, as distinct from one in which people finance their own retirement. If by lifting the burden of elder care (or much of it, at least) from the shoulders of one&#39;s children, social security confers a benefit on the children, they should be expected to pay for it. A distinct but related point is made by Becker in his book <em>A Treatise on the Family</em> (enlarged ed. 1991). He points out that parents&#39; payment of school taxes finances their children&#39;s education (and hence earning power), and social security can be regarded as repayment to the parents in their old age. The larger the family, the greater the aggregate benefits to the children of a &quot;free&quot; public education, but also the greater social security taxes they pay (because there are more of them). The benefit to the children of shifting the elder-care responsibility is probably independent of family size, since parents&#39; need for such care is independent of the number of children they have.<br /><br />But the matching of benefits and costs under the pay-as-you-go system is both very crude and highly politicized. Compulsory retirement saving would protect children from parental demands for old-age care; and education, like retirement, could be made self-financing, though with appropriate subsidies for children whose parents cannot afford to educate them.&quot;  [February 6, 2005; <a href="http://www.becker-posner-blog.com">The Becker-Posner Blog</a> has the <a href="http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/archives/2005/02/social_security.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

My disappointment is founded in <a href="http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/archives/2005/01/tort_reformposn.html">my conviction that the &quot;problem&quot; of tort litigation is a product of hype. </a>Moreover, the criticism of tort litigation sorely neglects its effectiveness as regulation. I cannot imagine, for example, that state consumer protection legislation would be anything more than wishful thinking if its enforcement were left to state regulators. Instead, businesses comply with such regulation in the myriad of day-to-day transaction because of the threat of tort liability. Nevertheless, maybe the legislation is mild enough, if it isn&#39;t the first of a stream of similar laws, to justify <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20050210/ap_on_go_co/limiting_lawsuits_17">Feinstein&#39;s statement that </a>&quot;[th]is bill, like most, is not perfect.

While common wisdom has it that state court juries are vastly more generous to plaintiffs than are federal court juries, presumably federal courts will give a fair hearing to class action plaintiffs. But I&#39;m afraid the whole affair is just more of the politics of appearances.&quot;  [February 11, 2005; <a href="http://lawwww.cwru.edu/faculty/friedman/raw/index.htm"> RAWDATA</a> has the <a href="http://lawwww.cwru.edu/faculty/friedman/raw/index.htm">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Balkin [Yale]: The NY Same Sex Marriage Case</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/jbalkin/index.htm">Jack Balkin</a>, Yale Law School:<br /><br />&quot;In <a href="http://www.rawprint.com/q/q_ny_1.php">Hernandez v. Robles</a> a New York State trial court judge held that the New York State constitution prohibited restricting marriage to opposite sex couples.<br /><br />The court held that prohibition on same sex couples violated the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clauses of the New York State Constitution.  The court did not remand to the legislature to fix the law, as the Vermont Supreme Court did in Baker v. State.  Instead, the Court noted that the specific provision of the Domestic Relations Law which governs marriage licenses did not specifically exclude same sex couples by its language, but that other accompanying statutes did refer to husbands and wives, brides and grooms.  Therefore, the appropriate remedy, the court argued, was to read the accompanying New York statutes so &quot;that the words `husband&#39;, `wife&#39;, `groom&#39;, and `bride&#39;, as they appear in the relevant sections of the Domestic Relations law are and shall be construed to mean `spouse&#39; and all personal pronouns, as they appear in the relevant sections of the Domestic Relations Law, are and shall be construed to apply equally to either men or women.&quot;<br /><br />Hernandez is a puzzling case on two counts.  First, the Due Process argument is that the right of privacy under the New York State Constitution includes a right to marry, which the Court says is the right to choose whom to marry.  But the problem is that this would undermine state laws regarding incest and polygamy as well, and the court makes no attempt to distinguish those cases from the case of same-sex marriage. Indeed, at one point in the opinion (p. 45), the court uses the example of polygamy to show that marriage has meant different things at different times and in different places.  Perhaps the court really means to say that as applied to same sex couples, the state has provided no compelling reasons for restricting who may marry, leaving to another day the question of whether there would be compelling reasons in cases of incest and polygamy.  But if that is the holding of Hernandez-- and perhaps it is the best reading of the case-- the point is nowhere clearly expressed.  And what is puzzling about the opinion is that the court does not even seem to spot the difficulty.<br /><br />The court also says that prohibition on same sex marriages violates New York&#39;s Equal Protection Clause.  The court does not hold that the prohibition violates sex equality because it restricts the choice of a person&#39;s marital partner on the basis of one&#39;s sex.  Rather, the court holds that the restriction violates the prohibition against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.  The New York Court of Appeals has not held that discrimination based on sexual orientation requires heightened judicial scrutiny.  Nevertheless, the court in Hernandez argued that the state of New York did not offer even a rational basis for excluding same sex couples from marriage.  This part of the opinion is quite short and, because it is so short, it is not very convincing.  At least the Massachusetts court in Goodridge spent some time trying to explain why the state&#39;s reasons failed the test of rational basis.  What the court says in Hernandez is mostly conclusory.<br /><br />I have no idea whether this case will be affirmed by the New York Court of Appeals.  But if it is affirmed, it will have to be for somewhat different reasons than the court gives here.  The court has not given the New York Court of Appeals very much to work with.  It will pretty much have to start from scratch.<br /><br />I strongly support same sex marriage, but my decided preference is for legislatures to adopt reform of the marriage laws rather than have courts impose the reform.  If courts are going to get involved, I greatly prefer the approach of the Vermont Supreme Court in Baker v. State-- hold that the current law is unconstitutional, explain the rough contours of the constitutional principles that a statute would have to satisfy, and send the issue to the legislature to come up with a solution.  That is not the same thing as having the legislature take the issue up on its own, but it does have the advantage of giving the result some degree of democratic ratification.  My view is that this is probably what the U.S. Supreme Court should have done in Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton as well.<br /><br />For this reason, I would argue that if the New York Court of Appeals decides to uphold this case (although it will have to be on different grounds), it should reverse the trial court&#39;s remedy and give the New York Legislature 90 days to come up with a statutory solution.&quot;  [January 21, 2005; <a href="http://balkin.blogspot.com">Balkinization</a> has the <a href="http://balkin.blogspot.com/2005/02/ny-same-sex-marriage-case.html">post.</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Maule [Villanova]: The Social Security Debate</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://vls.law.vill.edu/prof/maule/taxmaster/taxhome.htm">Jim Maule</a>, Villanova Law School:<br /><br />&quot;...[M]ost, if not all, of the discussion [about Social Security reform] presupposes continuation of the social security system, with changes in the way revenues are gathered to fund it. A few proposals discuss changing benefits, either in amount or by delaying the age at which a retirement payout would begin. There has been almost no discussion that begins at the beginning. What is the social security system designed to do? What SHOULD it be designed to do?<br /><br />The current social security system is a hodge-podge of benefits. When Medicare was carved out, given its own dedicated portion of the payroll tax, and limited to medical coverage, an excellent first step was taken to untangle the mess that the politicians have made of the Federal INSURANCE Contributions Act. A program of insurance against the economic ravages of pension-less retirement morphed into an entitlement program covering retirement, disability, survivor benefits, and an array of minor miscellaneous benefits. It&#39;s easy to figure out how that happened. Members of the Congress knew, and know, that promising something for nothing, or promising more in return than is given, is a sure-fire way to get votes. It did wonders for Claude Pepper. But not for the many children living in poverty while well-to-do retirees gather social security benefits.<br /><br />No analysis about funding, about trust fund investment and growth, or about benefits eligibility makes any sense until the objectives of &quot;social security&quot; are defined, and then categorized in separate programs, each of which gets funding appropriate to its goals and each of which is managed and invested in ways suitable to its objectives. No private sector insurance or assurance business would set premiums, investment policy, and benefits formulas BEFORE determining the nature of the products it wishes to market. Of course, it is not unusual for a government to do things in reverse order.<br /><br />The primary and original objective of social security was to provide assistance to retired workers who did not have pensions or whose pensions disappeared when their companies went under during the Great Depression. In those days, funded pensions were not the norm. Instead, companies made unfunded promises to make payments to retirees. If the company went under, so did the pension.<br /><br />Much has changed since those days. Yes, there are employees whose employers do not offer pensions to them, and who fail to take advantage of the several tax-favored self-funded retirement plans such as IRAs. The failure may be lack of resources or it may be a lack of good planning. A person earning $23,000 and trying to support two children finds it almost impossible to stash several thousand dollars into an IRA. On the other hand, a college graduate pulling down $60,000 or $80,000 ought to think seriously about funding retirement, even if it means cutting back on what otherwise would be a consumer spending spree, but our education system racks up another demerit for ITS failure to teach retirement planning (and budgeting) to its graduates.<br /><br />With the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) standing by to deal with pensions that go under, the role of the Federal INSURANCE Contributions Act can and should be curtailed to focus on retirees whose employers did not offer them pensions or whose self-funded retirement savings are insufficient. To offset the temptation of workers to rely on &quot;Uncle Sam&quot; to pay the retirement bills, funding could be set at a bare bones minimum for those retirees whose earnings and expense history (determinable from tax returns, for example) demonstrate a lifetime of squandering and bad judgment, whereas those who saved as much as possible for retirement (for example, the person earning $23,000 and raising two children who managined to squirrel away $500 a year) would receive &quot;thrift lifestyle&quot; bonuses. The mentality that led to reform of social welfare abuse surely can inspire some methods to deal with retirement abuse, because the &quot;live well and let Uncle Sam support me when I retire&quot; approach is not good for the individual or the nation.<br /><br />Another goal of social security was to assist survivors of retirees, mostly surviving spouses. Social security was enacted when most surviving spouses had no pensions or retirement savings of their own, because almost all were women and few women held jobs, let alone pension-qualifying jobs, for more than a few years before marriage. Seventy years later, when many surviving spouses have their own pensions or self-funded retirement plans, the idea that a surviving spouse is per se entitled to financial assistance during retirement lacks cultural context. Similarly, penalizing those surviving spouses who DO have their own work history, as does current social security benefits computations, is no less anachronistic.<br /><br />Social security also provides assistance to survivors of workers who die before reaching retirement age. If, however, the deceased worker&#39;s pension benefits are payable to the survivor, or if there are death benefits, life insurance funded by the employer or the family, or other sources of assistance, why is there a need for the social security system to provide a benefit? The response by most defenders of the current system is that the worker paid in money, making the survivors ENTITLED to a return. That, however, is an approach that treats social security as compelled savings rather than as insurance. Is that what the goal should be?<br /><br />Social security also provides assistance to disabled workers. Should not a government disability program be synchronized with private disability insurance coverage? Some workers have employer-provided disability benefits that in some instances eliminate the need for government assistance. And to the extent the government is operating a fall-back disability plan, ought not that plan be carved out as was Medicare? Are not the funding, investment, and benefits considerations for disability different from those applicable to retirement annuities?<br /><br />The answers to these questions are required before arguments about funding sources, the level of payroll taxes, the apportionment of the funding burden between employer and employee, retirement age, privatization, and other issues can make any sense. There are sensible arguments to support a compelled savings/entitlement program wrapped around retirement annuities. There also are sensible arguments to restrict the government&#39;s role to insurance, similar to its role in providing insurance under other circumstances. And there are sensible arguments that the government ought not be involved in providing insurance unless it uses that role to discourage decisions that have long-term negative effects, much like the arguments that the federal government ought not be insuring homes built by individuals on barrier islands because by doing so it is encouraging a long-term disadvantage.<br /><br />This is where the debate ought to begin. The Administration, the Congress, and most commentators are not helping us begin the debate at the beginning. Perhaps they don&#39;t want to begin at the beginning because they don&#39;t like what it would do to the likelihood of success for their particular reform proposal. An informed debate is a useful debate. An uninformed debate generates confusion and bad decisions. I do not need to cite current or past examples. They surround us as does pollen in the spring.<br /><br />Current technology makes it possible to inform the citizenry and to obtain feedback. Do Americans want to pay higher payroll taxes to fund a compelled savings plan? Would doing so discourage private savings, and if so, what would be the effect on the economy? Do Americans prefer that social security benefits be paid to well-to-do retirees? Should social security be treated as insurance against need, as is homeowners&#39; insurance or automobile insurance? Should disability assistance be provided and, if so, should it be separately programmed as is Medicare? I am sure there are many more questions. My goal is not to generate the ultimate list but to spark some discussion among those responsible for leading the debate (though I doubt members of the Administration or of the Congress are reading this).<br /><br />So that&#39;s the reason I&#39;m not jumping in with arguments for or against this or that reform proposal or for or against the &quot;leave it as it is&quot; position. Nor does it make sense to me to argue about transitional rules. Perhaps if enough people pick up on my approach of first things first, the public debate over &quot;social security&quot; might progress in a useful, sensible way. And it might bring us to some surprising perspectives. And it might, note might, get us to something that works and in which most Americans would have confidence.&quot; [February 16, 2004; <a href="http://mauledagain.blogspot.com/">Mauled Again</a> has the <a href="http://mauledagain.blogspot.com/2005_02_01_mauledagain_archive.html#110856530971743167">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Balkin [Yale]: Johnson v. California: Thomas and Scalia Continue to Mystify</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/jbalkin/index.htm">Jack Balkin</a>, Yale Law School:<br /><br />&quot;Today, in Johnson v. California, the Supreme Court held that California&#39;s practice of segregating newly arrived prisoners by race for up to 60 days was subject to strict scrutiny.  Justice O&#39;Connor wrote the majority opinion.  Justices Scalia and Thomas dissented, arguing that strict scrutiny shouldn&#39;t apply in prison settings; instead the Court should use the very relaxed standard of Turner v. Safely.  Turner says that prisoner rights can be abridged whenever the regulation is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.  Justice O&#39;Connor argued that Turner does not apply to racial discrimination.  She pointed out that under the Turner standard, there would be no obvious limit to how much of a prison could be segregated, as long as prison officials asserted that it might have some benefit and might decrease the risk of racial violence. O&#39;Connor pointed out that Turner doesn&#39;t require any inquiry into whether more limited policies or race neutral alternatives would do just as well.<br /><br />I thought that the Court would subject this policy to strict scrutiny.  However, I am mystified about why Thomas and Scalia are dissenting in this case.  I had thought that they had strongly principled objections to racial classifications because these classifications fail to respect individual dignity, because they fail to treat individuals as individuals, and because they stigmatize and stereotype people according to their race, even when the classification is made from the purest of motives.  I don&#39;t happen to agree with their views in the affirmative action cases, but at least I respect a principled stand when I see one.  But there is nothing of that principled objection in this case.  Instead, it appears that their rhetoric only applies when they are opposing affirmative action policies designed to assist racial minorities.  Prisoners, it seems, have no rights which the state is bound to respect.  Of course, Thomas has never been interested in prisoner&#39;s rights, but one would think that his very strong objections to even &quot;benign&quot; racial classification would count for something here.<br /><br />In saying that Thomas and Scalia aren&#39;t being consistent, I do not mean to suggest that O&#39;Connor is.  As Thomas correctly points out, her refusal to defer to prison administrators in Johnson is in tension with her deference to university administrators in Grutter.  And there are passages in today&#39;s opinion that are, frankly, laughable given what she wrote in Grutter.  The point is that I don&#39;t really expect doctrinal consistency from O&#39;Connor-- I expect pragmatic case manipulation designed to hit the precise center of current public opinion.  Scalia and Thomas, on the other hand, have always struck me as true believers.  But cases like this one seem to suggest that they are doing precisely what they accuse liberals of doing-- writing their own personal predilections about policy into constitutional law.<br /><br />Speaking of liberals, at least Justices Ginsburg, Breyer and Souter have a principle that distinguishes this case from Grutter. It is the antisubordination principle-- racial classifications are suspect because they help perpetuate the subordination of racial groups.  Where the majority acts to undo the effects of past subordination, courts can apply somewhat less scrutiny (although not minimal scrutiny) because what the state is doing is not inconsistent with the goal of antisubordination.  That explains the Court&#39;s deferential attitude toward admissions committees in Grutter.  However, when the state uses racial classifications for mere administrative convenience, as in this case, its goals are orthogonal to alleviating social subordination, and the usual rule of strict scrutiny should apply.  Obviously, one could object to this line of argument at several places, but on the whole it seems somewhat more principled than what the other Justices are doing.&quot;  [February 24, 2005; <a href="http://balkin.blogspot.com">Balkinization</a> has the <a href="http://balkin.blogspot.com/2005/02/court-decides-johnson-v-california.html">post.</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Anderson [American U.]: Darfur and genocide</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.wcl.american.edu/faculty/anderson/">Kenneth Anderson</a>, Washington College of Law, American University:<br /><br />I want to go back to something that everyone has already talked to death - the UN report from a week or two back concluding that although Darfur involves mass murder, it does not meet the legal definition of genocide.<br /><br />The reason why the UN experts concluded that it does not meet the definition of genocide was that, in their view, it did not meet the requirement of intent - an intent to destroy an ethnic, religious, etc., group in whole or in part.<br /><br />My view of this is pretty simple.  The term genocide has been morphed during the 1990s, essentially to vitiate the intent requirement.  That is, I do not believe that the Bosnia war, for example, fit the definition of genocide, because it did not have the requisite intent.  But everyone in the &quot;international community&quot; concluded, on grounds that I thought at the time were quite weak, that it did constitute genocide.  With so many of the great and good having concluded that, then the defintional ball under international law shifted somewhat.  Then along came Rwanda, with mass atrocities that clearly fit the intent requirement as genocide as clearly as any since the Holocaust.  Then comes along reports on places such as, for example, Guatemala, where the UN report - with no new evidence not already known from the 1980s - concludes that it, too, was genocide - again, I would have said that the intent requirement was not met.  Once again, however, the chorus of great and good in the international community says that it was.  And then Samantha Power&#39;s Pulitzer-winning book, which pretty much walks away from the intent requirement - in any sense of specific intent - and turns genocide into any mass murder of an identifiable group of people.<br /><br />Okay, I&#39;m not in favor of this redefinitional trend - I think there is value to identifying a specific crime that is not just mass murder, but extermination with a group in mind to exterminate.  But that will always have an inconveniently high threshold of specific intent - as even the Yugoslavia tribunal, with its relaxed view of proof against defendants, has found in trying Milosevic.  This is partly what caused Power and others in the human rights community to move away from anything so demanding in the definition of genocide.<br /><br />Along comes Darfur, however, in the context of reflexive anti-Americanism on the part of the so-called international community - if the US is for it, we must be against! - combined with the real politik, which will increasingly rear an ugly head, of commercial interests of China and Russia.  And all of a sudden, somehow, mysteriously, the great and good of the international community suddenly rediscover a high threshold of specific intent for genocide.  Mind, I was never in favor of lowering it.  But if you <em>do </em>lower it for Bosnia, Guatemala, and elsewhere, then you have an obligation not to arbitrarily raise it again when you take up Darfur.&quot;  [February 16, 2004; <a href="http://kennethandersonlawofwar.blogspot.com/">Law of War and Just War Theory Blog</a> has the <a href="http://kennethandersonlawofwar.blogspot.com/2005/02/darfur-and-genocide.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Posner [Chicago]: Immigration Reform</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.uchicago.edu/faculty/posner-r/">Richard Posner</a>, University of Chicago Law School:<br /><br />&quot;I approach the issue of immigration reform (theoretical reform - neither Becker nor I are considering the political obstacles to radical changes in immigration law) somewhat differently. I begin by asking: why restrict immigration at all? The only answer I consider fully compatible with a market-oriented approach to social issues is that the immigrant might reduce the net social welfare of the United States, if for example he was unemployable or on the verge of retirement, or was a criminal, or was likely to require highly expensive medical treatment, or if he would impose greater costs in congestion or pollution than he would confer benefits, with benefits measured (crudely) by his income before taxes and by any consumer surplus that he might create. I assume that the welfare of foreigners as such does not enter into the U.S. social welfare function; but immigrants who create net benefits in the sense just indicated contribute to the strength and prosperity of the nation.<br /><br />The problem of the &quot;undesirable&quot; immigrant&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;the immigrant who wants to free ride on the services and amenities that the United States provides its citizens&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;could be solved by means of a two-stage process. In the first stage, the prospective immigrant would be screened for age, health, IQ, criminal record, English language capability, etc.; the screening need not be elaborate. If the would-be immigrant &quot;passed&quot; in the sense that he seemed likely to add more to U.S. welfare than he would take out, he would be admitted without charge. If he flunked the screening test, an estimate would be made of the net cost (discounted to present value) that he would be likely to impose on the U.S. if he lived here and he would be charged that amount for permission to immigrate.<br /><br />An alternative, less revolutionary, approach to screening out free-rider immigrants would be, first, to deny immigrants access to Medicaid and other welfare programs until they had lived in the United States for a significant period of time, and, second, to auction off a certain number of immigrant visas to the highest bidders. Immigrants willing to take their chances without access to welfare programs (not that all access could be denied&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;no one could be refused emergency medical treatment on a charity basis), and immigrants willing to bid high prices in an immigration auction, would be likely to be productive citizens, in the first case, and to cover any costs they would impose on the nation&#39;s health or other welfare systems, in the second case.<br /><br />Either the more or the less revolutionary alternative would impose significant transition costs, but that would be true of any radical change in immigration policy. The obvious cost (though not really a cost, rather a redistribution of income) would be that by increasing the supply of labor, an immigration policy that made it easy for employable workers to enter the U.S. labor force would reduce wages in the labor markets that the immigrants entered. A closely related but subtler consequence is that the downward effect of large-scale immigration on wages (a short-run effect, in all likelihood) would complicate the process of determining the correct fee to prevent free riding: an immigrant who might be able to pay his way at the existing wage level might be unable to do so if the wage level fell as a result of massive immigration. Similarly, congestion and pollution externalities might increase at an increasing rate with massive immigration, requiring a further adjustment in the fee charged the &quot;undesirables.&quot;<br /><br />Either approach seems to me preferable to a flat fee for all would-be immigrants. A flat fee would not do away with the need to screen, since some would-be immigrants might impose net costs on the U.S. that were greater than the fee; that is why Becker&#39;s approach includes screening. The flat fee would exclude two types of immigrant that should, in a market-oriented approach, be admitted. One type would be &quot;undesirables&quot; willing and able to compensate the United States for the expected costs that they would impose--and so they would not be free riders after all; a very wealthy person on the verge of retirement would be an example of such an &quot;undesirable.&quot; The second type would be highly promising would-be immigrants (for example, persons with a high IQ) who for some reason&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;perhaps because they reside in extremely poor countries&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;simply could not pay the down payment on the fee.<br /><br />The fee would, it is true, increase government revenues, which may seem a plus. But it would do so at the usual cost of distorting the allocation of resources, in this case by excluding immigrants in the second class.<br /><br />I note two complications. First, it may be desirable to adhere to the current policy of granting asylum to foreigners who are escaping persecution, even if they do not seem likely to be able to pay or to earn enough to cover the costs they&#39;ll impose on this country. My reason is not sentiment, but the fact that people who are persecuted tend to be either nonconformists or members of particularly successful minorities, and in either case they, or at least their children, are likely to be productive citizens even if their U.S. employment prospects are dim. Second, the United States in formulating immigration policy may have to worry about &quot;brain drain,&quot; and, what may be more important, &quot;leadership drain,&quot; from poor or unstable countries. For example, it would be highly unfortunate if all the Iraqis who have the ability and motivation to build a democratic, free-market society fled to the United States. Thus it may sometimes be in our national interest to exclude persons who would otherwise be highly desirable immigrants, in order to shore up forces or tendencies in their own countries that promote U.S. interests. However, I do not know how to mesh this concern with either my or Becker&#39;s proposals.&quot;  [February 25, 2005; <a href="http://www.becker-posner-blog.com">The Becker-Posner Blog</a> has the <a href="http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/archives/2005/02/immigration_ref.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/main.asp?PID=34">Jordan Paust</a> of the University of Houston Law Center says that not only does the President have the authority to direct states to comply with a decision of the International Court of Justice, but in fact he has the obligation to do so.<hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/paust.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled in March, 2004 that the United States must provide "effective review" of convictions of 51 Mexican nationals on death row in nine states who, upon arrest in the United States, were denied the right under Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations to be informed of their right to communicate with their consulate.  Recently, President Bush notified Attorney General Alberto Gonzales of his determination "that the United States will discharge its international obligations under the decision of the International Court of Justice" and stated that he has constitutional authority to order state courts to comply.  Does the President have such authority?<br /><br />Despite earlier protestations from some members of the Executive branch (for example, whether Executive agreements (oral or written) regarding assurances to foreign countries that US prosecutors will not to seek the death penalty could bind the states (forgetting, of course, United States v. Pink (1942), United States v. Belmont (1937), and the Supremacy Clause of the US Constitution, art. VI, cl. 2)), Supreme Court and other federal cases and opinions of the Attorneys General have long recognized more generally that, under Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution, the President is bound to faithfully execute the &quot;Laws&quot; and that such laws include treaty law of the United States and customary international law.  See, e.g., Paust, <em>International Law as Law of the United States</em> 7-11, 169-73 (2 ed. 2003).  Thus, the President has a constitutionally-based duty to faithfully execute treaties of the United States - a duty that presidents sometimes prefer when they want to go to war by executing UN Security Council or NATO resolutions authorizing the US to use military force abroad.  <br /><br />Further, it is possible that an executive order can execute a non-self-executing treaty. See, e.g., id. at 78.  In any event, our courts have found that the Vienna Convention is self-executing.  Customary international law reflected in Article 36 of the Vienna Convention would also be directly operative law of the United States.  See, e.g., id. at 7-11, 169-73.  Moreover, &quot;all&quot; treaties of the United States (not just some, the ones that a present Administration likes, those that are already fully or partly self-executing, etc.) are expressly covered under the unavoidable mandate of the Supremacy Clause.  Such treaties include the Vienna Convention as well as the UN Charter and, under the Charter, the United States is bound to faithfully execute decisions of the ICJ in cases directly involving the US (UN Charter, art. 94(1)).  In fact, an ICJ decision is part of the UN treaty process and the treaty expressly sets forth the duty of compliance.  This Charter-based duty also happens to override other inconsistent treaty requirements (UN Charter, art. 103).<br /><br />From the above it is evident that not only can the President order the states to faithfully execute a treaty-based decision of the ICJ, but the President must faithfully execute such a decision (unless to do so would directly violate the US Constitution, see, e.g., Reid v. Covert (1957)).  Of course, the 10th Amendment is no barrier to the treaty power because, considering the express recognitions in the amendment, the treaty power (1) has been expressly delegated to the federal government, and (2) has been expressly denied to the states. See, e.g., <em>Reid v. Covert</i>; <em>Missouri v. Holland</em> (1920); US Const. amend. X.  Moreover, the Constitution expressly mandates that &quot;all&quot; treaties are supreme law of the land "and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby."  Thus, under the Supremacy Clause the states and state judges are bound by Article 94(1) of the UN Charter whether or not the President acts to enhance faithful execution of the treaty.  I&#39;m sure that President Bush is not just playing games when stating that he has determined that &quot;the US will discharge its obligations under the decision of the International Court of Justice&quot; in this instance.  Clearly, he must do so as a matter of law in every instance and, most assuredly, the President of the United States is not above the law.<br /><br />When former General Counsel for Governor Bush of Texas, Alberto Gonzales (who now happens to be the US Attorney General that the President addressed in his determination), wrote in response to a request from the US Office of the Legal Adviser to the Secretary of State to indicate what Texas was doing to implement the Vienna Convention, Alberto demonstrated remarkable ignorance of constitutional law and international law: &quot;Since the State of Texas is not a signatory to the Vienna Convention..., we believe it is inappropriate to ask Texas&quot; to determine whether a breach occurs or to implement the treaty. See Paust, Fitzpatrick, Van Dyke, <em>International Law and Litigation in the US</em> 390-91 (West, American Casebook Series, 2000).  Perhaps that&#39;s why the President took special care to notify Alberto of the fact that the US will discharge its duties under the United Nations Charter.<br /><br /><em>Jordan Paust is Law Foundation Professor at the University of Houston Law Center, where he is the Director of the International Law Institute.</em><br /><p><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.piercelaw.edu/deansoffice/hutson.htm">Admiral John Hutson</a> (Ret. USN), former Navy Judge Advocate General, President and Dean of Franklin Pierce Law Center, and now a party to the ACLU torture suit against Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, wonders what myriad reports of prisoner abuses by US military personnel say about the America we have become....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/hutson2.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font> recently joined with Human Rights First (HRF) in a lawsuit against Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld filed March 1. After spending 28 years in the Navy, this was not a step I took lightly or without considerable angst.  In the end, I decided that it is a necessary step to get the country back on course with regard to our traditional abhorrence of torture and support of human rights.  <br /><br />HRF and the ACLU are representing four Iraqis and four Afghans in an action which seeks compensatory damages and a declaratory judgment based on the torture and abuse they suffered while detained by U.S. forces.  The allegations in the 77-page complaint read like a bad horror movie--sensory deprivation, sexual abuse and humiliation, cutting with knives, stress positions, beatings and other forms of shameful abuse.  All the allegations have been confirmed by personal interviews with the plaintiffs by credible human rights groups as well as lingering physical evidence.  <br /><br />After they had been tortured, each of the plaintiffs was eventually released from custody at U.S. detention facilities in Iraq and Afghanistan without charges.  One was 17 years old. The abuses occurred between June 2003 and June 2004, long after Secretary Rumsfeld had received notice of abuse in Guantanamo by the FBI in December 2002.<br /><br />The basis of the suit is violations of the 5th Amendment prohibition against torture and abuse that "shocks the conscience", 8th Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, the Alien Tort Claims Act, and the 3rd and 4th Geneva Conventions.  <br /><br />In the wake of 9/11, I applauded the Administration's decision to treat terrorist activities as a war, rather than criminal activity.  I still think that was the right decision.  However, a war does not give the United States the right to torture our prisoners.  Torture is wrong legally, morally, militarily, diplomatically and practically.  <br /><br />All the literature and experts essentially agree that as a practical matter torture doesn't work.  Eventually, you will gain information, but you have no idea of the validity of the information you get.  The torture victims will say anything they think you want to hear just to make you stop the pain.  Indeed, while the advocates of torture don't like to hear it, the more useful technique is quite the opposite.  It's more effective to gain the trust and confidence of the person from whom you seek information.<br /><br />Torture is wrong militarily because it emboldens our enemies and in doing so it ultimately imperils our troops.  The enemy won't surrender even when their cause is clearly lost, and you can be sure that the pictures out of Abu Ghraib are the most effective recruiting posters possible for future terrorists.  Does anyone really think the war has been made shorter or easier because of the torture that we've seen and read about for literally years now?  <br /><br />We can hardly expect our potential allies to eagerly fight along side us if we use tactics such as torture that are repugnant to them.  Unless we intend to rely only on Syria, Saudi Arabia, North Korea, and a few others for which torture is part of their national policy, we had better stop.  Coalition building isn't easy when other countries are wary about fighting alongside you.  <br /><br />The only purpose to have a military is to fight and win our nation's wars.  All the military can be expected to do is to buy the time and space necessary for real solutions&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;diplomatic, social, cultural, economic, and yes, religious--to take place.  The military can't provide a solution itself.  If we think it does, the solution it provides will be very short lived.    That's why it is critically important for the United States Armed Forces to reflect American culture and morality.   It's a recipe for disaster if the military somehow becomes different from the rest of America. That's why we have civilian leadership of the U.S. military.  That then raises the question of whether the 300 or so known or suspected cases of prisoner abuse and 35-40 investigations of suspicious deaths are reflective of American culture.  Is this what we have become?  I hope not.  <br /><br />I often hear the argument that the war on terror justifies torture because "Look what they did to us." I find this to be singularly unconvincing.  Indeed, it is repugnant to me.  I'm disgusted by it.   The cowardly actions of terrorists are reprehensible.  They can burn in hell for all I care.  But if we lower ourselves to the level of the enemy and resort to his tactics, we will have lost the reason for which we were fighting in the first place and lost our soul in the process.   Frankly, I'd rather lose the war.  <br /><br />As Secretary of Defense, Secretary Rumsfeld is by law in the military chain of command between the President as commander in chief and the war-fighting commanders.   He sits behind the desk where the buck stops.  One of the great strengths of our military is the chain of command which is enforced by the concept of accountability.  The orders and philosophy that originates at the top of the chain of command drops like a rock down the chain of command.  That's as it should be.  We rely on that.  The problem arises when those at the top are misguided.  When that happens, it is necessary that they be held accountable.  People have relied on their good judgment, character, vision, and morality and have been let down.  <br /><br />The prosecutions by the Allies after World War II are examples of the legal theory that leaders are responsible for breaches of international law committed by subordinates.  It doesn't mean those who actually engaged in the abuse are not responsible, but it does mean that their superiors are also accountable.  <br /><br />The point of this lawsuit is that Secretary Rumsfeld let down his subordinates in the chain of command.  He famously repeated the mantra that this was the result of "a few bad apples" and then commissioned a series of investigations to prove that point.  It is clear now to the most casual observer that what has occurred was the result his personal involvement in a series of decisions relative to approved interrogation techniques that deviated from generations of military doctrine and American policy.   <br /><br />What we needed from the Secretary was a clarion call that as Americans we will treat everyone, even suspected terrorists, with the dignity and respect that Americans have always treated other human beings simply by virtue of their humanity.  Rather, what we heard was essentially that they are all terrorists and therefore beneath contempt so different rules apply.  <br /><br />Why are we torturing people we ultimately release?  Apparently,  they weren't terrorists in the first place.  It's bad enough to torture and abuse known terrorists to get information.  It's even worse to torture people just in case they may know something.  <br /><br />Since at least World War II the United States has stood as a beacon for human rights around the world. We were the country that others looked to as the model for the rule of law.  We felt comfortable in that role and encouraged it.  Now we've taken a giant step down the slippery path from the high road to the low road.  Can we ever complain about torture in other countries again, even when U.S. troops are the victims?<br /><br />Is this
 the nation we have become?  Is this the nation we want to be?<br /><br /><em>Admiral John Hutson (Ret. USN), is President and Dean of Franklin Pierce Law Center in Concord, New Hampshire. He is a former Judge Advocate General of the Navy.</em><br />

Williams</a> of the Public International Law and Policy Group and American University&#39;s Washington College of Law insist that under legal standards the situation in Darfur constitutes genocide, whether the UN classifies it that way nor not....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/jafari.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td><img src="/forumy/williamspaul.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>mong all the interviews conducted last August with the seemingly uncountable number of refugees of the Darfur crisis who had escaped to relief camps in Chad, Amina Adam&#39;s* story stuck out for us. She described seeing the Sudanese military and Janjaweed militia throw her neighbor&#39;s baby up in the air and catch it on a bayonet. Amina suffered not only from witnessing that horrific event, but from witnessing the deaths of members of her own family before she fled hundreds of miles through desolate terrain to a refugee camp in Chad. She continues to suffer today while the United Nations refuses to categorize Darfur as a genocide and plays word games with this unimaginable tragedy. <br /><br />In January the United Nations released its own investigation of the Darfur atrocities and said that genocide was not committed, as defined by the Genocide Convention of 1948, because the perpetrators did not intend to destroy ethnic groups in Darfur. Rather, the intent was to "drive victims from their homes for the purposes of counter-insurgency warfare." This logic is not only faulty, but diminishes the gravity of the crimes committed and places another roadblock to meaningful action.<br /><br />First, the presence of other factors fueling violence is not a bar to declaring genocide. Rather, genocide is a means to an end for its perpetrators. In Rwanda, the extremist Hutu government hatched its diabolical plan in order to consolidate power, weaken a Tutsi insurgency, and claim control over vital natural resources. In its genocide trials, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda did not see these factors as a substitute for the intent to destroy Tutsis and moderate Hutus. <br /><br />Similarly, the government of Sudan has perpetrated violence to put down an insurgency effort in Darfur and send a message to the myriad other domestic groups opposed to the Khartoum government. The Janjaweed militia, which receives support from the government, joined the violence to gain control over valuable grazing territory. If, as the United Nations claims, the intent was to merely displace civilians, the government could have marched them to the border. Instead they chose to achieve their goals by killing civilians, driving refugees into a desolate desert, and making Darfur virtually uninhabitable by destroying food and water stores. These actions represent intent to destroy a group. That is genocide.<br /><br />Second, genocide does not require the immediate killing of members of the victimized group by the perpetrators. The UN report cited individual incidents where victims were killed only after they protested the theft of their cattle &#8212; implying that the intent was theft, not annihilation. In another example cited in the report, 220 out of more than 1000 captured civilians were executed by the government and militias. According to the report, "The fact that&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; the attackers refrained from exterminating the whole population that had not fled, but instead selectively killed groups of young men", proves intent to kill potential rebels, not destroy the group. <br /><br />If these arguments were applied to Rwanda, it could be argued that the motive for the violence was theft because some Rwandans were able to bribe their way out of execution. Similarly, it could be argued that the Holocaust was not genocide because not all of the people sent to concentration camps were executed. Rather, those that posed a risk, or were not physically capable of providing labor, were executed. Therefore there was no attempt to annihilate a group. In actuality, the Genocide Convention poses no timeline for genocide to occur, nor does it specify how brutally it must be carried out. The presence of secondary motives does not contradict intent to commit genocide.<br /><br />It&#39;s easy to see why the UN would seek to avoid categorizing Darfur as genocide. The Genocide Convention states that a finding of genocide can lead member states to &quot;call upon the competent organs of the United Nations to take such action... as they consider appropriate for the prevention and suppression of acts of genocide...&quot; Former Secretary of State Colin Powell pointed to this language when he described the violence in Darfur as genocide in September and called on the UN to act. The UN cannot separate the genocide from the war between the government and the rebels. Its policy of encouraging negotiations has not halted this nearly year-long genocide. It does not want a declaration of genocide as such to highlight its inadequacy in this regard.<br /><br />In a final example of contradictory absurdity, and after establishing that there was no intent to commit genocide, the UN report states that "in some instances individuals, including government officials, may commit acts with genocidal intent." During the genocide in Rwanda, reporter Alan Elsner famously asked State Department Spokesperson Christine Shelley "how many acts of genocide does it take to make genocide?" Now, it appears we must ask the UN, "How many individuals have to act with genocidal intent to make genocide?" Amina would like to know. But while the UN plays its word games, she and other Darfurians continue to suffer.<br /><br />* Pseudonym used for the protection of the refugee.<br /><br /><em>Jamal Jafari is a Senior Research Associate with the Public International Law and Policy Group, and interviewed Darfurian refugees in Chad in August 2004.

Simmons</em>, the United States has finally joined the community of nations that says the state-sanctioned execution of children is wrong.<hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/cohncolor.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><blockquote><em>Today, the Court repudiated the misguided idea that the United States can pledge to leave no child behind while simultaneously exiling children to the death chamber.</em><br /><br />- Dr. William F. Schulz, Executive Director, Amnesty International</blockquote><font SIZE=3><b>U</strong></font>ntil the Supreme Court&#39;s decision in <em>Roper v. Simmons</i> on March 1, 2005, the United States was the only nation in the world that permitted the execution of children under age 18.  Only seven countries besides the U.S. have executed juvenile offenders since 1990: Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and China.  Since then, each of those countries either abolished capital punishment for juveniles or made public disavowal of the practice.  With the monumental Simmons ruling, the United States has finally joined the community of nations that says the state-sanctioned execution of children is wrong.<br /><br />Christopher Simmons was a 17-year-old junior in high school when he and a friend burglarized Shirley Crook's home.  When Simmons realized Mrs. Crook had recognized him, he and his friend tied her up, and threw her off a bridge to her death.  Simmons, who had never even been arrested before, was described by clinical psychologists who evaluated him as "very immature," "very impulsive," and "very susceptible to being manipulated or influenced."  Nevertheless, a Missouri jury sentenced Simmons to death.<br /><br />The Supreme Court concluded in a 5-4 decision that executing children who were not yet 18 at the time of their crimes constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.  "By protecting even those convicted of heinous crimes," Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the majority, "the Eighth Amendment reaffirms the duty of the government to respect the dignity of all persons." <br /><br />In determining which punishments are so disproportionate as to be cruel and unusual, the Court considers "the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society," a test set forth in the 1958 case of <em>Trop v. Dulles</em>.  <br /><br />The Court had prohibited the execution of 15-year-old offenders in <em>Thompson v. Oklahoma</em> in 1988, but the following year, it upheld the execution of 16- and 17-year-olds in <em>Stanford v. Kentucky</em>.  The same day it decided <em>Stanford</em>, the Court also refused to mandate a categorical exemption from the death penalty for the mentally retarded in <em>Penry v. Lynaugh</em>.<br /><br />Three years ago, the Court overruled <em>Penry</em>, and held in <em>Atkins v. Virginia</em> that the standards of decency that had evolved in the intervening 13 years demonstrated the execution of the mentally retarded is cruel and unusual punishment.  In so ruling, the Court found a national consensus against capital punishment for the mentally retarded because by 2002, 30 States prohibited it.  The <em>Atkins</em> court also resolved that the impairments of the retarded make it less defensible to impose the death penalty as retribution for past crimes, and less likely that the death penalty will have a real deterrent effect.<br /><br />Kennedy used the same reasoning in <em>Simmons</em> to find a national consensus against the execution of juveniles under 18.  Thirty states now prohibit the juvenile death penalty.  That number includes the 12 states that have rejected the death penalty altogether, and 18 that maintain it but expressly exclude juveniles from its reach.  The consistent trend, wrote Kennedy, has been toward abolition of the juvenile death penalty.<br /><br />The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) is a treaty ratified by the United States and part of our domestic law under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution.  When the Senate ratified the ICCPR in 1992, it did so subject to a reservation to Article 6(5) of that treaty, which prohibits capital punishment for juveniles.<br /><br />When Congress enacted the Federal Death Penalty Act in 1994, however, it determined that the death penalty should not extend to juveniles.  Kennedy cited that law, as well as the infrequency of the use of capital punishment for juveniles, as further evidence that a national consensus has developed against the juvenile death penalty, notwithstanding the reservation to the ICCPR two years earlier.<br /><br />Kennedy also took notice of scientific and sociological studies that confirm three general differences between juveniles under 18 and adults, demonstrating that juvenile offenders cannot with reliability be classified among the worst offenders, deserving of the death penalty.<br /><br />First, youths display a "lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility" that "often result in impetuous and ill-considered actions and decisions."  For that reason, wrote Kennedy, almost every State prohibits those under 18 years of age from voting, serving on juries, or marrying without parental consent.<br /><br />Second, juveniles are more vulnerable or susceptible to negative influences and peer pressure, and, "lack the freedom that adults have to extricate themselves from a criminogenic setting." <br /><br />Third, the character of a juvenile is not as well-formed as that of an adult.<br /><br />"From a moral standpoint it would be misguided to equate the failings of a minor with those of an adult, for a greater possibility exists that a minor's character deficiencies will be reformed," wrote Kennedy.<br /><br />Thus, the Court held: "When a juvenile offender commits a heinous crime, the State can exact forfeiture of some of the most basic liberties, but the State cannot extinguish his life and his potential to attain a mature understanding of his own humanity."<br /><br />One of the most notable aspects of its decision in Simmons is the Court's reference to the law of nations.  "Our determination that the death penalty is disproportionate punishment for offenders under 18," Kennedy wrote, "finds confirmation in the stark reality that the United States is the only country in the world that continues to give official sanction to the juvenile death penalty."<br /><br />The Court cited the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which every country in the world except the United States and Somalia has ratified.  Article 37 contains an express prohibition on capital punishment for crimes committed by juveniles under 18.  What Kennedy failed to mention, however, is that the United States has signed that treaty. Under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, a country that signs a treaty is forbidden from taking action inconsistent with the object and purpose of the treaty.  <br /><br />Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a dissenting opinion joined by the Chief Justice and Justice Clarence Thomas.  Scalia, who fashions himself an "originalist," interprets the Constitution the way he thinks it would have been interpreted in 1791, when the Bill of Rights was adopted.  <br /><br />When Scalia spoke at Thomas Jefferson School of Law a few years ago, he chided the "evolutionists" on the Court, who would likely agree with Justice Thurgood Marshall's words: "I do not believe that the meaning of the Constitution was forever fixed at the Philadelphia convention.  The true miracle was not the birth of the Constitution, but its life, a life nurtured through two turbulent centuries of our own making."<br /><br />In his <em>Simmons</em> dissent, Scalia, still stuck in 1791, characteristically mocked the well-settled doctrine that the ba
n on cruel and unusual punishment should be analyzed in light of "the evolving standards of decency that reflect a maturing society."  Yet, Scalia noted: "At the time the Eighth Amendment was adopted, the death penalty could theoretically be imposed for the crime of a 7-year-old."<br /><br />Scalia disagreed with the majority's analysis of a "national consensus" against the execution of 16- and 17-year-olds because he omitted the 12 States that have outlawed the death penalty altogether from the total number of States that have shunned the juvenile death penalty.  Instead of a total of 30 States found by the majority, Scalia counted only 18, less than 50% of the 50 States. <br /><br />The majority's reference to international law drew perhaps the strongest rebuke from Scalia, who has never hidden his contempt for the law of nations.  "Though the views of our own citizens are essentially irrelevant to the Court's decision today, the views of other countries and the so-called international community take center stage," he wrote.  Indeed, in a D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals decision Scalia authored as a judge on that court in 1985, he scornfully referred to "the law of nations &#8212; the so-called 'customary international law.'"  Scalia disregards well-settled case law and the Restatement of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States, which both recognize customary international law as part of our federal law.<br /><br />Scalia eschews international contempt for the execution of juveniles in the United States.  He also overlooks the refusal of European countries, all of which have abolished the death penalty, to turn over prisoners suspected of terrorism to the United States for fear they will be executed.  And Scalia apparently ignores the disgust felt throughout the world for the torture committed by U.S. forces in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo Bay.<br /><br />As a result of <em>Roper v. Simmons</em>, the lives of 72 people who had not attained age 18 when they committed their crimes will be saved.  Forty percent of them were sentenced to death in Bush's home state.  A study in Texas found that the current capital punishment system is an outgrowth of the "legacy of slavery."<br /><br />The Supreme Court fortuitously issued its landmark juvenile death penalty decision on the National Day for the Abolition of the Death Penalty, which falls each year on March 1.  By outlawing the death penalty for the mentally retarded, and now for juveniles under 18, the Court may be taking small steps toward the eventual abolition of capital punishment.<br /><br />With ever increasing numbers of death row inmates being exonerated, public sentiment favoring the death penalty is waning.  The Marquis de Lafayette said nearly 200 years ago, "I shall ask for the abolition of the punishment of death until I have the infallibility of human judgment demonstrated to me."<br /><br />We can hope that one day soon, the United States, which remains the only Western democracy that still sanctions capital punishment, will abolish it.  As Supreme Court Justice Arthur J. Goldberg wrote in 1976: "The deliberate institutionalized taking of human life by the state is the greatest conceivable degradation to the dignity of the human personality."<br /><br /><em>Marjorie Cohn, a professor at Thomas Jefferson School of Law, is executive vice president of the National Lawyers Guild, and the U.S. representative to the American Association of Jurists.</em><br /><p><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Podgor [Georgia State University College of Law]:<br /><br />&quot;We posted <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/2005/03/review_of_marth.html">here</a> that Martha Stewart&#39;s attorneys had filed to reduce her sentence in light of the <em>Booker</em> decision. CNN <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/04/11/news/newsmakers/martha_sentence/index.htm">reports</a> today that the district court will not be reducing Stewart&#39;s sentence.&nbsp; As such she will need to continue the home confinement and continue to wear an ankle bracelet, and we are not talking about the fashionable kind of bracelet but rather a government monitoring device. <br /><br />Stewart, like many others who are or were incarcerated, or on home confinement, are having their cases re-examined in light of <em>Booker</em>.&nbsp; And most, like Martha Stewart, are finding that this new decision is not changing their sentence. This does not preclude these issues being re-examined by the appellate tribunal.&nbsp; The problem here is that it is unlikely that the appellate court&nbsp; will rule much in advance of the finishing of her sentence to home confinement.&nbsp; &nbsp;This case is also another indication that <em>Booker </em>will not have the dramatic effect that some anticipated it would have. The bottom line is that the sentence stays the same.&quot; [April 11, 2005; <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog">White Collar Crime Prof Blog</a> has the <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/2005/04/martha_stewart_.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Podgor [GSU]: Pasquantino - For the Government -  5-4</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ellen Podgor [Georgia State University College of Law]:<br /><br />&quot;In a 5-4 decision, the United States Supreme Court issued an extremely narrow decision favorable to the government in the case of<em> Pasquantino v. United States</em>. Justice Thomas, delivering the opinion of the Court, held that there was no violation of the common law revenue rule when the government prosecutes a wire fraud (18 U.S.C. s1343) and the scheme to defraud involves the deprivation of tax revenue to another country. In this case petitioners were &quot;convicted for federal wire fraud for carrying out a scheme to smuggle large quantities of liquor into Canada from the United States.&quot; The circuits were split on whether wire fraud could be used when the loss involved foreign tax revenue. The Court permits this prosecution and additionally finds that the tax revenue is &quot;property&quot; for purposes of the wire fraud statute.<br /><br />What is more interesting about this case, is what is not decided:<br /><br />1. In footnote one of the decision, the Court specifically states that it is expressing &quot;no view on the related question whether a foreign government, based on wire and mail fraud predicates, may bring a civil action under&quot; the RICO statute for defrauding of taxes.<br /><br />2. The Court does not rule on the issue of extraterritoriality as it does not see this case as allowing the wire fraud statute to have &quot;extraterritorial effect.&quot; (the Court in a footnote says this issue was not raised until the Reply brief).<br /><br />The dissent, authored by Ginsburg, and joined by&nbsp; Breyer, Scalia, and Souter, focused on the extraterritorial application.&nbsp; The dissent states:<br /><br />&quot;Construing s1343 to encompass violations of foreign revenue laws, the Court ignores the absence of anything signaling Congress&#39; intent to give the statute such an extraordinary extraterritorial effect.&quot;<br /><br />The dissent also supports its position through use of the Rule of Lenity.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this case does not resolve the extraterritorial application of white collar laws, although it does permit wire fraud to be premised on a tax loss othat occurs outside the United States. The question of extraterritoriality is made more interesting by the Court&#39;s accompanying decision in <em>Small v. United States</em>, where it held that &quot;convicted in any court&quot; as used in section 922(g)(1) is limited to domestic as opposed to foreign convictions.&quot; [April 26, 2005; <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog">White Collar Crime Prof Blog</a> has the <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/2005/04/pasquantino_gov.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

Here&#39;s an excerpt:<blockquote><em>They know we&#39;re not close to a global version of the European superstate. So they are content to champion creeping institutions like the International Criminal Court. They treat U.N. General Assembly resolutions as an emerging body of international law. They seek to foment a social atmosphere in which positions taken by multilateral organizations are deemed to have more &quot;legitimacy&quot; than positions taken by democratic nations. John Bolton is just the guy to explain why this vaporous global-governance notion is a dangerous illusion, and that we Americans, like most other peoples, will never accept it.</em></blockquote>It is interesting that critics of Bolton have refused largely to attack him on policy grounds by, say, criticizing his opposition to the ICC, as Bill Kristol notes <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/470mdmkj.asp?pg=1">here</a>, even though this seems to be the real basis for opposition.

This is a classic Washington tactic but it also reveals how opponents of Bolton have been largely unable (or unwilling) to gain traction by exposing his supposedly far-right views.&quot; [April 15, 2005: <a href="http://lawofnations.blogspot.com">Opinio Juris</a> has the <a href="http://lawofnations.blogspot.com/2005/04/non-debate-on-bolton.html">post</a>.]</p>]]></content:encoded>

Attorney General Eliot Spitzer.  The investigation concerns an insurance transaction between AIG and General Re (a unit of Berkshire Hathaway) that is in effect a reinsurance contract that may have been used by AIG to pump up its insurance reserves.  Reinsurance contracts are nothing new to these companies, but this one was odd because it was General Re buying reinsurance rather than its usual business of selling such contracts.  The contract triggered the resignation of long-time AIG CEO Maurice Greenberg last week, and the focus on Greenberg will be heightened.<br /><br />The firings of the two executives, who had been put on leave last week when Greenberg resigned, highlights a growing trend in corporations that are being investigated by the government and seek to avoid criminal charges by cooperating and conducting internal investigations.  In this case, Smith and Milton have every right to assert the Fifth Amendment to internal investigators because their statements will be turned over to the government, but they have no protection from their employer using that assertion to terminate their employment, unless they have a contract protecting them from such termination.  There could be an argument about whether assertion of the Fifth Amendment is &quot;good cause&quot; if they are not at-will employees, but that issue won&#39;t get decided for quite a while.  A more immediate issue for them will be whether the company continues to pay their legal bills, which is a common right given to corporate executives.  The Department of Justice is suspicious of companies that continue to pay the legal bills of executives who are the targets of criminal investigations, and has stated that it may view the corporation as not being cooperative in that situation.  A criminal charge could cripple AIG because its licenses to sell insurance could be at risk, so the company needs to avoid a criminal charge at almost any cost. A refusal to pay attorney&#39;s fees for its executives would be an issue of contract and state corporate law, and AIG may refuse to pay for the executives&#39; attorneys to show how cooperative they are now, and deal with any legal consequences from a breach of contract later.<br /><br />For the executives, their assertion of the Fifth Amendment will ratchet up the pressure from the government to cooperate.  A Fifth Amendment claim usually has a &quot;where there&#39;s smoke, there&#39;s fire&quot; effect on prosecutors, and the involvement of the U.S. Attorney&#39;s Office in the AIG/General Re investigation will increase, if it hasn&#39;t already.  This is hardly good news for Greenberg and executives at General Re who were involved in the transaction because they are now the primary targets of this new phase of the investigation.  Warren Buffet will continue to rue the day he decided to buy General Re, which has been a millstone for Berkshire Hathaway.&quot; [March 22, 2005: <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/">White Collar Crime Blog</a> has the <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/2005/03/assertion_of_th.html">post.</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Posner [Chicago]: The Bankruptcy Reform Act</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.uchicago.edu/faculty/posner-r/">Richard Posner</a>, University of Chicago Law School:<br /><br />&quot;Congress is on the verge of passing and the President of signing a major overhaul of the Bankruptcy Code. (See <a href="http://www.ws5.com/bankruptcy/">Summary</a> and <a href="http://www.doney.net/bra/index.htm">Changes</a>). The new bankruptcy law, popularly termed the &quot;Bankruptcy Reform Act,&quot; has engendered passionate debate inside and outside Congress. The criticisms of the Act bespeak a failure to analyze it in economic terms.<br /><br />The Act is complex, but the thrust is to make it more difficult for individuals to declare bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. Under Chapter 7, the bankrupt&#39;s assets, minus exempt assets such as a home and work tools, are sold to repay creditors. When the bankrupt is an individual rather than a corporation, his assets often are too limited to enable the creditors to be paid in full what they are owed; often the creditors receive just a few cents on the dollar. However much or little they recover, at the conclusion of the bankruptcy proceeding the bankrupt (save in exceptional cases, as where the debt consists of a fine, or of damages owed because of a fraud committed by the debtor) receives a &quot;discharge,&quot; meaning that the creditors cannot go against him for the unpaid balance of his debts. His debts are wiped out even if he has a high enough income to be able to repay them in full over a period of years.<br /><br />An alternative procedure that individuals (and their creditors) can avail themselves of is Chapter 13 bankruptcy: instead of surrendering his nonexempt assets, the debtor agrees to make periodic payments to his creditors for as long as five years after the bankruptcy. Although Chapter 13 is attractive to some individuals, especially those who have substantial assets, Chapter 7 is more attractive to individuals who have few nonexempt assets but some income, and there are many such individuals. These individuals can run up huge credit card debts for purchases that do not create durable assets (such as food, travel, and entertainment), declare bankruptcy, wipe out their debts, and then start over. The Bankruptcy Reform Act will force many debtors who have annual incomes in excess of the median income in their state of residence to go the Chapter 13 route and thus make periodic payments out of their income for a period of years. The Act also increases the length of time that a bankrupt must wait, after receiving his discharge from his existing debts, before he can declare bankruptcy again and wipe out a new round of debts. The Act contains still other provisions also intended to make it more difficult for individuals to wipe out their debts by declaring bankruptcy under Chapter 7.<br /><br />Critics have derided the Act as mean-spirited and hard on the poor, but they overlook the most important effect that the bill is likely to have, and that is to reduce interest rates. One component of an interest rate is compensation for the risk of default. The higher that risk, the higher the interest rate. This assumes of course that a creditor cannot, in the event of default, collect the debt owed him quickly, fully, and with little expense. If bankruptcy were very cheap and the typical individual bankrupt had assets sufficient to cover his debts, or had no right to discharge his debts and could repay them, with interest, out of future income, default would not impose a substantial cost on creditors and so the risk of default would not have a substantial effect on interest rates. But bankruptcy is costly and most individual bankrupts do not have assets sufficient to cover their debts, yet under existing law they have a right to a discharge of their debts no matter how far short of repaying their creditors their assets fall. So default is costly and this is bound to be reflected in interest rates.<br /><br />Note the irony of the critics&#39; complaint that credit-card interest rates are &quot;exorbitant&quot;; the so-called exorbitance is, to an extent anyway, an artifact of a bankruptcy law that by making bankruptcy inviting to credit-card debtors increases the risk of default and therefore the interest rate. Notice moreover the vicious cycle created by the present system. The greater the risk of default, the higher interest rates are; but the higher interest rates are, the greater is the risk of default, since interest rates represent a fixed cost to the debtor: if he loses his job and his income plummets, he still owes whatever he borrowed when he was flush. Of course, an alternative possibility is that the high rates will discourage borrowing; this is a paternalistic goal of some opponents of the Act. But the high rate of personal bankruptcies that the critics stress is evidence that the vicious cycle dominates the effect of high interest rates in discouraging borrowing.<br /><br />I conclude that the new Act, by increasing the rights of creditors in bankruptcy (for remember that Chapter 13 enables a creditor to obtain repayment out of the debtor&#39;s post-bankruptcy income, not just out of what may be his very limited nonexempt assets at the time of bankruptcy, as under Chapter 7), should reduce interest rates and thus make borrowers better off. The most reckless borrowers&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;those most prone to file repeated Chapter 7 bankruptcies&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;will be made worse off. But there will be fewer of these, precisely because they will be worse off than under the existing system. If bankruptcy is more costly, there will be less of it.<br /><br />Critics say that more than half of all individual bankrupts are not reckless borrowers but rather are unfortunate people who have been hit by unexpected medical expenses. But this ignores the fact that whether one is forced into bankruptcy by a medical expense (or by an interruption of employment as a result of a medical problem) depends on one&#39;s other borrowing. If one is already borrowed to the hilt, an unexpected medical expense may indeed force one over the edge. But knowing that medical expenses are a risk in our society, prudent people avoid loading themselves to the hilt with nonmedical debt.<br /><br />At a more fundamental level, one might ask why voluntary bankruptcy is ever permitted. It is easy to understand involuntary bankruptcy&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;that is, bankruptcy forced upon a debtor by his creditors. Such bankruptcy overcomes the free-rider problem that would exist if multiple creditors were allowed to race each other to be first to seize the assets of a defaulting debtor, when the creditors as a whole might be better off with a more orderly liquidation. But why should a debtor ever be permitted to write off his debts? One answer is that, assuming people are risk averse, voluntary bankruptcy operates as a kind of social insurance. One cannot buy private insurance against going broke (for then people would indeed borrow recklessly), but even a prudent borrower could find himself broke as a result of an unforeseeable streak of bad luck. However, the Bankruptcy Reform Act does not eliminate voluntary bankruptcy. The social-insurance role is fulfilled by Chapter 13 as well as by Chapter 7, since after five years of partial payments the Chapter 13 bankrupt is entitled to a full discharge of the unpaid balance of his debts.<br /><br />Behind the Bankruptcy Reform Act, as behind the President&#39;s proposal for social security reform, is an ideology of giving nonwealthy people greater responsibility for their own economic welfare, which entails subjecting them to additional financial risk. Under the present system, the prudent and the imprudent consumer pay the same high interest rates, assuming creditors can&#39;t readily determine which consumers are prudent and which are imprudent. By lowering interest rates on credit-card and other consumer debt while at the same time discouraging default, the Bankruptcy Reform Act will encourage consumers to exercise greater care in borrowing&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;yet at the same time, because interest rates will be lower, the Act will enable prudent consumers (who do not face a high risk of bankruptcy) to borrow more and by doing so will increase their consumption options. The Act will not redistribute wealth from the poor to the rich, but from the imprudent borrower to the prudent borrower.&quot;  [March 27, 2005; <a href="http://www.becker-posner-blog.com">The Becker-Posner Blog</a> has the <a href="http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/archives/2005/03/the_bankruptcy.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

I will blog more on each of these separate points after I have read the entire release.   But I have a couple of initial reactions.  I am not as optimistic as Annan and <a href="http://lawofnations.blogspot.com/2005/03/can-international-law-fight-terrorism.html">Julian </a>that there is currently any shared understanding of &quot;terrorism&quot; such that the entire UN membership can sign on to Annan&#39;s proposed definition of terrorism, which he adopted from the recommendation of the <a href="http://www.un.org/secureworld/report.pdf">Panel on Threats, Challenge and Change</a>.  (For a round-up of critiques -- some arguing the proposed definition is too broad, some that it is too narrow --  see this <a href="http://www.asil.org/pdfs/ASIL_News0502.pdf">discussion </a>in the latest ASIL newsletter.)  As to Security Council membership, the devil is in the details.  Will there be an additional permanent member with a veto? Or two with rotating membership?  For now, I think it appropriate to recognize the boldness and seriousness of Annan&#39;s plan; this is the most ambitious reform program ever put forth in the history of the UN.  Stay tuned.&quot;  [March 21, 2005: <a href="http://lawofnations.blogspot.com/">Opinio Juris</a> has the <a href="http://lawofnations.blogspot.com/2005/03/annan-to-propose-reforms-today-human.html">post.</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Bainbridge [UCLA]: Terry Schiavo, Congress, and First Principles</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.ucla.edu/faculty/bios/bainbridge">Stephen Bainbridge</a> [UCLA Law School]:<br /><br />&quot;Now that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/21/politics/21cnd-debate.html?hp&ex=1111467600&en=d959f74eb94c300f&ei=5094&partner=homepage">Congress has approved the legislation to give federal courts jurisdiction over the Terry Schiavo case</a>, I am finding myself oddly unable to reach a definitive assessment of that action. As I see it, Congress&#39; act implicates four first principles I hold dear: The culture of life; Limited government; Federalism; The rule of law.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I do not see how we can reconcile the four in this case.<br /><br /><strong>The culture of life.</strong>  As a Catholic, I accept as binding the Church&#39;s magisterial teaching on the <a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_25031995_evangelium-vitae_en.html">Gospel of Life</a>. Of particular relevance to the Schiavo case, of course, is Pope John Paul II&#39;s <a href="http://www.cathnews.com/news/403/122.php">statement</a> that the removal of feeding tubes from people in a persistent vegetative state is immoral and &quot;euthanasia by omission.&quot; (For a useful explication of the context in which the statement was made, see this <a href="http://www.archden.org/dcr/news.php?e=80&s=4&a=1933">analysis</a> from the Archdiocese of Denver.)<br /><br />But I also believe that even non-believers can (and many do) embrace a culture of life. We live in a society that offers fewer and fewer protections for the weak and vulnerable. When another&#39;s life becomes inconvenient, we seem increasingly willing to end it. Abortion, assisted suicide, and euthanasia. What next? Solving Social Security&#39;s woes by putting the old folks out to sea on ice floes?<br /><br /><strong>Limited Government</strong>. I am no libertarian. Like most conservatives, however, I do believe in a limited government. If Terry Schiavo had left a living will directing that feeding tubes be removed once she was in a persistent vegetative state, I would regretfully counsel that we respect her wishes. But she did not. Instead, the courts have chosen to believe the potentially self-serving testimony of a husband with serious conflicts of interest. If government does not have a legitimate role in protecting someone so vulnerable, of what use is government at all?<br /><br />But which government?<br /><br /><strong>Federalism</strong>. The national government is, as the 10th Amendment to the Constitution makes clear, a government of limited and enumerated powers. To be sure, the Civil War and the post-War amendments de facto expanded the scope of the national government&#39;s powers. Likewise, the infamous &quot;switch in time that saved nine&quot; de facto eviscerated the 10th Amendment. Of late, however, we seem to have been slowly recovering some aspects of what might be called the Constitution-in-Exile.<br /><br />Federalism is important both for pragmatic and moral reasons. As to the former, Justice Brandeis famously opined that: &quot;It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous State may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of country.<br /><br />As to the latter, federalism is closely linked in my analysis to the principle of subsidiarity.<br /><br />&quot;This tenet holds that nothing should be done by a larger and more complex organization which can be done as well by a smaller and simpler organization. In other words, any activity which can be performed by a more decentralized entity should be. This principle is a bulwark of limited government and personal freedom.&quot; (<a href="http://www.acton.org/publicat/randl/article.php?id=200">Link</a>)<br /><br />Yet, like most virtues, federalism is capable of becoming a vice if we make a fetish of it. Would the rest of the country really stand by and watch if Florida adopted a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004VVNB/corporatilawa-20">Logan&#39;s Run</a>-like policy of euthanizing anybody over a certain age? If Appomattox proved anything, it proved that the national government can (and should) override state&#39;s rights to protect the basic human rights of the weak and vulnerable.<br /><br /><strong>Rule of law</strong>. To this point in my thinking, I find that neither the principle of limited government nor that of federalism poses a serious bar to Congressional interference in the Schiavo cases. Only the seemingly exiled notion that Congress may exercise solely those powers enumerated in the Constitution appears to be a bar to federal intervention. In contrast, I believe that the rule of law is a serious obstacle to federal intervention.<br /><br />The rule of law proscribes ex post facto legislation. To be sure, the Constitutional proscription of such laws has been interpreted for over two centuries as extending solely to the criminal laws. As a prudential matter, however, there is a strong case to be made for extending that same principle to civil laws. As Madison explained in Federalist No. 44, for example:<br /><br />&quot;Bills of attainder, ex-post facto laws, and laws impairing the obligation of contracts are contrary to the first principles of the social compact, and to every principle of sound legislation.... [<strong>T]he sober people of America are weary of the fluctuating policy which has directed the public councils. They have seen with regret and indignation that sudden changes and legislative interferences, in cases affecting personal rights, become jobs in the hands of enterprising and influential speculators, and snares to the more industrious and less informed parts of the community</strong>. They have seen, too, that one legislative interference is but the first link of a long chain of repetitions, every subsequent interference being naturally produced by the effects of the preceding. They very rightly infer, therefore, that some thorough reform is wanting, which will banish speculations on public measure, inspire a general prudence and industry, and give a regular course to the business of society.&quot;<br /><br />Or, as Justice O&#39;Connor observed in <em>General Motors Corp. v. Evert Romein</em> (1992):<br /><br />&quot;Retroactive legislation presents problems of unfairness that are more serious than those posed by prospective legislation, because it can deprive citizens of legitimate expectations and upset settled transactions.&quot;<br /><br />Likewise, the rule of law counsels against crafting laws that apply to an individual case. If public policy counsels for prohibiting the removal of feeding tubes from persons in a persistent vegetative state or, more precisely relevant to this case, giving federal courts jurisdiction to review such cases, the principle of equal protection under the laws counsels that such legislation should be available to all similarly situated persons, not just those who have become the poster child for a particular cause.<br /><br />Finally, the rule of law requires the separation of powers. It is the job of Congress and state legislatures to pass laws of general applicability. It is the job of courts to apply those laws in particular cases.<br /><br />I&#39;ll grant you that the judges in Florida often seem more concerned with enacting personal policy preferences (and getting favorable mentions from the NY Times) than following the law. See, e.g., Bush v. Gore. I&#39;m reliably informed by an attorney who was involved in the Schiavo cases that the presiding judge committed two structural errors: (1) the judge compromised his judicial independence by assuming inconsistent roles and (2) Terri was denied effective representation because of her husband/guardian&#39;s conflict of interest.<br /><br />If so, the rule of law was compromised by the presiding judge. The solution to such judicial errors, however, is an appeal within the judicial system. Ex post facto laws limited to a single case are not an appropriate solution.<br /><br /><strong>Conclusion</strong>. In sum, the culture of life and the rule of law appear to be in unavoidable conflict. Both are central values of a free and just society. All of which makes it extremely difficult to decide where one stands on this issue.<br /><br />Ultimately, I think we need to get past this case to deal with the broader issues. How should we as a society regulate end of life decisions? That&#39;s the real question and its one that nobody in power seems very interested in dealing with.

		<title>Ribstein [Illinois]: Schiavo and abortion</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ribstein.org/">Larry Ribstein</a>, University of Illinois College of Law:<br /><br />&quot;Schiavo is about abortion, at least that much is obvious. Terri Schiavo is a &quot;fetus&quot; tethered by life-giving machines rather than to her mother. There&#39;s speculation about whether she shows signs of life. Portraying the &quot;fetus&quot; as an adult lying on a bed outside of the womb makes the right to life more salient and politically persuasive.<br /><br />I have been arguing for resolution of such morally contentious issues at the state rather than federal level, focusing on same sex marriage, e.g., <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=599162">here</a>, and in the Marriage archive of this blog. In that case, the parties have the opportunity to choose, and the argument for intervention rests on the propriety of forcing others in the community to recognize this choice.<br /><br />Of course Terri Schiavo has no such choice, and it is at least debatable to let others make it for her. Obviously this isn&#39;t about the &quot;right to die,&quot; but about the &quot;right to kill.&quot;<br /><br />Others who come to Terri&#39;s position might make the choice in a living will before they&#39;re disabled. This opportunity for advance choice distinguishes the right to die from both abortion and Terri Schiavo. The states might offer a variety of living will options, making this situation at least somewhat comparable to the same sex marriage debate.<br /><br />But for now, the &quot;right to kill&quot; is a battle in the abortion war, and it has dragged Congress and the right to die along with it. Living wills may be a victim of this political struggle, as <a href="http://www.tampabaylive.com/stories/2005/03/050318wills.shtml">this post </a>suggests. If so, they would be another casualty of the battle that began with the Supreme Court&#39;s attempt to foreclose the national debate 30 years ago.&quot; [March 20, 2005; <a href="http://busmovie.typepad.com/ideoblog">Ideoblog</a> has the <a href="http://busmovie.typepad.com/ideoblog/2005/03/schiavo_the_rig.html">post</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Henning [Wayne State]: Is AIG the Next ...?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.wayne.edu/faculty/profiles/henning_peter.html">Peter Henning</a>, Wayne State University Law School:<br /><br />&quot;With all the turmoil swirling around American International Group Inc., I wonder whether the company will become the new poster-child for corporate misconduct. An insurance company is built on trust, that the money given to them today (the float, as Warren Buffett discusses ad nauseam in his letters to shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway) will be invested wisely to pay off claims made in the future. At the moment at least, AIG has a triple A credit rating, but that can change in a hurry if damaging revelations of earnings manipulation take a turn toward falsified records or fraudulent reinsurance transactions designed to cover up potentially significant losses.<br /><br />I hate to use the E word -- Enron -- but that company&#39;s energy trading division, which was its primary business unit, was also built on the trust of other market participants, and once serious questions about its survival arose, other companies simply refused to do business with it. On the Enron theme, another scary similarity for the two companies is their use of questionable off-shore entities to enhance their balance sheets: SPEs for Enron, and possibly captive reinsurers for AIG.&nbsp; The reinsurance companies that did business with AIG are located in &quot;lightly regulated&quot; jurisdictions, like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, for reasons other than the nice weather and great beaches. A disturbing note in a Wall Street Journal story about former AIG CEO Maurice Greenberg (<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB111206560939091696,00.html?mod=home_whats_news_us">here</a>) is that he refused to turn over documents related to two off-shore entities in which he has substantial involvement. The inquiry into the off-shore entities is a definite wild card for AIG, and it is hard to predict what will be revealed.<br /><br />Is AIG going to end up like Enron? I doubt it, because Enron (and WorldCom) had flawed business models, and at this point there does not appear to be the same problem at AIG. A different parallel may be to HealthSouth, at least as that company has been portrayed by the government in the prosecution of Richard Scrushy with its cabal of senior executives manipulating the books every quarter for years. A third senior AIG executive, Michael Murphy, has not been cooperative in the company&#39;s internal investigation, and another Wall Street Journal story (<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB111206564022891698,00.html?mod=home_whats_news_us">here</a>) portrays his deep involvement in Bermudan tax and reinsurance affairs for both the company and Bermuda. If Murphy asserts the Fifth Amendment -- and he&#39;s definitely a candidate for it -- then he will be the third senior executive to refuse to cooperate. If more AIG executives refuse to cooperate with investigators, it begins to look like there was significant involvement among the top levels of the company in criminal conduct. If there is a plea agreement involving a senior AIG executive, that will likely mark a significant turning point in the investigation and increase the pressure on the company.<br /><br />What are the potential problems that could threaten the company in the near future? Here are two possibilities: first, if there is evidence of document destruction or falsified records, then the case turns from an accounting inquiry into an obstruction of justice case. While the Arthur Andersen effect -- the destruction of a viable business by a criminal conviction -- is one that will slow down prosecutors in deciding to charge the company, AIG already has one criminal strike against it from its plea deal last December (earlier post <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/2004/12/aig_finalizes_s.html">here</a>). Prosecutors are already wary of the company, and a lack of cooperation by senior executives coupled with any possible document destruction might push it toward a criminal indictment. Second, insurance companies have to be licensed in every state (and the District of Columbia) in which they operate, so AIG is subject to as many as 51 state regulators. Insurance commissioners and state AGs beyond just N.Y. Attorney General Eliot Spitzer may take action against the company, and losing its license in a significant number of states could affect its domestic operations. Add to that potential foreign regulatory actions, and AIG could be subject to the proverbial thousand cuts.<br /><br />AIG is an important company, not only in the insurance market but also for investors. It is one of the thirty companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the gyration of its stock (it is down over 20% since the first set of subpoenas came to light in February) affects a significant number of investors. If the investigations are limited to more technical accounting matters, involving such interesting topics as whether to consolidate the results of a subsidiary on the parent&#39;s financial statements and the proper accounting for reinsurance contracts, then I think AIG will come through without too much damage. If the case turns into one involving fraudulent transactions and bogus agreements, the effect will be much greater. If there is obstruction of justice, than in another future case the question will be whether a company is the next AIG.&quot; [March 29, 2005: <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/">White Collar Crime Blog</a> has the <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/2005/03/is_aig_the_next.html">post.</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Ku [Hofstra]: More Uninformed Predictions On Medellin</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.hofstra.edu/Academics/Law/law_ku.cfm">Julian Ku</a>, Hofstra University School of Law:<br /><br />&quot;Having failed to motivate myself to get down to D.C. for oral argument in Medellin, and being too cheap to shell out the money for an instant transcript, I will have to content myself with reviewing the several very interesting press accounts of the argument at <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/movabletype/archives/2005/03/medellin_case_t.html">SCOTUSBlog</a>, <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2115869">Slate</a>, <a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1112016914359">Law.com</a>, and the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/29/politics/29scotus.html?">NYT</a>. All of these accounts seem to agree that the Justices&#39; questions reflect no consensus on what to do with what is becoming a very procedurally messy case.<br />All of these accounts, however, do suggest that the Justices are not thrilled with the idea of staying the case while the state court proceeds, preferring either they &quot;DIG&quot; the case (dismiss, cert being improvidently granted) or reaching the merits of the case. This means maybe I was wrong in thinking that Texas was gambling by opposing the stay motion. Ordinarily, courts don&#39;t like to reach out to decide cases with complex and difficult cases raising important constitutional issues if those cases could be decided elsewhere. This is why Medellin&#39;s stay motion seemed like a sensible strategy. But this is the Supreme Court of the United States. Deciding complex constitutional cases that they don&#39;t have to decide and that might otherwise be left to the states or Congress is exactly what this (or any) Supreme Court loves to do.<br /><br />My initial view, after the Government&#39;s brief was filed, was that the Court would dismiss the case and avoid the constitutional and statutory interpretation dilemmas raised by the parties in this case. The various accounts from yesterday do not lead me to change my initial prediction and also suggest strongly that no stay will be issued. The only question now seems to be whether the Court will &quot;DIG&quot; the case or whether they will reach out and decide the merits. Although I would prefer the Court to reach the merits and adopt the views of Texas, the U.S., and the brief of the <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/movabletype/archives/medellin.sixprofessors.amicus.pdf">Seven Law Professors</a> (and perhaps cite articles by some of those brilliant professors) that federal habeas jurisdiction does not permit a treaty-based claim, it seems like &quot;digging&quot; the case is the most responsible thing for the Court to do here.<br /><br />UPDATE: My colleague Eric Freedman, who knows everything there is to know about these sorts of things, points out that the Court has another option besides the ones discussed above.  They could G.V.R. (grant-vacate-remand) the case back to either the Fifth Circuit or the federal district court in light of the U.S.G.&#39;s intervention.  Unlike &quot;digging&quot; the case, this would vacate the Fifth Circuit&#39;s opinion in this case.<br /><br />The only problem with this option is that it is not at all clear if the Fifth Circuit&#39;s opinion in this case is wrong, even in light of the S.G.&#39;s brief and the President&#39;s executive order.  So vacating that opinion may not be what the court wants to do if they want to remain agnostic on whether or not there is indeed a federal judicial remedy for Medellin here.  On the flip side, &quot;digging&quot; the case would essentially leave in place a decision going the other way on the question of a federal judicial remedy.<br /><br />So maybe they should reach the merits after all...&quot; [March 29, 2005: <a href="http://lawofnations.blogspot.com/">Opinio Juris</a> has the <a href="http://lawofnations.blogspot.com/2005/03/more-uninformed-predictions-on.html">post.</a>]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.scu.edu/law/faculty/all/fcty_1078.html">Paul Goda S.J.</a> of Santa Clara University School of Law says that the procedures adopted for the election of a pope are founded on the conviction that there is a higher good to be served beyond the simple transmission of institutional power ...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/goda.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>n describing a dialog among the Apostles at the Last Supper, the Gospel writer Luke said that "A dispute arose among them about who should be regarded as the greatest."   In an analogical way, the words may be applied to any dispute among human beings who are involved in the process of the distribution of power.  The dispute among the Apostles arose out of a misconstruction of the mission of Jesus.  They wanted earthly power but that was not his mission.  However, the dispute was also one whose solution had to be institutionalized if Jesus' mission was to continue in history.<br /><br />The institutionalization of the process of the transmission of power - such as that undertaken by the College of Cardinals, meeting in conclave in Rome beginning April 18 - is a political process, deep within the incarnate history of humankind.  To be incarnate is to be invested with a bodily, human form.<br /><br />Even on the assumption that the faith espoused by the Roman Catholic Church is true, that church could not escape institutionalization for two reasons.  First, it is certainly an organization made up of human beings who live in history.  It is subject to the same sociological, economic, political, and historical processes that touch every human institution.  But more importantly, in the light of the religious tradition it claims, it is also the Body of Christ -- <em>Corpus Christi</em> -- an "incorporation," if you will, primarily of believers.  Further, if the claims of the Catholic Church were true, there is also an "incorporation" as well of every human being, since the underlying claim is that Jesus is Lord of all.  He is claimed to be Lord not just because He is God but because He paid His dues in becoming incarnate, in having been invested with a bodily form.  If His memory continues within history, that memory has to be institutionalized.<br /><br />The Roman Catholic Church claims to be that institutionalized memory, living in history.  The thrust of this essay is not to dissect other claims to be that institutionalized memory.  It is to look at the electoral process that has become the mode of transmitting power within the Roman Catholic Church.  That institutionalized memory was reconfirmed in 1996 by Pope John Paul II in his Apostolic Constitution <em>Universi Dominici Gregis</em> ([Shepherd] "of the Lord's whole  flock").<br /><br />The earliest modes of transmitting papal power are almost certainly lost to memory.  It is most probably not true that St. Peter constituted a senate for the Roman Church to elect his successor.  It is more probable that neighboring bishops made the choice and that sometime in the fourth century the people had some part in the elections.  <br /><br />After the incorporation of the Roman Catholic Christian Church into the structure of the Roman Empire by Constantine, there was some interference by the Emperors in the election of the Pope, especially when there were disputed elections.  Barbarian kings took the place of Western Emperors in such interference.   Indeed, upon the reassertion of the authority of the Eastern Roman Empire in the West, the Eastern Emperors actually had a right of confirmation over the choice of Pope.<br /><br />On occasion in the first millennium, a reigning Pope nominated his successor, but apparently this practice never solidified into real control of the selection of the succeeding Pope.  The Roman nobles also had some part in the selection of the Pope in the midst of what we call the Dark Ages.  The Western Emperors tried to get the same right of confirmation, indeed of nomination, as the Eastern Emperors once had, but this never solidified into practice.  It is hard for us who know modern Europe to imagine its misery during the Dark Ages of European history, approximately from the fall of the Roman Empire in 476 A.D. to the turn of the millennium in 1000 A. D.  The corruption and poverty in Western Europe touched the heart of the Roman Catholic Church as well, affecting the selection of Popes around the turn of the first millennium.  The struggle for independence of Papal elections was long and difficult.<br /><br />A series of canons over those centuries established practices some of which remain today.  That the cardinal bishops are the first to meet to elect a new Pope was established in 1059 by a decree of Nicholas II, although there was some kind of assent of lower clergy and laity that was interwoven into the process.  Imperial rights were not spelled out but apparently the result of the choice was supposed to be forwarded to the Emperor for confirmation.  The Popes after Gregory VII in 1073 ended that practice by no longer asking for confirmation.<br /><br />In 1139, the Tenth Ecumenical Synod, a Lateran Council, decreed that the choice was left to the cardinals alone, and in 1179, another Lateran Council decreed that the pope was to be chosen by a two-thirds majority.  That, of course, led to a problem not unknown to modern legislators.  Look to the tax problems of California.  Be that as it may, the years 1268-1271 saw a deadlock at Viterbo over the election of the next Pope.  Incipient European nationalism fractured those entrusted with choice.  The good citizens of Viterbo finally locked up the Cardinals "with a key," <em>cum clave</em>, until they elected a Pope.  They got tired of having undecided Cardinals wandering around.<br /><br />The practice of the conclave was institutionalized in 1274 at the Second Council of Lyons in the Apostolic Constitution, <em>Ubi Periculum</em> (Where danger...).  The provisions were stringent and after five days, only bread, wine, and water would be the food for recalcitrant Cardinals.  The principle of the conclave worked and after some years, finally grew to be the common practice, both to protect the independence of the electors and to speed up the electoral process.<br /><br />At the same time, a kind of right of exclusion grew up as nationalism solidified its hold on Europe in the last 500 years of the second millennium.  The major Catholic powers, Austria, France and Spain, claimed a right to tell those at the conclave which individuals were personae minus gratae (less pleasing candidates).  Such rights are almost certainly not traceable to the medieval right of confirmation.  Such rights apparently were exercised on occasion and certainly were combated and condemned by Popes and canonists for 400 years.  The last such interference was in 1903 when Austria exercised the right.  Pope Pius X effectively and finally repudiated such a right of exclusion in 1904.<br /><br />Pope John Paul II built on the structure of the preceding centuries in the Apostolic Constitution <em>Universi Dominici Gregis</em> that I mentioned earlier.  Probably his greatest change, which actually is not a new idea, is to allow the electors the right to change the mandate from a two-thirds majority to a majority of electors after four rounds of ballots, the first round apparently of 12 or 13 ballots, the last three rounds of 7 ballots each.  Otherwise, the method of election is spelled out in great and mostly traditional detail.  <br /><br />But it is neither on those details nor on my words that I wish to focus at the end of this essay.  Rather, I&#39;d like to give my readers a chance to peruse a few paragraphs of <em>Universi Dominici Gregis</em> directly, to get a feel of past centuries which still touch the present. The first paragraph I quote summarizes the issue of independen
ce of the electors:<blockquote>...in order that the Cardinal electors may be protected from the indiscretion of others and from possible threats to their independence of judgment and freedom of decision, I absolutely forbid the introduction into the place of the election, under whatsoever pretext, or the use, should they have been introduced, of technical instruments of any kind for the recording, reproducing or transmitting of sound, visual images or writing.</blockquote>Indeed, as I write, experts in communications technology are sweeping the Vatican! The second set of paragraphs relates to claimed jurisdiction and the source of a set of procedures:<blockquote>The Shepherd of the Lord&#39;s whole flock is the Bishop of the Church of Rome, where the Blessed Apostle Peter, by sovereign disposition of divine Providence, offered to Christ the supreme witness of martyrdom by the shedding of his blood. It is therefore understandable that the lawful apostolic succession in this See, with which &quot;because of its great pre-eminence every Church must agree&quot; [St. Ireneus], has always been the object of particular attention.<br /><br />Precisely for this reason, down the centuries the Supreme Pontiffs have deemed it their special duty, as well as their specific right, to establish fitting norms to regulate the orderly election of their Successor. Thus, also in more recent times, my predecessors Saint Pius X, Pius XI, Pius XII, John XXIII and lastly Paul VI, each with the intention of responding to the needs of the particular historical moment, issued wise and appropriate regulations in order to ensure the suitable preparation and orderly gathering of the electors charged, at the vacancy of the Apostolic See, with the important and weighty duty of electing the Roman Pontiff.</blockquote>Clearly, we are all set into history; we do have the power to make our own procedures.  The faith behind these particular Roman Catholic procedures is a faith in incarnate history.  It is a conviction that the Lord walks with us in history, indeed, with all of us.  It is a conviction that our procedures should aim at a higher good than simply the organized use of power.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Father Paul Goda is a law professor at Santa Clara University School of Law, where he teaches community property, wills and trusts and jurisprudence.

		<title>The Legacy of Pope John Paul II: A Larger Vision of Law and Freedom</title>

The first is that I cannot nuance what I say, or even begin to say all that I was requested to say, in a thousand word op-ed.  The second is that my expertise is civil law rather than canon law.<br /><br />I do know, however, that as a legislator alone Pope John Paul II would have gone down in history with his name attached to the promulgations of the revised Code of Canon Law in 1983 and to the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches in 1990.  These two documents are a legacy to help the Church, and Europe, "breathe with two lungs," with western and eastern traditions.<br /><br />I read recently that Pope John Paul II amazed those around him when he personally reviewed and annotated the draft of the revised Code of Canon Law for the "western" church and that he also did so with the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches.  Both codes were built on centuries of tradition, with a great deal of modern study which were not his, nor was the original impetus his.  And therein lies a truth.  At the beginning of the Apostolic Constitution, <em>Sacri Canones</em> Pope John Paul II wrote in 1990:<blockquote>The Fathers gathered in the seventh ecumenical council in 287 A.D. at Nicaea.  The legates sent by my predecessor, Hadrian I presided.  &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; the Council brought forth the Sacred Canons and confirmed them &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;</blockquote>It is almost stunning to feel the years of history and tradition that those words reveal.  The vision behind those years of history and tradition, is, I believe, the legacy in law of Pope John Paul II.  I choose not to use the word legal because that word usually has connotations of describing a system composed of legalistic, dry formulas which destroy vision.  St. Thomas Aquinas said that of the canonists once upon a time and it can still be true.  On the other hand, the word law has myriads of meanings, depending on the assumptions of the one who verbalizes it.  The meaning of law can range from raw power to visionary ideal.<br /><br />In its ideal meaning, law is not just a legal system but a translation of the highest aspirations and loftiest challenges of human beings into the enforced norms of a community.  Therein lies the sad tale of humanity, with political messianism, of whatever stripe, including the Roman Catholic Church, enforcing by blood its highest ideals.  It is the terrifying temptation of power.  Pope John Paul II, assailed for apologizing too much and for not apologizing enough, nevertheless made his apologies for the misuse of ecclesiastical power in the sack of Constantinople and the sins of the Inquisition and the Crusades and for anti-Semitism.<br /><br />But he never failed to try to teach that the highest meaning of freedom is not simply the capacity to do what we will but rather the possibility of joining our wills freely with God's will as living and loving human beings, challenged to give ourselves back to God by limiting our self-will, under law, and under love.  In <em>Evangelium Vitae</em>, "The Gospel of Life," written in 1995, he wrote his legacy, his vision:<blockquote>Every individual, precisely by reason of the mystery of the Word of God who was made flesh, is entrusted to the maternal care of the Church. Therefore every threat to human dignity and life must necessarily be felt in the Church&#39;s very heart; it cannot but affect her at the core of her faith in the Redemptive Incarnation of the Son of God, and engage her in her mission of proclaiming the Gospel of life in all the world and to every creature.<br /><br />Today this proclamation is especially pressing because of the extraordinary increase and gravity of threats to the life of individuals and peoples, especially where life is weak and defenseless. In addition to the ancient scourges of poverty, hunger, endemic diseases, violence and war, new threats are emerging on an alarmingly vast scale.<br /><br />The Second Vatican Council, in a passage which retains all its relevance today, forcefully condemned a number of crimes and attacks against human life. Thirty years later, taking up the words of the Council and with the same forcefulness I repeat that condemnation in the name of the whole Church, certain that I am interpreting the genuine sentiment of every upright conscience: &quot;Whatever is opposed to life itself, such as any type of murder, genocide, abortion, euthanasia, or willful self-destruction, whatever violates the integrity of the human person, such as mutilation, torments inflicted on body or mind, attempts to coerce the will itself; whatever insults human dignity, such as subhuman living conditions, arbitrary imprisonment, deportation, slavery, prostitution, the selling of women and children; as well as disgraceful working conditions, where people are treated as mere instruments of gain rather than as free and responsible persons; all these things and others like them are infamies indeed. They poison human society, and they do more harm to those who practice them than to those who suffer from the injury. Moreover, they are a supreme dishonor to the Creator.&quot;</blockquote>In an address to a "Symposium on 'Evangelium Vitae' and Law," in 1996, he argued that there is a necessary link between freedom and truth.  I certainly do not mean, and I doubt very much that Pope John Paul II would have wished, to go back to a legal system with an Inquisition.  St. Thomas Aquinas himself understood that not all of morality could be enforced by the legal system.  But St. Thomas also understood that much of the gap between law and morality existed as an excuse for failure and not as an exercise of freedom in the deepest sense of the word.  Pope John Paul II's incessant argument against abortion was grounded in the reality of his understanding of the dignity of every human life and in the practical realization that generalized, legalized abortion is the enforcement of power by blood and that its broad use is giving to individuals what once used to be the province of armies.<br /><br />It is the nature of the modern, developed western legal system to emphasize individual freedom, the legal capacity to do whatever one wants to do as much as possible.  And that is indeed a kind of good.  But the breadth of that legal freedom is paradoxically limited.  John Paul II spoke to a larger vision of law and freedom.<br /><br />The canons of law and tradition flowed from past centuries, from Nicaea and Hadrian I to Pope John Paul II.  It will be over future centuries that the larger vision about law and freedom from the legacy of Pope John Paul II will be learned.  Such learning always should begin with the present.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Father Paul Goda is a law professor at Santa Clara University School of Law, where he teaches community property, wills and trusts and jurisprudence.

		<title>Who Will Take the Lead in Exiting Iraq: Congress or the President?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.northwestern.edu/faculty/fulltime/Nzelibe/Nzelibe.html">Jide Nzelibe</a> of Northwestern University School of Law says that if the new Iraqi government can stabilize the country&#39;s internal security situation, the time may be coming for President Bush to declare victory and order a US withdrawal if he doesn&#39;t want Congressional pressure for a pullout to mount...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/nzelibe.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=1></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>s the euphoria surrounding the recent Iraqi elections dies down, the White House is going to face mounting pressure to develop a concrete exit strategy from Iraq. Thus far, the administration has simply issued a terse statement that American troops will leave when a stable and peaceful Iraq has been established.  Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, the first clamors to bring the troops back home soon have started.  So far it is mostly talk; no member of congress has actually introduced a formal congressional resolution calling for a withdrawal.  <br /><br />As the White House confronts the prospects of having the troops spend another year in Iraq, it should not take the growing din on Capitol Hill too lightly.  Although Congress's bark is often more than its bite in war powers, it enjoys a successful track record in forcing the President's hand in the termination of unpopular wars.  Reagan's Lebanon deployment that ended in 1984 was a victim of congressional intervention, and so was Clinton's 1993 Somalia deployment.  In both instances, the President insisted that Congress's suggested withdrawal timetable would imperil the chances for peace and send a wrong signal to United States' enemies around the World, but Congress did not budge.   Indeed, in an interesting parallel to the current Iraqi crisis, President Reagan vowed in early 1984 that American troops would remain in Lebanon until a democratic and stable government came into power.  Less than three months later after he made that speech, however, American troops were on their way out of Lebanon after Congress threatened to cut off funding for the deployment.  <br /><br />President Bush, unlike Reagan and Clinton, enjoys the benefit of having members of his party as the majority in both houses of congress, but that might not be enough to stave off congressional opposition.  In both Lebanon and Somalia, for instance, a significant number of legislators from the President's party jumped ranks to support resolutions calling for the immediate termination of hostilities. In both of those conflicts, public opinion polls, rather than partisan loyalty, seemed to drive congressional intervention.  Thus far, public support for the war in Iraq seems to be more erratic, although the polls took a slight dip in the few months leading up to the 2004 presidential election.  The historical evidence suggests, however, that Congress is likely to introduce a resolution imposing a timetable for the withdrawal of troops when public opinion polls take a sustained dip for a couple of months in a row. <br /><br />Interestingly, with respect to the termination of wars, the President and Congress have two strikingly different approaches to public opinion.  Congress tends to react to public opinion when it constrains the President's war initiatives.  In Lebanon, for instance, members of Congress would repeatedly call for termination plans once public opinion of the conflict dipped below 45% for over two months, but then seemed to retreat once the polls went up again.<br /><br />In contrast, the President tends to frame and shape public opinion in his role as the commander-in-chief.  Rather than follow the course of public opinion when a war is going badly, the President is more likely to entrench himself into a war and gamble that the course of the war (and public opinion) will change in his favor.  For instance, President Johnson repeatedly escalated the conflict in Vietnam whenever there was a sustained dip in the public opinion polls.  President Reagan followed a similar strategy in Lebanon during the early months of 1984 when public support of the deployment was often below 40%.  Indeed, as the public opinion polls on the Lebanese deployment started to decline dramatically in January 1984, President Reagan mounted an unsuccessful public relations campaign to try to mobilize public support for the deployment. <br /><br />The presidential reluctance to follow the course of public opinion in unpopular wars makes sense.  When presidents commit troops to war, they bear a disproportionate amount of the political benefits if there is victory, but then they also bear a disproportionate amount of the blame if there is failure.  A president is aware that the withdrawal of troops in the face of negative public opinion is likely to be construed as an admission of failure or incompetence.  But members of congress, who do not risk the same share of blame as the President does in losing wars, are usually more willing to respond to negative public opinion.  Even those members of congress who voted for a war initially are often willing to support resolutions calling for an end to war once public opinion goes south.  Unlike the President, members of congress can simply deflect blame for their decision by claiming that they were misinformed about the risks and objectives of the war when they initially voted for it.<br /><br />So far President Bush has been able to convince Congress and the American public that it would be foolhardy to leave Iraq in its current stage.  But he should be aware that the risk of civil war or anarchy is often not enough to assuage the American public to hold the course indefinitely, especially if American casualties continue to mount.  President Reagan repeatedly warned the American public and Congress that Lebanon would descend into anarchy and possible occupation by Syria if American troops pulled out in early 1984, but Americans were simply fed up with the recurring scenes of American body-bags coming home from Beirut.  President Reagan turned out to be right: the Lebanese civil war did get worse and the Syrians eventually started an occupation that lasts until the present day. <br /><br />When is the right time, then, for President Bush to order the bulk of the American troops home from Iraq?    If a newly elected Iraqi regime is able to secure a reasonable modicum of security on its own, President Bush may be tempted to call the Iraqi deployment a complete success and order the troops home.  If he does so while American public opinion polls of the Iraqi deployment are over 50%, he would have accomplished what many of his predecessors could not: a politically successful withdrawal strategy.  But if he stays on and public opinion polls of the Iraqi deployment dip below 40% for more than three months in a row, he should rest assured that he will be hearing from the rumbling set on Capitol Hill.       <br /> <br />    <br /><em>Jide Nzelibe is a law professor at Northwestern University School of Law.

Bush recently said, "First of all, justice ought to be fair.  And those who have been hurt ought to have their day in court."  Fine words.  Unfortunately, they are belied by the class action "reform" legislation the President recently pushed into law.  This so-called "Class Action Fairness Act," may well deny thousands of injured Americans their fair day in court.  It tilts the legal system in favor of culpable corporate defendants who have committed fraud, injured consumers, hurt the environment or violated civil rights.<br /><br />The class action legislation was supported by a &quot;who's who&quot; of industry groups that have been called to account for their behavior through class action lawsuits, including chemical companies, pharmaceutical firms and the tobacco industry.  The legislation was opposed by state and federal judges, state attorneys general, law professors from across the country, the AFL-CIO, and over 80 organizations advocating for civil rights, worker rights, seniors, consumers, the disabled, and the environment.<br /><br />Under the best of circumstances, this business-backed law we now have to live with will make it far more burdensome, expensive and time-consuming for individuals to band together to redress wrongs through the court system.   But our real fear is that in many cases, this new law will simply deny access to justice outright.<br /><br />The new law imposes an elaborate matrix which steers nearly all class actions involving more than $5 million dollars in losses into federal court, even where all the claims in the case are based on <strong><em>state</em></strong> law.  Even those few cases that may not or should not be in federal court under the new law will face time consuming litigation just to determine where the case belongs.<br /><br />Effectively, this law covers virtually all class actions.  This massive case shift to federal courts will clog the already overburdened federal courts with thousands of additional complex class actions, delaying or denying justice to the injured parties.  In addition, because federal judges often are neither familiar nor comfortable with the state claims involved in such class actions, many fear they will refuse to hear the cases on the grounds that too many different state laws are involved and the cases are "unmanageable" as class actions.<br /><br /><strong>Class Actions Are Critical for Protecting Individuals' Legal Rights</strong><br /><br />Class action lawsuits ensure that all Americans &#8212; rich and poor alike &#8212; can assert their legal rights.  Class actions allow people who have been harmed by a pattern of discrimination, commercial abuse or other unlawful conduct to group together and bring a claim in situations where each individual claim is not large enough to warrant legal action on its own.  Without the ability to bring a class action, there would be no recourse when thousands, or even millions, of consumers are cheated in small amounts.  The class action device is the only mechanism that allows those consumers to pursue a legal remedy while at the same time providing some deterrence to this type of corporate abuse.<br /><br />Class actions protect victims of unlawful discrimination, workplace violations, investor and consumer fraud, environmental degradation and health and safety violations.  The landmark Supreme Court ruling in <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), for example, came out of a series of class action lawsuits that were initially brought in state courts to desegregate our nation's public school systems.<br /><br />Class actions are currently being used by workers across the country who have been forced to work "off the clock" without being paid. The nation's leading worker and civil rights organizations opposed the law because it would "adversely impact the workplace and civil rights of ordinary Americans by making it extremely difficult to enforce civil rights and labor rights."[1]<br /> <br />Class actions are often the only mechanism available for people harmed by toxic spills, contaminated drinking water, polluted air and other environmental hazards.  Over a dozen national environmental organizations wrote Congress urging lawmakers to reject the class action "reform" legislation.<br /><br />In short, class actions often are the most economically efficient way to resolve these matters.  They diminish, not increase, legal costs.  They assure consumer protection without regulatory action.  In many cases, they are a superior alternative to hundreds of separate trials on the same facts.  While some improvements were no doubt needed, it is a sign of misplaced priorities and "spin" that defendants succeeded in demonizing them and now placing virtually all such cases in what the business community sees as a corporate-friendly federal court system.<br /><br /><strong>The New Law Goes Too Far in Broadening Federal Jurisdiction</strong><br /><br />The new law rewrites the jurisdictional rules so that federal courts would have jurisdiction over every state court class action where the amount in controversy exceeds $5 million, if <em>any</em> member of a plaintiff class is a citizen of a state different from any defendant.  There was no justification for such a radical change in current jurisdictional rules.<br /><br />Under the new law, a class action brought in state court by that state's citizens using only that state's laws against a company that has substantial business operations in the same state would be removed to federal court if the company was <em>headquartered</em> or <em>incorporated</em> in a different state.  Today, the headquarters or place of incorporation of a company can be irrelevant to where that company has substantial numbers of employees or does substantial business.  Because most big corporations are incorporated in Delaware where almost no one lives; the federalization ploy is all but absolute.  Citizens of a state will now no longer be able to take advantage of their own state court system if the harm occurred to them in that state by a company with substantial business ties to that state.<br /><br />There is a narrow exception in the law designed to preserve state court class actions, but it will apply only in a few cases.  Specifically, federal courts would be required to decline jurisdiction if greater than two-thirds of the members of the proposed plaintiff class in the aggregate are citizens of the State in which the action is filed and at least one defendant, from whom significant relief is sought, and whose alleged conduct forms a significant basis for the claims asserted, is also a citizen of that state. Additional factors relating to the conduct of all defendants would also have to be present before this exception would apply.  And, even cases that met the narrow exception would stay in state court only if no similar class action had been filed in any state during the previous three years.<br /><br /><strong>Federal Courts May Not Certify These "Nationwide" State Law Class Actions</strong><br /><br />The fear is that federal courts will not be willing to hear national class action lawsuits affecting consumers all over the country.  By removing nationwide class actions to federal court, the legislation may have run these cases into a de
ad end.<br /><br />In a 2003 brief to the Second Circuit, the U.S. Chamber wrote " &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; it is nearly a truism that nationwide class actions in which the claims are subject to varying state laws cannot be certified because they are simply unmanageable."[2]<br /> <br />By their own admission, the industry groups that initiated and aggressively pushed the new law had much more in mind than simply moving the venue of class action litigation from state to federal courts &#8212; the real purpose behind the legislation was to ensure that most consumer class actions never get heard.<br /><br />It is not a mystery why federal courts are reluctant to certify nationwide consumer class action suits.  There is no federal consumer protection statute.  Therefore, class action lawsuits involving fraud, deceptive sales practices, or sales of defective products allege violations of state consumer protection statutes or common law.  State courts, which are accustomed to hearing cases involving state laws, are generally comfortable adjudicating state law consumer class actions.  Federal courts, on the other hand, have far less experience and interest in cases involving solely state law consumer claims.  And their dockets are already crowded by a plethora of federal criminal and civil suits.<br /><br />Six federal circuit courts and at least twenty-six district courts have denied class certification of nationwide consumer fraud cases.  Federal courts often deny class certification to state-based consumer class actions brought on behalf of citizens from different states by relying on Rule 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 23(b)(3) says, in pertinent part, <strong><em>"An action may be maintained as a class action if &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members."</em></strong><br /><br />If courts must apply the laws of different states to different members of a class action, they may find that questions of law common to the members of the class do not predominate, rendering adjudication of the case as a class action unmanageable and deny class certification.  In the typical consumer class action, in which large numbers of consumers have lost relatively small amounts of money, the decision to deny class certification will cut off any opportunity to bring a suit.  The individual members of the class will not suffer losses great enough to justify bringing suit solely on one person's behalf.  That means the wrongdoing by the defendant will continue and the victims will be left without relief.  The merits of the victims' grievance will never be heard.<br /><br />While federal courts have tools available to manage multi-state cases, but they have in the past been reluctant to take advantage of them.  We can only hope now that since victims will be left with <strong><em>no remedy at all</em></strong> if the federal court denies class action treatment, federal judges will step up to the plate and undertake the task of making sure consumers get a fair shake.  If they do not, the new class action legislation will end up denying many Americans a fair day in court.<br /><hr size=1><font size=2>Notes<br /><br />1.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.washington.edu/Faculty/Stilt/">Kristen Stilt</a> of the University of Washington School of Law says that official US emphasis on the urgency of the forthcoming Iraqi constitutional process overlooks the fundamental question of whether such a process, undertaken now, will in fact be good for Iraq...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/stilt.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>O</strong></font>n January 30, 2005, Iraqi voters elected a 275-member National Assembly, but it was not until this month - April - that the Assembly selected from among its members a President, Jalal Talabani (leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and member of the Kurdish coalition in the Assembly), and two Deputy Presidents, Ghazi al-Yawar (from the minority Sunni coalition in the Assembly) and Adil Abd al-Mahdi (from the majority Shi&#39;ite coalition).  In turn, these three men (collectively known as the Presidency Council) appointed Ibrahim al-Ja&#39;fari (also a member of the majority Shi&#39;ite coalition in the Assembly) as the Prime Minister.  <br /><br />Congratulatory messages to the new Iraqi leaders rang out from the White House.  In multiple official statements, the Bush Administration affirmed that the Assembly will now commence its chief task of writing a new constitution.  The Assembly should complete a draft by August 15, 2005, and then hold a national referendum for the adoption of the final version by October 15, 2005.  Alternatively, if on August 1, 2005, the President and a majority of the Assembly determine that more time is necessary to prepare the draft, they may extend the drafting process by six months.  In such a case, the referendum would take place by February 15, 2006, and the remainder of the process would be delayed accordingly.  Provided that the new constitution is adopted by a referendum in October 2005, elections for a permanent Iraqi government should take place by December 15, 2005, and the Assembly would then pass control to the new government and dissolve by December 31, 2005.  <br /><br />Such standard accounts of the electoral and constitutional process in Iraq overlook the most fundamental question: is this process good for Iraq?  The current violence, factionalism, and lack of Sunni participation in the Assembly are obstacles that must be overcome before a genuinely participational constitutional process can begin.  Essentially, the U.S. has been the driving force behind the urgent need for a new Iraqi constitution, from the earliest post-invasion days to the present.  The timeline for the elections to the Assembly and the drafting and adoption of a constitution are dictated by the Transitional Administrative Law (generally called the "Interim Constitution"), which was adopted on March 8, 2004, by the now-defunct U.S. Coalition Provisional Authority ("CPA") and the U.S.-appointed Iraqi Governing Council.  The U.S. administration's obsession with a new Iraqi constitution relates to the way the U.S. had expected events in Iraq to develop immediately after the invasion.  The U.S. intended to aid in the preparation and installation of a new constitution that would provide fundamental rights and liberties and prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender, religion, ethnicity, or race.  Iraqis would then hold elections pursuant to that constitution, the new Iraqi government would step into place, and the U.S. could withdraw from Iraq with the confidence that the constitution would provide liberty and justice for all in the first true democracy in the Arab world.  <br /><br />However, this did not happen.  The U.S. was forced to accept the popular Iraqi view, relentlessly advocated by Ayatollah Ali Sistani, that the constitution should be drafted by an elected body of Iraqis.  The U.S. finally conceded, but enshrined its agenda in the Interim Constitution's schedule for Assembly elections and the preparation of the constitution.  Seeking a guarantee of this timeline, the U.S. included in the Interim Constitution the provision that no amendment may be made to the Interim Constitution that would, inter alia, delay the elections or the deadlines for the constitutional referendum.  Even with the option of a six-month extension, drafting a constitution that has adequate popular support in the allotted time will be a miraculous feat.<br /><br />President Bush recently reiterated that the Assembly's work is to write a new constitution, continue to train Iraqi security forces, deliver basic services, and advance Iraq's transformation from dictatorship to democracy.  The order of these objectives should be reversed.  Instead of prioritizing the constitution, the Assembly would better serve its nation by first focusing on negotiations to stop the violence and to seek some common ground for discussions on a basic level, which would ultimately lead to a constitutional process.  The Assembly could forge ahead with the constitution, devoting precious time and resources to the process, but this would be a mistake.  Because of the wide-scale Sunni boycott of the elections, both as candidates and voters, they are substantially under-represented on the Assembly in relation to their population.  The constitutional process can be a forum for negotiations among different factions and interest groups and produce positive results, but only when all parties are able and willing to come to the drafting table.  Given the utter lack of security in the country, the paucity of basic services, and Sunnis fighting to resist what they fear will result from their status as minorities in the country, racing to meet the U.S.-imposed timeline will only force the existing conflicts onto the constitutional stage.  Under this spotlight, there is little hope for success.  And when the stakes are the country's most authoritative legal document, additional pressure will be added to an already incendiary scenario.<br /><br />Perhaps the most sensitive constitutional issue is the role that Islam will play in the Iraqi legal system.  There are a wide range of views among Iraqis, and the U.S. is keen to see constitutional language that does not give Islamic law too much prominence.  The language regarding Islamic law in the U.S.-drafted Interim Constitution is vague and abstract.  As I have shown elsewhere (<em>Islamic Law and the Making and Remaking of the Iraqi Legal System</em>, 36 Geo. Wash. Int'l L. Rev. 695 (2004)), abstract language such as the provision "Islam is the official religion of the state and is considered a source of legislation" in the Interim Constitution has little meaning on its own.  Legislative acts or judicial interpretation would be needed to determine how such a provision would apply to specific areas of the law, such as family law or criminal law.  Prime Minister Ja&#39;fari has said that he wants Islam to play a strong role in the new constitution, although he has not given specific details.  <br /><br />Ja&#39;fari and the Assembly's Shi&#39;ite majority may seek to include in the constitution specific and detailed Islamic law-related language desirable to many Shi&#39;ite Iraqis but objectionable to others in the country.  Such a move may have success in the Assembly, but even majority support in the country does not guarantee adoption of the constitution in the referendum process.  According to the Interim Constitution, a majority of voters nation-wide must approve the referendum, but if two-thirds of the voters in three or more of the provinces of Iraq vote against the referendum, it will fail.  In the case of failure, the current Assembly would be dissolved, elections for a new Assembly would be held, and the drafting process would begin anew.  <br /><br />The Assembly could devote its energies now to constitutional drafting, and even put a constitution to the people for vote in a referendum, but the Sunnis (and the Kurds, for whose bene
fit this three-province "veto" provision was included in the Interim Constitution) have a large enough population in three or more provinces to have a good chance at defeating it.  A failed referendum would be an unaffordable loss of human energy and resources and would only further polarize factions and interest groups in the country.  The Assembly must produce a constitution that is sufficiently inclusive of the population's desires in order for it to be successful.  Thus, the Assembly members will have to negotiate and come to some resolution with the Sunnis who chose not to participate in the Assembly elections, because any constitution drafted before this reconciliation takes place will fail.  The constitutional process should be put on hold until a sufficiently inclusive group&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;composed of Assembly members or individuals chosen by them&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;is ready and willing to draft it.  Ultimately, Iraqis should prioritize the success of their constitution above a constitutional process that was imposed upon them.  <br />    <br /><br /><em>Kristen Stilt is a law professor at the University of Washington School of Law, where her speciality is Islamic law.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.utsa.edu/cias/bios/MrAddicottbio.htm">Jeffrey Addicott</a> of St. Mary&#39;s University School of Law says that it is much better to have deposed Iraqi president Saddam Hussein put on trial in an Iraqi court than before an international criminal tribunal along the lines of existing models.<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/addicottnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>E</strong></font>ight months after Baghdad fell, Saddam Hussein was captured from a six by eight foot dirt hole about six miles from his hometown of Tikrit.  Since that time, a heated debate has swirled around the issue of the proper forum in which to prosecute him for his wanton criminal actions &#8212; both against his own people and basic principles of international law regarding genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.<br />  <br />An Iraqi war crime tribunal was established December 10, 2003, three days before Hussein's capture. Saddam Hussein first appeared before the war crimes tribunal July 1, 2004, where Hussein and 11 of his lieutenants were informed of charges before them (crimes committed such as genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and various Iraqi criminal charges).  The charges date from July 14, 1968, when Saddam's Ba'ath Party came to power, until May 1, 2003, when President George Bush declared major hostilities over in the international armed conflict.<br />  <br />A number of observers have expressed concerns over the Iraqi-led process, preferring an ad hoc or special purposes United Nations-styled tribunal, created on the model of the International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda tribunal.  Their most valid point is in respect to the lack of procedural rules for the Iraqi tribunal.  Fortunately, precise rules of evidence for the upcoming trials for Saddam and his fellow high level cohorts will be released within the next few weeks.  Hopefully, the rules will fully address the due process concerns.<br /><br />In any event, bolstered by the 2004 unanimous Security Council Resolution 1546 (fully recognizing the legitimacy of the Iraqi Interim Government) and the recent elections in Iraq, the enormous task of collecting evidence, and preparing the five-judge tribunal for the trials is taking shape (the judges are being assisted by international legal scholars).  As stated, while the rules of evidence for the trials have not been released, international experts have been working very hard with the Iraqis to ensure that other due process concerns are satisfied.  Of particular importance is equipping the five judges with the legal skills necessary to properly preside over the trials.<br />  <br />What is most ironic in the debate of which forum would be most appropriate and fair to try Saddam, however, is that the deficiencies of the so-called United Nations model are seldom addressed.  Even a cursory review shows why an Iraqi model is much preferred.<br /><br />First, a United Nations model would remove the operations of justice from the community where the crimes occurred.  International tribunals do not sit in the countries where the violence occurred, seldom involve the citizens who suffered the crimes, and the rules and formalities used are foreign to the country subject to adjudication.  The people who suffered the most are not able to make the fundamental decision about how to bring about criminal accountability.<br /><br />Second, international tribunals are vastly inefficient.  For example, the trial of Slobodan Milosevic, staffed by international personnel chosen by the Security Council and General Assembly, opened on February 12, 2002 and is still ongoing!  In fact, the tribunals in The Hague and Arusha have handed down only 44 convictions and 6 acquittals resulting from over 200 indicted individuals.  In contrast, budgeted at $60 million over three years, the Iraqi tribunal costs one-fifth as much as its counterparts in Arusha and The Hague, and has a built-in end date of 2006.<br /><br />Third, international forums gravitate more towards international theatre, allowing the accused criminal a political forum.  There is nothing that Saddam Hussein (or lawyers like Ramsey Clark) would like more than to grandstand before the world trying to shift attention away from his heinous crimes by falsely charging the United States for a "war of aggression," etc. <br />  <br />Fourth, international tribunals do not permit plea bargaining, are not designed to handle intelligence debriefings of captured personnel, and do not permit the death penalty, under any circumstances.  Certainly, the people of Iraq have the right to demand the death penalty.<br /><br />On the other hand, consider the strengths of the Iraqi tribunal. It was set up fully cognizant of the need to strike a balance between allowing the Iraqi people the right to prosecute Saddam and the concerns that the trails be fair. It has five units:  Tribunal Investigative Judges, Trial Chambers, Appeals Chambers, Prosecutions Department, and an Administrative Department.  The Tribunal Investigative Judges conduct the investigations, determine the existence of a prima facie case, and prepare indictments.  The evidence contained in these indictments is primarily drawn from seized documents, witness interviews and evidence from forensic teams from at least twelve mass graves.  The indictments are transferred to the Trial Chambers, five-judge panels who conduct hearings, pronounce judgments, and impose sentences. Unlike the common-law court system in the United States, the Iraqi tribunal will have no jury, and the verdicts and sentencing will be handed down through a majority decision of the Trial Chamber.  The court will hear from victims, witnesses, a state prosecutor, defense witnesses, and in some cases, the defendants themselves.  The rights of the accused include a presumption of innocence, right to be informed of the charges against them, to have adequate time to prepare their defense, to cross-examine and call witnesses, not to be forced to testify against themselves and a right to appeal the verdict to a nine-judge appellate chamber.<br /> <br />In short, as the process to try Saddam Hussein and his lieutenants goes through its preliminary stages, the basic framework for the Iraqi tribunal is in accordance with international norms and standards of due process.  One can expect that the precise rules of evidence, soon to be released, will follow suit.  The people of Iraq have suffered unimaginable terror for over thirty years and deserve a fair and judicious Iraqi court to bring these criminals to justice for their atrocities.    <br /><br /><em>Jeffrey Addicott is Associate Professor of Law and Director, Center for Terrorism Law, St. Mary&#39;s University School of Law.

That is an understatement of the obvious: if even a single Member State fails to ratify the Treaty, the latter cannot enter into force, and the European Council would be obliged immediately to start deliberating the best way forward.  <br /><br />Those deliberations would be likely to focus upon four basic options:<ol><li>the Member State(s) concerned might have a second attempt at ratification on the basis of the Treaty as it stands and hope that persistence pays off;<br /><br /><li>another IGC could undertake formal renegotiation of the Treaty, which would then have to be submitted for re-ratification by all of the Member States;<br /><br /><li>the Member States might collectively abandon the Constitution, so that the current Treaties as amended by Nice remain in force;<br /><br /><li>the Member State(s) concerned might voluntarily withdraw from the existing European Union, so that the new Treaty can enter into force in respect of those countries which have successfully ratified it.</ol>The UK ratification process is generally acknowledged to be among the most awkward.  Tony Blair must sometimes regret being bounced by tabloid and Opposition pressure into calling a popular referendum which is not necessary as a matter of British constitutional law, but whose result will in practice become determinative of the parliamentary ratification procedure, when opinion polls consistently suggest high levels of hostility towards, and only a low percentage of (lukewarm) support for, the Constitution.<br /><br />Yet even before serious campaigning begins there are clouds on the horizon, in the form of the French referendum on the EU constitutional treaty scheduled for 29 May 2005.  Rumours abound that Blair secretly hopes for a French "non", and that this rejection would be by a sufficient margin to stop any constitution dead in its tracks &#8212; leaving Nice as the EU's only viable option for the foreseeable future, and rendering any further attempts at ratification by other Member States (including the UK) superfluous. <br /><br />The British will therefore experience a meaningful referendum campaign only if France votes "oui" and the recently-re-elected Labour government sets out to champion the Treaty in the face of a sceptical public.  In that event, one suspects that the broad terms of the referendum debate (as in other Member States) will not focus upon what the Constitution actually changes.  After all, many of the Constitution's reforms (such as the new hierarchy of regulatory norms, or the definition of qualified majority voting within the Council of Ministers) are dull as dishwater to all but specialists in EU law and politics.  Passions are much more likely to be shaped by popular (dis)satisfaction with aspects of the existing acquis that are touched but little &#8212; if at all &#8212; by the Constitution itself (such as the principle of supremacy and the common fisheries policy); by the tendency of Eurosceptic media and politicians to blame every alleged vice (from the Human Rights Act to the number of attempted asylum seekers) firmly but groundlessly upon the Brussels bureaucrats; or by panoramic visions of the UK's political destiny within or outwith the EU (which often thrust upon the voter a highly simplified choice between "belonging to Europe" or "siding with America").    <br /><br />All that makes the referendum a high risk game &#8212; and if it ends in a "no", it will present Blair with a serious crisis.  He has already signalled his reluctance to pursuing Option 1, i.e. holding a second referendum on the same Treaty.  Perhaps the best he could hope for is that a UK "no" is matched by several other Member States (such as Denmark, Poland and the Czech Republic): it would then be plausible to join forces and argue more convincingly for Option 2 (renegotiation and re-ratification) or Option 3 (sticking with the Nice status quo).  <br /><br />But if the UK alone rejects the Treaty, the room for political manoeuvre would become much tighter.  Sticking with Nice would be seen as holding the European integration process hostage to the lowest common denominator, and might appear unlikely to win support from the other 24 Member States willing to forge ahead.  Seeking renegotiation and re-ratification would be impractical at the best of times, and seems even less likely to work for Blair.  After all, the Constitution is already seen by many countries as very much a British product: the UK's input into the Convention was influential, and Blair's "red lines" on issues such as taxation and defence dominate much of the final text.  If Blair cannot persuade the UK population to accept even that very favourable deal, why should the other Member States agree to water down the settlement yet further?  At this point, another problem arises.  For all Blair's positive engagement with the EU, he does not seem to have succeeded in making the UK feel like the same "indispensable" member as France or Germany (thanks not least to his relationship with the Bush administration on major foreign policy issues such as the invasion of Iraq).  All of which might combine, in the event of a solitary British "no", to transform Option 4 &#8212; voluntary withdrawal from the EU so as to allow the other Member States to proceed with ratification &#8212; from the ludicrous and unthinkable into the frightening yet possible; and leave the UK to reengage with the EU essentially through some sort of trade organisation such as the European Economic Area.<br /><br />Ironically, if that were indeed to be the result of this referendum process, it might well entail exactly the loss of British sovereignty for which "no" campaigners vociferously denounce the Constitution.  The UK would be obliged (de jure or de facto) to dance to the EU's regulatory tune, but without having politicians and officials fighting the British case from the inside.  In that regard, the UK might become a little like how many commentators currently view Norway: economically prosperous, perhaps, but politically marginalised.<br /><br /><br /> <br /><em>Michael Dougan is Professor of European Law and Jean Monnet Chair in EU Law at the Liverpool Law School, University of Liverpool, England</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.syr.edu/faculty/facultymember.asp?fac=128">Eugene Quinn</a> of Syracuse University College of Law says that the US Supreme Court&#39;s pending decision in the <em>Grokster</em> case on file-sharing copyright infringement will likely involve a struggle with its landmark 1984 ruling on videotaping technology in <em>Sony v. Universal Studios</em>...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/quinnnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=1></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>O</strong></font>n Tuesday, March 29, 2005, the United States Supreme Court heard oral arguments in <em>MGM Studios v. Grokster</em>, the much anticipated copyright case that pits file-swapping software companies Grokster and StreamCast Networks against the recording industry.  At stake in this appeal is whether companies such as Grokster and Streamcast can provide file-sharing software without incurring copyright liability when end users use the technology to commit copyright infringement.  <br /><br />This saga starts not with the <em>Grokster</em> case, but rather dates back to the Internet bubble, when anything "dot-com" promised instant success.  At that time an upstart website launched and began to redefine the copyright and economic landscape of the recording industry.  It seems hardly possible that only several years ago Napster was an enigma to most, but well on its way to infamy.  As anyone who has even passing familiarity with file-sharing knows, Napster was found to be liable for copyright infringement.  It has recently re-launched as a legitimate pay-per-download service.<br /><br />After several post-Napster litigation successes the recording industry faced its first defeat.  It was a tremendous setback when on April 25, 2003, a federal judge in Los Angeles handed a stunning court victory to file-swapping services Streamcast Networks and Grokster, dismissing much of the record industry lawsuit against the two companies. In what has been vilified by the industry as a complete reversal of previous victories for the record labels, federal court Judge Stephen Wilson ruled that Streamcast--parent of the Morpheus software--and Grokster were not liable for copyright infringements that took place using their software. After careful review of the decision of Judge Wilson, most copyright experts would agree that this does not in any way represent a reversal of previous decisions at all. <br /><br />The distinguishing facts present in this case all revolve around exactly how the Grokster file sharing technology actually works. Judge Wilson compared the technological workings of Grokster to those of Napster and concluded that Grokster is quite different, and the Grokster technology cannot be prevented.  The key difference between Grokster, for example, and Napster is that Napster acted like a hub for the ongoing file-sharing and copyright infringement.  In other words, all infringing traffic passed through Napster.  Quite to the contrary, infringing traffic does not pass through Grokster.  Grokster only provides software that allows individuals users to trade files among themselves.  In short, if you take Napster out of the equation the copyright infringement would stop.  Take Grokster out of the equation and file-sharing can and will still continue.  Therefore, Grokster argued that it was merely providing a technology that end users could use for either legitimate or illegitimate purposes.  Because the technology is capable of legitimate uses, such as trading non-copyrighted works or public domain works, Grokster could not be and was not found liable as a contributory infringer.  This well-established rule regarding a technology being capable of use for "substantial non-infringing uses" stems from the United States Supreme Court landmark decision in Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417 (1984).<br /><br />On Thursday, August 19, 2004, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's partial grant of summary judgment, holding that under the circumstances presented by the present Grokster technology, the distributors of peer-to-peer file-sharing computer networking software may be held contributorily or vicariously liable for copyright infringements by users.  A show down in the Supreme Court was on the way.<br /><br />The legal issue that is expected to be addressed by the Supreme Court revolves around whether the technology in question is capable of substantial non-infringing uses.  The decision, which should be rendered over the Summer of 2005, will all but certainly become a landmark copyright decision that will have long reaching implications for the protections afforded to copyright owners in the digital age.  Pundits seem to be predicting a wide variety of possible outcomes, but a ruling against Grokster and StreamCast would likely require the Supreme Court to revise substantial parts of the famed <em>Sony</em> case dealing with the Betamax, or at the very least revise the way that district courts and the various Courts of Appeal have interpreted the Sony decision.  <br /><br />In the 1984 <em>Sony</em> case, Petitioner Sony Corp. manufactured home video tape recorders (VTRs), and marketed them through retail establishments, some of which are also petitioners. Respondents were the owners of the copyrights on some of the television programs that were broadcast on the public airwaves. Respondents brought an action against petitioners in Federal District Court, alleging that VTR consumers had been recording some of respondents&#39; copyrighted works that had been exhibited on commercially sponsored television and thereby infringed respondents&#39; copyrights, and further that petitioners were liable for such copyright infringement because of their marketing of the VTRs. The Supreme Court, however, explained that any individual may reproduce a copyrighted work as long as such reproduction is a &quot;fair use.&quot;  The Supreme Court went on to hold that the recording accomplished by VTRs was only time-shifting in nature and even though 100% of the copyrighted work was copied, the use nonetheless constituted a fair use.  As a result, the Supreme Court said that video taping was a fair use, and based that decision at least in part on the fact that video taping devices are capable of substantial non-infringing uses.<br /><br />In issuing its ruling, the Supreme Court will undoubtedly struggle with its <em>Sony</em> decision.  Ever since the <em>Sony</em> decision issued courts have found technology to be non-infringing if it is at all capable of any non-infringing uses.  Nevertheless, the distinguishing factor between online file-sharing and the video tape situation is the degree of non-infringing use.  Certainly Grokster technology is capable of non-infringing uses, but factually it is the infringing uses that make up the lion share of the traffic, which does seem to be a significant distinguishing factor.  Nevertheless, to focus on the amount of infringement would potentially limit technological development and also adds a significant factual issue into play in copyright litigation, perhaps making it much more difficult in the future to win on summary judgment.<br /><br /> <br /><em>Eugene Quinn is a law professor at Syracuse University College of Law, and he is also the Associate Director of the New York State Science &amp; Technology Law Center.

The NPT, now 35 years old, has succeeded to the extent that nearly 190 states have to subscribed the pact. Despite its grandiose universality, however, here are five reasons why the NPT is poised to fall apart in the near future.<br /><br />1. The NPT's nuclear club has been broken into. In 1970, the Treaty divided the world into two camps: haves and have-nots. It acknowledged that five states -- the US, UK, France, Russia and China -- lawfully possessed nuclear weapons. It hoped that the rest of the world would not acquire them. That did not happen. In 1998, India and Pakistan detonated nuclear weapons in face of the world. The US now publicly admits that Israel possesses nuclear weapons. North Korea claims to have nuclear weapons. The dilemma is therefore insurmountable. If the club of five is expanded to eight and perhaps more, proliferation would seem to have been accommodated. If not, the club would be treated as a foolish anomaly. Either way, the NPT is in legal disarray.<br /><br />2.  The NPT can be lawfully dumped. It allows a signatory state to withdraw from the non-proliferation regime "if it decides that extraordinary events, related to the subject matter of this Treaty, have jeopardized the supreme interests of its country."  All that&#39;s required is three months advance notice. North Korea joined the NPT in 1985. In January, 2003, however, it withdrew from the Treaty (effective immediately).  If North Korea detonates a bomb and joins the <em>de facto</em> nuclear club, the NPT would be further weakened. And the dumping rule will be reaffirmed in international law. As luck would have it, there will be new withdrawals from the NPT, most likely in the Middle East where states will not accept Israel's regional nuclear monopoly. Even one or two more withdrawals will kill the Treaty.<br /><br />3. The NPT's foundational promise has not been not kept. The five declared nuclear-weapon states promised to cease the nuclear arms race and head toward a complete nuclear disarmament under strict and effective international control. The collapse of the Soviet Union was a godsend that halted the superpowers' nuclear arms race. But no good-faith effort, as the Treaty requires, is being made towards complete nuclear disarmament. In fact, contrary to the letter and spirit of the NPT, the Bush administration is actively pursuing the development of brand new nuclear &quot;bunker-buster&quot; weapons. No treaty regime can succeed if a superpower shows such blatant contempt for the world. When the shepherd on the white horse loses his way, no sheep come home. <br /><br />4. The NPT is a double-headed monster. It is simultaneously good and evil. In fact, the Treaty rests on a bargain. States relinquished the right to have nuclear weapons because they were led to believe that "peaceful applications of nuclear explosions will be made available" to them. Iran, a signatory to the NPT, claims that it has "the unalienable right" to develop peaceful nuclear energy. The United States claims that if Iran is allowed to acquire nuclear technology, it would come closer to developing nuclear weapons.  Both claims are simultaneously accurate.  This double-headedness is precisely the inherent flaw of the NPT. One of its head spews light, the other flame.  <br /><br />5. The NPT is a suicide pact. US foreign policy has created a global context in which it is far more attractive for states to have nuclear weapons than not to have them. The war on Iraq demonstrates that a state without weapons of mass destruction is vulnerable to invasion and occupation. It would be perfectly logical to conclude that Iraq was attacked not because it had weapons of mass destruction but because it had none. This pathological logic will be further confirmed if the United States continues to pursue diplomacy with North Korea, a country that presumably has nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them. The Iraq/North Korea binary reality resurrects old truths that 'might is right' and 'be firm with the bullies" And so, in a dangerous world, adhering to the NPT will be considered foolish.<br /><br />For these five reasons, the NPT seems no longer viable. If the analysis above is dark and pessimistic, and nothing be done about weapons of mass destruction, beware - more wars and "the devastation that would be visited upon all mankind" may be on the way. Unless, of course, there is complete nuclear disarmament.<br /><br /> <br /><em>Ali Khan is a professor of law at Washburn University School of Law in Topeka, Kansas.

The actual content of their text, signed in Rome in October 2004, leads to a more modest appraisal. But while formally being not more than a treaty, the reference to "constitution" has proved sufficiently provocative to potentially bring down the European house. Such an outcome would certainly be unfortunate considering the institutional challenges facing the European Union by its latest enlargement to twenty-five Member States. <br /><br />If the word "constitution" has raised expectations and focused in France and elsewhere the attention of so-called Eurosceptics &#8212; quite a diverse group in reality &#8212; the arguments raised by the critics of European integration do not vary much. Although the focus may differ in each Member State, their criticism consistently emphasizes the same issues; the creation of a superstate or the existence of a democratic deficit are among the most popular allegations. <br /><br />Does the constitutional treaty, shorthand for the formal "Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe", deserve so much vilification or, to put it more dispassionately, does it represent a radical departure from present EU treaties? <br /><br />My reading of the constitutional treaty leads to a more balanced and modest assessment. While the treaty improves to some extent the efficiency and transparency of the decision-making process and simplifies, for instance, the allocation of competencies between the Union and the Members States, it does not alter the current political and legal equilibriums. To paraphrase Abraham Lincoln, the European Union was, is and under the constitution will remain a government of the Member States, by the Member States, and for the Members States. <br /><br />A lack of consistency, and a good dose of ignorance associated with a great deal of bad faith, typically characterise the negative appraisals of the EU Constitution. <br /><br />For instance, the argument about the prospective creation of a superstate, an obsession of Margaret Thatcher, ignores all material and legal facts. Yet to merely focus on the constitutional treaty, Article I-1 says it all: "&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;this Constitution establishes the European Union, on which the Member States confer competences to attain objectives they have in common. The Union shall coordinate the policies by which the Member States aim to achieve these objectives, and shall exercise on a Community basis the competences they confer on it." To put it succinctly, the Constitution does not change the nature of the relationship between the European Union and the Member States: the Union may only act if it has the competence to do so, meaning competence conferred on it by an exclusive and unanimous decision of the Member States, and the Union does so in an extreme decentralised manner. The Union does not and will not have any independent sovereignty, to use an old and familiar concept. <br /><br />As for the famous &quot;democratic deficit&quot;, not only does the diversity of competing diagnosis make the expression meaningless, the accusation quite often reflects a phantasmagoric vision of democracy not even applied at the local level. Worse, the lack of consistency from the proponents of the democratic deficit vision is astonishing. Indeed, the more democratic the Union, the more powerful it will be. If you plead on the one hand for preserving as much authority as possible for the Member States, it is quite remarkable to plead on the other hand for a more democratic Union, as that will certainly lead to a more powerful and independent EU. In any case, the Constitution again offers some innovative thinking with the association of two models of democracy: representative democracy (Article I-46) and participatory democracy (Article I-47). In practice, among other novelties, a new mechanism will allow direct input from Union citizens, if they number at least a million and represent a significant number of Member States, allowing them to ask the Commission to submit to the legislature any legislative proposal they consider necessary.<br /><br />If transparency and accountability are two key criteria of a democratic regime, then the Union does not suffer comparison with Member States. Moreover, the Union's political regime is extremely consensual and protective of its smallest constituents. Should some complain about a lack of "democracy", the biggest Member States would certainly be entitled to do so. Among them, Germany deserves honorable mention for having permanently subsidized European integration whilst accepting a remarkable diminution of representation within the decision-making process. For instance, if one looks at qualified majority-voting within the Council of Ministers &#8212; the most powerful legislative organ of the Union &#8212; Ireland, with 7 votes for 4 million people, is almost five times "better represented" than Germany with 29 votes for 80 million people. As a rule, "small" Member States benefit from an overwhelming overrepresentation. Without the Union, their political influence would certainly have a far smaller say in European and World affairs. <br /><br />In all fairness to its regular critics, the European Union is a political and legal creature difficult to come to terms with. To take a simple example: the distinction between the European Community and the European Union. A nightmare for first-time students, this uneasy distinction is the fruit of the Maastricht Treaty which created the European Union, a concept comprising the European Community, as well as other forms of cooperation. Technically, the European Union has no legal personality and therefore, to put it simply, what is being studied in law schools is EC law and not EU law. Yet again, the Constitution greatly simplifies the situation: only the Union is due to survive as a legal entity (Article I-7).<br /><br />Notwithstanding the clear and numerous improvements brought by the Constitution, their technical nature makes it a tough sell for politicians. It is undeniably quite difficult to fall in love with what remains a set of rules for what continues to be a unique but no more than a supranational framework. When coupled with the deeply unpopular French national executive holding a referendum on the instrument, these ingredients may bode ill for the popular backing needed to ratify the Constitution in France. <br /><br />Although not a constitutional obligation, President Jacques Chirac decided to go for a popular ratification of the EU Constitution rather than opting for a secure parliamentary ratification. Such bravery was sensible when the decision was made in July 2004, as a comfortable margin of the electorate, more than 70 per cent, had at the time a positive view of the text. A slow but constant erosion since then has however has diminished the Yes vote to the point where recent polls suggest a slight but persistent majority against the Constitution. As with the scenario surrounding the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, the involvement of a French "presidential Monarch" nearing the end of his reign had led to a personalisation of the campaign and has multiplied the chances of a backlash. No m
atter the nature of the question being asked to the sovereign people, the referendum is always understood as a motion of confidence (a "plebiscite") on the President. Such was the will of Charles de Gaulle in order to balance the unusual influence of the presidency under the Constitution of the Fifth Republic. Convincing its troops to vote in a similar fashion as the President is thus a delicate task for the leader of the opposition, as Fran&Atilde;&#167;ois Hollande, the uncharismatic leader of the Socialist Party, is now experiencing. <br /><br />Despite a clear propensity of the European Constitution to disappear as a topic in domestic debates, its French opponents are also making a few substantive arguments against it. <br /><br />A dominant one raises the deficiencies of the text with regard to an effective protection of one "Europe sociale". No matter how indefinite, that concept is appealing to the French psyche with its deep-seated affection for public services as well as broad social and economic rights. In this context, the Bolkenstein directive on services offers the perfect scarecrow. Not only does the name of the former Dutch Commissioner make it easy to nickname it the Frankenstein directive, its complex governing principles necessitate some thinking and consequently, the directive could not easily resist the feel-good accusation &#8212; however unfounded &#8212; of an Europe favourising "social dumping". <br /><br />Yet the link between the Constitution and the previous directive still needs to be found. Furthermore, it is somewhat amusing that while the peril of a new European Moscow easily excites British minds, French citizens are delighted to argue against the alleged neo-liberalism aspects of the Constitution, quite often presented as the triumph of the British free-market and anti-integrationist views. To briefly answer the accusation of a neo-liberal bias, it is sufficient to mention the inclusion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights as Part II of the Constitution &#8212; a major breakthrough. Incidentally, it should also be mentioned that the same Charter has been presented in the British press as having a potentially bad impact on business as it gives too many rights to workers. A single text, two ridiculously extreme interpretations&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;<br /><br />The prospect of Turkish EU membership also agitates the minds of French voters in the constitutional debate. Interestingly, the topic appears to have phagocyted the traditional right-centered debate on the preservation of national sovereignty or French identity. Yet again it would be challenging to discover a link between this issue and the constitutional text. Besides, the French Constitution was amended (see Article 88-5) in order to suppress any presidential margin of appreciation whether to hold a referendum to vote on the acceptance of new Member States. As a result, it will be a constitutional obligation for President Chirac's successors to hold such referendum. The French electorate will consequently, when the time comes, vote on Turkish accession to the European Union. <br /><br />In any case, if the arguments raised on social and cultural grounds are excluded, the main objective contention against Turkish membership is once more a fear of an Anglo-Saxon trap. While the numerous condescending editorials in favour Turkish EU membership in the <em>New York Times</em> did not help (not mentioning past insensitive actions taken by Bush Jr.), it is mostly argued that the Union's institutional framework would not survive such enlargement. More precisely, the adhesion of what will be potentially the most populated Member State will inevitably limit any potential for further deepening of European integration. Jean Monnet's Europe would have come to a halt, limiting its potential to a mere free-trade area. <br /><br />With such important and complex questions to be debated, it is, to say the least, unfortunate that the public discussion about French ratification of the EU pact is led by unprincipled leaders, guided by short-term political calculus. A pathetic former socialist Prime Minister is betting his survival on a &quot;Non&quot;, while the leader of the dominant centre-right party is quietly hopeful of an identical result to render irresistible his candidacy to the next presidential elections. In this ocntext there is no hope left for a discussion focusing either on the Constitution itself, or at least on the substantive merits of European integration. <br /><br />For the tenants of Jean Monnet's vision of Europe, a &quot;Non&quot; vote on 29 May should not necessarily be interpreted as a dramatic and negative outcome. A &quot;Non&quot; could actually help unravel the carefully preserved ambiguity about the finality of European integration. The Constitution being insufficiently integrative for many French voters, a Non could pave the way for a "core Europe" between Member States sharing a geo-strategical vision and genuine interest in deepening European unity.  <br /><br /><br /> <br /><em>Dr. Laurent Pech is Jean Monnet Lecturer in European Union Law at the National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a JURIST <em>Forum</em> special, JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.williamgeorgeross.com/">William G. Ross</a>, Professor of Law at Samford University&#39;s Cumberland School of Law in Alabama, reviews the fourth day of the Senate confirmation hearings for US Chief Justice nominee John Roberts, and suggests that although the hearings may have provided few key insights into the nominee, they have proved to be an important demonstration of democratic process... <hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/wgrossnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=1></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>fter more than twenty hours in the hot seat, John G. Roberts, Jr. finally has concluded his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, leaving even many of his most severe critics expressing admiration for his thoughtful and deft responses to questions about a multitude of legal issues. Although Roberts provided few new insights into his thoughts about major constitutional questions, he helped to assuage fears that he is a right-wing ideologue who would roll back civil liberties and significantly diminish federal power. His testimony helped to confirm the widespread impression that has an open mind, a sanguine temperament, and the capacity for wisdom, important attributes in any judge and ones absolutely critical in a Chief Justice. His powerful but soothing presence also dispelled doubts, if doubt there had been, that he would facilitate harmony among the Justices and administer the federal judicial system in a calm and efficient manner. The likelihood of the Senate's confirmation of his nomination without significant opposition or delay now appears virtually certain.<br /><br /> Like the extensive hearings on the confirmation of other Supreme Court nominees during the past forty years, the hearings on Roberts also provided what Senator Jon Kyl described this week as "great civics lesson." For four days, senators, the nominee, and sundry witnesses discussed legal issues in front of the nation, enlightening millions of Americans and creating a permanent record of the pulse of constitutional law at this moment in history.<br /><br /> In addition to enabling the Committee and the nation to take the measure of Roberts as a potential Chief Justice, the hearings also provided the senators with a unique opportunity to express their ideas, concerns, and advice about a remarkably broad array of legal issues. In particular, senators repeatedly reminded Roberts of the importance of judicial humility and proper respect for coordinate branches of government, and admonished him to remember the human dimensions of the cases that come before the Court.<br /><br /> It is important to consider what the hearings did not do and probably could not have done. <br /><br /> While hearings on judicial nominees often are assumed to have the principal purpose of eliciting insights into how nominees might rule on particular issues, these hearings are almost useless in this regard. Roberts, like all other Supreme Court nominees whose views the committee has tried to plumb, properly refused to comment about issues that are likely to come before the Court since such comments could create the impression of bias. Only on the subject of abortion did Roberts's testimony offer some potentially significant insights into how he might rule on a particular issue, for Roberts affirmed his belief in a constitutional right to privacy and expressed at least theoretical agreement with the principles of stare decisis that have helped to preserve <em>Roe v. Wade</em>. Even this, however, was not enough to assuage the fears of many pro-choice activists or shake his support among most pro-life advocates. Roberts's expression of belief that the Constitution may change with the times also provided at least hint that Roberts's views are consistent with those of the majority of the present Court, although the level of generality of his remarks offers no real clues about how he would rule on any particular issue.<br /><br /> Roberts also provided several reminders to the committee that the Court often is forced to make law because Congress leaves gaps in statutes and that unpopular judicial decisions often are easily remediable through legislative action. In particular, Roberts responded to criticism of the Court's recent controversial takings clause decision, <em>Kelo v. City of New London</em>, by pointing out that the Court's holding that local governments have broad power of eminent domain does not require local governments to exercise that power. Although the senators already were aware of these points, his reminders might be useful. <br /><br /> Perhaps the most useful exchanges at confirmation hearing involve a nominee's thoughts about the process of adjudication and judicial administration, issues that are particularly relevant to the confirmation of a Chief Justice. In responses to questions by Senator Russell Feingold about the Chief Justice's power to assign opinion writing when he is in the majority, Roberts stated that he disapproved of making assignments "as a way to promote a particular view or agenda." When Feingold asked if Roberts would ever change his vote in order to be able to assign an opinion (as Chief Justice Warren Burger is rumored to have done), Roberts flatly declared that he regarded this practice as inappropriate and would not do it. Roberts explained that such tactical uses of the assignment writing power "causes tension on the court" and interferes with the Chief Justice's ability to promote "cohesiveness and collegiality."  <br />  <br /> In response to Senator Arlen Specter's question about whether he would try as Chief Justice to avoid the proliferation of concurring opinions that often creates confusion about the Court is saying, Roberts acknowledged the importance of "clear guidance from the Supreme Court." He stated that "it's a responsibility of all the justices, not just the chief justice, to work toward an opinion of the court" and remarked that a justice who is considering a concurring opinion should ask himself, "What benefit is this serving? Why is it necessary to state this separately?" Roberts also affirmed the importance of writing "crisply and efficiently." <br /><br /> But while these observations are interesting and may represent norms to which a Chief Justice should aspire, they are hardly surprising and there is no guarantee that Roberts will honor them.<br /><br /> Similarly, even if Supreme Court nominees were willing to comment about specific legal issues, their comments would have little utility for the Senate since they could make no commitment that they would decide cases in this manner after their confirmation. A disingenuous nominee could with impunity tell the committee whatever he or she felt she needed to say to secure confirmation, while an honest nominee could change her mind after her confirmation. There are many examples of Justices whose performance on the Court has defied the expectations of the Presidents who nominated them and the Senates that confirmed them. The chances that a justice will confound expectations about his or her performance is especially great since most justices serve for such a long time. As Yale Law professor Alexander Bickel once famously observed, "you shoot an arrow into a far distant future when you appoint a justice, and not the man himself can tell you what he will think about some of the problems that he will face." <br /><br /> Moreover, confirmation hearings rarely, if ever, generate any fresh insights into constitutional issues. Senators usually ask nominees questions that are considerably less complex than a professor would ask students in an introductory constitutional law course, and the circumspect responses of the nominees rarely goes beyond rote recitation of the facts and holdings of Supreme Court decisions and a basic exposition of elementary constitutional princ
iples. The hearings often resemble a high school civics class more than a law school seminar. While Roberts's extensive testimony demonstrated that he is well versed in the law,  none of his responses demonstrated original or brilliant thinking. Roberts may be an extraordinarily bright man, but the questions generally did not call for brilliant answers, and anything too intelligent or original could have provoked the sort of controversy that Roberts, like all Supreme Court nominees, wanted to avoid. <br /><br /> Hearings also serve can serve an important function by providing an opportunity to explore charges of ethical misconduct. Indeed, this was the primary purpose of testimony by nominees from 1925, when Harlan Fiske Stone became the first nominee to testify, until the 1970s, when the hearings began to focus upon the legal philosophies of the nominees. In most instances, however, the Senate's questions to nominees about misconduct have failed either to dispel the suspicions of the nominee's critics or shake the faith of his supporters. <br /><br /> The only ethical controversy involving Roberts has arisen out of his failure to recuse himself from <em>Hamsden v. Rumsfeld</em>, in which a three-judge panel of the appellate court on which Roberts sits unanimously rejected a challenge to the Bush Administration's practice of trying terrorist suspects before military tribunals rather civil courts. Since Bush met with Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to discuss the possibility of his nomination to the Supreme Court before the Court of Appeals decided the case, some legal scholars have argued that he ought to have recused himself rather than risk the perception that he may have voted in favor of the Administration on this high profile issue in order to bolster his chances for promotion. Since a legal challenge to Roberts's participation in the case is presently pending, Roberts properly refused to respond to questions from senators concerning the reasons for his failure to recuse himself.<br /><br /> Evaluated in the context of these limitations, it becomes clear that the hearings have little substantive value. <br /><br /> This does not, however, detract from their immense value as an important ritual of democracy. This unique opportunity for dialogue between senators and a nominee who is likely wield immense power on the Supreme Court for decades to come is one of our nation's most important rites. Even though the simple verities about constitutional law that the senators and the nominees espouse during these hearings fail to offer any original or brilliant insights into constitutional law or the thoughts of the nominee, the dialogues between the senators and the nominees provide a litany of the most fundamental values upon which American democracy is based. It useful for the senators, the nominees, and the nation to renew their fidelity to these values by hearing them recited at confirmation hearings each time a member of the Court is appointed. <br />  <br /><br /><hr size=1><br />Also by William G.

The two dozen members of the Judicial Conference will reflect poignantly on the absence of their "Chief"- the late Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist.  He has been the respected and beloved leader of the Conference for the past two decades.  The Chief Justice of the United States (the proper title of the office - not "Chief Justice of the Supreme Court" - as Chief Justice Warren Burger was fond of reminding people) heads the Conference, which is the policymaking arm for the 13 federal appeals courts and the 94 federal district courts.  Its membership comprises the chief judges of every judicial circuit as well as a district judge who is elected from each judicial circuit.<br /><br />The biannual meeting also furnishes a paradigmatic example of the approximately sixty ex officio responsibilities which Congress has assigned the Chief Justice by statute in addition to the judicial duties which the Chief has to decide cases and to oversee the Supreme Court's internal operations.  How Circuit Judge John G. Roberts, Jr., President George W. Bush's nominee for Chief Justice, will discharge the administrative responsibilities of the office should be of paramount concern in the Senate confirmation process.  Senate Judiciary Committee hearings, which were rather protracted and comprehensive, concluded last Friday and the Committee vote is scheduled for Thursday, while Senate floor debate on the nominee will commence next week and the final vote may also be taken at that time.<br /><br />The Judicial Conference of the United States formulates and implements federal court policy.  Its numerous, expert committees develop policies ranging across a broad spectrum. One field involves courthouse construction and security, the latter of which has become essential, given the murder of a Chicago district judge's family members and recent courthouse violence.  Another area is federal jurisdiction, which Congress has generally expanded over the last half century, although some lawmakers have recently threatened to strip federal court jurisdiction in controversial areas, such as religion and gay rights.  A third significant area is federal court budgets, which Congress severely limited last year and which are crucial to the federal judiciary's prompt, fair and inexpensive resolution of civil and criminal disputes.  A fourth area is the rules of practice and procedure that govern federal court litigation.  Numerous Conference committees study the admiralty, appellate, bankruptcy, civil, criminal and evidentiary rules and formulate suggestions for improvements which the Supreme Court usually adopts.  These Conference activities are central to the operations of the federal courts with Congress's essential support and cooperation. <br /><br />A fundamental role which the Chief Justice performs through the Judicial Conference is staunchly protecting judicial independence, and this duty has peculiar contemporary salience.  Congressional threats are in the air that would strip federal court jurisdiction, dictate the sentences which judges mete out to convicted persons, reduce court funding, and even impeach judges.  This congressional antagonism towards the courts makes safeguarding judicial independence the highest modern priority. After all, it is through our federal courts that the United States achieves the goal in the Constitution's preamble to "establish justice."<br /><br />The Judicial Conference of the United States session on Tuesday is an apt occasion for honoring Chief Justice Rehnquist's many profound contributions to justice.  The meeting also trenchantly reminds the nation of the office's many important responsibilities.  Senators asked Judge John Roberts several cogent questions about how he expects to fulfill these administrative duties, and the nominee furnished candid, thorough responses. The office of Chief Justice of the United States requires wisdom, vision, and dedication to excellence in the administration of the entire judiciary - the Supreme Court, the appeals court and the district courts.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Carl Tobias is the Williams Professor of Law at the University of Richmond</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.indiana.edu/directory/bradleyc.asp">Craig Bradley</a>, a former law clerk to the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist, says that Rehnquist&#39;s thirty-three year legal legacy is complex and must be examined from multiple perspectives... <hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/craigbradley.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=1></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>N</strong></font>o one person can adequately assess Chief Justice William Rehnquist's thirty-three year-plus legal legacy. It&#39;s necessary to break that down into different areas of law, and to ask people with an expertise in each area to assess that legacy from their perspective. That&#39;s why this past April the Indiana University School of Law in Bloomington convened a special conference to examine Rehnquist&#39;s contributions in the field of constitutional law, including criminal procedure and habeas corpus.  The papers delivered at that conference will soon be published by Cambridge University Press in a book aptly entitled <em>The Rehnquist Legacy</em>.  <br /><br />In abridged form, here&#39;s what our speakers and contributors had to say. Keynoter Linda Greenhouse, Supreme Court correspondent for the <em>New York Times</em>, picked up on a theme expressed in a 2002 lecture by Prof. Thomas Merrill entitled &quot;The Making of the Second Rehnquist Court&quot;. She noted that the first eight years of Rehnquist's Chief Justiceship saw the Court experiencing frequent changes in membership and it<blockquote>spent much of its time and energy spinning its wheels on hot-button social issues without being able...to make much progress toward advancing the conservative agenda on such issues as abortion and school prayer. That was the First Rehnquist Court. Then, beginning in the summer of 1994, the Court experienced no turnover.  The emphasis of the docket&#8212;a shrinking docket&#8212;shifted from the social issues to the structural, most notably to questions related to federalism, on which the conservative majority enjoyed striking...success.  That was the second Rehnquist Court, and the Chief Justice appeared to be leading it with a sure hand.</blockquote>The last three years, in Greenhouse&#39;s view, have shown the emergence of a "Third Rehnquist Court."  This is characterized by a "re-engagement with divisive social issues, including affirmative action, religion and gay rights," "the suggestion that the much-vaunted federalism revolution may have run its course," "and the unmistakable indication...that the Chief Justice no longer speaks for a majority of the Court on many of the docket's most important issues."<br /><br />Turning to specific topics,  Prof. Geoffrey Stone (University of Chicago) noted that, during his tenure on the Court, Rehnquist was "by an impressive margin, the member of the Supreme Court least likely to invalidate a law as violating the freedom of speech or of the press."  This was particularly true when unanimous cases were not considered.  However, there were three areas, commercial speech, religious speech and campaign financing, where Rehnquist was more likely to uphold free speech claims than most of his colleagues.  Stone observed that "a cynic might say that Rehnquist's First Amendment reads 'Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech of corporations, the wealthy, or the church.'"<br /><br />Specifically as to commercial speech, Prof. Earl Maltz (Rutgers University) pointed out that Rehnquist originally held out against First Amendment protection for commercial speech as the sole dissenter in the 1976 <em>Virginia Pharmacy</em> case.  He attracted a majority to his position ten years later in <em>Posadas de Puerto Rico v. Tourism Co. Of Puerto Rico</em>, writing an opinion upholding a state imposed ban on billboards advertising casinos to local residents.  However, in 1996 <em>Posadas</em> was overruled in <em>Liquourmart v. Rhode Island</em> with Chief Justice Rehnquist "giving up" and joining Justice Thomas unanimous opinion striking down a state ban on liquor price advertising.  With both liberals and conservatives committed to an activist judiciary striking down commercial speech limitations imposed by legislative bodies, there was no longer any point in Rehnquist holding to his position of deference to those bodies.<br /><br />In  his paper &quot;Free Speech, Public Property and Government Money&quot;, Prof. Richard Garnett (Notre Dame) was much more supportive than Prof. Stone of Rehnquist's reluctance to favor First Amendment claims:<blockquote>Rehnquist's work does not reflect skepticism or hostility toward the core values protected by the Free Speech Clause, as some have charged, but instead reveals a careful appreciation for the fact that the translation and reduction of so many policy questions to free-speech problems comes at a cost.  After all, as the civic, social and political territory controlled by the Free Speech Clause grows, the amount shrinks that is governed democratically and experimentally by the people and their representatives or that is left under the direction of private persons, groups, and institutions.  One implication of the free speech takeover, Rehnquist seems to be warning us, is that difficult policy and other decisions depend increasingly on judges' evaluation of the abstract weight or worthiness of the government's interests, rather than on deliberation, compromise, and trial-and-error by and among citizens and politically accountable public officials.</blockquote>In fact, Garnett's explanation could be applied to all of Rehnquist's many decisions that are inhospitable to claims of constitutional protection by various litigants.  As Rehnquist put it, dissenting in <em>Trimble v. Gordon</em>, a case in which the majority established constitutional protection for the inheritance rights of  illegitimate children,  the Constitution "did not confer on this Court any authority to nullify state laws that were merely felt to be inimical to the Court's notion of the public interest."<br /><br />As for the First Amendment's prohibition of the establishment of religion, Prof. Daniel Conkle noted that<blockquote>consistently with his general inclination to read the Bill of Rights narrowly, Chief Justice Rehnquist has championed an extremely relaxed approach to the Establishment Clause. He has voted to reject virtually every Establishment Clause challenge the Court has confronted, and, contrary to settled doctrine, he has argued that the states should be permitted to favor religion as long as they avoid discrimination among competing religious sects.  Rehnquist's general view of the Establishment Clause has not prevailed and he frequently has found himself languishing in dissent."</blockquote>Rehnquist has, however, prevailed in one important area: voucher-based  public funding for religious schools and organizations.  As long as such funding programs are "neutral," i.e. available to religious and non-religious schools or organizations alike, they are acceptable, even if the bulk of the funding in fact goes to religious schools/organizations.<br /><br />The conference next turned to Rehnquist's legacy in criminal procedure: specifically his record as to searches and seizures under the Fourth, confessions under the Fifth and right to counsel under the Sixth Amendments, as well as the right of state prisoners to seek habeas corpus relief in federal courts.  In this area, Rehnquist has virtually never voted in favor of a criminal defendant in a non-unanimous case. As to the Fourth Amendment, I noted that "the police have had no greater friend on the Supreme Court than William Rehnquist." While he has not succeeded in overruling <em>Mapp v. Ohio</em>, which extended the exclusionary rule to the states,  he has participated in a substantial, across the board, curtailment of suspects' Fourth Amendment rights. This includes limiting the definition of what police
 conduct is a "search" (and hence covered by the Fourth Amendment at all); weakening the "probable cause" and warrant requirements for arrests and searches, creating a "good faith" exception to the exclusionary rule in warrant cases, and limiting the number of defendants who have "standing" to raise Fourth Amendment claims.<br /><br />Likewise, he has been unsuccessful in his second major goal: overruling <em>Miranda v. Arizona</em>.  In fact, he authored the majority opinion in <em>Dickerson v. United States</em>, striking down a federal statute that purported to "overrule" <em>Miranda</em>.  However, as Professor Yale Kamisar pointed out, four years later, he joined in a decision that severely undercut <em>Miranda</em> by allowing the government to use the "fruits" of confessions obtained in violation of <em>Miranda</em>, and dissented in another case where the Court narrowly disallowed the fruits of confessions obtained due to intentional <em>Miranda</em> violations by police: "The Chief Justice has probably contributed more to the confusion about Miranda than any other Justice."<br /><br />Rehnquist has never expressed the same hostility to the third keystone of the "criminal procedure revolution," <em>Gideon v. Wainwright</em>,  that he has to Mapp and Miranda.  <em>Gideon</em> established a Sixth Amendment right to appointed counsel for indigents in all felony cases.  <em>Argersinger v. Hamlin</em>,  extended Gideon to at least all cases in which a person is sentenced to imprisonment.  Rehnquist joined Justice Powell's opinion concurring in the result in that case, expressing reservations about the Court's adoption of a bright line "actual imprisonment" standard. Since then, as Prof. James Tomkovicz explained, "he has had particular success in restricting indigent defendants' rights to appointed counsel for trial and for post-trial phases of the criminal process." In particular, he, joined by Powell, cut off the right to counsel at the "actual imprisonment" line about which he had previously expressed reservations, in <em>Scott v. Illinois</em>.<br /><br />On the subject of federal habeas corpus as a means for state prisoners to achieve review of their convictions in federal court,  Prof Joseph Hoffmann observed that<blockquote>During his long career on the Court, Chief Justice Rehnquist has played a central role in reversing the (Justice) Brennan-engineered expansion of federal habeas.  Rehnquist&#8212;a staunch believer in the prerogatives of the state vis-a-vis the federal government, as well as in the inherent right of society to punish criminals as it sees fit&#8212;consistently has advocated for a far narrower federal habeas remedy than the one Brennan envisioned in the 1960&#39;s. Today it is clearly Rehnquist's view of federal habeas corpus that has prevailed....Moreover, to the extent that he has sometimes failed to persuade the Court to restructure federal habeas corpus, Congress has stepped in and completed the task for him.</blockquote>The next section of the conference was devoted to the structure of government.  Rehnquist authored two highly publicized opinions limiting the power of Congress to legislate under the Commerce Clause: <em>United States v. Lopez</em> and <em>United States v. Morrison</em>.  However, Prof. Mark Tushnet (Georgetown) is of the view that these cases lack "second order principles (beyond the basic notion of federalism itself) that would translate these opinions into legal doctrines that could be regularly and predictably applied." In fact, five years after <em>Morrison</em>, it now appears that these cases were not the opening salvo of a "federalism revolution" as some averred at the time, but more of a shot across the bow of Congress warning it to limit its Commerce Clause jurisdiction to situations that really did involve interstate commerce in some meaningful sense. The recent case of <em>Gonzales v. Raich</em>, in which the Court upheld a federal statute that prohibited use/possession of marijuana for medical purposes despite a state law allowing it, and despite no obvious connection to interstate commerce, seems to confirm that a major reduction of the powers of the federal government will not occur.<br /><br />As Prof. Lynn Baker (Texas) pointed out, Rehnquist has been more hospitable to exercises of congressional power vis a vis the states when Congress attaches conditions to spending that the states can refuse altogether if they wish. In <em>South Dakota v. Dole</em>, the Court, per Rehnquist, upheld a federal statute that directed the Department of Transportation to withhold federal highway funds from states that did not establish a minimum drinking age of at least 21 "even if Congress may not regulate drinking ages directly." In discussing Rehnquist's apparent lack of interest in narrowing the "potentially eviscerative 'loophole' that existing spending doctrine provides to the Rehnquist Court's important project of restoring a meaningful balance between the state and federal spheres," Baker suggested that Rehnquist's various spending power and Commerce Clause decisions can be reconciled with one another "if one acknowledges that what drives his jurisprudence in both areas is a (sometimes) unstated inquiry into whether the congressional statute would regulate an area 'where states historically have been sovereign,' or whether it instead involves a traditional and appropriate federal function.  That is, Chief Justice Rehnquist's legacy in the area of federalism and the spending power may be a quiet, and to date only partially successful, revival of the doctrine he set forth in 1976 in <em>National League of Cities v. Usery</em>."   <br /><br />On a rather different note, Prof. Daniel Farber (Boalt) considered the issue of separation of powers as exemplified by the 1988 decision in <em>Morrison v. Olson</em>, which upheld the special counsel law, and hence led to Ken Starr's prosecution of President Clinton.  This decision "dramatically halted the efforts by Justice Scalia and other supporters of the 'unitary executive theory' to eliminate independent agencies and centralize power in the President." <br /><br />Prof. William Marshall (North Carolina) considered the issue of state immunity from tort suit as addressed in the Eleventh Amendment.<blockquote>When Rehnquist joined the Court in 1972, the right of the states to be immune from suits for damages brought by individual citizens was under siege from a variety of  doctrinal fronts.  Justice Rehnquist... reversed course....In two cases early in his tenure, Rehnquist both turned back the existing challenges to state immunity and created the intellectual foundation for (its) future expansion.</blockquote>Prof. Philip Frickey (Boalt) examined Rehnquist's work in often unpublicized cases involving statutory interpretation, which make up a substantial part of the Supreme Court's workload. Frickey observed that "Rehnquist has done more than his share of (this) routine work of the Supreme Court with good cheer, few complaints, and an admirable humility."  When constitutional values do come into play, Frickey argues that it can be said that "Rehnquist's voting record is best explained as implementing the preferences of the Republican Party," as Prof Tushnet has averred. But, it can also be said that his votes in statutory cases, "travel a methodologically defensible path based on a version of pluralist theory that assumes legislatures often reach good results, that courts are not well-equipped or even authorized to displace legislative policy judgements, and that local decisions are to be preferred to national ones," as Prof. Merrill has argued.  As discussed below, when it comes to a choice between his principles of federalism, and the politics of the individual case, Rehnquist has more often stuck to his principles over politics, as his dissent in the medical marijuana case illustrates.  <br /><br />Professors Ruth Colker (Ohio State) and Kevin Scott (Texas Tech) did a statistical analysis of Rehnquist's federalism decisions.  They found that Chief Justice Rehnquist does in fact<blockquote>demonstrate the respect for the balance between stat
e and federal governments that he has articulated in so many of his opinions...he places the actions of (federal and state) governments on equal footing.  Rehnquist also demonstrates a fair amount of judicial restraint, frequently tolerating state (and federal) action even if the underlying action is liberal....Ultimately we conclude that while there is an ideological component to Chief Justice Rehnquist's jurisprudence, there also appears to be evidence of a sincere commitment to the protection of the line between national and state governments.</blockquote>The final topic of the conference was Rehnquist's view of the scope of various rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.  As to abortion rights, Prof. Dawn Johnsen (Indiana Bloomington) observed that<blockquote>Rehnquist's abortion opinions over the years are striking in how little they have to say about abortion per se....Rehnquist has based his opposition to Roe v. Wade instead on an extremely narrow view of individual "liberty" protected against government intrusion....</blockquote> However, as is well known, so far Rehnquist has failed in his efforts to overturn Roe, despite his claim in dissent in <em>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey</em> that "Roe continues to exist, but only in the way a storefront on a western movie set exists: a mere facade to give the illusion of reality."<br /><br />Prof. Neil Devins (William &amp; Mary) considered the Chief Justice's opinion in <em>Washington v. Glucksberg</em> where the Court held that there was not a "right to die"and, more generally, the Court's decisions on the right to privacy.  In <em>Glucksberg</em>, the Court upheld the constitutionality of a state statue forbidding assisting a suicide. Although the 5 member majority opinion is "filled with internal inconsistencies and a startling disregard of precedent" Devins attributes this to "likely compromises that the Chief Justice made in order to secure the vote of the Court's swing Justices" O'Connor and Kennedy.  However, this left an opinion that was "so indeterminate as to be without precedential force" paving the way for Justice Kennedy to totally ignore <em>Glucksberg</em> six years later in striking down the Texas sodomy statute, on "right to privacy" grounds in <em>Lawrence v. Texas</em>. <br /><br />Prof. David Barron (Harvard) considered the topic of  "state action." A prerequisite to an assertion of a constitutional right is that the person against whom the assertion is made be a governmental (i.e."state"), not a private, actor.  Rehnquist has been instrumental in limiting what is considered "state action" and therefore the range of activities subject to constitutional limitation.  As Barron observed:<blockquote> An increasingly popular view argues that Rehnquist's jurisprudence is marked by an unusually strong embrace of judicial supremacy.  But it is hard to square that critique with his consistent efforts...to narrow the scope of judicial authority to impose constitutional constraints.  At the same time, his state action decisions do not support the view...that his Court has been overly deferential to politics.  The striking thing about his state action decisions is that they limit the scope of constitutional reach without deferring to majority decision making.  Instead, they consistently assert the independence of private action from governmental authority.... Rehnquist's jurisprudence in many ways has more to do with privatizing the Constitution than entrusting it to, or wresting it from, the people.</blockquote>In the book we leave the last word to Prof. Earl Maltz and his paper &quot;The Intractable Problem of Race.&quot;  Maltz notes that "in general terms, Rehnquist accepted the consensus view condemning racial discrimination." However, Rehnquist was a staunch supporter of neighborhood schools, and consequently against busing as a remedy for de facto school segregation. This led to his key decision in B<em>oard of Education of Oklahoma City v. Dowell</em> in 1991, ending busing in that city.  By contrast, when it came to affirmative action, Rehnquist's view that "under our Constitution, the government may never act to the detriment of a person solely on the basis of that person's race," has not prevailed.  Most recently, Rehnquist found himself on the losing side of <em>Grutter v, Bollinger</em> which upheld the University of Michigan Law School's affirmative action program.  Finally, Maltz notes that, "the only area where Rehnquist was less categorical in his opposition to race-conscious government has been in cases involving the creation of electoral districts."<br /><br />What does all this mean? Rehnquist's legacy will be one of staunch conservatism, with a very narrow view of judicially protected constitutional rights, and a broad view of the authority of the democratically elected branches of government. But, where a conservative social view clashed with a conservative view of the power of states within the federal system, he often allowed the states' power to trump conservative social values.<br /><br /> <br /><em>Craig Bradley is the James L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a JURIST <em>Forum</em> special, JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.williamgeorgeross.com/">William G. Ross</a>, Professor of Law at Samford University&#39;s Cumberland School of Law in Alabama, reviews the first day of the Senate confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Chief Justice nominee John Roberts, and wonders about the baseball metaphor chosen by the nominee to describe his judicial role... <hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/wgrossnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=1></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he first day of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on the nomination of John G. Roberts, Jr. to become Chief Justice of the United States was consistent with the moderate tension evidenced over his confirmation during the eight weeks since President Bush first nominated Roberts for an associate justiceship. Although the hearings lacked the rancor that from the very beginning beset the hearings on Robert Bork in 1987 and the hearings on Clarence Thomas in 1991, Senate Democrats were less deferential to Roberts than Republicans were toward Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993 and Stephen Breyer in 1994. The wariness of Judiciary Committee Democrats toward Roberts was reminiscent of their initial attitude toward David Souter in 1990. Several Democratic senators warned Roberts that they would not vote for his confirmation unless he provided satisfactory answers to questions about his views on a wide array of controversial legal issues, particularly federalism. As Senator Russell Feingold declared, the confirmation process "is not a coronation." <br /><br /> More than perhaps any confirmation hearing on history, Monday's hearing focused on process. Although Senate Democrats assured Roberts that they do not expect him to compromise the Court's integrity and independence by explaining how he would vote on specific issues that are likely to come before the Court, they expect him to discuss previously decided cases and to provide considerable detail in his responses to questions that are designed to probe his political predilections. Meanwhile, Senate Republicans reminded Roberts that he is not obliged to answer any question and should not make any response with which he is not comfortable. "Don't take the bait," Senator John Cornyn urged Roberts. Republican senators likewise urged their Democratic colleagues to refrain from asking questions that sought commitments on specific legal issues.<br /><br /> Monday's hearings also provided examples of how the confirmation process provides an opportunity for senators to impart information and advice to nominees in addition to asking questions. As Senator DeWine remarked, "This is a time for a national conversation" about the Constitution. Senator Feinstein, for example, reminded Roberts of the long struggle of women for gender equality. Warning him that she would be very reluctant to vote for any nominee whom she "knew would overturn Roe v. Wade," Feinstein recalled how her Stanford classmates had collected money to enable a woman to obtain an abortion and how she had known a woman who had killed herself because she was pregnant. Meanwhile, Senator Brownback reminded Roberts that nearly forty million abortions have been performed since Roe and he expressed regret over "forty million lives that could be amongst us but are not, beautiful, innocent faces that could bless our existence and our families and our nation, creating and expanding a culture of life."<br /><br /> Senators also reminded Roberts of the importance of judicial restraint and judicial compassion. In confirmation hearings, Republicans traditionally emphasize the need for judicial "humility," a code word for judicial restraint, while Democrats stress the importance of "heart," a reference to empathy and compassion for the nation's dispossessed. In his brief remarks to the committee, Roberts twice assured the senators that he understands the importance of "humility," a word he used several times in his written responses to the Senate's questionnaire several weeks ago. Roberts said nothing, however, about "heart." Like the conservative that he is, Roberts emphasized the importance of liberty rather than equality or compassion. The Court, Roberts explained, should "safeguard those liberties that make this land one of endless possibilities for all Americans."<br /><br /> In emphasizing that the need for judicial restraint, Roberts analogized the Court's role to that of a baseball umpire. "Judges are like umpires," Roberts declared. "Umpires don't make the rules; they apply them. The role of an umpire and a judge is critical. They make sure everybody plays by the rules."<br /><br /> Roberts's baseball imagery minimizes the political significance of the Court, which is much more than an umpire. Although Roberts may have been correct in averring that the Court merely "calls balls and strikes" and does not "pitch or bat," the way in which the Court calls balls and strikes involves considerably more discretion than that of a baseball umpire. As Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes once famously remarked, "We are under a Constitution, but the Constitution is what the judges say it is, and the judiciary is the safeguard of our liberty and of our property under the Constitution." Roberts's contention that "nobody ever went to a ball game to see the umpire" is belied by the intense interest taken that countless Americans take in his own confirmation hearings and the work of the Supreme Court. <br /><br /> Since most Americans recognize that even the most "restrained" judges are influenced by their political predilections, Democratic senators are demanding that Roberts demonstrate that his constitutional values are not significantly at odds with their own. Although Democratic senators are willing to acquiesce to the appointment of a "conservative" Justice since they are only too well aware that Bush would nominate no other kind, they want to test the boundaries of Roberts's conservatism. As Senator Charles Schumer told Roberts at yesterday's hearing, "the pivotal question which will determine my vote is this: Are you within the mainstream &#8212; albeit the conservative mainstream &#8212; or are you an ideologue who will seek to use the Court to impose your views upon us, past and present, on the left on the right, have attempted to do?"<br /><br /> Monday's hearings indicate that the committee will focus its inquiry mostly on ideology since no senator appears to doubt that Roberts has the intellectual ability and the integrity to serve on the Court. Although Roberts has little administrative experience, there is no indication that senators will seriously question Roberts's ability to serve with effectiveness as the chief administrator of the vast federal judicial system. <br /><br /> As several senators indicated at Monday's hearing, the principal question is likely to be whether the youthful Roberts has the capacity to adapt his thinking to the exigencies of particular cases as he encounters myriad legal issues, many presently unforeseen, during what is likely to be a very long tenure. In his remarks yesterday, Roberts assured Judiciary Committee members that he has an "open mind." His testimony during the coming days will determine whether he is able to convince wary Democratic senators that his mind is indeed open. If he succeeds, a relatively quick confirmation seems assured. If not, his confirmation proceedings could become much more tumultuous.<br /><hr size=1><br />Also by William G.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.onu.edu/faculty/gerber/">Scott Gerber</a> of Ohio Northern University Pettit College of Law says that while Judge John Roberts, Jr., President Bush&#39;s nominee for Chief Justice of the United States, may have trouble building consensus on the fractured US Supreme Court, it is unlikely any lower court appellate judge could do better... <hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/gerber.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=1></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>F</strong></font>irst things first.  I think Judge John G. Roberts Jr. should be confirmed as the chief justice of the United States.  He&#39;s smart, experienced, well educated, and possesses a splendid temperament.  Most important of all, he&#39;s right on most political issues.  However, one thing he won&#39;t be good at is building consensus on the Supreme Court.<br /> <br />No one else would be good at it either.<br /> <br />Judge Roberts&#39;s consensus-building skills were put in play by the very first senator to speak at the confirmation hearing, Judiciary Committee chairman Arlen Specter (R-PA).  Senator Specter stressed during his opening statement how important it would be for a new chief justice &quot;to bring consensus to [a] court&quot; crippled by split decisions and splintered opinions. <br /><br />Later, during his questioning of the nominee, the senator characterized the Court&#39;s recent jurisprudence as a &quot;patchwork of confusion&quot; and asked Judge Roberts whether, if confirmed as chief justice, he would work to build consensus on the Court.  Judge Roberts responded that he would make it a &quot;priority&quot; to do so. <br /><br />I&#39;m confident that Judge Roberts was being sincere in his answer to Senator Specter&#39;s question.  Unfortunately, as Professor Keeok Park and I demonstrated in a lengthy empirical study in the <em>American Political Science Review</em> it is quixotic to search for a consensus-builder for the Supreme Court, at least when the nominee is drawn from one of the nation&#39;s lower appellate courts, as Judge Roberts is, and as almost all nominees have been during the modern era. <br /><br />Professor Park and I discovered in our study that virtually all justices become more conflictual on the Supreme Court than they were on a lower court:  they concur more and dissent more--and write more concurring and dissenting opinions--as justices than they did as judges.<br /><br />In addition, we found that many justices who exhibited consensus-building inclinations on a lower court are highly conflictual on the Supreme Court.  For example, the late Justice Harry Blackmun&#39;s discordant ratios as an appellate judge were among the lowest in the group, but his discordant ratios on the Supreme Court were among the highest.  These findings held even after we adjusted for the differences in court size and ideology between the relevant lower appellate courts and the Supreme Court. <br /><br />This is because the modern Supreme Court is a unique court, one whose institutional environment leads to dissension.  Specifically, the Supreme Court is distinctive among collegial U.S. courts in the discretionary character of its docket, the controversial nature of the cases it decides, and the norm of individualism it invites. <br /> <br />Consequently, consensus is not easily achieved. <br /><br />Indeed, although the late Justice William J. Brennan Jr. had a reputation for being a consensus-builder on the Supreme Court, what he was actually so gifted at was building coalitions for liberal political outcomes.  Our study found Justice Brennan to be one of the most conflictual members of the conservative Rehnquist Court:  he cast concurring and/or dissenting votes 68 percent of the time and wrote concurring and/or dissenting opinions 20 percent of the time. <br /><br />In short, the Supreme Court is, at heart, a political institution, and what matters above all else is the political preferences of the individual justices.  What this means for the confirmation process involving Judge Roberts is that if a particular senator likes Judge Roberts&#39;s political views, he or she should vote to confirm him as chief justice.  If the senator does not share the nominee&#39;s political views, the senator should vote against the judge.  This might sound overtly partisan, but the data suggests there&#39;s no use burying our heads in the sand any longer. <br /><br /> <br /><em>Scott D.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the US Senate Judiciary Committee holds hearings on John Roberts&#39; nomination as the next Chief Justice of the United States, JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="mailto:bmiller@law.wnec.edu">Bruce Miller</a>, Professor of Law at Western New England College of Law, says the Court&#39;s federalism rulings over the last two decades helped to create a legal climate that impaired the ability of the federal government to respond effectively to the recent Hurricane Katrina disaster, and that Senators should seek assurances from Roberts and other Bush high court nominees that they will support a more robust federal power... <hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/brucemiller.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=1></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>n the past fortnight, Americans have witnessed two seemingly unrelated events that may define our common future for years, or even generations, to come.  The first is, of course, the overwhelming, shameful catastrophe of our collective failure to anticipate and respond to Hurricane Katrina, resulting in the destruction of the great city of New Orleans and the death and utter ruin of the lives of so many of its mainly African American citizens.  The other is the death of the sitting Chief Justice of the United States, William Rehnquist, a rare and significant turning point in our constitutional history, made even more important this time because it offers President Bush an opportunity to appoint two new justices, one of whom (now apparently Judge John Roberts), will probably lead the court for many years.  The last President to enjoy a similar chance to influence the court so profoundly was Richard Nixon, who appointed Lewis Powell and Mr. Rehnquist to succeed two of the great voices of the Warren court, Hugo Black and the second John Marshall Harlan.<br /><br />But if these events seem unrelated, they are not.  The devastating impact of the hurricane is widely, and accurately, seen as a political debacle rather than the inevitable result of a natural disaster.  Over the past two weeks, the pages of the country's leading newspapers and the broadcasts of network and cable television news have been filled with accounts of the downgrading, even near dismantling, of the Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA) by the Department of Homeland Security since September 11, 2001, the diversion of substantial funding intended for levee maintenance and repair to the war in Iraq and, above all, the abject impoverishment and ghettoization of New Orleans' (until now) politically invisible African American community.  We, the people of the United States, these stories tell us, have made (or tolerated) political choices that allowed a hurricane to lay waste a vital center of American culture and annihilate the lives and prospects of those who lived there.<br /><br />It is this failure of political will that connects Hurricane Katrina to the appointment of two new justices.  For the abandonment of New Orleans happened because our national government allowed it to happen, and our national government, at least in the domestic sphere, has been under siege for a generation, most often at the hands of its own officeholders.  Some of these officeholders, it must be said, have been justices of the Supreme Court.<br /><br />It is well known that the so-called federalism decisions effected by a narrow majority of the Rehnquist court over the past decade have cast serious doubt on Congress' ability to identify and resolve important national problems by using its power to regulate interstate commerce [see <em>U. S. v. Lopez</em>, 514 U. S. 549 (1995); <em>U. S. v. Morrison</em>, 529 U. S. 598 (2000)].  Perhaps slightly less well known but no less important are a line of decisions by the same narrow majority that appear, at least implicitly, to limit Congress' power to outlaw ostensibly neutral state and local policies that in practice discriminate against racial minorities and women [<em>City of Boerne v. Flores</em>, 521 U. S. 507 (1997);  <em>Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett</em>, 531 U. S. 356 (2001). See also <em>Washington v. Davis</em>, 426 U. S. 229 (1976); <em>Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney</em>, 442 U.S. 256 (1979)].  In the court's most recent terms, some members of this majority, most notably Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice O'Connor, clearly pulled back from the most extreme consequences of this doctrine.  For example, Rehnquist and O'Connor's votes in favor of Congress's ability to rely on the 14th Amendment to pass the Family and Medical Leave Act as a remedy against sex discrimination were essential to the Court's decision to sustain that Act against a states' rights challenge [<em>Nevada Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs, 538 U. S. 721 (2003)</em>].  The Senate Judiciary Committee would do well to ask both Judge Roberts and the new potential successor to Justice O'Connor whether they agree with the moderate views expressed by their predecessors in this important case.  If they do not, a future pro civil rights Congress may find that it is blocked by the Court from legislating to remedy the sorts of deeply embedded but tacit structures of racial domination that have so obviously plagued New Orleans' African American citizens.<br /><br />To be sure, no decision of the Rehnquist Court would have prevented Congress from using its power to spend for the general welfare to appropriate the funds necessary to protect New Orleans and its residents from the consequences of Hurricane Katrina.  But under the view of the Spending Power espoused by an informal group of conservative and libertarian lawyers who identify themselves as the "Constitution-in-Exile" movement, such funding might be placed in constitutional doubt.  This movement, described in detail by Professor Jeffrey Rosen last April in the N.Y. Times Sunday Magazine, seeks to restore a pre New Deal understanding of Congress's constitutional powers. Rosen, "The Unregulated Offensive" [<em>New York Times Magazine</em>, April 17, 2005, at 42]. For at least some Constitution-in-Exile thinkers, this means that many spending measures for purposes other than national defense amount to an impermissible forced transfer of wealth from taxpayers to recipients and thus are not for the "general welfare".  Rosen's article, for example, recounts Professor Richard Epstein's  argument that taxation can be reconciled with personal freedom only when it leaves the taxed individual at least as well off as before the tax was imposed. "The Unregulated Offensive", at 48. And even when federal spending is permissible, Congress may be seriously limited by considerations of state sovereignty in imposing conditions on the use of federal funds by state and local governments [see, e.g. <em>South Dakota v. Dole</em>, 483 U. S. 203, 212 (1987) (dissenting opinion of Justice O'Connor)].  Professor Rosen's article reports that at least some of the lawyers and judges under consideration by the President for vacancies on the Supreme Court, including Judge Roberts, are sympathetic to the ideas of the Constitution-in-Exile movement ["The Unregulated Offensive", at 130].  The consequences of these ideas for specific cases are, of course, difficult to predict.  Still, the Senate Judiciary Committee has ample ground to question Mr. Roberts and the President's choice to succeed Justice O'Connor on their views of Congress' spending power.<br /><br />We, the people of the United States, allowed Katrina to destroy New Orleans.  By relearning the lesson that our national government can serve our commitment to mutual aid and advance our common destiny as citizens of the United States, we have the constitutional power to protect other regions of our country from the preventable, political consequences of future natural disasters and to help the people of New Orleans and the Southeast to recover and, eventually, prevail over their terrible misfo
rtune.<br /><br />If we ever choose to exercise this power, we will be sorely disappointed if our efforts are thwarted by the Supreme Court.  But if we allow the Senate to confirm the President's nominees to the Court, without assuring that they have due respect for the domestic powers of the federal government, we will have no right to be surprised by just such an outcome.<br />  <br /> <br /><em>Bruce Miller is Professor of Law at Western New England School of Law, where he teaches constitutional law and other public law subjects, and has a continuing interest in legal issues that especially affect the poor.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a JURIST <em>Forum</em> special, JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.williamgeorgeross.com/">William G. Ross</a>, Professor of Law at Samford University&#39;s Cumberland School of Law in Alabama, reviews the third day of the Senate confirmation hearings for US Chief Justice nominee John Roberts, and suggests that while the nominee has so far shown humility, but he has not yet demonstrated heart... <hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/wgrossnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=1></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>D</strong></font>uring more marathon testimony on the third day of the Senate Judiciary Committee's hearings on his nomination, John G. Roberts continued to discuss a wide spectrum of legal issues in about as much detail as he could without improperly revealing his opinions about specific questions that are likely to come before the Court. Although a few Democratic senators expressed exasperation over Roberts's refusal to offer his views about specific legal issues, this could hardly have surprised them, since every Supreme Court nominee who has testified before the committee has remained similarly reticent. Roberts, however, genuinely appeared to surprise and vex some senators because he seemed more reluctant than most nominees to share personal thoughts and feelings that would help to demonstrate empathy with the problems of Americans, particularly those less fortunate than himself, who regularly look to the Supreme Court as a last resort for justice.    <br /><br /> Throughout his testimony, Roberts repeatedly resisted opportunities to speak about his personal experiences or demonstrate that he had an understanding of the human dimensions of the numerous legal issues he has discussed. For example, Roberts, who was questioned at length about his work in helping to craft the Reagan Administration's opposition to expansion of the Voting Rights Act, missed repeated opportunities to deflect criticism by roundly deploring the injustices created by racial discrimination. Although Roberts explained that voting is the cornerstone of liberty and expressed his opposition to racial discrimination, he could have done much more to disarm his critics and re-assure his supporters if he had infused his remarks with some sense of passion, perhaps through anecdotes that would demonstrate that he had personally witnessed racial discrimination or injustice.<br /><br /> Similarly, when Senator Dianne Feinstein implored Roberts to offer "your feelings as a man" about the difficulties that many terminally ill persons and their families experience in deciding whether to remove life support systems, Roberts offered only vague remarks that indicated no real experience or empathy with the problems of real-life people. In response to a similar question by Senator Joseph Biden, Roberts observed that a judge should not "incorporate his or her personal views into deciding issues of this sort." Likewise, Roberts responded in the negative to Senator Charles Grassley's question about whether a judge could consider his or her personal values and beliefs in adjudicating constitutional issues. <br /><br />  Although Roberts is correct that a judge should strive to decide cases upon the law rather than emotion or personal predilections, several of the Judiciary committee members who spoke yesterday, including some Republicans, seemed to agree with the numerous judges and legal scholars who believe that personal values and beliefs can and should influence judges. At the very least, a judge's understanding of the human aspects of a legal problem can and should help to inform his or her judgment about the law. Such understanding is particularly important in adjudications before the Supreme Court, where there are nearly always strong legal arguments in favor of competing legal arguments and cases often turn on the policy preferences of Justices. Since the ideological bent of Justices and their personal philosophies influence the outcome of many Supreme Court decisions, senators have a need to know as much as possible about the personal ideals and ideas of Supreme Court nominees. Since it is improper for nominees to offer their opinions about specific legal issues that are likely to come before the Court, insights into their personal ideals help senators to determine whether nominees have the commitment to justice that is generally regarded as an essential criterion for the confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee.<br /><br /> Several senators expressed frustration over Roberts's refusal to reveal more about his private feelings. Senator Dianne Feinstein, for example, declared rather plaintively that she wished to learn more about "Roberts, the man," as opposed to "Roberts, the legal automaton." <br /><br /> In contrast with Roberts, other recent Justices have shared personal feelings and insights with the committee, often without prompting from the senators. O'Connor, for example, told the committee during her confirmation hearings that abortion was "repugnant to me and something in which I would not engage."Similarly, Ginsburg shared poignant anecdotes about her personal experiences with gender discrimination, Thomas spoke movingly about the discrimination and deprivations he suffered during his childhood as an African-American in the segregated South, and Souter made a point of recalling how he personally counseled a woman who was considering having an abortion. Other nominees also have sometimes been willing to share their views on public policy issues that are separable from legal issues. For example, O'Connor testified that she did not regret voting for capital punishment as an Arizona legislator, and Rehnquist testified at his first confirmation hearing in 1971 that the use of force at Kent State that resulted in the deaths of four students was "unwarranted and misguided." <br /><br /> It is particularly important for Roberts to demonstrate some type of compassion or empathy since he has come from a privileged background. In his most forceful statement about his ability to understand the problems of litigants whose backgrounds differ from his own, Roberts told Senator Durbin that while his life had been "comfortable," it had not been "isolated," and that he has associated with "people of a wide variety of backgrounds." Moreover, he explained that he has represented welfare recipients whose benefits had been cut off, criminal defendants who faced long prison sentences, antitrust plaintiffs, and environmental interests. He also told senators that he has been involved in a street law program for the past fifteen years. <br /><br /> Since deeds speak more loudly than words, Roberts's representation of a diverse clientele and his record of pro bono work is more impressive than any pious expression of compassion for the nation's dispossessed. But not every lawyer who represents disadvantaged clients comes to have an empathy for their problems. Some lawyers who represent such clients remain highly detached from their clients and treat their problems as mere legal abstractions. Roberts's testimony does not indicate whether his representation of disadvantaged persons made him more sympathetic toward their fundamental problems. In order to appreciate justice, one must first have a sense of injustice. Not once during the hearings has Roberts provided any forceful indication that he has any passion about injustice.<br /><br /> Roberts's claim that he had a "typical middle class upbringing" when in fact his background is distinctly upper middle class indicates that perhaps he is not fully aware of just how "comfortable" his life has been. Also troubling was his remark to Senator Feinstein that he expected to remain in touch with the lives of ordinary Americans through his children's school activities. Feinstein immediately pointed out that the social circles in which his family moves are hardly likely to bring him into contact with the least fortunate
 members of American society. <br /><br /> Roberts deserves credit for refusing to feign emotions that he lacks and for sparing the nation the type of tawdry and maudlin personal confessions that have become all too common among public figures. Nevertheless, Roberts's testimony is troubling insofar Roberts has expressed little personal understanding of the ways in which constitutional issues involve the day-to-day problems of countless Americans. <br /><br /> Roberts has effectively demonstrated that he understands the importance of judicial restraint and judicial humility, and he has opened his head as freely as is proper in discussing legal issues. Perhaps in his final day of testimony, he will open his heart, too.   <br /><br /><hr size=1><br />Also by William G.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.washington.edu/Faculty/Stilt/">Kristen Stilt</a> of the University of Washington School of Law says that the victory of President Hosni Mubarak in the recent Egyptian multi-candidate presidential election was no triumph of democracy, but rather the product of constitutional sleight of hand that has only further entrenched an authoritarian regime...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/stilt.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>t is no surprise that Egyptian President Mubarak won last week in the new presidential election system he created.  Commentators in the U.S. noted in the run-up to the vote that even though Mubarak's victory was a sure bet, at least the new system opened the political arena to multi-candidate elections and exposed Egyptians to election campaigning with its speeches, advertisements, and, most novel, criticisms of the incumbent candidate.  <br /><br />This political opening may seem to follow directly from Bush's call in his 2005 State of the Union address for Mubarak to lead the Middle East to democracy, and Mubarak has been praised by the U.S. administration for holding these multi-candidate elections.  Criticisms of the election, whether by the U.S. media or the White House, have tended to focus on Mubarak's refusal to allow international election monitors.  But this is a small deficiency in the larger context of the overall presidential election system, which is in fact a democratic charade.<br /><br />Soon after Bush's address, Mubarak proposed a constitutional amendment to change the presidential selection process from a single-candidate referendum to a multi-candidate election.  This promised to be the most dramatic development in the Egyptian political process since a coup brought the military to power in 1952.  Under the old system, the lower legislative house nominated a single candidate for president and submitted the name to the voters in a referendum. Since Mubarak assumed office after the assassination of Anwar Sadat in 1981, the lower house &#8212; which like the upper house is dominated by Mubarak's National Democratic Party (NDP) &#8212; has nominated Mubarak four times, and he has won with "yes" votes in the mid to high 90 percent range each time.  The regime did not permit any independent monitoring of these referenda, and the accuracy of the official results is highly suspect.<br /><br />The new system enables voters to select their president in direct elections from a list of individuals who meet the criteria and are certified by the newly-created Presidential Election Commission.  The ten candidates on the ballot this time gave the illusion that the winds of democratic change are kicking up in the region, but the details of the new election system reveal a very different story.  <br /><br />There are two ways to achieve certification as a candidate: one for leaders of registered political parties and one for independent candidates.  First, political parties that have been in existence for the previous five consecutive years and in the last legislative election received at least 5% of the seats in both legislative houses may nominate a presidential candidate.  The formation of a political party is not an easy matter.  The registration and activities of political parties are regulated by the Law on Political Parties, which was amended by Law 177 of 2005 as part of a package of new laws relating to the presidential elections.  The regulations for forming a political party are strict and include, for example, the requirement that the program of the party must add to the political life of the country according to the party's specified goals and methods.  Party registration requests have been denied on the grounds that a party was not sufficiently unique as to add a different perspective to political spectrum.  There are clear parameters in the law for the perspectives that a party might represent, however.  A party may not be formed on the basis of religion, whether in its fundamental principles, program, activities, or choice of leaders or members.  The Muslim Brotherhood, for example, would not be permitted to register as a political party under these rules, even if it were not otherwise considered an illegal organization by the administration.  <br /><br />Second, would-be candidates without a party affiliation, or whose party does not have the required number of seats, must obtain support from legislators to be on the ballot.  Specifically, the aspiring independent candidate must obtain signatures of support from at least 250 members of the two national and the many regional legislative houses combined, provided that at least 65 are from the lower house, at least 25 are from the upper house, and at least 10 members from at least 14 of the 26 regional legislatures support the individual.  <br /><br />These requirements make it almost impossible for any party other than the NDP to achieve certification for its candidate.  Independents have an equally difficult task.  Let's do the math.  There are 454 seats in the national lower house.  In the 2000 legislative elections, the NDP won 402 seats in the lower house, four opposition parties won a total of 17 seats, and 25 independent candidates won seats.  Ten seats are filled by presidential appointment.  None of the opposition parties came close to the 5% threshold of 23 seats.  Furthermore, with 402 NDP members and ten more presidential appointees, the remaining 42 legislators are not enough to support an independent candidate, even if they would all agree upon one.  <br /><br />But it would have reflected very poorly on Mubarak if he were the only candidate in the first election under the new system, which has been touted by the Egyptian and American administrations as democratic progress, so Mubarak included in the constitutional amendment a waiver of the minimum seat requirement for party-sponsored candidates for first election only.  But in subsequent presidential elections, the number of candidates will be much smaller, perhaps even just one NDP candidate whose last name might also be Mubarak, unless the election process for the legislatures is completely reformed and the NDP's tight grip on politics is broken.  This type of true reform is, however, only a distant dream.<br /><br />The substance of the new presidential election system is troubling, but even more problematic from a legal perspective is the means by which Mubarak implemented this system.  Article 76 of the constitution provided for the presidential referendum system, and so a constitutional amendment was needed to modify this provision.  The amendment, however, contains a level of detail far beyond the original Article 76, and enshrines in the constitution the numerical requirements discussed above that will have the effect of keeping independents and opposition party candidates out of the presidential elections in the future.  The administration's motives are clear: in defense of the constitutional amendment, Fathi Sorour, Speaker of the lower legislative house, adeptly commented that part of the constitution cannot be declared unconstitutional.  <br /><br />The regime obviously feared that if the constitutional amendment provided only the broad outlines of the new election system, leaving the details for implementing legislation, then it would run the risk that the fairly strong and independent Egyptian Supreme Constitutional Court (SCC) might later review a constitutional claim and find part of the implementing legislation unconstitutional.  This is no idle fear: the SCC has invalidated on constitutional grounds the results of more than one legislative election, and Mubarak would not subject his own "re-election" to the same possibility.  By legislating in the constitution, the regime circumvented the power of the SCC to review the presidential election system without
delving into the much more complex terrain of potentially conflicting constitutional provisions.<br /><br />Egypt's new presidential election system is not progress.  It is not even as benign as the failure of progress.  It is authoritarian entrenchment.  By pointing to Mubarak's new election system as a sign of the winds of democracy blowing across the Middle East, the U.S. has lost even more credibility in the hearts and minds of the Egyptian people.  Egyptian voters have seen through Mubarak's democratic charade and find it as tiresome and uninspiring as the blazing heat of Cairo during last week's election.  <br />    <br /><br /><em>Kristen Stilt is a law professor at the University of Washington School of Law, where her speciality is Islamic law.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a JURIST <em>Forum</em> special, JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.williamgeorgeross.com/">William G. Ross</a>, Professor of Law at Samford University&#39;s Cumberland School of Law in Alabama, reviews the second day of the Senate confirmation hearings for US Chief Justice nominee John Roberts, and suggests that the eleven hours of testimony were as remarkable for the key questions Senators did not ask as for the many questions they did... <hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/wgrossnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=1></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>J</strong></font>ohn G. Roberts, Jr. was as outspoken and forthcoming as any Supreme Court nominee in the nation&#39;s history in his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee during the second day of its hearings on his nomination to become Chief Justice of the United States. Although Roberts, like other Supreme Court nominees, rightly refused to answer many questions on the ground that he should not reveal his thinking about issues that might come before the Court, he provided detailed and thoughtful responses to questions concerning about a wide array of legal issues. The consistent moderation of Roberts's comments and his repeated emphasis on fidelity toward precedent and the importance of deciding cases on the basis of facts rather than ideology should help to dispel fears that he is some kind of fanatic. If there was any disappointment during an exhaustive eleven hours of hearings, it was that senators neglected to probe Roberts's ideas about more issues on which he could have provided interesting insights, and that senators sometimes failed to ask effective follow-up questions in response to Roberts's answers.<br /><br /> Much of the day was devoted to probing Roberts's thoughts on Roe v. Wade in an effort to elicit hints (for senators knew that they could hope for no more than hints) about whether he would vote to overturn or add significant new restrictions to the Court's decisions concerning the right to abortion. Like every other nominee since Roe was decided in 1973, Roberts naturally refused to reveal how he would vote on abortion issues. But he went about as far toward affirming Roe as any pro-choice advocate could hope to hear from a Bush nominee. For example, he squarely expressed agreement with the Court's 1965 decision in Griswold v. Connecticut, which laid the foundation for Roe by striking down a law that prohibited the use of contraceptives by married couples. Roberts also had no trouble in finding merit in the Court's use of stare decisis as a basis for re-affirming Roe in its 1992 decision in Casey v. Planned Parenthood. In particular, Roberts was quick to agree with Senator Arlen Specter that the overturning of any precedent would tend to unsettle the expectations of citizens and undermine the Court's legitimacy. <br /><br /> Roberts's emphasis on the importance of precedent must have won him points with both liberal and conservative senators. Adherence to precedence would require fidelity to the Court's decisions expanding civil liberties, particularly in cases involving abortion and homosexuality. At the same time, Roberts's emphasis on precedent would help to ensure that he would not support further expansion of such liberties or help to "discover" new ones. <br /><br /> Roberts also was surprisingly unequivocal in response to questions about the existence of a right to privacy. Although he naturally affirmed his belief in a right to the types of privacy specifically spelled out by the Constitution, he at first was willing to say, in response to questions by Specter, only that the Court has recognized that the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments accord a substantive right of privacy over matters that the Constitution does not explicitly mention. Later, however, Roberts explicitly agreed with Senator Joseph R. Biden that the Fourteenth Amendment provides, in Biden's words, "a liberty right to privacy that extends to women." Various senators who queried Roberts about Roe seemed not to fully appreciate this admission and they passed up opportunities to press Roberts more fully about his views about the scope of substantive due process, a key issues in cases involving many controversial issues, including abortion, parental rights, and homosexuality. Only Senator Charles E. Schumer seemed to recognize that Roberts's endorsement of Griswold had important implications for many controversial privacy issues, but Roberts refused to permit Schumer to draw him into a discussion of these issues.  Moreover, Roberts's expression of disapproval of the Court's notorious 1905 decision in Lochner v. New York, striking down New York's law limiting the hours of bake shop workers, could have provided an excellent opportunity to explore Roberts's views on substantive due process, along with any differences in the standards of review for economic and non-economic legislation. But senators missed the cue.<br /><br /> Senators also failed to press other points. Although, for example, Roberts twice recited the Court's position on the level of scrutiny to which courts should subject gender discrimination, no senator tried to elicit Roberts's own views on the appropriate level of scrutiny, even though the Supreme Court's position on this question is not settled.<br /><br /> In addition to his remarks about the right to privacy, Roberts also might have helped to soothe the fears of civil libertarians in his declaration, in response to Senator Patrick J. Leahy's question about whether the president as commander in chief  has the power ignore congressional ban on torture, that "no one is above the law under our system, and that includes the president. The president is fully bound by the law." Similarly, Roberts flatly told Senator Russell D. Feingold that "the Bill of Rights doesn't change during times of war."<br /><br /> Roberts's repeated emphasis on judicial restraint and his reluctance to overturn congressional legislation may have won him points with both liberals and conservatives, albeit for different reasons. On several occasions, Roberts had to remind senators that the Court sometimes must interpret rights narrowly because Congress itself has failed to provide statutory support for rights, and not because the Court has any political or constitutional objection to such rights. <br /><br /> As expected, Roberts was questioned in some depth by several senators about his views on federalism. Roberts steadfastly rejected repeated attempts by Schumer to offer his views on the Supreme Court's broad interpretation of the commerce clause in its 1942 decision in Wickard v. Filburn since Roberts contended that it remains controversial. He likewise flatly refused to answer Schumer's question about whether Congress can regulate commerce that does not involve an article that moves across a state line, and he generally resisted similar attempts by Senator Dianne Feinstein to have him draw precise lines in defining interstate commerce. Roberts was willing to say little beyond making the obvious empirical point that the Court in its recent decision in Gonzales v. Raich demonstrated that the Court's 1995 Lopez decision and its Morrison decision in 2000 were limited in scope and did not require a return to the highly restrictive view of interstate commerce that the Court had espoused until 1937. <br /><br /> With sixteen of the eighteen members on the committee having asked their questions, it does not appear that the questions at Roberts's confirmation hearing will have been as wide-ranging as questions at most other confirmation hearings during the thirty years since intense questioning of Supreme Court nominees became customary. With only thirty minutes allotted to each senator, committee members perhaps preferred to concentrate on a narrow band of issues. In contrast to other confirmation hearings during the past thirty years, senators asked
 relatively few questions about separation of church and state and the free exercise of religion. There were very few questions about criminal procedure, a hot button topic in many earlier confirmation hearings. Although several senators asked questions about voting rights, often in reference to Roberts's controversial involvement in voting rights cases during his years in the Reagan administration, senators all but ignored affirmative action. In view of the recent national debate over the removal of life support for terminally ill persons, it is likewise surprising that there was almost no mention of this issue. It is also strange that senators practically ignored the Court's recent controversial recent takings clause decision, Kelo v. New London; Senator Jon Kyl criticized Kelo, but did not ask Roberts about it. While Roberts was briefly questioned about the constitutional protection of pornography, no senator asked him about his views on the constitutional dimensions of hate speech.<br /><br /> Like most other nominees, Roberts was willing to express unequivocal support for such bedrock decisions as Marbury v. Madison and Brown v. Board of Education. Roberts explained that he was willing to express his opinion on past decisions, including Griswold, if he did not believe that the issue involved in the case was likely to come again before the Court. In contrast to Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who explicitly stated during her confirmation hearings that the Court wrongly sustained the forced relocation of Japanese-Americans in its 1944 Korematsu decision, Roberts was just a trifle more circumspect, saying that he could not see what argument the government could make in favor of the internment of an ethnic group for security reasons. <br /> <br /> Although senators refrained from asking Roberts to name a judicial role model, a question that they have asked many other federal judicial nominees, Roberts made a point of expressing admiration for Justice Robert H. Jackson's willingness to take a narrower view of presidential power during his years on the Court than he had espoused as Franklin Roosevelt's attorney general. Senators were not slow to recognize that Roberts seemed to be assuring them that his opinions as Chief Justice might differ from the controversial positions on civil rights that he advocated as an official in the Reagan Administration. In response to numerous questions about memoranda that he wrote during those years, Roberts generally explained that he was simply crafting arguments that reflected the administration's position and which did not necessarily reflect his own views. To the amusement of anyone who heard his testimony, Roberts was willing to unequivocally repudiate only one position that he advocated as a young man &#8212; term limits for federal judges. <br /><br /> Although Roberts expressed admiration for Rehnquist, for whom he clerked, he pointedly remarked that "I will certainly be my own man." Explaining that he resisted labels, Roberts explained to Senator Orrin G. Hatch that he prefers "to be known as a modest judge" who respects precedent. "I do not have an overarching judicial philosophy," he declared. In his dialogue with Kyl, Roberts may have been thinking of himself when he recalled how Judge Henry Friendly, for whom he also clerked, took delight in confounding efforts to peg him as a liberal or a conservative. <br /><br /> Like other nominees, Roberts also repeatedly emphasized that he would keep an open mind. In his dialogue with Senator Jeff Sessions, for example, Roberts explained that he and every judge has sometimes changed his "original view" about a case after reading briefs or hearing the views of fellow judges.<br /><br /> Senators devoted too little time to questions about the role of the Chief Justice. This is unfortunate, particularly since Roberts, as a former Rehnquist clerk, might have some interesting thoughts on such questions and he could feel more free to express these than to answer questions about specific legal issues. Aside from a few remarks from Senator Lindsey O. Graham about the importance of a Chief Justice's ability to maintain control over judicial conferences, there was no attention to how the Chief might facilitate efficient and amicable relations among Justices. Senators also devoted little attention to other important issues, including the Court's control over its docket and the procedures for granting certiorari petitions. The televising of Supreme Court arguments was one of the few issues involving Supreme Court administration about which Roberts was questioned. Roberts professed to have an open mind on the subject and assured the committee that he would explore the issue with his colleagues if he were confirmed. <br /><br /> Senators likewise failed to elicit Roberts's views about his role as the chief administrator of the federal court system. In particular, it would have been interesting to hear Roberts's thoughts concerning the workload and compensation of lower federal judges, both of which were of keen interest to Rehnquist. The only substantive question was Mike DeWine's question about the criteria that Roberts would employ in discharging his duty to appoint judges to the eleven-member Federal Intelligence Surveillance Administration court, to which intelligence agents must apply for wiretaps or search warrants involving terrorists or foreign spies.<br /> <br /> Aside from questions about stare decisis, which were really only intended to probe Roberts's substantive views, senators likewise asked too few questions about judicial process and decision-making. One of the few exceptions was Kyl's question about the Court's consideration of the laws of other countries in its recent decision in Roper v. Simmons, which held that the state cannot execute a person who was a minor at the time he committed a crime. In one of his most revealing statements of the day,  Roberts expressed significant reservations about reference to foreign law in American constitutional decisions. He explained that the use of foreign law denigrates the American political process since the foreign judges who make law are not appointed as part of that process by a democratically elected and accountable to the American President and Senate. Roberts also remarked that reliance on foreign precedent does not limit the discretion of judges in "the way that relying on domestic precedent does. Domestic precedent can confine and shape the discretion of the judges. Foreign law, you can find anything you want."<br /> <br /> Although many senators seemed more interesting in making speeches than in asking questions or listening to Roberts's answers even when they asked questions, their often protracted comments served a useful purpose. Hearings on the confirmation of federal judges provide a unique opportunity for direct communication between the legislative and judicial branches of government, permitting senators to directly convey their thoughts and concerns to members (or soon-to-be members) of the federal judiciary. The televised confirmation hearings on U.S. Supreme Court nominees provide a marvelous civics lesson for countless persons, both in the United States and abroad.<br /><hr size=1><br />Also by William G.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.williamgeorgeross.com/">William G. Ross</a>, Professor of Law at Samford University&#39;s Cumberland School of Law in Alabama, says that in his upcoming Senate confirmation hearing US Supreme Court nominee John G. Roberts Jr. may not reveal how he&#39;ll decide particular legal questions, but that doesn&#39;t mean that the questioning process itself won&#39;t be interesting and useful... <hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/wgrossnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=1></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>lthough several Democratic senators have vowed to subject U.S. Supreme Court nominee John G. Roberts to an intense grilling at the Judiciary Committee hearings which are scheduled to begin on September 6, Roberts will probably &#8212; and properly &#8212; follow the practice of previous nominees in refusing to answer questions that would reveal how he would rule on specific cases or issues. The hearings are nontheless likely to generate a fascinating dialogue on constitutional law.<br /><br />Fearful that Roberts, despite his gentle demeanor, is a right-wing ideologue who would vote to overturn a wide range of civil liberties decisions, various senators have vowed to ask Roberts very pointed questions designed to try to pin down his position on highly controversial subjects. Such questions are appropriate insofar as senators need to know as much as possible about the views of nominees in order to decide how to vote on their confirmation. In particular, Senator Charles Schumer of New York has announced that he will ask Roberts whether <em>Roe v. Wade</em> was correctly decided, whether he agrees with the reasoning in <em>Bush v. Gore</em>, and whether he believes that either Congress or the states can regulate the sexual behavior of individuals within the privacy of their home. Although Schumer is perfectly within his rights in asking these questions, it would be improper for Roberts to answer these and other questions that solicit his opinion regarding specific issues which are likely to come before the Court.<br /><br />Any judicial nominee who offered opinions on such questions would diminish confidence in the Supreme Court by suggesting that his mind was closed. As the Senate's Republican Policy Committee warned in a statement last month, "no judicial nominee should be compelled to answer any question that would force him or her to prejudge or signal future conclusions regarding any case or issue."  A nominee who speaks too freely about an issue that may come before the Court also may later need to need to recuse herself under a federal statute which requires recusal when a judge's "impartiality might reasonably be questioned."<br /> <br />Moreover, a nominee who is too voluble in her response to a question risks violation of Canon 5A(3)(d)(ii) of the ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct, which states that a candidate for appointment to judicial office "shall not with respect to cases, controversies, or issues that are likely to come before the court, make pledges, promises or commitments that are inconsistent with the impartial performance of the adjudicative duties of the office." Although mere expression of an opinion may not be intended as a pledge, promise, or commitment, it could be interpreted as such. <br /><br />Nominees have therefore regularly refused to speculate about how they would have ruled in previous cases or how they would vote in cases that might come before the Court. Although Stephen Breyer assured senators during his confirmation hearings in 1994 that he would "try very hard to give you an impression, an understanding of how I think about legal problems of all different kinds," he explained that he did  not "want to predict or commit" himself "on an open issue" that was likely "to come up in the Court." Breyer explained that a judge who has thoroughly studied an issue might reach a conclusion that differs from his casual opinion, and also that "it is so important" that "clients and lawyers understand the judges are really open-minded." Breyer explained that such comment would be inappropriate in the absence of "thorough briefing and thorough thought" and could create the appearance of bias. Similarly, O'Connor declared at her 1981 confirmation hearings that "neither you nor I know today the precise way in which any issue will present itself in the future, or what the facts or arguments may be at that time...Until those crucial factors become known, I suggest that none of us really know how we would resolve any particular issue."<br /><br />Nominees such as Roberts who already have served as judges also should refrain from engaging in detailed explanations of their judicial decisions. A judge's opinion should speak for itself, and a nominee can only sow confusion and detract from the opinion's integrity by offering commentary on it. A judge's public explanation of his judicial opinion is tantamount to a re-writing of it. Insofar as the decisions of a lower federal judge often involve issues that are likely to come before the Supreme Court in one form or another, discussion of specific opinions also can encourage comments about legal issues that would create the appearance of bias. Some Democratic senators have announced that they intend to query Roberts in detail about his judicial decisions since his service as a Court of Appeals judge only for two years does not provide a long-term judicial record that would bring his judicial views into a clearer focus. Roberts should not shrink from refusing to answer any question that requires more than a re-statement of his judicial opinion or a few very general remarks about it.<br /> <br />Since senators naturally want to probe the thinking of nominees in order to elicit clues about how they would rule in actual cases, Senate confirmation hearings often have the flavor of a cat and mouse game. Senators try to cajole or even trick nominees into revealing their opinions about substantive legal issues, while nominees offer replies that sound sage and erudite but which often are platitudinous and provide little real insight into how they might rule on specific issues. Nominees assure senators that they revere judicial restraint, separation of church and state, Brown v. Board of Education,  fairness to criminal defendants, and gender equality. And they stand foursquare against slavery. As Ruth Bader Ginsburg asserted during her confirmation hearings, Dred Scott was "a wrong decision."<br /><br />Senators and the public therefore should not expect too much from the questioning process. As Senator Arlen Specter observed during the Ginsburg hearings, "nominees answer about as many questions as they have to for confirmation."Attempts to probe the views of a nominee on specific issues also is futile to the extent that the nominee's general views already are known. It is quite clear by now, for example, that Roberts's views on many political issues probably are inconsistent with those of many Democratic senators. Although questioning may help to reveal whether his views are so different that senators wish to oppose his nomination, there is no way to predict whether the nominee will change those views once he is a member of the Court, and there likewise is no way to determine the extent to which those views will affect his adjudication of specific cases.<br /><br />The questioning of nominees nevertheless can serve a number of useful purposes.<br /><br />Various nominees have offered thoughtful comments about a wide range of legal issues without creating any appearance of bias with respect to particular issues. For example, a report of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1993 praised Ginsburg for providing useful insights into her thoughts concerning the Supreme Court's role in the political process, the scope of unenumerated rights, abortion, gender discrimination, affirmative action, freedom of speech and religion,
 separation of powers, statutory interpretation, standing, and criminal law and procedure, even though the committee acknowledged that it was not "fully satisfied with the responsiveness of Judge Ginsburg's answers."<br /><br />In a nice example of how a nominee can provide substantive insights into her thinking without committing herself to particular position, Ginsburg testified that she believed that the government must accommodate specific religious practices in the absence of "specific circumstances," a view that the Judiciary Committee's report pointed out was in direct conflict with the Court's recent decision in Employment Division v. Smith. Although Ginsburg refrained from direct criticism of Smith and her remarks did not demonstrate how she would vote in any actual case involving re-consideration of Smith, the Judiciary Committee pointed out that "Ginsburg's approach, reflected in her testimony and in her judicial record, shows sensitivity to the problem at the core of Smith and of modern free exercise clause doctrine &#8212; the problem of adjusting government action on religious practice to a pluralistic society." <br /><br />The sophisticated questions about judicial activism and federalism that Senator Specter has announced that he will ask Roberts similarly promise to generate a fascinating dialogue on these two critical subjects. Even though Roberts should avoid comments, including remarks about specific cases, that would tend to reveal how he would decide actual issues, there is much that Roberts could say that would offer insights into his thinking.<br /><br />It also is appropriate for nominees to answer questions about their non-judicial publications and statements, but only to the extent that such comments do not tend to reveal their opinion about issues that are likely to come before the Court. In many instances, of course, this exception may swallow the rule. These types of questions are likely to create  tension during the hearings on Roberts's nomination since Roberts wrote many controversial memoranda during his service as an assistant to the attorney general, a member of the White House counsel's staff, and deputy solicitor general. Roberts should try to answer these questions as fully as possible, particularly if the Administration continues to balk at the release of substantial number of documents relating to Roberts's tenure in the solicitor general's office.<br /><br />Nominees also may appropriately answer questions concerning their opinions on political or public policy questions, unless they fear that such responses would create an appearance of bias in actual cases . For example, Ginsburg re-affirmed her support for adoption of the Equal Rights Amendment. Similarly, O'Connor expressed her personal repugnance toward abortion and explained that she had did not regret that she had voted in favor of capital punishment as a member of the Arizona legislature. Such comments naturally offer clues about how a nominee might approach issues from the bench since a judge's political views often affect the manner in which a judge decides issues of law, but they need not necessarily create an appearance of bias since a judge presumably ought to be able to draw a distinction between her personal public policy choices and her views on legal questions.<br /><br />The questioning process also can help to probe a nominee's legal acumen and mental nimbleness,  although these qualities rarely are in doubt since most nominees, including Roberts, obviously have the intellectual ability to serve on the Court. The testimony of nominees can, however, help to confirm existing impressions about a nominee's fitness for office. Such confirmation is particularly useful in helping to bolster public confidence in the Court among the millions of Americans who watch the televised confirmation hearings.<br /><br />Similarly, the questioning process can be useful if there are issues concerning a nominee's previous actions, particularly those that call into question his character. The prime example is the hearing on Clarence Thomas's nomination in 1991, when Thomas was questioned extensively about alleged sexual harassment. A more common example has been questioning about possible conflicts of interest. Since Roberts appears free from any taint of scandal, questions about his personal or professional conduct are not likely to be prominent during the hearings on his nomination.<br /> <br />The testimony of judicial nominees also provides a unique opportunity for direct dialogue between the legislative and judicial branches of the federal government. Nominees often make observations that help to inform senators about the judicial process, while senators are able to communicate their thoughts and concerns about judicial issues. O'Connor, for example, told the senators that her experience as a trial judge had convinced her that Miranda had not encouraged crime or impeded the ability of police to gather evidence. Senators, in turn, have routinely admonished nominees to exercise judicial restraint and to remain mindful of the practical effects of their decisions. The advice that senators often give to prospective judges at these hearings adds a new layer of meaning to the constitutional duty of the Senate to offer "advice and consent" in connection with judicial nominations. During the past twenty years, the televising of the hearings has provided marvelous national seminars on constitutional law. Watched by millions of Americans, the hearings have gone far in helping to promote understanding of constitutional issues and the Court's work. <br /> <br />The questioning of nominees also can provide insights into their character and clues to how they would approach cases. For example, David Souter helped to assuage the anxiety of pro-choice advocates by reveling during his confirmation hearing that he once served as a confidant to a young woman who was considering having an abortion. Although this offered no specific insights into how Souter would vote in abortion cases, it indicated that this middle-aged bachelor was not oblivious to the personal trauma of women who have unwanted pregnancies. Conversely, Robert Bork helped to crystallize the misgivings of his critics when, in response to a question about why he wanted to become a Justice, he explained that service on the Court would offer "an intellectual feast." This reinforced the widespread perception of Bork as a cold intellectual who regarded the law more as an academic game than as an instrument of justice.<br /><br />The hearings and the committee's written questions also may help to clarify issues concerning the nominee's background and offer insights into the nomination process. For example, the Judiciary Committee's written questionnaire asks all federal judiciary nominees whether anyone, including persons at the White House, Justice Department, and Senate, have discussed "any specific case, legal issue or question in a manner that could reasonably be interpreted as seeking any express or implied assurances concerning your position on such case, issue, or question." If so, nominees are asked to provide a full explanation. Roberts responded to this question with one word: "No."<br /><br />In responding to the questionnaire's query about his views on so-called "judicial activism," Roberts may have offered some insights into his judicial temperament, if not his judicial philosophy. His response to this written question also provides clues about the extent to which he will be willing to respond to oral questions during the upcoming hearings. <br /><br />Roberts began with the obvious and sensible observation that "It is difficult to comment on either 'judicial activism' or 'judicial restraint' in the abstract, without reference to the particular facts and applicable law of a specific case." Like literally all of the hundreds of federal judicial nominees who have responded to this question, Roberts expressing misgivings about judicial activism, explaining that "courts should not intrude into areas of policy making reserved by the Constitution to the political branches." Unlike some lower court
nominees, however, who seem to have tried to placate senators by categorically denouncing any form of judicial activism and have avowed that they would never deviate from precedent, Roberts frankly declared that "[i]t is not 'judicial activism' when the courts carry out their constitutionally-assigned function and overturn a decision of the Executive or Legislature in the course of adjudicating a case or controversy properly before the courts."<br /><br />In proceeding to elaborate on these points, Roberts emphasized the need for judicial "humility," a word he used four times in the course of five brief paragraphs. In discussing this "humility," Roberts explained that judges "do not have a commission to solve society's problems, as they see them, but simply to decide cases before them according to the rule of law." He also pointed out that a judge should appreciate that "he is not necessarily the first person to confront a particular issue" and that he should "be fully open to the views of his fellow judges on the court." <br /><br />Roberts's answer did not, and probably could not, add anything new to the vast commentary on the proper role of federal courts in the American political system. His short, simple, and sound response was for the most part quite predictable. His emphasis on judicial humility, however, helps reinforce the widespread perception that Roberts is open-minded and is not an ideologue. While his acknowledgment that the courts have the duty to review the constitutionally of actions of coordinate branches of government merely states the obvious, Roberts deserves credit for not confining himself to a rote denunciation of judicial review, as have so many lower federal judicial nominees who have responded to the same questionnaire. <br /><br />On the other hand, his response is troubling to the extent that it ignored two specific issues that the question addressed: "a tendency by the judiciary toward loosening jurisdictional requirements such as standing and ripeness" and "a tendency by the judiciary to impose itself upon other institutions in the manner of an administrator with continuing oversight responsibilities." Roberts easily could have provided thoughtful responses to both of these highly generalized questions without revealing how he would vote in specific cases.<br /><br />Although Democratic senators are reportedly divided about how intensely to question Roberts, the hearings, like other hearings during the past thirty years, are likely to cover a wide range of issues. Extensive oral examination of Supreme Court nominees is a relatively recent phenomenon, for no nominee appeared before the Committee until 1925, when Harlan Fiske Stone was called answer questions about the propriety of some of his actions as Attorney General. During the next thirty years, the Committee interviewed only two nominees, Felix Frankfurter and Robert H. Jackson, questioning them about their activities rather than their views on legal issues. Beginning with John Marshall Harlan in 1955, the Committee has interrogated every nominee about substantive legal issues. Since the nomination of John Paul Stevens in 1975, the Committee has asked questions about a broad and often comprehensive array of contemporary legal issues. Extensive questioning of nominees is so much a part of the confirmation process that nominees are expected to engage in extensive dialogue with senators. Let us hope that both the senators will ask far-ranging and robust questions and that Roberts will provide detailed and candid responses, while steadfastly refusing to offer any opinion about any issue that is likely to come before the Court. <br /><br /> <br /> <br /><em>William G.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://mason.gmu.edu/~tzywick2/">Todd Zywicki</a>, Professor of Law at George Mason University School of Law and a Fellow at the James Buchanan Center for Political Economy, says that the new federal bankruptcy legislation signed into law this past Spring weeds out fraud and abuse while preserving a &quot;fresh start&quot; for debtors... <hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/zywicki.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=1></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>fter eight years of trying, Congress finally enacted the comprehensive, bipartisan bankruptcy reform bill this Spring.  Notwithstanding widespread misinformation about the bill's effect in the mainstream media and the halls of academia, the legislation passed both the <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2005/roll108.xml">House</a> and <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&session=1&vote=00044#position">Senate</a> with over 70% support, including substantial Democratic support.  Indeed, the bill was supported by every Republican in both Houses, and the overwhelming majority of centrist Democrats.  Opposition emanated almost exclusively from the far left of the Democratic Party, but even then <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20050506-122430-5180r.htm">one-quarter of the Congressional Black Caucus</a> supported the legislation.  The broad bipartisan support for the legislation indicates the recognition that the legislation provides a necessary rebalancing of America's bankruptcy laws to reduce the fraud and abuse in the system, to restore the ethic of personal financial responsibility, and to preserve the fresh start for those who need it.<br /><br />The past quarter-century in America has witnessed the most extended period of economic prosperity in American history&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;strong economic growth, low unemployment, low interest rates, and record levels of wealth accumulation owing to booming stock gains in the 1990s and rising home values throughout.  Nonetheless, consumer bankruptcy filings, which stood at slightly over 300,000 per year just twenty-five years ago, have risen to five times that level today&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;over 1.5 million annual filings.  Many of those filing bankruptcy today are those for whom the system is intended&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;families who are down on their luck due to job loss or other misfortune.  But the paradox of spiraling bankruptcy rates in the face of unprecedented economic prosperity reflects the fact that many bankruptcies today <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=587901">are not the result of economic hardship</a>, but an overly <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=681483">generous bankruptcy system</a> that provides strong incentives to file bankruptcy and does little to deter fraud and abuse.<br /><br />Why should we care about bankruptcy fraud and abuse?  Because bankruptcy fraud costs all of us, but especially small businesses and those consumers who pay their bills.  At the Presidential bill-signing ceremony, I sat next to a man and his son who own a small family-owned lumber store in rural New Jersey.  When a deadbeat buys $500 or $1,000 in lumber on store credit to build a deck on his house, and then files bankruptcy rather than repay it, they explained that those losses have to be made up somewhere.  Either other consumers have to pay higher prices, the family business (already struggling to keep pace with Loew's and Home Depot) has to write it off the bottom line, or they have to reduce costs by laying off employees, cutting wages and benefits, or reducing customer service.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/hq/cid/fc/video_text/bf_txt.htm">FBI estimates</a> that roughly ten percent of bankruptcy filings have some amount of fraud in them, usually outright lying and concealment about the assets and income that a debtor has to pay to his creditors.  To attack this problem, the legislation creates new safeguards for the government and creditors to identify and punish fraud, replacing the "honor system" that rested almost exclusively on the debtor's veracity.  Bankruptcy filers will have to submit copies of tax returns and pay stubs with their bankruptcy petitions, and bankruptcy filings will be randomly audited for accuracy.  Bankruptcy lawyers will be required to undertake minimal efforts to verify the accuracy of the debtor's sworn statements in her bankruptcy papers.  Bankruptcy mills who advise debtors to file bankruptcy using false Social Security Numbers will now face enhanced penalities.  Each of these safeguards and others in the legislation are simply sound, common-sense approaches to try to curb some of the fraud that is currently endemic in the system. <br /> <br />True, some of these safeguards will make it marginally more difficult for honest filers to declare bankruptcy as well as fraudulent filers.  But just as we realize that we can't rely on the "honor system" when it comes to paying taxes or prosecuting insurance fraud, the past two decades has demonstrated the na&Atilde;&macr;vete of relying on the honor system alone for bankruptcy filings.<br /><br />The bill also cracks down on various bankruptcy abuses.  For instance, it eliminates a number of obstacles that currently interfere with the ability of divorced spouses to collect alimony and child support from a bankrupt father and eliminates such pernicious traps as the second-class treatment of certain marital dissolution obligations, such as property settlements.  <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/testimony.cfm?id=1381&wit_id=3993">Philip Strauss</a>, formerly the principal attorney for the San Francisco Department of Child Support Services, testified that the domestic support provisions in the bill constitute a "'wish list' of amendment to the Bankruptcy Code aimed at facilitating support collection."  Strauss notes that almost all of the national child-support collection organizations in the country endorsed the legislation.<br /><br />The legislation also lengthens the permissible period for repeat bankruptcy filings from six years to eight and tightens up on abuse of the notorious unlimited homestead exemption.  The legislation places limits on those who purchase new expensive homes within two years of filing bankruptcy, imposes a 40 month waiting period before those who relocate to a new state can avail themselves of the new state's homestead exemption, and finally, creates a 10 year reachback period to attack homesteads acquired to defraud creditors.  Thus, whereas prior law permitted O.J. Simpson and WorldCom's Scott Sullivan to purchase mansions in Florida while leaving their creditors holding the bag, the bankruptcy reform legislation closes the most notorious homestead exemption loopholes.<br /><br />Finally, the legislation imposes a system of "means-testing" eligibility for chapter 7 relief.  As a result of generous exemptions and savvy pre-bankruptcy planning, 95% of chapter 7 bankruptcy filings result in no distribution to unsecured creditors, and usually only trivial amounts even where there is a distribution.  If a debtor makes more than his state median income (adjusted for family size), and could repay more than $10,000 of his unsecured debt over a five-year repayment plan (after subtracting for numerous allowances), then he would be presumed to have to file in chapter 13 and repay what he can, rather than being allowed to file chapter 7 and walk away from her debts.  Even then, the debtor would be entitled to demonstrate that he had "special circumstances" that should permit him to file in chapter 7 anyway.  The expense allowances are quite generous&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;permitting not only a standard living allowance for food, clothing, shelter, etc., but also payments on acutal secured debt (such as mortgages and car loans), actual medical expenses, premiums for
medical insurance, and up to $1,500 for educational expenses for dependent children.  It is estimated that the means-testing provisions of the legislation will shift roughly 10% of filers into chapter 13, but because these will be high-income filers with the greatest repayment capacity, those affected would be able to repay some 60% of their unsecured debt on average.  More fundamentally, nothing in the legislation prohibits anyone from filing bankruptcy; it simply conditions bankruptcy relief for high-income filers on repaying some of their debts as a condition for bankruptcy relief.  Equally importantly, it leaves the roughly 80% of bankruptcy filers who earn below their state median income completely unaffected.  <br /><br />Overall, therefore, the reform legislation is a balanced, common sense, incremental effort to deal with known problems of fraud and abuse in the system.  Why then has the legislation suffered such heated criticism by bankruptcy academics and professionals?<br /><br />In part, the criticism seems to be based on the simple-minded notion that if the legislation is good for creditors (especially credit-card issuers), it must ipso facto be bad for consumers.  But this argument fails to appreciate <a href="http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/archives/2005/03/the_bankruptcy.html">basic economics</a>. Those consumers who pay their bills are the primary losers when others file bankruptcy rather than repaying their bills.  As a society, it appears that we are all willing to pay a bit more for goods, services, and credit to permit honest and unfortunate debtors to discharge their debt and receive a fresh start.  But we <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/zywicki200503150744.asp">draw the line</a> when asked to subsidize widespread fraud and dishonesty.<br /><br />Nor should we be distracted from the necessity of the legislation by the political support for the legislation by the consumer credit industry.  Of course, the consumer credit industry, as well as thousands of small businesses, stand to gain from the enactment of the bankruptcy reform legislation, and lobbied heavily for the legislation.  But there were <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/zywicki200503160744.asp">"special interests" on both sides of the bankruptcy bill</a>.  In particular, just as creditors stand to gain financially by a reduction in bankruptcy filings, bankruptcy lawyers and other elements of the bankruptcy industry stand to lose from the anticipated reduction in filings following reform.  In fact, as Professor David Skeel observed in his magisterial <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691116377/qid%3D1117744302/sr%3D2-3/ref%3Dpd%5Fbbs%5Fb%5F2%5F3/104-5965543-7256730">history of bankruptcy law</a>, American bankruptcy law traditionally has been guided strongly by the influence of bankruptcy lawyers.  On net, the financial clout of these two powerful lobbying groups&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;lawyers and bankers&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;appear to have largely canceled each other out.  As for the heated criticism from the academy, this may simply reflect the ideological views of the modern legal academy, which seems to be <a href="http://www.legaled.com/lawprofs.htm">closer to</a> that of Ted Kennedy, Bernie Sanders, and the small minority of stauncly liberal politicians who opposed the bill than the conservative and centrist politicians that overwhelmingly supported it.<br /><br />What then explains the overwhelming political support for the legislation?  For once Washington appears to have recognized what critics have not&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;that bankruptcy reform was an issue of personal and moral responsibility, and that the system had tilted too far toward becoming a tool for opportunism and dishonesty.  As President Bush <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/04/print/20050420-5.html">observed</a> in signing the bill into law, "America is a nation of personal responsibility where people are expected to meet their obligations. We&#39;re also a nation of fairness and compassion where those who need it most are afforded a fresh start. The act of Congress I sign today will protect those who legitimately need help, stop those who try to commit fraud, and bring greater stability and fairness to our financial system."<br /><br />The bipartisan bankruptcy reform legislation restores much-needed principles of personal responsibility to the bankruptcy system.  Bankruptcy should be a last resort for those who need a helping hand, not a haven for crooks, deadbeat fathers, serial filers, opportunistic debtors who buy Florida mansions on the eve of bankruptcy, or high-income debtors who evade bills that they could pay but choose not to.  There is absolutly no reason why responsible, hard-working Americans who live within their means should subsidize bankruptcy fraud and abuse by others.  Balanced, common-sense bankrupty reform is not going to prevent honest, unfortunate debtors from getting the fresh start they need and deserve, but it will make it tougher for those who game the system to evade their financial responsibilities and stick the rest of us with the bill.<br />  <br /> <br /><em>Todd J.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.yale.edu/outside/html/faculty/wmr3/profile.htm">W. Michael Reisman</a>, McDougal Professor of International Law at Yale Law School, says that the current debate over expansion of the UN Security Council is not as critical as many diplomats and activists make it out to be... <hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/wmichaelreisman.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=1></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>B</strong></font>ureaucrats "securitize" matters they want to expedite by pretending that a failure to move on them will somehow threaten national security. In parallel fashion, governments that want to change the UN "crisis-ize" their particular concerns by prophesying that a failure to accommodate them will bring down the Organization. At times, there are so many "crises" afoot that Turtle Bay swarms with Chicken Littles, each rushing about clucking its own message of doom. Most of these "crises" enjoy a brief moment in the media and a slightly longer run in the scholarly literature, but for all practical purposes they are ignored. To date, the sky has not fallen.<br /><br />The current agitation for expansion of the Security Council under one of the two plans of the High Level Panel is another of those ephemeral "crises." Once again, nothing will be done -- and the sky will not fall.<br /><br />The real crisis posed to the UN, the one which prompted the Secretary General to establish the High Level Panel, was American insistence, after 9/11, on an expanded right to use military force unilaterally. The UN Charter prohibits states from using force, with one exception: actions in self-defense may be undertaken without prior Council approval, but, the Charter specifies, only in case of an "armed attack." The US, concluding that the only defense against Jihadist modes of warfare was ongoing offense, announced that henceforth it would defend itself "preemptively." This put the UN on a collision course with a Great Power, something which the veto privilege was designed to avert, but in this instance could not. After stating that there was no need to amend the Charter, the High Level Panel then reinterpreted it to find, mirabile dictu, that "armed attack" included "imminent attack." This largely met America's concern and obviated a real crisis for the Organization.<br /><br />Because the United Nations is a heterogeneous constituency in which different states and groups of states have their own issues, an initiative like this has to be bundled into a package with something for everyone else's particular crisis. So the High Level Panel had recommendations, among others, for all forms of development assistance, which is the Third World's concern; for human rights reform, which is civil society's concern; and for changes in the Security Council, which is supposedly the General Assembly's concern.<br /> <br />None of the Panel's recommendations was surprising. On development assistance, the recommendation was . . .  more. On human rights, which seeks to control what governments do to their citizens, the recommendation was to replace the Human Rights Commission, to which the General Assembly has repeatedly elected notorious human rights violators, with a different kind of commission . . .  selected by the General Assembly. (Not that any of it will make much difference for human rights protection; after the conclusion of the Covenants and the other human rights treaties, for which the UN was indispensable, the action has shifted to non-governmental organizations.) As for the Security Council, the recommendation was to add enough seats to take care of the states that really want to become permanent members.<br /><br />Curiously, there wasn't much in the cornucopia for the General Assembly, the body with the largest number of member-states. Unlike the 1963 Charter amendment, the alternative plans to expand the Security Council (the members of the Panel could not agree on one or the other) do not respond to General Assembly demands and will not empower that body. Now the 1963 amendment  could have. It had increased the two-year, non-permanent berths on the Council from six to ten. This could have created a "non-aligned veto," if all the non-permanent members, who are elected by the General Assembly, had established a consultation procedure with the Assembly membership and collectively acted as its proxy in critical Council matters. They did not.<br /> <br />The vast majority of General Assembly members have neither  expectation nor aspiration of ever winning a place on the Council. The High Level Panel's expansion proposals are of concern to a fraction of the UN membership, states that want to be on the Council because they covet the power and prestige that a permanent seat would give. Some of the aspirants for new permanent seats can validly point to their contribution to the UN as amply fulfilling the criteria spelled out in the Charter, for whatever those arguments are worth. Others claim to be "representatives" of their regions; there is no indication that their "co-regionists" share this perception or that the aspirants themselves would use the power they seek for "regional" purposes (whatever that means). The truth is the aspirants want the power for themselves. This is stated baldly, not to be invidious, but to underline the fact that expansion of the Council, whether under High Level Panel Plan A or B, would have no effect on the Assembly's historic concerns: the legitimacy of the Council and the veto power of its Permanent Members.<br /><br />Amendment of the Charter requires the support of all five Permanent Members. While there is no evidence that any Permanent Member is especially enthusiastic about this amendment, it is all but certain that at least one member will not support it. With an arithmetical formula of 190-1= 0, that means that neither Plan A nor B is going to succeed.<br /><br />Because terrible things are supposed to happen if the Council is not expanded, it is important to keep in mind how tiny the interest group agitating for expansion is. The failure to respond to their "crisis" will be a great disappointment to them but not a crisis for the Organization. Indeed, it will leave things better off. The United Nations has its problems, but a bigger Security Council, far from solving them, will only reduce the Council's effectiveness. Whether it is designing buildings or executive committees, Mies put it best: "less is more."  <br /> <br /><em>W.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/alumni/newsletter/2003/april/oconnell.html">Mary Ellen O'Connell</a> of Moritz College of Law, Ohio State University, says that when it comes to fighting terrorism, the experienced British, newly challenged in the recent London bombings, have the right idea... <hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/oconnellnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=1></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he British have shown extraordinary resilience in the face of the London Transport bombings.  They are determined not to let terrorists disrupt their way of life.  They are "getting on with it."  No one is proclaiming that "Everything changed on 7/7."  And no one is declaring war.[<a href="#1">1</a>] <br /><br />The British know from their long, hard experience with IRA and related terrorists, that to declare war on terrorism is to hand terrorists a victory.  To call opponents "combatants" and declare war against them elevates their status above the mere criminals they are.  The IRA used hunger strikes to try to pressure the British into recognizing them as combatants.  They wanted the psychological boost that would come with being at war with the United Kingdom.  According to Professor Christopher Greenwood of the London School of Economics, however,<blockquote>[i]n the language of international law there is no basis for speaking of a war on Al-Qaeda or any other terrorist group, for such a group cannot be a belligerent, it is merely a band of criminals, and to treat it as anything else risks distorting the law while giving that group a status which to some implies a degree of legitimacy.[<a href="#2">2</a>]</blockquote>Under international law, to become a belligerent or a combatant is to take direct part in armed conflict.  Armed conflict exists when organized armed groups engage each other in significant armed hostilities.[<a href="#3">3</a>]   The intermittent nature of terrorist attacks means that they will not generally, by themselves, amount to armed conflict:  "'International terrorism implies the intermittent use or threat of force against person(s) to obtain certain political objectives of international relevance from a third party.'  &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;[T]he intermittent factor, which is a hallmark of terrorism, excludes it from constituting war per se.  But &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;, terrorist tactics may be adopted in war for the purpose of guerilla warfare."[<a href="#4">4</a>]   The British have long held that "It is the understanding of the United Kingdom that the term &#39;armed conflict&#39; of itself and in its context denotes a situation of a kind which is not constituted by the commission of ordinary crimes including acts of terrorism whether concerted or in isolation."[<a href="#5">5</a>] <br /><br />The British position was also America's position until September 11.  American presidents for decades stood against equating terrorism with armed conflict.[<a href="#6">6</a>]   Yet on September 12, President Bush declared a global war on terrorism.  It soon became clear why the Administration reversed course.  It had nothing to do with any change in the nature of terrorism.  It had to do with trying to find a way around the applicable law. <br /><br />Apparently, the Administration was interested in a legal strategy that would allow it to avoid the burdens of American criminal law applicable in peacetime.[<a href="#7">7</a>]   In wartime, in contrast to peace, lawful combatants may kill other combatants on the battlefield without warning.  Captured combatants may be held without trial until the end of hostilities.  The law of war, however, has burdens, too.  Detainees have extensive protections&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;including the right to be registered and visited by the International Committee of the Red Cross, the right to be free of coercive interrogation, and the right to be free of inhumane treatment of any kind.  <br /><br />Rather than acknowledge those protections and comply with them, Administration lawyers fabricated a new combatant category called "enemy" combatant.  They assert that individuals in this category have no legal protections under the law of war and that the law of peace is not applicable in wartime. We now have extensive evidence that after the Administration created this imagined category, George Tenet, Donald Rumsfeld, and others began authorizing the torture, coercion, and abuse of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and at other undisclosed locations.  Dismissing wartime protections in the global war influenced the flouting of protections in the real wars of Afghanistan and Iraq.<br /><br />Governments, international organizations, human rights organizations, scholars and judges have all challenged the claims to wartime rights in the absence of armed conflict.  The President, his advisor Karl Rove, and others in the Administration have felt pressed recently to justify their policy.[<a href="#8">8</a>]   Administration lawyers are out arguing that the global war is a real war.  They cite the series of intermittent attacks on the United States by al Qaeda between 1993 and 2001.[<a href="#9">9</a>]   These officials, however, confuse armed attack with armed conflict.  Yes, the United States was attacked, but until it counter-attacked in Afghanistan, until it engaged in significant armed hostilities, there was no armed conflict; there was no war.  The U.S. counter-attacked for September 11 on October 7 and then it was not against "terrorism," but against Afghanistan.  The armed conflict in Afghanistan triggered the law of war&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;the rights to kill and capture and the duty to protect those in custody. The war in Afghanistan created combatants in Afghanistan; Afghanistan was the war zone, not the world over.  <br /><br />The consequences of adopting policies that cannot be justified in law have been dire for the Untied States.  The U.S. prisons at Guantanamo Bay (Cuba), Bagram Air Base (Afghanistan), and Abu Ghraib (Iraq) have become powerful symbols of American lawlessness.  They are now used to recruit America's enemies.  Here, again, we could have learned from the British experience in Northern Ireland.  If you deny basic human rights to your opponents, you not only commit a grave moral and legal offense, you create in your opponents a greater will to fight.  The British abuses against prisoners at its infamous Maze Prison were the best recruiting tool the IRA had.  When the abuses ended, following a decision of the European Court of Human Rights, recruitment tailed off too.[<a href="#10">10</a>]    <br /><br />Despite the evidence of how the global war policy is failing, the President persists with it.  Even while he was trying to contain the growing call to close Guantanamo Bay, President Bush sought to use the war on terror to bolster declining American support for the war in Iraq.  In a speech to soldiers at Fort Bragg, North Carolina in June 2005, the President said the war in Iraq was part of the war on terror.  He implied the fighting there was about fighting Osama bin Laden.  To make his case, President Bush did the extraordinary thing of citing Osama bin Laden for authority.  Not only did he point to bin Laden's belief in a global war, the President actually used bin Laden's term that the U.S. was now engaged in a "third world war."[<a href="#11">11</a>]   The President took the position that a band of criminals was able to launch World War III.  <br /><br />By dramatic contrast, Prime Minister Blair would not give the terrorists the benefit of a platform on July 7.  He stated briefly the facts of the attacks and went on about his business refusing to allow the bombers the satisfaction of knowing they had disrupted British life much at all&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;let alone engaged the British in an armed conflict, much less a "world war."[<a href="#12">12</a>]  <br /><br />The U.S. needs to start following
this example.  It is time to drop the war on terror rhetoric, and it is time to get the country into compliance with international and U.S. law.  We need to be able to defend our positions based on generally accepted legal principles, not the esoteric views of lawyers who advised the Administration on the global war policy.   The most important thing that needs to be done is the appointment of an independent special prosecutor to investigate Administration officials responsible for detainee policy.[<a href="#13">13</a>]  While there have been at least twelve major investigations into detainee abuse, no investigation has been conducted by an independent prosecutor with subpoena power into the actions of civilian officials.  The special prosecutor needs to be someone who understands and respects international law.  <br /><br />The British take international law seriously&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;certainly on the question of terrorism.  They know that international law tracks common sense, experience, and moral principle.  We should follow their lead and make stark the difference between us and terrorist criminals.<br /><br />------------------<br /><br /><font SIZE=2 style='font-size: 8pt'>Notes<br /><br /><a name=1>1</a>.

So, too, does the Right&#39;s demand for a conservative.  The Founding Fathers wanted a federal judiciary independent of these sorts of political calculations.  As they put it in <em>The Federalist Papers</em>, &quot;The complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly essential in a limited Constitution.&quot;<br /><br />Although John Adams was serving as the American ambassador to England during the time the Constitution was being written, perhaps no one played a more influential role in the creation of an independent judiciary in the United States than he did.  Adams first wrote about the importance of judicial independence in 1773 in a series of letters published in the Boston press between himself and William Brattle.<br />  <br />Brattle, a Tory, argued that payment of judicial salaries by the Crown should not concern the people of Massachusetts Bay, given that the judges of the Superior Court enjoyed tenure during good behavior. <br /> <br />Adams, after conducting an extensive historical review of the subject, countered by stating that Brattle was wrong to suggest that judges in England, let alone in the colonies, held their offices during good behavior.  As a result, the proposed control by the Crown over judicial salaries was perceived by many in the colony as a grave threat to the independence of the Massachusetts judiciary.<br /><br />Adams revisited the matter of an independent judiciary in his celebrated 1776 pamphlet <em>Thoughts on Government</em>.  The pamphlet--a clarion call for the separation of powers written in response to Thomas Paine&#39;s recommendation in <em>Common Sense</em> that all government power be vested in a unicameral legislature--was influential in a number of state constitutional conventions in addition to that of Massachusetts, including those in New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, and Virginia.<br />  <br />Adams maintained that the pamphlet was inspired by a number of the great liberal political theorists of his day, specifically by Harrington, Sydney, Hobbes, Nedham, and Locke (no mention was made of Montesquieu).<br /><br />Adams explained in no uncertain terms in <em>Thoughts on Government</em> how important an independent judiciary was to any form of government dedicated to the preservation of liberty.  He wrote:  &quot;The dignity and stability of government in all its branches, the morals of the people, and every blessing of society depend so much upon an upright and skillful administration of justice, that the judicial power ought to be distinct from both the legislative and executive, and independent upon both, that so it may be a check upon both, as both should be checks upon that.&quot;  He recommended that judges be &quot;nominated and appointed by the governor, with the advice and consent of council.&quot;<br /><br />Adams believed not merely in making the judiciary a separate branch of government, but also in judicial tenure during good behavior and stable compensation:  &quot;[T]hey should hold estates for life in their offices; or, in other words, their commissions should be during good behavior, and their salaries ascertained and established by law.&quot;  Judges who misused their offices should be impeached by the &quot;house of representatives . . . before the governor and council&quot; and, &quot;if convicted, should be removed.&quot;<br /><br />A decade later, the Framers of the Federal Constitution incorporated Adams&#39;s recommendations into the nation&#39;s current organic law.  Indeed, efforts to modify the essence of Adams&#39;s plan--the judiciary as a separate institution of government, life tenure for judges during good behavior, and secure compensation--were rejected on the grounds of judicial independence.<br /><br />For example, John Dickinson attempted to include &quot;address&quot; as a means of removing federal judges.  He moved to place after the good behavior clause language that federal judges &quot;may be removed by the Executive on the application by the Senate and House of Representatives.&quot;  The motion was resoundingly defeated.  Gouverneur Morris called the proposal a &quot;contradiction in terms,&quot; because it would have subjected judges otherwise serving during good behavior to removal without trial.<br /> <br />James Wilson complained that under Dickinson&#39;s proposal &quot;Judges would be in a bad situation if made to depend on every gust of faction which might prevail in the two branches of our Govt.&quot;  Edmund Randolph opposed it &quot;as weakening too much the independence of Judges.&quot;  In fact, the need for an independent judiciary was so widely accepted by the Framers of the Federal Constitution that even Dickinson insisted that &quot;the Legislative, Executive &amp; Judiciary departments ought to be made as independent as possible.&quot;<br /><br />The recent Fourth of July celebrations reminded the nation how much the Founding Fathers could teach us about courage and the love of liberty. President Bush should heed the advice of one of the most influential Founders of all, John Adams, the second president of the United States, and appoint a replacement for Justice O&#39;Connor who is &quot;independent&quot; in the best sense of that word.  The Left and Right might not like it, but the nation would be better for it.<br /><br /> <br /><em>Scott D. Gerber is a law professor at Ohio Northern University.

		<title>Getting on With It: Pragmatism at Guantanamo</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/faculty/profiles/jonesd.php">Darryll Jones</a>, former criminal trial attorney for the US Army Judge Advocate General and now a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, says that the recent ruling of the US DC Circuit Court of Appeals on the validity of military commissions is not so much a victory or defeat for the friends or foes of military terror trials as it is a warning to simply get on with the necessary process of adjudication... <hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/darjonesnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=1></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he long-awaited decision in <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em> constitutes neither a victory for the government nor a defeat for detainees.  It is merely another preliminary and ultimately meaningless skirmish &#8212; at least from the standpoint of the objective observers &#8212; in a battle the genesis of which is fast fading.  It&#39;s like one of the incessant shoot-outs between the Hatfields and McCoys.  The two sides seemed to have lost sight of the original reason for the fight and instead have grown so accustomed to their skirmishes that they would rather keep fighting than admit to any common understanding that might eventually settle the dispute one way or another.  All the while they seem oblivious to the fact that their separate, mutually exclusive interests are being equally sacrificed.<br />  <br />The government wants a clean, neat and decidedly non-transparent way to handle the people it refers to as &quot;unlawful combatants.&quot;  &quot;Trust us,&quot; it says.  The civil libertarians, on the other hand, want to prove that the Bush administration's bloodlust means that it is willing to sacrifice the very principles that make the terrorist want to kill us all.  They want a transparent but very messy procedure.  &quot;Don't trust those who say they want to protect you!&quot; they say.  <br /><br />The D.C. Circuit's opinion demurs on both arguments, thankfully preferring a pragmatic approach devoid of left- or right-leaning political philosophy.  Reasonable people might disagree about the Court's essential holding that the government may try detainees under the present military commission rules.  But it is hard to deny the pragmatic, "best we can do" attitude underlying the Court's opinion.  The Court never really tells us whether the government or the civil libertarians are right.  It definitively states only two things:  there is a war going on and suspected war criminals should have their day in court.  <br /><br />Common ground, that.  Neither side can disagree with those two conclusions.  After the detainees have their day in court, the federal civilian judiciary can exercise its constitutional authority in review.   The sides disagree on the civilian judiciary's role but that disagreement need not delay the detainees day in court.  The Court's simple pragmatism will go a long way towards fair process even if the process is not entirely fair right now.  A pragmatic approach may not yet be the most perfect solution, but it is far superior to the present state of affairs where essentially nothing is happening.  How fair can that be?<br /><br />Guantanamo, as everybody knows, has become nothing less than a shameful embarrassment not because the world audience appreciates the jurisprudential niceties separating the two sides, but because of the incessant delays.  As long as the Gitmo courtroom remains empty and silent, it serves only as precedent, legitimate or illegitimate, for future governments who want to throw people away under the banner of national security.  Imagine even a guilty U.S. citizen being branded an "unlawful combatant" and then confined by a foreign government for four years without any process or hint thereof.  Indeed, some 600 detainees sit around, probably even hoping for their turn at interrogation because by this time interrogation has to be preferable to anything else.  Interrogation, at least, provides the opportunity for mental jousting.  The best way to prove that a superior unchecked foe is unjust, incidentally, is by total submission to that foe's power.  Unchecked, unlimited power invariably proves its own injustice.  <br /><br />The detainees' submission may be involuntary, of course, but it has the same effect.  The government's heretofore unchecked power to hold 600 human beings incommunicado, all the while arguing about its obligation to submit its decisions to the test of judicial inquiry, has proven the injustice.  The government should eschew the unchecked power implicit in its legal arguments.  Civil libertarians, on the other hand, have no qualms about assisting the government in shooting itself in the foot.  While detainees sit, assigned defense counsel and their amicus allies wax indignantly about the government's failure to grant complete privacy to defense lawyers so accustomed to such luxuries in cases ranging from shoplifting to serial murder.   They can't seem to fathom that cases involving genocide and indiscriminate suicidal killing of "infidels" (i.e., any man or woman who happens to believe differently, their children and their babies, and anybody else who happens to be standing around) might just require the compromise of luxuries that are so commonplace in peace that they are somehow viewed as indispensable in war.  In fact, the judicial review argument can wait and it would have cost the parties nothing to have indulged a temporary compromise four years ago.<br />  <br />One reason why the detainees have sat around for so long &#8212; living witnesses to the cause of jihad &#8212; is that the government and the defenders have been arguing about mostly theoretical possibilities. The government has insisted that the detainees are not entitled to the protections of the Third Geneva Convention, even though proving that point would have required only the most minimal of "probable cause" type hearing; one that would only have required a finding that the detainees sought to pose as civilians in their holy war.  That's it.  It is a hardly even a theoretical possibility that the Third Geneva Convention would apply given what we know about the nature of terrorist warfare and yet the Government relied on filibuster for so long.  The Government could have successfully resolved this point a long time ago.  And while any defense counsel could easily and legitimately concede the argument without being subjected to an ineffective assistance claim (if, indeed, that standard even applied in this context), assigned defense counsel have instead decided to press theoretical point on principle, thereby delaying a consideration of each detainees' substantive defense for the four years it has taken the D.C. Court to tell us to get on with it and know that the federal civilian judiciary will be watching and prepared to perform the oversight role assigned by the Constitution.  <br /><br />The D.C. Court of Appeals said this, basically:  "Maybe the detainees are entitled to a finding that the Geneva Convention applies, maybe not.  Let's just allow the military commission, with whatever flaws they may possess, to decide as a preliminary matter whether the Convention applies and then proceed to trial accordingly.  Once the commissions render a judgment, we will then have a concrete procedure and outcome to review, and review we will."  That preliminary matter, by the way, should take maybe one day at the most, right?  So after four years of detention &#8212; not good for either side, actually &#8212; we are pretty much back to the point we should have long since passed.  The detainees still sit, the world still watches, and the Geneva Convention question has finally been called, though the answer is hardly in doubt even to those who staunchly oppose the government's policies.   Implicit in the D.C. Court's opinion is an admonition, with which I agree, tha
t we get on with it.  Both sides should stop shooting blanks and get on with it already.<br /><br /> <br /><em>Darryll Jones is a professor of law at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law and a former criminal trial attorney for the US Army Judge Advocate General.

		<title>Why the International Criminal Court Needs Darfur (More Than Darfur Needs the ICC)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/faculty/profiles/baylise.php">Elena Baylis</a> of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law says that while Darfur may be a dream case for the International Criminal Court, the value of the International Criminal Court for Darfur is yet to be seen... <hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/baylis.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=1></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>O</strong></font>n March 31, 2005, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1593, referring the ongoing conflict in Darfur to the International Criminal Court.  This referral represents a watershed moment for the new court, and for the Security Council and the United States in their relationships to it.  What, if anything, it will mean for the people of Darfur is less certain. <br /><br />In many ways, Darfur is the International Criminal Court's dream case.  At the most fundamental level, it fulfills the court's core purpose: to redress widespread atrocities when governments cannot or will not do so.  The court also has a strong mandate for action in the international outcry against Darfur's horrors and against the impunity of its perpetrators.  This mandate is crucial for a controversial and as yet untested court that needs desperately to prove its legitimacy.  Under the spotlight of world attention, the ICC's success or failure in handling this case may well determine its future credibility as a mechanism for accountability.<br /><br />Darfur is also a perfect fit for the International Criminal Court's jurisdiction, which is strictly limited by the terms of its Rome Statute. The ICC has jurisdiction over only the most serious and well-recognized international crimes: genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. The systematic attacks on defenseless villages that have occurred in Darfur are classic examples of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and, depending on the intent of the attackers, may constitute genocide as well. <br /><br />All the key events in Darfur are also within the ICC's limited temporal jurisdiction, which began only with the entry into force of the Rome Statute on July 1, 2002.  Whereas many world conflicts have been ongoing for years, so that the ICC could exercise jurisdiction over only a small and likely unrepresentative sliver of those conflicts, the widespread violence in Darfur began only in 2003.<br /><br />Finally, the ICC has jurisdiction over individual defendants only on the basis of the two most well-established principles for jurisdiction, territoriality and nationality, or if the Security Council refers a situation to the court.  Although Sudan (the state on whose territory the attacks occurred and the state of nationality of most potential defendants) is not a party to the Rome Statute and has not accepted the ICC's exercise of jurisdiction, the Security Council's resolution confers jurisdiction on the court in this case.  <br /><br />In addition to the nearly ideal match between the events in Darfur and the ICC's mandate and jurisdiction, this case is also important to the ICC because it is the Security Council's first referral to the new court.  As such, it represents for the ICC a welcome affirmation of its legitimacy.   The proper relationship between the Security Council and the ICC was hotly debated during the drafting of the Rome Statute, and the question of how these two bodies will balance the sometimes conflicting goals of international peace, security and accountability remains an open one. <br /><br />But the Security Council resolution represents a critical juncture not just for the ICC, but also for the Council and for the United States.  The U.S. government has long criticized the ICC's Statute for permitting the Prosecutor to bring charges against citizens of states that are not parties to the treaty, and as failing to safeguard sufficiently against politically motivated prosecutions generally.  Expressing particular concern about the risk of prosecution of Americans serving in peacekeeping operations, the United States has sought Article 98 agreements from other states to shield its citizens from ICC jurisdiction.  <br /><br />In this referral, the U.S. government's opposition to the ICC as an institution came into direct conflict with its interest in justice for the victims in Darfur.  Crucially, the Security Council acceded to U.S. concerns in Resolution 1593 by excluding the citizens of non-state parties who contribute to Security Council or African Union operations in Sudan from the ICC referral, unless the state itself consents to that jurisdiction (with the exception, of course, of citizens of Sudan, also a non-state party).  With this concession, and with the failure of its own effort to garner support for an ad hoc tribunal, the U.S. acquiesced in the referral, abstaining from the 11-0 vote on the resolution and refraining from exercising its veto power to thwart it.<br /><br />Predictably, both proponents and opponents of the ICC have characterized the text of the Darfur resolution as supporting their positions.  Supporters of the ICC have described it as demonstrating the court's authority and the international community's commitment to ending impunity, while the United States has asserted that the included exemption for non-parties is precedent-setting acknowledgment of the validity of U.S. concerns that should be followed in future cases. <br /><br />But while this referral may be crucial for the ICC, the Security Council, and the United States, what will it mean for the people of Darfur?  While in some senses this is the ideal case for the ICC, in others it represents an enormous challenge to the institution and to its goal of justice for the victims of atrocities.   <br /><br />In particular, Sudan's opposition to the ICC's involvement represents both practical and fundamental obstacles for the court.  On a practical level, no international tribunal can operate without a state's cooperation in turning over defendants and evidence and permitting investigation.  If Sudan shields its citizens from the ICC, the court will be hard pressed to proceed against them.  <br /><br />On a more fundamental level, criminal proceedings in international tribunals have often failed to meet victims' expectations of justice.  The ad hoc tribunals for Rwanda and Yugoslavia have been criticized as too distant, too slow, and as both limited and biased in their selection of defendants.  These prosecutions, it has been argued, have removed the most senior defendants from the local courts where they might have been tried in accordance with local standards and within view of the local population, and where they would have been subject to the death penalty if convicted, as their subordinates have been.  The ICC will undoubtedly encounter similar concerns.<br /><br />In addition, some victims would prefer other models of justice to criminal trial and punishment.  In Uganda, where the ICC is investigating the atrocities committed in the government's conflict with the Lord's Resistance Army, the <em>New York Times</em> has reported that some victims oppose ICC involvement.  The reasons offered: fears that prosecutions will prolong the bloodshed, as well as the sense that foreign models of retributive justice will not bring reconciliation to their communities as well as local processes, left to their own devices, could do.<br /><br />Finally, the ICC referral is intended not only to provide after the fact justice in Darfur, but also to deter the militias there through fear of prosecution, and to add to the international pressure on the Sudanese government to intervene to end the conflict.  It remains to be seen whether the court's involvement will contribute to these political goals.  For now, while the Darfur referral is a crucial development for the ICC, and for both its proponents and opponents, it represents only an uncertain opportunity for justic
e in Darfur.<br /><br /><br /> <br /><em>Elena Baylis teaches international and comparative law at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law. She is a graduate of Yale Law School.</em><br />

Having received the case from the UN Security Council, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, will conduct an investigation into the atrocities that have unfolded in this western region of Sudan, claiming countless lives and driving two million people from their homes into hastily arranged, understaffed refugee camps across the border in Chad.  Indeed, he has already begun collecting documentary evidence.  <br /><br />Ocampo&#39;s investigation may lead to the finding that genocide was committed by government-backed Arab militias against the predominately black population, whose villages have been burned to the ground during the last year, and whose death toll was recently estimated by a British House of Commons committee at 300,000.  This notwithstanding an opposite finding in Jnauary 2005 by the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Darfur, which reported to Secretary General Kofi Annan that only war crimes and crimes against humanity had occurred there, not genocide.  The ironies of this evolving legal situation abound.<br /><br />Foremost is the possibility that the ICC might ultimately come to support a legal conclusion drawn by the United States which was rejected by the United Nations, putting the US in an awkward political position.  The US has steadfastly opposed the ICC since its creation in 2002.  Indeed, the Bush Administration has gone so far as to withdraw America&#39;s signature from the Rome Statute that created the court and seek over 90 bilateral immunity agreements with individual countries which protect Americans from the court&#39;s jurisdiction.  The US even hesitated supporting the Security Council resolution that referred the case to the ICC, trying instead to garner support for creation of another <em>ad hoc</em> court based on the Rwanda tribunal model, before finally agreeing to abstain from voting rather than vetoing the measure.<br /><br />But Congress and the Bush Administration have also concluded that the situation in Darfur unequivocally constitutes genocide and must be stopped.  It was at American prodding than the Security Council requested Annan to form and dispatch the UN Commission of Inquiry to Sudan.  While the commission found that the objective elements of genocide had occurred, mass killings of a distinct ethnic or racial group, it failed to find evidence of the subjective element - specific intent on the part of the government or its agents to destroy the group in whole or in part.  The showing required to prove specific intent is more than mere knowledge.  Washington continued to disagree, however, insisting that genocide was evident.<br /><br />The Security Council resolution referring the case to the ICC does not frame the referral in terms of the UN Commission&#39;s findings.  Instead, it simply refers the &quot;situation in Darfur&quot; to the court.  In other words, Ocampo&#39;s inquiry is not specifically limited to investigating war crimes or crimes against humanity.  His inquiry is left free to uncover evidence of genocide independently, even the missing specific intent.  The only country of the fifteen-member Security Council that expressly based its support of the resolution on the Commission&#39;s findings as a limiting feature was Argentina.  Yet another irony, as Ocampo is Argentine.<br /><br />Khartoum predictably rejected this assertion of judicial authority over it.  Sudan, like the US, is not a party to the Rome Statute and has not otherwise availed itself of the ICC&#39;s jurisdiction.  In fact, the government has undertaken its own internal atrocity investigations - widely viewed as a sham.  One element of the Security Council&#39;s resolution particularly ruffling Sudanese feathers is the blanket immunity conferred on other citizens of countries not party to the Rome Statute, such as the US.  Sudan argues that this is a manifestation of ICC&#39;s true purpose:  as yet another tool for repressing poor, developing countries.  The fact that the three cases currently under referral to the Prosecutor are also poor African nations (Congo, Uganda, and the Central African Republic), play into this assertion.<br /><br />The referral also puts Ocampo in a politically precarious position.  He is faced with a chance to appease Washington and tamp down on the hostility directed toward the ICC, but to do so means discrediting the UN Commission.  However, a pre-trial chamber approval mechanism which places the court institutionally behind his investigation may provide necessary political cover from any international backlash.<br /><br />If the ICC Prosecutor determines that genocide has occurred in Darfur, Washington may yet be able to have its policy cake and it eat too - international recognition of genocide in Sudan with continued immunity of Americans from ICC jurisdiction.  And it may, in the end, cast a somewhat more friendly glance in the direction of The Hague, where the ICC is based.  Or was that a wink?<br /><br /><br /> <br /><em>Michael Kelly is Associate Professor of International Law at Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska and author of the forthcoming book </em>Nowhere to Hide: Defeat of the Sovereign Immunity Defense for Crimes of Genocide &amp; the Trials of Slobodan Milosevic and Saddam Hussein<em> (Peter Lang, 2005) -  foreword by Desmond M.

		<title>Meltdown at the Milosevic Trial: A Much Delayed Rush to Judgment</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.nuigalway.ie/human_rights/Staff/william_schabas.html">William Schabas</a> says that the seemingly-interminable trial of Slobodan Milosevic at The Hague is a poor model for international justice, and in the long run may not serve the purpose for which it was undertaken... <hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/schabaslarger.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=1></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he trial of Slobodan Milo&Aring;&iexcl;evi&Auml;&#8225;, now underway in the Hague for more than three years and likely to consume at least another three years before it finally concludes, is held out as the centrepiece of international justice, the proof of its importance and its viability.  It is struggling to live up to its promise.<br /><br />In December 1992, as war raged in Bosnia, United States Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger said that '[l]eaders such as Slobodan Milo&Aring;&iexcl;evi&Auml;&#8225; &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; must eventually explain whether and how they sought to insure, as they must under international law, that their forces complied with international law'.  Eagleburger was referring to appalling  reports of concentration camps where torture and sexual assault were daily occurrences, brought to international attention by journalists like Roy Gutman.<br /><br />The 'naming names' speech was a defining moment in building momentum for the establishment of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.  In February 1993, the Security Council agreed to set up a Tribunal, although it took another year before it was fully operational.<br /><br />But instead of charging Milo&Aring;&iexcl;evi&Auml;&#8225;, the Prosecutor went after small-time war criminals.  The first proceedings were directed against a local thug, Dusko Tadi&Auml;&#8225;, who had been involved in torture, beatings and killings of Croats and Muslims in camps in the Prijedor region of north-western Bosnia.<br /><br />Many thousands just like Tadi&Auml;&#8225; had participated in the conflict.  They could be found on all sides.  None of them had figured in Eagleburger's famous speech that had launched the Tribunal.  But Tadi&Auml;&#8225; was the one who got caught first, and he soon dominated the work of the fledgling Tribunal.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the evil leader who had prompted the whole business, Slobodan Milo&Aring;&iexcl;evi&Auml;&#8225;, was invited to Dayton, Ohio, in late 1995, for peace negotiations.  Milo&Aring;&iexcl;evi&Auml;&#8225; must have been given some assurances he would not be arrested or otherwise troubled while in the United States.  After all, less than three years earlier its Secretary of State had called for his arrest and prosecution.<br /><br />Milo&Aring;&iexcl;evi&Auml;&#8225; remained in office after Dayton.  All was going swimmingly, until the extremists in the self-styled Kosovo Liberation Army tried to break away yet another piece of the old Yugoslavia.  As low-level civil war ensued, the post-Dayton honeymoon came to an end, and the 'international community' renewed its attacks on the Serb leader.<br /><br />Full-blown war erupted in March 1999, with the NATO aerial attack on Serb cities.  The Tribunal's Prosecutor, Louise Arbour, announced the indictment of President Milo&Aring;&iexcl;evi&Auml;&#8225; for crimes against humanity and war crimes (but not genocide) committed in Kosovo, but not Bosnia or Croatia, which had, after all, provided the rationale for setting up the Tribunal in the first place.<br /><br />In the aftermath of the war, Milo&Aring;&iexcl;evi&Auml;&#8225; lost power.  In June 2001, under unbearable financial pressure from the West, Belgrade agreed to hand over Milo&Aring;&iexcl;evi&Auml;&#8225; to the Tribunal and he was duly flown to The Hague.<br /><br />Later in 2001, as preparations were underway for an uncharacteristically speedy beginning of the great trial (many defendants have had to wait years in detention for trials to begin), the Prosecutor issued two new indictments against Milo&Aring;&iexcl;evi&Auml;&#8225;.  One dealt with the war in Croatia, which had taken place in late 1991.  The other concerned Bosnia and Herzegovina, and included a provocative count of genocide to take into account the August 2001 conviction of a Serb general for the Srebrenica massacre.<br /><br />No serious or credible explanation has ever been provided for this troubling delay in indicting Milo&Aring;&iexcl;evi&Auml;&#8225; for such 'stale' war crimes.  The whole saga smells of political manipulation.<br /><br />The trial began in January 2002.  Milo&Aring;&iexcl;evi&Auml;&#8225; insisted upon acting in his own defense, without counsel.  He is a skilled lawyer himself, and has proven that he can do an able job.  Presiding judge Richard May readily accepted that this was his fundamental right.  After all, the Tribunal's Statute, which is modelled on human rights instruments, declares: 'In the determination of any charge against the accused pursuant to the present Statute, the accused shall be entitled to the following minimum guarantees, in full equality&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;'<br /><br />The trial plodded along, punctuated by short suspensions because of Milo&Aring;&iexcl;evi&Auml;&#8225;'s health problems.  He has high blood pressure.  I suppose that if I had been charged with genocide, I would too!<br /><br />As the Prosecution case neared its end, in early 2004, Presiding Judge Richard May announced he was resigned due to ill health.  May was fatally ill, and died within months.<br /><br />Only a year earlier, the Tribunal had changed its rules to allow a trial to continue with a replacement judge, even without the consent of the accused.  In January 2004, weeks before May announced he was leaving, the Tribunal's president had said the new rule could not be used in a long trial, because there would be too much catching up to do for the replacement judge.  But starting the Milo&Aring;&iexcl;evi&Auml;&#8225; trial de novo was a frightening option, and it was decided to appoint a new judge.  He spent a few weeks reviewing the transcripts of a two-year trial, and then declared he was ready to rock and roll.<br /><br />The renewed bench announced it was reconsidering Judge May's earlier decision to allow Milo&Aring;&iexcl;evi&Auml;&#8225; to defend himself.  The defendant's infirmities were causing delays, said the judges, and this argued for an exception to the fundamental right of self-defence set out in the Statute.  They reasoned by analogy.  The right to defend oneself was subject to exceptions, they said, giving as an example the unruly accused.<br /><br />The argument was flawed.  Nobody was claiming Milo&Aring;&iexcl;evi&Auml;&#8225; was misbehaving.  Sure, his cross-examinations were aggressive and his challenges to the judges withering.  But putting ill health on a part with intentional misconduct was, in effect, to discriminate against Milo&Aring;&iexcl;evi&Auml;&#8225; based on disability.  In effect, the judges were saying that the right to defend oneself belonged only to the young and restless, not the aging and infirm.<br /><br />Indeed, whether or not Milo&Aring;&iexcl;evi&Auml;&#8225; defends himself in person or by appointed counsel, he is still entitled to direct the defense and to make the appropriate decisions about trial strategy.  If he is too ill to be present and do this, the trial cannot go on, even with a defense lawyer imposed by the bench.<br /><br />The Trial Chamber's decision to impose counsel was overturned on appeal.  The whole business of forcing counsel on Milo&Aring;&iexcl;evi&Auml;&#8225;, which was intended to accelerate the trial, actually resulted in many months of additional delay.  The judges had shot themselves in the foot.<br /><br />None of this helps the International Tribunal in its historic role of bringing justice to the
Balkans.  Decades from now, Serb nationalists will point to the ugly procedure and argue that the whole business was a frameup.<br /><br />Sixty years ago, Nuremberg delivered justice to Nazi war criminals.  Some critics have decried it as 'victor's justice', but by and large it has stood up to the attacks.  Most important, modern Germany accepts the trial and its lessons.<br /><br />Will the same be said of the Milo&Aring;&iexcl;evi&Auml;&#8225; trial in half a century?  The comparison is a telling one.  If history now gives Nuremberg five stars, will it be as kind to The Hague?<br /><br /> <br /><em>William Schabas is professor of human rights law at the National University of Ireland, Galway, and Director of the Irish Centre for Human Rights.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="mailto:laurent.pech@nuigalway.ie">Dr. Laurent Pech</a>, Jean Monnet Lecturer in European Union Law at the National University of Ireland, Galway, and a native of Aix-en-Provence who returned to France to vote in its referendum on the European Constitution, says that French rejection of the charter was based on several legal and political factors, and presents a range of possible scenarios for France and the future of European integration... <hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/pechlarge.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=1></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>L</strong></font>et&#39;s admit it. We voted &quot;Yes&quot; on Sunday in Aix-en-Provence. Indeed, while French voters nationwide said No to the &quot;Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe&quot; by a  clear majority of 54,87 per cent, Aix-en-Provence voted 54,89 per cent Yes. This &quot;Yes aixois&quot; at least provides some consolation to supporters of the new EU charter.<br /><br />The French &quot;constitutional&quot; debate was definitely impressive in its intensity and length. And it was certainly positive to see the French citizenry inject politics into the European debate over a legal document. On the other hand, referendums have the unfortunate potential of liberating frustrations and fears. And above all, the French No is a patchwork of inconsistent claims: essentially a no to what is called "Anglo-Saxon" Europe and its "neo-liberal" policies, a no to unemployment and social dumping (the "Polish plumber") and finally, a no to Turkey. With ideological absolutism on the left side of the political spectrum and a deeply unpopular government, these ingredients have proven fatal to the proposed European Constitutional Treaty. <br /><br />With the benefit of hindsight, I would argue that the usual portrayal of the text as a "Constitution" may have been the decisive fault of its drafters. Indeed, not only is the term constitution synonymous in the mind of most voters with intangibility, therefore dramatising the debate, it also spectacularly raised expectations. And these expectations could only be disillusioned by the reading of a document of 448 Articles (I do not share the criticism of the alleged excessive length and complexity of the European text, but space precludes further analysis of such constitutional ignorance). As I said in a <a href="/forumy/2005/05/eu-constitution-and-french-referendum.php">previous JURIST op-ed</a>, my reading of the constitutional treaty leads to this modest conclusion: it does not revolutionize the nature of European integration, therefore the complexity of its decision-making process somewhat persists. Yet the European text plainly offers the perspective of more efficiency, more transparency and a satisfying improvement of the Union's democratic pedigree. <br /><br />With only modest visible improvements brought by the European Constitution and no alteration to the <em>sui generis</em> nature of the European Union, any defence of the text was a delicate challenge from the start. The original and therefore relatively complex development of European integration made it very simple for deceitful politicians to raise fallacious arguments. While the extreme-right's obsession about the prospect of Turkish adhesion to the EU did not constitute a surprise &#8212; one may then wonder why European leaders did not assume that opening accession negotiations with Turkey the year the Constitution had to be ratified would not help the constitutional debate &#8212; the linking of the European Constitution with widespread fears of "social dumping" and outsourcing was somewhat unanticipated. Such allegation has found deep resonance with left-wing voters. It was however unsurprising considering that the "social dumping" accusation had been popularised for years by an influential association of "alterglobalists" (ATTAC) in its fights against the World Trade Organisation. And it was certainly the most destructive claim raised against the European Constitution. <br /><br />While I do not claim any particular expertise to evaluate the effects of globalisation, I can affirm without a doubt that the Constitution, in itself, is neither neo-liberal nor socialist: it remains a framework embodying all European values. It is therefore left to the Member States to subsequently define sound public policies. To single out a particularly foolish dispute, the reference to a "social market economy" at Article I-3(3) revealed deep and embarrassing ignorance. Some non-Weberian "experts" went as far as to compare the European Constitution to the capitalistic component of the USSR Constitution. It was alleged that these two texts are the only examples of constitutions embodying the economic principle upon which the society is organised and some would add, condemned. <br /><br />It is difficult to know where to begin with this kind of statement. First of all, is there an effective alternative to a market economy, a North Korean or a Cuban type of socialism perhaps? More fundamentally, the dishonesty of the argument becomes apparent once Article I-3(3) is read in its entirety:<blockquote>The Union shall work for the sustainable development of Europe based on [emphasis added] balanced economic growth and price stability, a highly competitive social market economy, aiming at [emphasis added] full employment and social progress, and a high level of protection and improvement of the quality of the environment. (&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;) It shall combat social exclusion and discrimination, and shall promote social justice and protection, equality between women and men, solidarity between generations and protection of the rights of the child. (&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;) It shall respect its rich cultural and linguistic diversity, and shall ensure that Europe's cultural heritage is safeguarded and enhanced.</blockquote>Does it require a high degree of intelligence to understand that the market economy is actually a means to fulfil social goals which happen to be downright innovative ones? Incidentally, one may ask: with no historical precedent in the constitutional texts of democratic societies, should the reference to "social progress" or "social exclusion" also to be found illegitimate? <br /><br />The self-proclaimed "progressives" are mysteriously selective in their reading of the Constitution. If they undertook in good faith a genuine reading of the document they might well discover among the "provisions of general application" (Articles III-115 to III-122), the unprecedented affirmation which defines and implements the entire set of policies and actions referred to in the Constitution, "the Union shall take into account requirements linked to the promotion of a high level of employment, the guarantee of adequate social protection, the fight against social exclusion, and a high level of education, training and protection of human health" (Article III-117).<br /><br />No, really, the discussion on the insufficiencies of "social Europe" was simply either a joke or a zealous act of dishonesty. <br /><br />During less confusing times, the use of these two adjectives had been reserved to describe the &quot;views&quot; of rightist Jean-Marie Le Pen. They can now easily serve to characterise Laurent Fabius' views on the European Constitution. Thanks to the Machiavellian former Prime Minister, implicit xenophobia towards Eastern Europeans (I refer to the popular, albeit nauseating, metaphor about the "Polish plumber") has gained the hearts and minds of left-wing voters. So much for workers' solidarity&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; <br /><br />More fundamentally, it may be argued that the French No vote is the ultimate fruit of a degenerate politico-administrative elite, which simply cannot escape from its roots of intellectual constraints in a bureaucratic model of economic growth (read stagnation) and social organisation (read bankrupted model). With the end of the
Cold War and subsequently, the EU&#39;s enlargement to 25 Member States, it would have been necessary to explain the rationale and the continuing benefits of European integration. Unfortunately, the European Community has been constantly used as a convenient fig leaf to hide national incompetence in tackling national issues. Instead of offering long-term vision and well-thought compromises to its European partners in order to effectively pursue well-defined goals, the Presidency of Jacques Chirac has simply been an exercise of shifting blame and escaping accountability. <br /><br />What's next? <br /><br />The No-camp has deluded itself with the perspective of "lendemains qui chantent". Widely presented as the triumph of "Anglo-Saxon" views, i.e., a minimalist vision of European integration with an absolutist emphasis on free trade and market mechanisms, there remains hope for a more "social" and "political" constitutional text to  be renegotiated.  <br /><br />From a legal perspective, the rules governing the entry into force of the Constitution are clear-cut: unanimous ratification is required. No matter how practically absurd in a Union of 25 Member States, such unanimity is actually the clearest indication that the Member States retain the entirety of the &quot;pouvoir constituant.&quot; In other words, it does not give life to a new sovereign power following a European-wide referendum of self-determination and will not lead to the materialization of a "superstate", an unhealthy fixation in some quarters&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; In any case, without unanimous ratification within two years (before November 1, 2006), the Constitution cannot enter into force. Apprehensive of future hurdles, the Member States did, however, give themselves some political latitude by agreeing (in a Declaration appended to the Constitution) to review the situation where hypothetically four fifths of the Member States have ratified the Constitution, but one or more have "encountered difficulties" in doing so. Yet, according to many officials, there is no Plan B if the Constitution falls victim of a French "Non" vote. Is that so?<br /><br />In reality, a few potential scenarios can be anticipated. <br /><br />The first is a simple one. The French No vote associated with a high turnout (especially if reinforced by a Dutch No) is likely to see the constitutional project condemned to the dustbin of history. No attempt will be made to hold a second referendum, as was the case with the Maastricht Treaty in Denmark or the Nice Treaty in Ireland. As a result, the status quo remains, meaning the deficient Treaty of Nice keeps governing the newly enlarged and, at this point ungovernable, European Union. And if some Member States are willing to further European integration, they may rely upon the provisions governing "enhanced cooperation" (Article 43 TEU). The conditions attached to the implementation of such cooperation being so cumbersome, it is unrealistic to expect such an outcome. A more realistic one is to see a lethargic EU trying pathetically to cope with the challenges of a globalized world.<br /><br />A second scenario could see four-fifths of the Member States being governed by the Constitution. Their relationship with the Member States who did not ratify the Constitution will be governed by the current rules. Such a scenario, however lawful under international public law and in particular the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, remains highly unrealistic as Member States would find it extremely impractical to work under differing rules of voting arithmetic or institutional composition. <br /><br />While the "Russian dolls" scenario (a core Europe being governed by the Constitution while the current treaties are still maintained in force) is doubtful on pragmatic grounds, the history of past negotiations also tells us something about "opt-in" and "opt-out" protocols. Such devices were brought into play when the United Kingdom expressed its opposition to some of the EC Treaty's social provisions. Ireland also benefited from an opt-out clause, in association with the United Kingdom, regarding immigration matters and judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters. Concretely speaking, specific provisions of the EC Treaty were thus limited in their geographical scope. <br /><br />To draw on this parallel, would it be feasible to conclude a separate protocol with France and hold a second referendum? Such a scenario worked in the cases of Denmark and Ireland, however, it is unlikely in the present case. It would be necessary to determine from what constitutional obligations France should be exempted: from the neo-liberal aspects of the text, perhaps? This is an indefinite allegation bearing no direct link with the Constitution&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; As an additional obstacle, France would need to convince its partners of the legitimacy of an opt-out protocol. In any case, there may little appetite for political suicide in France, and knowing the French psyche, a second referendum might actually make things worse. What if indeed a second No vote complicates an already intricate situation?<br /><br />The last major potential scenario, the most revolutionary and thus the most implausible, would be France's withdrawal from the EU. The current treaties, however, are said to have been concluded for an unlimited period (Art. 51 TEU and Art. 312 TEC) and they do not provide for any right to withdraw. Whilst the EU Constitution expressly states &#8212; for the first time &#8212; the existence of such right (Art. I-60), such a rule cannot be relied upon before ratifying the Constitution. Yet no one doubts, no matter these legal niceties, that a Member State with the clear will to withdraw could unilaterally do so as the ultimate foundation of European integration is to be found in the Constitution of each Member State. A contrario, no Member State could be legally compelled by its peers to withdraw from the Union following a refusal to ratify a treaty. <br /><br />Ultimately, in the short run, the status quo is the most probable short-term scenario with the potentiality of a "soft" constitutionalisation of the current treaties through the back door. The Constitution represents indeed a respectable compromise and a necessary improvement. Any requiem for it may be too difficult to accept. As a result, it would not be surprising (nor legally too troublesome) to see some provisions of the Constitution being inserted into the current Treaties or applied outside the EU framework. And who knows, it could not entirely be excluded that a newly elected French President may decide to hold a second referendum in 2007.<br /><br />Some wishful thinkers have argued a French No vote will open a "salutary crisis", leading to a more "social" and "federalist" Europe. Whilst it could be rightly argued that the European Union has for too long suffered from ambiguity regarding its final destination &#8212; an ambiguity inexorably leading to a complex institutional architecture and an uncertain legitimacy &#8212; a French No vote (rather than a British No) is more likely to lead to a persistent and imperfect status quo, and one deeply prejudicial to the French reverie of an "Europe puissance". <br /><br />The irony of all this is that French voters may realise too late that for all its imperfections, the European Constitution offered the hope of political leadership at a level where the social impact of globalisation could be effectively managed. And for those keen on mechanically emphasizing the cardinal value of national sovereignty, they may come to realise that &#8212; apart from dealings with the American hegemon &#8212; national sovereignty can best be protected by giving some it up locally with the hope of gaining it at the level of the European continent. <br /><br /><br /> <br /><em>Dr. Laurent Pech is Jean Monnet Lecturer in European Union Law at the National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland and a native of Aix-en-Provence, France who voted in the French EU constitution referendum.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.uchastings.edu/?pid=722">Marsha N. Cohen</a>, Professor of Law at the University of California Hastings College of Law, says governments have a responsibility to protect individuals&#39; freedom by requiring health care businesses to fully meet health care needs, even over the objection of individual pharmacists... <hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/pharmacistshands.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=1></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>n the battle about pharmacists who demand to "follow their conscience" and refuse to fill certain prescriptions, opposing parties have staked out extreme positions.  In doing so, they obscure the reasonable middle-ground solution that represents the strength of the society we celebrate so noisily every Fourth of July.<br /><br />As an adherent myself to a minority religion, I greatly appreciate the freedom I have at work as well as at home to follow the tenets of my faith.  On the other side of the coin, I don't expect my workplace to cease operations for my religious observances.  When we celebrate our constitutional freedoms, we sometimes forget that one person's freedom is another person's sacrifice &#8212; and the Constitution protects us all.  So while employers are required to accommodate religious practices and beliefs, the courts have recognized that they need not, and in fact may not, accommodate those practices and beliefs if to do so would discriminate against believers in other faiths or even nonbelievers.  Statutory protections of religious belief (such as the federal Title VII) must steer carefully between the Scylla and Charybdis of the establishment and free exercise clauses of the First Amendment.  <br /><br />The pharmacists at the center of the recent refusal-to-furnish battles are surely not the first ones to seek accommodation for their religious beliefs.  Many likely have been quietly accommodated, and appropriately so.  Pharmacists whose religious beliefs conflict with filling birth control prescriptions can be scheduled for shifts when multiple pharmacists are on duty, or when few pickups occur, without significant interference either with the conduct of business or patient health care.  Essentially this is the position incorporated in the Conscience Clause of the American Pharmacists Association's Code of Ethics, which recognizes a pharmacist's right to exercise conscientious refusal but the simultaneous need to ensure patient access to prescribed drugs.  When such accommodation can easily be made, it should be made.  While I appreciate the concern for health care availability of those who argue that you should not be a pharmacist if you object to any category of legal prescription medication, I fear where such an absolutist position leads.  (Should I not be a professor because I refuse to teach during a few days of the scheduled school year?)  In any case, the availability problem can be solved by requirements directed to pharmacies rather than to pharmacists.  <br /> <br />The absolutists on the side of pharmacists demanding their "right" of conscience also need to recognize their responsibility to respect the freedoms of others &#8212; both the freedom to obtain medications that patients and their physicians deem necessary and the freedom not to share the refuser's religious beliefs.  A common theme in many of the high-profile recent skirmishes involving pharmacist refusals to fill prescriptions has been active interference with the patient's right to obtain legal medications &#8212; more than just quiet compliance with conscience.  Sometimes that interference has included a refusal to return or to transfer a prescription; the pharmacist's conduct in those cases is clearly out of bounds.  Whether you consider the prescription a form of property or just a medical record, it surely belongs to the patient and not to the pharmacist, unless it is being used for the purpose for which it was tendered (that is, unless it is being filled).  <br /><br />Often the pharmacist's interference has included a lecture &#8212; the most extreme of which have allegedly included calling patients murderers or baby-killers, sometimes in front of other customers.  To my mind, not only does such behavior exceed the bounds of ethical behavior by a professional, but it also violates existing federal law and probably some parallel state laws as well: the laws that protect our medical privacy.<br /><br />The federal law that protects the privacy of our personal health information (HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) and its implementing regulations detail when a "covered entity" (including every pharmacy) may use as well as disclose protected health information.  "Use" is the key here.  Personal health information may not be used for purposes unrelated to our health care.  Pharmacies, as well as other health care providers, are required to have polices in place that limit the amount of health information disclosed "to the amount reasonably necessary to achieve the purpose of the disclosure."  And every patient has the right to "adequate notice of the uses" that may be made by the covered entity.<br /><br />Implementation of HIPAA was responsible for that blizzard of paper about privacy rights we all received from our health care providers in 2003.  I can't say that I kept the paper I got from my pharmacy (or even, frankly, that I read it).  But I'm willing to wager that neither my pharmacy nor any other has ever given any patients notice that their personal health information might be used to convince them of the immorality of their medical choices, to determine whether they were violating God's law (in the opinion of the pharmacy's representative), or to save their souls from eternal damnation.  Nor would such uses in any case be related to health care as contemplated by HIPAA.<br /><br />I can hear representatives of Pharmacists for Life International (which has provided coordination and leadership to refusing pharmacists) arguing that pharmacists aren't "lecturing" patients; they are just providing them with important personal health information on the basis of which they might decide not to fill their prescriptions.  That argument, however, would be transparently specious.  The pharmacists in question have not been providing clinical information and education of the type often most available to and best understood by pharmacists.  Reports suggest that a lot of misinformation has in fact been provided &#8212; for example, that birth control pills are dangerous for healthy women (a position obviously not shared by the Food and Drug Administration or the medical profession).  Patients seeking birth control do not need to be "educated" that birth control medications prevent births.  That's why they are taking them.  Not to mention that some patients report being vilified and embarrassed.  More critically, the ultimate decision about health care belongs to the patient, but the pharmacists supposedly providing information want to make decisions for patients, not empower them to decide on their own.  In fact, they have already decided not to fill the prescriptions in question, whatever the patient might choose.  That is a pharmacist imposing his or her belief, not engaging in education.<br /><br />Does HIPAA thus muzzle those pharmacists who want to take the opportunity of patients seeking birth control to convince them not to fill these prescriptions?  Absolutely, if the "discussion" is not legitimately based on individual health-care concerns related to the patient (such as a drug contraindication) but rather on the pharmacist's religious convictions.  I don't know whether the federal Department of Health and Human Services Office of Civil Rights, which enforces HIPAA, has received any such complaints, but it seems to me they would be entirely legitimate.  If I hand a prescription to, or share my health care probl
ems with, a pharmacist, I am entitled to expect that his or her use of that information will only be to promote my health and not to proselytize, embarrass, or frighten me based on his or her religious beliefs.<br /><br />The middle-ground solution I favor &#8212; allowing pharmacists to quietly follow their religious beliefs to the extent they can be accommodated by their employers &#8212; also has application to the question of the responsibilities of a pharmacy rather than an individual pharmacist.  The Illinois emergency rule to assure the availability of contraceptive medications was directed to pharmacies rather than individual pharmacists, an excellent solution to the problem of contraceptive availability.  A state government's significant interests in family planning and maternal and child health certainly are adequate justification to require that those who enter the pharmacy business make available at their licensed establishments a wide range of necessary family planning medications.  Should holders of pharmacy licenses, like individual pharmacists, be allowed to seek conscience-based exceptions?  If the licensee is an individual rather than a corporation, or a corporate license holder is a religious organization requiring the license for activities central to its religious mission, I would support a limited exception, even if the exception is not required by the Constitution.  If making such exceptions proves to interfere with the availability of needed health care in a particular state, that state could review and narrow their availability.  For-profit corporate holders of pharmacy licenses, however, regardless of their sense of their employees' or stockholders' beliefs, should have no such right of conscience; objecting stockholders can invest in other ventures if they do not wish to meet the mandated responsibilities of a health care provider.<br /><br />To date, it appears that no state other than Illinois has adopted a requirement that its pharmacy licensees either stock or order prescription contraceptives or (if the patient prefers) transfer or return the prescription.  California's licensing board requires pharmacies that choose not to make emergency contraception services available to refer the patient to a provider who can provide them.  Given the significant patient demand for prescription contraceptives, few retail pharmacies are likely to choose not to sell any of them.  While the freedom we so value should be extended to individuals, even health care professionals, who act responsibly and respectfully while following their religious beliefs, government should not hesitate to protect the freedom of the rest of us by requiring health care businesses to fully meet our health care needs.  <br /><br />  <br /> <br /><em>Marsha N.

As the War on Terror continues into its fourth year, America has suffered a significant number of tactical errors in the use of its military, ranging from friendly fire incidents that have killed American soldiers and the soldiers of its coalition partners, to the unintended deaths of non-combatants by coalition military fire power.  While these tragedies have been leveraged by some to criticize the legitimacy of the American led effort to employ force against its enemies on the battlefield, all such attempts to denigrate the war polices and credibility of the United States pale in the wake of the prisoner abuse scandal at Abu Ghraib.  Not only did the photographs of American soldiers abusing Iraqi detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq create a firestorm of allegations concerning illegal interrogation practices, but it provided terrorist groups and other anti-American groups a "propaganda bonanza" that threatened to derail fundamental legal and policy pillars upon which America conducts the War on Terror.   Many even suggested that there was a moral equivalency between the systemic tactics of the terrorists and the modus vivendi of the United States.<br /><br />     Was the prison abuse a reflection of a systemic policy &#8212; either <em>de jure</em> or <em>de facto</em> &#8212; on the part of the United States to illegally extract information from detainees, or was the abuse simply isolated acts of criminal behavior on the part of a handful of soldiers amplified by an incompetent tactical chain of command at the prison facility?  Now that Lynndie England, the "poster child" of the Abu Ghraib scandal and the last of the nine members of the 372nd Army Reserve unit to be convicted, has been sentenced (to three years confinement) the answer is clear - the legal and policy pillars that support the War on Terror are still standing strong.<br />  <br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/abughraib.php">Abu Ghraib</a> | Text: <a href="/gazette/2005/04/report-on-command-responsibility-for.php">Command responsibility report</a> [HRW] | Audio: <a  href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/monitor/2004/10/military-commissions-colonel-will-gunn.php">What Really Happened at Abu Ghraib?</a> [Karpinski]<br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br />    The public was first shown the infamous photographs taken inside of the U.S. military run prison at Abu Ghraib in the CBS show <i>60 Minutes II</em> aired on April 28, 2004.  The widely circulated photos showed a handful of U.S. military police soldiers engaged in a variety of abusive and sexually sadistic acts against mostly blindfolded Iraqi detainees.  Among other things, the photos showed naked prisoners stacked in pyramids, connected by wires, on a dog leash, and threatened by dogs.  In addition, a handful of U.S. military police charged in the abuse scandal had forced naked prisoners to simulate sex acts. <br /> <br />    The chronology of how the Abu Ghraib abuse story shows that the military self-reported the crimes.  On January 13, 2004, Army Specialist Joseph Darby, a military policeman at Abu Ghraib, gave a computer disc containing the abuse photos to a military investigator.  On January 14, 2004, the Army immediately initiated a criminal investigation and the United States Central Command (the four-star combatant command located in Florida) informed the media in a press release on January 16, 2004, that it was investigating detainee abuse at an unspecified U.S. prison in Iraq.  On February 23, 2004, the military informed the U.S. press that 17 Army personnel had been suspended of duty pending further criminal investigations about the detainee abuse.  Then, on March 20, 2004, the military reported to the media that it had charged six soldiers with detainee abuse to include criminal charges of assault, cruelty, indecent acts and mistreatment.  Interestingly, however, the press did not fully respond to the growing story as the mere fact that soldiers were being punished for misconduct did not constitute news that was out of the ordinary &#8212; the military regularly punishes soldiers who violate the law.  In fact, the media only became energized on April 28, 2004, when  60 Minutes II aired the photos.<br />  <br />    Pursuant to evidence of criminal misconduct contained in a U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Division (CID) Report, nine enlisted reserve soldiers all from the 372nd Military Police Company, 320th Military Police Battalion, 800th Military Police Brigade were charged and convicted for an assortment of violations of provisions of the Uniformed Code of Military Justice.  The central figure in the scandal was Private First Class Lynndie England who is known for poses in which "she pointed at the genitals of a naked detainee while a cigarette dangled from her lips" and "holding a [dog] leash around a naked prisoner's neck."  All of those charged were reservists and all worked the night shift at Tier 1 in Abu Ghraib, where the abuses took place in the last months of 2003.<br /><br />    The particulars relating to the Abu Ghraib abuse story are now well settled thanks to the CID's criminal investigation and a number of collateral administrative investigations.  To include:  (1) the April 2004 Taguba Report, prepared by Major General Antonio Taguba; (2) the July 2004 Army Inspector General Report, prepared under Lieutenant General Paul Mikolashek (3) the August 2004 Fay Report, prepared by Major General George Fay; and (4) the August 2004 Schlesinger Report, headed by the former Secretary of Defense in the Nixon administration, James Schlesinger. <br /> <br />    The overriding question regarding the prisoner abuse echoes the thoughts of Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a member of the Armed Services Committee:  "How could we let this prison melt down and become the worst excuse for a military organization I've seen in my life?"  None of the Reports have found that there was an official policy - either written or oral - to torture or abuse prisoners.  According to the Schlesinger Report, the most far reaching investigation to date and the one which the Wall Street Journal deemed the "definitive assessment of what went wrong," "no approved procedures called for or allowed the kinds of abuse that in fact occurred."  In fact, the Schlesinger
 Report found:  "There is no evidence of a policy of abuse promulgated by senior officials or military authorities."  In addition, none of the Reports cite any direct abuse of prisoners by officers or by superiors ordering subordinates to commit the abuses.  In short, the Schlesinger Report concurs with all the Reports to date in finding that the individuals that conducted the sadistic abuse are personally responsible for their acts.<br />  <br />    Nevertheless, taking a broader examination of what happened at Abu Ghraib, the Schlesinger Report did find fault with the senior levels of command; there were "fundamental failures throughout all levels of command, from the soldiers on the ground to [the United States] Central Command and to the Pentagon" that set the stage for the abuses. <br /> <br />    The Schlesinger Report agreed with the calls for disciplinary action in the Fay Report for a number of officers in the immediate tactical chain of command who knew, or should have known, about the abuses at Abu Ghraib.  "The commanders of both brigades - 800 Military Police Brigade Commander Janis Karpinski and Military Intelligence Brigade Commander Thomas Pappas - either knew, or should have known, abuses were taking place and taken measures to prevent them."  Certainly, however, this would include not only Brigadier General Janis Karpinski and Colonel Thomas Pappas, but those subordinate commanders and on down the chain of command to the battalion, company and platoon level.  The chaotic environment at the prison existed in large part due to the dereliction of tactical commanders on the ground at Abu Ghraib.  <br /><br />    Apart from the issue of individual responsibility the factor that weighed the heaviest in explaining the abuses at Abu Ghraib was clearly the total break down in the immediate chain of command.  While the Schlesinger Report provides some blame to all levels of command, it is certain that a key causative factor was the failure at the Brigade &#8212; both the military police brigade and the military intelligence brigade.  This dereliction in leadership extended to the subordinate officers in the command and the senior non-commissioned officers as well.  These individuals are certainly responsible for what occurred in the light of culpability by omission; at a minimum they were guilty of dereliction of duty.  The primary responsibility for ensuring adherence to the law rests in the officer corps.  As noted, the Schlesinger Report followed suit with all the Reports and found that there was a "failure of military leadership and discipline."<br /><br />    Understanding the stresses of combat and the fact that the soldiers involved in the abuse at Abu Ghraib were untested reservists, the leadership should have taken greater precautions to ensure that a strong and dedicated chain of command was in charge to "inspect what was expected."  Accordingly, the officer corps must be filled with only the finest available men and women; only officers of the highest moral caliber and military skill should be assigned the responsibility of command.  In commenting on leadership skills for combat officers, World War II General George S. Patton, Jr. correctly stated:  "If you do not enforce and maintain discipline, you [officers] are potential murderers."<br /><br />    At the end of the day, it seems improbable that the United States military engaged in command directed torture or ill-treatment at Abu Ghraib, particularly when it was the military itself that self-reported to the media the fact individual soldiers were being investigated and punished in accordance with the rule of law for wartime abuses at the prison.  Clearly, the best indicator that the senior leadership is not culpable is found in its continuing commitment to criminally investigate and prosecute those soldiers accused of committing detainee abuses.  Numerous soldiers have already been prosecuted and sentenced for their crimes, and criminal trials will continue for others.<br /><br />    When one considers that the number of detainees in the War on Terror - including Afghanistan, Iraq and other operations - is about 50,000, it is unrealistic to expect that abuses will not occur.  Violations of rules occur in every human endeavor, to include war.  In an interview with the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, James Schlesinger correctly noted that the "behavior of our troops is so much better than it was in World War II."  The so-called "bad apple" syndrome is in fact the primary causative issue at Abu Ghraib &#8212; a handful of closely knit reserve personnel engaged in acts of sadism as they worked the night shift from October to December of 2003.   Former U.S Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell provided the most pointed assessment of the entire affair:  "I don't know how the hell these people got into our Army."<br /><br />    It is equally true that the Abu Ghraib story has been devastating to the United States.  While each and every case of abuse is repulsive to American standards of decency and justice, terrorists and other opponents of the United States have certainly become "media-savvy" in their quest to parlay these individual cases into marketable propaganda.  For example, many nations that are opposed to the United States are quick to exploit the individual cases of abuse at Abu Ghraib by painting the entire conduct of all American soldiers as immoral and illegal.  Of course, Americans do not need to be told that the abuses are beyond the pale of conduct expected of its military.  A CNN Gallup poll taken in May 2004, showed that three in four Americans agreed that the abuses at Abu Ghraib could not be justified.<br />  <br />    The investigative Reports and the convictions of the nine soldiers have done a great service to the American people and the world by dispelling the shrill cries of those who blame a secret Pentagon "culture of permissiveness," for the abuses at Abu Ghraib.  While the Schlesinger Report found institutional and even personal responsibility in the tactical chain of command for allowing conditions for abuse to occur at Abu Ghraib, the Report specifically found that "[n]o approved procedures called for or allowed the kinds of abuse that in fact occurred.  There is no evidence of a policy of abuse promulgated by senior officials or military authorities."  <br /><br />America&#39;s fundamental values have been translated into well-rooted rules of law at the cost of untold blood and treasure.  Hope remains that the attendant sacrifices in the War on Terror will not be overshadowed by the inexcusable conduct of the few at Abu Ghraib.  Indeed, as long as the military maintains its policy of transparency - as it did in the Abu Ghraib abuse case - the nation will understand.<br /><br />    <br /><br /><em>Jeffrey Addicott is Associate Professor of Law and Director, Center for Terrorism Law, St. Mary&#39;s University School of Law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.syr.edu/faculty/facultymember.asp?fac=54">Donna Arzt</a> of Syracuse University College of Law says that for all the furor over whether the Hurricane Katrina evacuees should or should not be called &quot;refugees&quot;, that legal label doesn&#39;t apply in circumstances of natural disaster....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/arztnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>n the midst of the Katrina disaster, many of the victims, their supporters, and much of the rest of the country were caught up in a debate over what to call the survivors. Shortly after news media began using the term "refugees," the Rev. Jesse Jackson, among others, protested that it was racist to call American citizens "refugees." Rep. Diane Watson (D-Ca.) even said the label was "almost a hate crime." The victims of Katrina, after all they had gone through, did not appreciate being compared to people fleeing from Third World countries, it was said. Ironically, when the current definition of "refugee" was originally adopted in 1951, it primarily applied to Europeans fleeing the Nazis, as a result of "events" occurring before January 1, 1951.[<a href="#1">1</a>]  <br /><br />The national media split between those, like the <em>Washington Post</em>, <em>Boston Globe</em>, CNN, NPR, that banned use of the word "refugee" in reference to Katrina survivors, and those such as the <em>New York Times</em>, the <em>LA Times</em> and the Associated Press, who continued to label them as such. For lack of a better term, the awkward "evacuees" became the word most often used to refer to anyone who had been displaced by Katrina and its aftermath.[<a href="#2">2</a>]    <br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Hurricane Katrina Disaster</a> | Video: <a  href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/monitor/2005/10/beyond-katrina-georgetown-u-law-center.php">Katrina Victims&#39; Bill of Rights</a><br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /> By now, it is more than evident that "refugee" does not technically apply to persons who remain in their own country and that the legally correct term would be the inelegant phrase, "Internally Displaced Person" or "IDP."[<a href="#3">3</a>]    A refugee is someone who:<blockquote>owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.[<a href="#4">4</a>]  </blockquote>Refugees are not necessarily stateless; "refugee" is not the opposite of "citizen." However, the term reflects a certain reality, evident in the clause immediately after the italicized words: "unable, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country." Katrina's victims who did not receive the expected aid were, indeed, unable to avail themselves of governmental protection.<br /><br />As in an international refugee crisis, private and public refugee agencies did respond to the disaster. For instance, the International Rescue Committee, a New York-based NGO, dispatched an emergency response team at the request of the Baton Rouge Area Foundation to assist local organizations with public health and emergency education needs. In early September, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Geneva, Switzerland deployed two staff members &#8212; with twelve more on standby &#8212; to the U.S. to assist with relief coordination and offered its emergency stockpiles or "anything else that could be of assistance to US authorities."<br /><br />Internally displaced persons are<blockquote>persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally recognized State border.[<a href="#5">5</a>]  </blockquote>There is currently an estimated 25 million IDPs around the world &#8212; twice as many as international refugees. Because they are internally located, their government must consent to the assistance of an international agency such as the UNHCR or UNDP (UN Development Programme). That is more likely in the case of a natural disaster than when a military conflagration is occurring.<br /><br />Hypothetically, let's assume that many of Katrina's evacuees had indeed crossed an international frontier &#8212; either that Texas is an independent country or that they had reached Mexico, which had taken them in. Then suppose they had sought asylum in a third country, such as Canada. Would they then be properly classified as "refugees"?[<a href="#6">6</a>]   <br /><br />Probably not. Flight from a natural disaster is not normally considered "persecution" or "torture," which are intentional acts caused by a human persecutor. While it would be a stretch, they could argue that the persecution was not the hurricane and flood but the government's neglect of them after the natural disaster occurred, because of their predominantly African-American race. But the burden of proof, which is on the persons claiming refugee status, would be hard to meet, since non-black evacuees, though they may have had more resources to evacuate on their own, usually encountered the same governmental incompetence. Refugee law provides protection from intentional mistreatment, not disparate impact.<br /><br /><font SIZE=2 style='font-size: 8pt'>Notes <br /><br /><a name=1>1</a>. State parties to the 1951 Refugee Convention had the choice of covering persons fleeing either (a) &quot;events occurring in Europe before I January 1951&quot;; or (b) &quot;events occurring in Europe or elsewhere before I January 1951.&quot; Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/v1crs.htm 189 U.N.T.S. 150, entered into force April 22, 1954, art. 1(B)(1).  <br /><br /><a name=2>2</a>. On Sept. 21, the Christian Science Monitor reported 6,800 Google "hits" for "Katrina evacuees" and only 5,400 hits for "Katrina victims."

Like the U.S., Canada has a dual system: the Refugee and Humanitarian Resettlement Program, for people seeking protection from outside Canada; and the In-Canada Refugee Protection Process, for persons making refugee protection claims from within Canada.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.umaryland.edu/faculty_profile.asp?facultynum=069">Sherrilyn Ifill</a> of the University of Maryland School of Law says that contrary to what some female politicians, commentators and even the First Lady of the United States have said, skepticism about the qualifications of Harriet Miers for the US Supreme Court is not sexist...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/ifill.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>S</strong></font>enator Barbara Mikulski suggested it.  Television commentator Cokie Roberts confirmed it.  And Laura Bush has driven it home.  Intense skepticism about the qualification of Harriet Miers to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court is sexist.  The only problem with this growing consensus among high profile women from both sides of the aisle is that it's just plain wrong. <br /><br />Nothing is more harmful to ongoing efforts to eliminate sexism and racism from public and private life than a high profile charge that is utterly unfounded.  And the charge that Harriet Miers is the victim of sexism is about as unfounded as Clarence Thomas' 1991 charge after the Anita Hill sexual harassment allegations came to light that he was the victim of a "high-tech lynching."  Thomas was the subject of intense scrutiny because he was alleged to have engaged in conduct towards a female subordinate in his office, which was offensive and inappropriate.  Harriet Miers is the subject of intense skepticism by those on the right and on the left (including women) because she seeks a lifetime appointment to perhaps the most intellectually and personally challenging and important legal jobs in our country on a resume that reflects very little preparation for the job at hand.<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/miers.php">Harriet Miers</a> | Video: <a href="/monitor/2005/10/miers-us-supreme-court-nomination.php">Miers nomination</a> [White House]<br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>Miers' anemic answers to the questions proferred by the Judiciary Committee certainly undermine the sexism claim.  Read in total, her application reads like that of a competent candidate for a district court judge seat, not a Supreme Court justice.  To say this is not to impugn Miers' intelligence or skill as a lawyer.  Yes, Miers is a prominent and capable attorney who headed up a major law firm.  Yes, she was the first female president elected to head the Dallas Bar Association.  But the job of Supreme Court justice is a unique one.  Being smart and capable are only the starting points for this job.  What is blatantly lacking in Miers' resume is a demonstration that she has committed herself to confronting and grappling with complex constitutional issues &#8212; the bread and butter of the modern Supreme Court docket.  This does not require, as some have suggested, that Miers have served as a judge before coming to the Court &#8212; although such experience would help in her acclimatization to the insulated and high-pressure life of a judge.  I have long advocated greater professional diversity among our Supreme Court Justices.  With most recently appointed justices rising from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to the High Court, we had come perilously close to creating a kind of "professional track" to the Court.  The Court needs justices that have a range of experiences to bring to judicial decision making. Admittedly, Chair of the State Lottery Commission is not necessarily the kind of diverse experience I had in mind, but I welcome a justice that has some non-traditional experience in state government.<br />  <br />This kind of experience however, cannot replace the need for a nominee to have demonstrated their knowledge of and commitment to engaging with complex constitutional law questions.  If Thurgood Marshall had been nominated to the bench straight from practice, before he served as Solicitor General and on the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, I would have regarded him as qualified.  He'd spent 35 years as a constitutional litigator.  Likewise, even if Chief Justice Roberts had not served on the D.C. Circuit, his experience litigating constitutional cases before the Supreme Court over 20 years demonstrated that at a minimum he had a firm grasp of and an intense interest in resolving the kinds of questions with which he would be confronted as a Supreme Court justice for the rest of his life.  Whatever my concerns about his refusal to answer questions about specific cases, and his unsatisfactory answers to other questions, therefore, I could not argue that Roberts was unqualified to sit on the Court.<br /><br />Harriet Miers presents a different case.  To be blunt, her resume &#8212; thick with unremarkable service on local boards -- is thin on constitutional litigation, scholarship or service.  She has never appeared before the Supreme Court.  She has argued only 4 cases in the federal circuit court.  She has not authored a law review article or book presenting a sustained and coherent argument or exposition of a complex legal question of public significance.  Nominees for the Supreme Court cannot expect to "catch-up" on constitutional law issues during the confirmation process.  They must have already thought long and hard and deeply about these issues.  How can we expect Miers to engage forcefully and independently in conferences with the other justices if she has only begun to think through complex constitutional law questions in the past few weeks?   These deficiencies lead me (and many others) to conclude that there are countless conservative women lawyers who are more qualified than Miers to sit on the Court.  They serve on state and federal courts, on law faculties and in law firms throughout this country.  But these women apparently lacked the two qualifications that the Bush vetting team regarded as essential to fill this vacant seat on the Court &#8212; proven loyalty to this President and a gossamer paper trial.<br /><br />The Judiciary Committee, therefore, must closely question this nominee on her qualifications, and on the extent of her loyalty to this President.  To argue that it's sexist to do so distracts us from the very important charge that confronts the Committee.  The President's highly inappropriate conduct since Miers' nomination --  winking and nodding to his right-wing base, to assure them of Miers' anti-abortion stance --  should further spur the Committee to demand that this nominee explain to the American public who she is, and what kind of judge she would be.<br /><br />Of course, there will be some who will regard Miers' gender as a reason to suspect her competence.  Questions about her law school grades, whether she's a good cook and why she's single are all grossly out of bounds.  But to characterize challenges to her qualifications for this most important job as sexist is simply off the mark.  To confront Miers with tough questioning and to hold her to the standard of excellence that we shou
ld expect of any Supreme Court nominee is not sexist.  It is the constitutional obligation of each Senator on the Judiciary Committee.<br /><br /><br /><em>Sherrilyn Ifill is a civil rights lawyer and law professor at the University of Maryland School of Law</em><br />

When viewing the daily media reports detailing numerous car bomb detonations and insurgent attacks, it is difficult to imagine that any progress is taking place.  But it is.  The entire country is being rebuilt, and I personally observed that progress every day during the more than ten months I spent in Iraq during 2004-2005.  Some of those steps include the well-publicized elections.  Others, like the rebuilding of schools and hospitals, often miss the media spotlight.  Nevertheless, they go on and include the establishment of a criminal justice system.  On October 19, 2005, a major step was taken when Saddam Hussein was called before the Iraqi Special Tribunal (IST) to answer a charge of a crime against humanity for complicity in the execution and incarceration of civilians from a small town called Ad Dujayl, a farming community approximately 35 miles north of Baghdad. <br />  <br />For almost 30 years, Saddam Hussein as the dictator of Iraq controlled the population by various forms of terror, torture and execution.  Literally every quarter of Iraqi society felt Saddam's wrath, from the Kurds of northern Iraq to the Marsh Arabs in the south.  Even today, his presence instills fear in the Iraqis to a degree that is difficult to fathom.  When Saddam Hussein was first taken into Iraqi custody last July, I was present in the courtroom with other Iraqi governmental officials.  They were shocked to finally see him and seemed to cower at his very presence.  Notwithstanding the fear Saddam engendered, the search for justice moved forward, investigations were conducted, and Saddam's conduct was examined.  Now he finally is being called to answer for the acts that he and others have done, before an Iraqi court, with Iraqi judges; a historic event not only for Iraq, but for the entire Middle East.<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/saddamtrial.php">Saddam Hussein Trial</a> | Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/iraqispecial.php">Iraqi Special Tribunal</a> | Text: <a  href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/gazette/2005/10/saddam-tribunal-report-hrw.php">Saddam tribunal report</a> [Human Rights Watch]<br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>  <br />Iraq is an emerging democracy.  It recently held its first free elections and a referendum on the proposed constitution, essential steps on the road to democracy.  Equally important for the establishment of any democracy is a court system grounded in the rule of law.  Over the years the Iraqi people have had little or no faith in the Iraqi court system.  Through his regime of terror, Saddam flouted due process principles by using secret courts where civilians were tried and sentenced to death for inconsequential acts.  For instance, people were executed for simply telling a joke about Saddam.  We routinely discovered execution orders with a copy of the joke attached.  Others were arrested, tortured and incarcerated with no due process or accountability.  There are numerous stories of Iraqi law enforcement officials taking a loved one from his home never to be seen again.  In stark contrast, these proceedings before the IST will take a large step towards eradicating Saddam's climate of fear and establishing a renewed faith in the court system. It is crucial that these trials not only be fair but that they be perceived to be fair by the Iraqi people.  This trial, unlike those conducted by Saddam Hussein, will be held in an open courtroom to be viewed by the public and scrutinized by the world.<br /> <br />This trial is also the first step toward some reconciliation with Iraq's collective past.  While it is important that the former Iraqi leaders be called to answer for their acts, it is also vital that the Iraqi people come to understand fully what happed in Iraq and examine how large parts of the Iraqi population suffered.  In every society that has undergone unspeakable suffering, be it in Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia or Nazi Germany, the population must have a reckoning with the past.  During the late 1990's, I spent almost five years at the International War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).  The people from the former Yugoslavia continuously spoke to me about the crimes inflicted on the civilian population during World War II.  It was still being discussed into the 1990's because it had never been addressed after the war.  I can tell you that the Iraqi people want to heal as well.  In whatever reconciliation method is employed, the people must have some ability to explain to their fellow countrymen and the world what happened to them.  That accounting with the past must and can occur through these trials, as well as through other vehicles such as truth commissions.  These proceedings will begin that reckoning and are the first major step taken by the Iraqi people to confront the past and allow them to move forward into the 21st century.<br /><br /><em>Trials in Iraq: Why Not in The Hague?</em><br /><br />Unlike many other tribunals such as the ICTY, these proceedings will be held in Iraq and will be conducted by Iraqis.  A significant amount of unjustified criticism has been leveled at the Iraqis, the Iraqi Special Tribunal and the United States for choosing to conduct the proceedings in Iraq by Iraqis.  Human rights organizations have argued that these trials should be held in The Hague or some other forum under the auspices of the United Nations, thereby taking any control over the conduct of these proceedings away from the people who suffered most at the hands of Saddam Hussein and his regime.  Without question, there is a valid reason for ad hoc tribunals such as the ICTY to conduct their proceedings far away from the crime scenes.  However, it has come at a cost.  One must wonder how most Americans would react at having an unknown entity in a foreign country preside over crimes committed by an American dictator against American civilians.   Clearly, we would have little tolerance for such a choice.  This scenario is no different from the choices given to and made by the Iraqi people.  After all the suffering inflicted on the civilian population, the Iraqis chose to conduct these proceedings themselves.  During my tenure in Iraq, I met and spoke to many Iraqi people as I moved throughout the country.  In all my discussions, no Iraqi questioned the decision to try
 Saddam Hussein and his co-defendants in Iraq.<br /><br /> Of course, there will be difficulties.  Obviously, the insurgency as well as Saddam Hussein loyalists could employ extraordinary measures to disrupt the proceedings.  Others who might believe that the defendants do not deserve due process could attempt to punish anyone who operated in concert with the IST.  Regardless of the goal or sector of Iraqi society, the threat does exist, and actions by those who object to these proceedings could jeopardize the entire IST.  In fact, one of the defense attorneys representing Amad Hamed al-Bander, the former judge of Saddam's Revolutionary Court, was abducted after the first day of trial, and executed by individuals posing as representatives of the Ministry of the Interior.  Unfortunately, this murder was not the first that affected the IST.  Last spring, an IST investigative judge and his son were executed, and other IST employees have also been killed.  Clearly, if these proceedings are to have legitimacy, all participants must be free from threats and violence.  But is this possible in Baghdad at the present time?  I believe that it is.  The trial itself is being held in a safe location inside the International Zone, a/k/a the "Green Zone," and the media has reported that safeguards have been afforded to all participants should they so choose.  With cautious vigilance and the proper safety measures, these proceedings can and should move forward.   The time for delay is past.  The Iraqi people must see that the court system is emerging and reestablishing itself.  If these trials fail to move forward, it is difficult to imagine how the foundations of the rule of law will be laid for the future.<br /><br /> A second major objection to the Iraqis' decision to conduct these proceedings themselves focuses on the ability of the Iraqi judges to be objective when viewing the facts before them.  Having spent significant time with all the IST judges, I have no doubts about their fairness.  It is true that many of these judges had not been educated in international humanitarian law.  Such  training obviously was not a priority of Saddam Hussein's regime.  Nevertheless, since their appointment, the judges have had significant blocks of time among themselves and at numerous legal forums to discuss the applicable law.  When I joined the ICTY at its inception, many of those judges and lawyers including myself had no prior exposure to international humanitarian law and went through the same educational exercise.  Yet, with time and diligence, the ICTY has become one of the major courts routinely interpreting humanitarian law.  I have no doubt that the IST judges will follow in this respected tradition.<br /><br /> As for the judges' objectivity, I also have every reason to believe that the IST judges can render a decision on the facts that come before them in a fair and impartial manner.  They want to convince the world and the Iraqi people of the IST's legitimacy.  They know the ramifications of any decision that is not based squarely on the evidence before them.  These judges have taken on a major responsibility where the validity of the entire government could rest on the perception of their ability to conduct a fair trial with the attendant due process requirements.    I know these judges and I have no doubt that these brave men and women will meet that challenge.<br /><br /><em>The Iraqi Special Tribunal Trial Procedures</em><br /><br /> After the first day of trial, it is easy to observe that the IST proceeding will be different from those seen on Court TV and those American audiences are accustomed to viewing.  Like the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia, the criminal justice system in the United States is grounded in the right to a jury trial.  However, when examining judicial frameworks from around the world our common law system is the exception rather than the rule.  Most countries, including France, Germany, Spain and the Middle East operate on a civil law system where investigations are directed by judges, not prosecutors, and trials are held before a panel of judges.  Such is the system in Iraq.  I have observed and participated in other civil law settings (France and Germany), and their procedures are remarkably similar to those employed in Iraq.<br /><br /> The trial itself will be held before five trial judges, one of which will preside over its proceedings.  Interestingly, the trial chambers in the ICTY are comprised of only three judges.  These IST judges will make the findings of fact and will also apply applicable precepts of international humanitarian law to the evidence presented.  As that evidence unfolds, it will likewise come before the court in a manner unfamiliar to the common law practitioner.  For instance, in the civil law setting, the judges have the primary role in bringing evidence before the court and examining witnesses.  This is so because long before public proceedings commence, the trial chamber judges have been given a dossier from the investigative judge that includes all the pertinent evidence and sworn statements.  The trial judges then select those facts that are at issue, and only those become the focus of any public proceeding.  Judges rather than the prosecutor or defense lawyer interrogate witnesses.  Even the manner in which the trial unfolds is different from common law courts.  For instance, during the trial the trial chamber judges could conclude that additional investigation is warranted, and send the entire file back to the investigative judge for further inquiry.   The key is for the judges to render a decision based on a complete investigation so that the trial chamber can be satisfied in its conclusion.<br />  <br />In a civil law system, prosecutors and defense lawyers have a secondary role.  Although the prosecutor is not the main examiner, he may of course suggest areas of inquiry to the trial chamber and can give his position on the facts and points of law.  Nevertheless, it is up to the trial judges to determine how the receipt of testimony and evidence will proceed.  Once all the testimony and evidence is received, the prosecutor has the opportunity to argue the conclusion must be drawn from that evidence.  Thereafter the judges will retire and formulate a written "charge" to be presented to the defendant, who must answer if the court's charge points to guilt.  <br /><br />The defense is then allowed to present evidence and testimony on behalf of the accused, and the defendant, while not obliged to do so, may make a statement on his own behalf.  Once again, unlike the American system, there will be no dramatic cross-examinations or final arguments.  At the conclusion of the defense case, the trial chamber will retire to consider its final decision.  That written ruling could take weeks to write as the judges apply the facts before them to the pertinent aspects of humanitarian law.  Should a decision of guilt be handed down, the defendant has the right to appeal any such decision to a panel of nine appellate judges.  Should the decision of the trial judge be affirmed, sentence is generally imposed within thirty days.  The range of penalties includes, inter alia, death by hanging.<br /><br /><em>Why is the </em>Ad Dujayl<em> Case First and What is it About?</em><br /><br />The <em>Ad Dujayl</em> case is certainly not the most extensive crime committed by the former regime.  During the Anfal campaign against Kurds in 1988, more than 100,000 were killed with thousands removed from their homes and incarcerated, and during the 1991 uprising, thousands more civilians were executed.  Nevertheless, a review of <em>Ad Dujayl</em> facts reflects a strong example of the methods employed by Saddam Hussein throughout his reign.<br /> <br />Through his feared intelligence services Saddam Hussein routinely used terror as a way to control the Iraqi population.  His methodology included using the media to publicize the punishments he meted out to transgressors.  This approach accomplished two goals:  1) removal of any perceived threat, and 2) the instilling of fear in the public, while preventing any other
 further transgressions.  Such was the approach conducted by Saddam in Ad Dujayl.<br /> <br />The village itself is a small agrarian town approximately 35 miles north of Baghdad.  It is the home of mostly Iraqi Shiites, and while it sits in a sea of Sunni villages, a walk through Ad Dujayl reflects nothing but serenity.  On July 8, 1982, a small group of villagers from Ad Dujayl unsuccessfully attacked Saddam Hussein's convoy as it traveled through the village.  By all accounts, it was an <table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/kehoedujayl.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=4 ALT="US Regime Crimes Liason Greg Kehoe (left) walks through Ad Dujayl, Iraq"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table>amateurish assassination attempt.  Unharmed, Saddam thereafter spoke to the village extolling its loyalty and was then flown by helicopter to Baghdad.  However, even then, the Ad Dujayl townspeople feared Saddam's retaliation.  Within hours of the failed assassination, forces from the Iraqi Intelligence Service (IIS), the feared <em>Mukhabarat</em>, and other state police agencies descended upon the town to exact revenge.  These forces were brought to bear by Barzan Ibrahim Hasan Al-Tikriti, then the IIS chief and Saddam Hussein's half-brother, acting on Saddam Hussein's direct orders.  Barzan ordered the arrest of everyone over the age of 13 who was capable of carrying a weapon.  The defendant Abdullah Kazim Ruwayyid and his son Mizhar Abdullah Ruwayyid, loyal Ba'athists assisted the IIS squads in the arrests.<br />  <br /> The IIS forces then brought scores of arrested citizens to the Ba'ath Party building in Ad Dujayl for interrogations.  Despite the fact that the assassination attempt had been a crime of opportunity with few participants, the number of civilians arrested grew tremendously during the days that followed.  Hundreds of the townspeople were arrested and as many as 15 were summarily executed.  Eventually, over 1,000 people spent years in prison with no charges brought against them, and more than 145 were executed, many without ever seeing a court of law.  Civilian prisoners were sent to various prisons in Baghdad where they were beaten and tortured to extract information or compel confessions.  As time passed, prisoners were transported to desert internment camps throughout the country.  Many of the prisoners were never charged with any crimes or taken before any judges, but simply were detained.  A significant number of prisoners were held until 1985, when they were released to return to Ad Dujayl, only to find their land and property confiscated or destroyed.<br /><br /> Many others were brought before the Revolutionary Court, a body charged with hearing cases involving state security.  It was widely known that any referral to the Revolutionary Court meant certain death.  These prisoners were accused of membership in the Da'wa Party, a Shiite political opposition group outlawed by Saddam Hussein's Revolutionary Command Council (RCC) in 1980.  The RCC had deemed death as the punishment for membership in the party.  The Revolutionary Court judge was the defendant Awad Hamed Al-Bandr, who sentenced more than 145 prisoners to death with many already dead by the time the execution orders were signed.  The youngest person executed appears to be an 11-year-old boy, while two others, fighting in the Iran-Iraq war at the time of the assassination attempt, were taken from the army, incarcerated and ultimately executed.  As a final punishment, in addition to the tortures, incarcerations and executions, the land around Ad Dujayl was stripped of crops and destroyed, rendering it unusable for farming.  <br /><br /><em>The Defense</em><br /><br />You can expect the defense presented by the accused to be a vigorous one.  First, there will be a challenge to the formation of the IST.  Set up by the Coalition Provisional Authority in 2003 during the occupation, and reaffirmed by the current Iraqi legislative chamber, the IST's validity and establishment will nonetheless be challenged as an unlawful act by an occupying force.  This defense should prove unsuccessful because the Iraqis have since validated the court themselves.  The second challenge will focus on the 1970 Iraqi Constitution, which granted immunity to all RCC members including Saddam while acting in their governmental capacity.  Under international law, it is doubtful that any legislative body can legitimize or legalize a crime against humanity.  So this defense should also prove unsuccessful.  To ensure that the immunity defense is not effective, however, the Iraqi legislature need only vote to withdraw any such immunity in much the same fashion that Chile withdrew General Augusto Pinochet's protective status.<br /><br /> The last major legal objection will focus on the <em>ex post facto</em> aspects of the crimes for which Saddam and his co-defendants are charged.  Under the well grounded international law concept of <em>nullum crimen sine lege</em> (no crime without law), a defendant cannot be charged or punished for a crime that did not exist at the time.  Clearly, there was no Iraqi equivalent of crimes against humanity during Saddam's reign.  However, the existing law at the time of the <em>Ad Dujayl</em> event included international law as well as domestic law.  Mandates forbidding crimes by coordinated state action directed against the civilian population were crimes under international humanitarian law, regardless of domestic law.  Thus, as with Nazi war criminals from the Third Reich, neither legality under domestic law nor the absence of specific prohibition of crimes against humanity will bar a prosecution of Saddam and his co-defendants for the <em>Ad Dujayl</em> matter.<br /><br /> Lastly, I am sure that Saddam and some of his co-defendants will argue that they were unaware of the crimes that took place.  As this is a command responsibility case, it must be established that superiors such as Saddam either ordered or condoned the criminal conduct of his subordinates for a guilty verdict to be rendered.  I participated in a command responsibility case in the ICTY, and they are inherently difficult to prove because the proponent is attempting to hold a superior liable for a subordinate's conduct when the superior was not present at the scene of the crime.  For it to be shown that a superior is responsible up the chain of command, the evidence must include testimony as well as documentary proof of an individual's legal responsibility and participation regardless of his presence at the crime scene.  In my opinion, in absence of documentary proof, lack of knowledge could very well be Saddam's best defense.  Even if he signed the death warrants for the more than 145 Ad Dujayl civilians, he could nonetheless argue that he relied on the court system, and he was unaware that there was little or no evidence against these executed civilians.  To meet this defense, oral testimony of governmental insiders could counter any such assertion as well as documentary evidence outlining the information that was passed up the chain of command.<br />  <br /><em>Conclusion</em><br /><br /> Whatever the outcome of the <em>Ad Dujayl</em> case, the IST and the Iraqi people can take great pride in conducting a criminal proceeding free of the shackles of secrecy.  In a further step towards democracy, the price for this step will be high, but I believe that the people of Iraq are willing to pay that price.  In the early part of this year, the body of an IST driver was found dumped in a Baghdad alley.  His body was taken to a makeshift morgue where it was identified by his brother several days later.  His brother, also on the IST staff, was and is a friend of mine, and we sat together after he had buried his brother according to Islamic law.  He told me that while he mourned his brother's death, he knew that his death was part of the tax that he and other Iraqis had to pay for a democracy; and he was willing to pay it.  For people so willing to pay such a price for freedom, I ha
ve no doubt that they will succeed.  <br />   <br /><br /><em>Gregory W. Kehoe was the Regime Crimes Liaison to the Iraqi Special Tribunal in Baghdad, Iraq from March, 2004 until March, 2005.

Until Tuesday of this week, it was assumed Iraqis would vote on the September 18 draft of the Constitution.  On Tuesday, a few amendments were supposedly agreed upon, although the National Assembly may not approve them in time for the referendum. [<em>Editor&#39;s note</em>: the speaker of the Iraqi National Assembly said late Wednesday that the <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/breaking-news-iraq-parliament-approves.php">changes had been approved</a> by the body, meeting with 157 of 275 members present, although no actual vote was taken.] One should bear in mind, however, that Tuesday's amendments are few in number and generally very minor.  Whether or not the amendments are approved, the constitution upon which Iraqis will vote will track in most respects the September 18 draft constitution.<br /> <br />As a result of the recent minor amendments, there is new hope that the Iraqi constitution will be approved by strong majorities from all Iraqi communities, including the Sunnis.  Whether this is realistic is unclear.  But even if this occurs, what would approval really mean?  The Bush administration has suggested that approval of the draft constitution will represent a giant step towards stability.  By its account, Iraqis who vote for the constitution will be signaling that they agree on common aspirations and consent to be governed by a certain type of governmental structure that will help realize their common goals. <br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/iraqiconstitution.php">Iraqi Constitution</a> | Text: <a href="/gazette/2005/09/iraq-constitution-final-draft-epic.php">Iraq constitution final draft</a> [Sept. 18] | Video: <a  href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/monitor/2005/10/remaking-iraq-federalism-and-rights.php">Remaking Iraq</a><br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br />The administration's view is too optimistic.  In fact, the approval of the constitution this week will not signal the presence of a common vision for Iraq and it could not, by itself, lead to the formation of a stable, integrated state.  This is for two interrelated reasons.  First, whether or not Tuesday's proposed amendments are adopted, the constitution that Iraqis vote on will fail to resolve many of the most basic questions about what the Iraqi state will look like.  Second, although it pays lip service to the importance of unity, the constitution may permit regions effectively to opt out of the Iraqi union.  It allows regions a right to autonomy, and the degree of autonomy that is permitted is not entirely clear.  Indeed, some provisions could be interpreted broadly&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;so broadly that regions could assert a right to operate virtually as independent states.  In short, once this constitution is approved, Iraqis will still be faced with the challenge of coming up with mutually acceptable answers to enormously divisive questions that the constitution leaves open.  Until they do, Iraq is likely to remain unstable.  And if they do not succeed quickly, the constitution may itself provide disgruntled regions with a road map to virtual secession.<br /><br />Let us begin by discussing the ambiguity of crucial constitutional provisions.  The constitution's drafting process was deeply flawed.[<a href="#1">1</a>]  Among other problems, the constitutional drafting committee worked under unreasonable time pressure.  The draft constitution submitted to the Transitional National Assembly on August 28 left some of the most basic and divisive issues about the nature of the state unresolved.  Amendments made on September 18 and those tentatively agreed on Tuesday have not resolved many of the ambiguities about the shape of the new Iraqi state&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;indeed, they may have exacerbated some of them.  Obviously, any constitution will inevitably contain important ambiguities, and these are rarely fatal.  On deeply divisive issues, however, this constitution contains more than the usual vagueness and internal tension.<br /><br />For example, the constitution leaves open the question of whether Iraq should be a unitary state containing an autonomous Kurdish region or should instead be a federation of many autonomous regions.  This was a source of sharp disagreement during the drafting process, and the constitutional drafting committee could not settle this issue.  The constitution thus leaves this issue to be resolved jointly by parliament and regional elites.  It provides that at the outset Iraq will be a unitary state with one autonomous Kurdish region in the North.  At the same time, the constitution instructs the Iraqi parliament to enact a law setting procedures by which residents of provinces outside Kurdistan can choose to join Kurdistan or, in the alternative, to form new autonomous regions.<br /><br />Given the confusion in the document about whether Iraq will be a federation, it is perhaps not surprising that the constitution does not specify how autonomous a region is really permitted to be.  The extent of federal power to supersede regional legislation is deeply ambiguous.[<a href="#2">2</a>]   More important, it is unclear whether the Supreme Federal Court has the authority to exercise constitutional review of state legislation.  (This is a necessary power if the national courts are to ensure that all Iraqi laws conform&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;as the constitution formally requires&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;to common Iraqi understandings of human rights and Islamic law.).[<a href="#3">3</a>]   <br /><br />Notwithstanding the amendments proposed on Tuesday, the constitution that Iraqis vote on will fail to resolve countless other crucial issues. For example, it leaves to future resolution (mostly by parliamentary legislation) questions about the civil and political rights Iraqi citizens should enjoy,[<a href="#4">4</a>]  the degree to which the judiciary should have effective guarantees of independence,[<a href="#5">5</a>]  and the distribution of oil revenues in the country.[<a href="#6">6</a>] <br /><br />Iraqis who vote for a constitution that leaves so much open cannot really be said to be approving a particular vision of the state.  They are merely voting to begin the process by which a representative body will try to develop a shared vision of the state.  What will Iraqis be able to do under the constitution if (1) no consensus can be reached and (2) a parliamentary maj
ority begins to shape Iraq in a way that others find intolerable? <br />  <br />The constitution does not permit secession.  Indeed, if Tuesday's amendments are approved in time for the referendum, the constitution will contain strong language stressing the unity of Iraq.  Nevertheless, one might want to ask what the constitution means by unity.  In fact, the constitution allows citizens in a particular part of the country to vote to organize themselves into an autonomous region.  Furthermore, as noted already, it is possible to interpret this right to autonomy very broadly.  Indeed, one can plausibly read the constitution to permit regions vast power to ignore national legislation or policy.  Regions can also assert some degree of control over natural resources in their region and over customs collection at their borders.  More striking still, the constitution empowers regions to take steps that would help them fight, if necessary, for their effective independence.  It allows regions to maintain total control over regional militias.[<a href="#7">7</a>]   Furthermore, regions may establish offices in national Iraqi embassies and consulates around the world.  Should tensions arise between the national government and a particular region, these offices could enable de facto diplomatic relations between the breakaway region and sympathizers in foreign nations.[<a href="#8">8</a>]   <br /><br />At the end of this week, Iraqis will probably vote to approve a constitution that tracks in most respects the September 18 draft constitution.  We should hope that they do so enthusiastically and overwhelmingly.  It is always good when people with guns vote to keep talking about how to live together peacefully.  At the same time, we should be realistic about the implications of approval.  Approval of this constitution is not, by itself, likely to stabilize Iraq.  Contrary to the most optimistic assertions, the new Iraqi constitution will not provide the blueprints for a functional, peaceful and integrated Iraqi state.  It will provide only a starting point for complex discussions about whether such a state is really possible and what it might look like.  Furthermore, it will give disgruntled regions a plausible claim to radical autonomy.  By approving the new constitution, the Iraqis will be agreeing to continue upon a difficult attempt to forge a common vision for a future together.  For quite some time, however, the possibility of a de facto partition may remain very real. <br />   <br /><font SIZE=2 style='font-size: 8pt'>Notes <br /><br /><a name=1>1</a>. For well-informed descriptions of the process and trenchant critiques, see the <a href="http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/brown8_314.pdf">commentary</a> by Nathan Brown at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace and the International Crisis Group's <a href="http://www.crisisgroup.org/library/documents/middle_east___north_africa/iraq_iran_gulf/b19_unmaking_iraq_a_constitutional_process_gone_awry.pdf">report on the process</a>.<br /><br /><a name=2>2</a>. Here and in subsequent notes, I will still have to cite the September 18 draft.  To the best of my knowledge, none of the articles that I discuss here are expected to be amended.  Nevertheless, readers should bear in mind that if Tuesday's proposed amendments are formally approved, the numbering of articles may change.  In the September 18 draft of the constitution, Article 107 identifies the limited areas of governance that lie in the "exclusive" control of the national government.  Article 111 clarifies that national government must regulate these areas and, more important, that national legislation in this area will trump any inconsistent regional legislation.  It also provides that in areas outside the national government's exclusive jurisdiction, regional legislation would trump national legislation.  To avoid doubt, Article 117 adds that, except for laws that fall within the areas of exclusive federal control, the regions have the right to ignore any federal legislation that conflicts with regional legislation.  Given the stakes involved, the description of exclusive powers is susceptible to variant readings, some expansive and some very narrow.  For example, the national government's power to "regulat[e] commercial policy across regional and governate boundaries" seems to be modeled on the commerce clause of the U.S. constitution&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;a provision that has been interpreted in very different ways over the years.<br /><br /><a name=3>3</a>. The September 18 draft of the Iraqi constitution contained an Article 2 which included a provision that (1) requires all laws in Iraq to be consistent with certain ill-defined Islamic legal norms and (2) guarantees that all laws in Iraq shall respect any human rights norms that are guaranteed by the constitution.  It is not entirely clear that the federal courts have the authority both to establish the meaning of these provisions and to ensure that regional governments respect them.  A textual argument could be made either way.  Important constituencies in Iraq, however, believe that the constitution must be read to preclude review.  Illuminating in this respect are the comments made at the United States Institute for Peace by Peter Galbraith, a former U.S. diplomat who served as an adviser to the Kurds during the constitutional drafting process. Galbraith apparently told an audience that during the negotiations, people could not agree on whether the federal courts should create a unified interpretation of Islamic law or human rights and force all regions to abide by them or whether, instead, regions should interpret the constitutional command for themselves.  He was paraphrased as saying that "the [Supreme Federal] Court was stripped of its power to review regional legislation. As such, the concern for rights may lie beyond the scope of the federal court. In a patriarchal society, the federal constitutional guarantee of an individual's right to choose the application of civil or religious personal status law is nullified; moreover, what is written in the federal constitution will be irrelevant to regions that have the right to determine their own legislative framework."  See the <a href="http://www.usip.org/newsmedia/releases/2005/1005_iraq.html">report</a> on the USIP website.<br /><br /><a name=4>4</a>. With respect to important rights, the September 18 draft states that parliament has the right to regulate (and thus to define) the nature of the right.  See for example, Articles 36-38. <br /><br /><a name=5>5</a>. The September 18 draft constitution provides woefully few meaningful protections for judicial independence.  Although several provisions describe judicial institutions as independence, Articles 84-98 give the parliament discretionary powers over the structure of the federal courts, their procedures, the manner of nominating judges, the procedures for judicial discipline (and the reasons for disciplining them) and the staffing to be resolved by parliamentary legislation.<br /><br /><a name=6>6</a>. Article 109 of the September 18 draft addresses the distribution of oil revenues.  It provides that the allotments will established by parliament in consultation with regional or governate-level governments, as appropriate.   Revenues from existing fields are to be distributed evenly to the various regions of the country.  But the parliament and regions can adjust this scheme, as they feel appropriate, to compensate regions that have suffered under previous regimes.  In other words, the Kurds and Shi`a could strike a parliamentary deal to keep oil revenues from current fields for themselves as compensation for their suffering under Saddam Hussein's regime.  The constitution is, if anything, even more open-ended.<br /><br /><a name=7>7</a>. Article 107 of the September 18 draft of the constitution places both the national army and "national security policy" within the exclusive control of the federal government.  However, Article 117 explicitly permits regions to establish not just "police" but also "security forces."  Regions such as Kurdistan will almost surely interpret this to mean that
 they can establish heavily armed military units.   In the short term, some regional militias---particularly the battle tested militias that would be under the control of the Kurdish government would probably be more effective than many units of the national Iraqi army.<br />  <br /><a name=8>8</a>. In a further sign that regions can have a role in policing borders and can exercise other functions normally associated with a national government, regions have an unusual, if ill-defined, right to exercise joint control with the national government over customs revenues, according to Article 110 of the September 18 draft of the constitution.</font> <br /><br /><br /><em>Clark Lombardi is a professor at the University of Washington School of Law specializing in Islamic law.</em><br />

		<title>Consult or Insult? The Senate and Harriet Miers</title>

A dozen days earlier, President George W. Bush had met with the identical Senate leaders who attended a July 11 session which opened the first search.  That meeting seemed an auspicious beginning, insofar as President Bush vowed to cooperate with the Senate, particularly through meaningful consultation.  True consultation was essential because O'Connor cast the swing vote on many critical issues and Democrats promised to oppose any nominee who might upset the Supreme Court's delicate balance.  However, no real consultation occurred before Miers's Monday nomination.<br />  <br />Bush had suggested he would follow a process like that employed when initially choosing Judge John Roberts.  The president once again vowed to consult fully with the Senate. In conducting the search which yielded Roberts, Bush pledged that his advisers, such as Andrew Card, would secure Senate members' opinions about the process.  The White House has been fond of reminding the public that it spoke with the vast majority of senators; however, that statistic meant little if the president and his counselors did not listen.<br /><br />Bush's apparently conciliatory remarks seemed to augur well. However, his record of engaging in little actual consultation belied those views. When the chief executive and his staff talked with Democrats before the Roberts nomination, they may not have heard or applied the ideas Democrats espoused.  Senator Leahy (D-Vt.), who attended both meetings, said consultation "never resulted in any meaningful discussions," and the "President never shared his thinking, as is the nature of true consultation."  Indeed, when Bush first named Roberts, it was a surprise, not a "result of meaningful consultation," while he "then preemptively announced" Roberts's nomination for chief justice with no consultation.  After the latest meeting, Leahy added: "I hope President Bush will share with us his intention, and even seek our advice before he acts; that little thing called the advice-and-consent clause of the Constitution." <br /><br />Despite the recent promise to consult, there was virtually no pre-nomination consultation on the latest nominee.  On September 27, White House press secretary Scott McClellan declared "I think we were essentially wrapping that [consultation] process up today."  He asserted that 70 senators and 17 of the 18 Judiciary Committee members were consulted.  However, McClellan seemingly arrived at these overinflated figures by conflating consultation in the first search with the new search.  In fact, the White House apparently consulted only a minuscule number of senators.  Even that consultation was severely truncated.  For instance, Miers ironically had a few-minute conversation with Senator Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), who described it as "consultation in name only."   He elaborated:  "There is no back and forth.  It's just, 'Give us some names.'  I said to her, 'Look, I'd like to know who the president is considering.' And she didn't say anything."<br /> <br />Harriet Miers may ultimately prove to be a highly qualified nominee who secures approval as easily as Judge Roberts.  For example, the confirmation process and Judiciary Committee hearings may reveal that Miers possesses great intelligence, integrity, independence and industriousness as well as balanced temperament, attributes which Roberts so capably demonstrated.  Miers's experience in the White House, on the Texas State Lottery Commission and the Dallas City Council, as Texas and Dallas Bar President, and as the leader of a substantial law firm could also diversify the Supreme Court, all of whose present members, except O'Connor, are former federal appellate judges. However, if the confirmation process somehow goes awry and devolves into a contentious fight, President Bush and his advisers can blame themselves for not freely and fully consulting senators, closely listening to what they said and actually implementing the advice given.  <br />    <br /><br /><em>Carl Tobias is the Williams Professor of Law at the University of Richmond</em><br />

Five members of the FSB, the Russian state security service, were at my hotel door at 1 AM to let me know that they had determined the extent to which I would be allowed to represent my client.  In organising my expulsion and the proposed disbarment of the majority of Mikhail Khodorkovsky&#39;s legal team, the Russian Federation had decided that one more overt attack on the rule of law could be snuck past the West during this new period of convergence - a time when the Realpolitiks of the West and East have merged around the superiority of oil over European values, a convergence that is the exact opposite of that once imagined by Soviet-era dissident Andrei Sahakarov and others.  Instead of joining with the West on fundamental human rights the Kremlin has managed to collaborate with key Western states around the most base and crude economic interests.<br />  <br />The following note represents an attempt to outline the guiding principles of this new convergence and demonstrate clearly that the Khodorkovsky case, rather than being anyone&#39;s view of a &quot;one off&quot; one-time affair, is symptomatic of a method of governing based above all else on the Kremlin&#39;s growing belief in its own impunity.  The fundamentals of this system are proximity to power, the vertical of power, debasement of judicial independence, the establishment of a new Kremlin-based Oligarchy, and fuel diplomacy as a black jack to be used against recalcitrant nations not willing to bend to the Kremlin&#39;s dictates of the Kremlin.<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/khodorkovsky.php">Khodorkovsky Trial</a> | Audio: <a href="/monitor/2005/10/khordorkovsky-case-georgetown-u.php">Political and economic ramifications of the Khodorkovsky case</a> [Robert Amsterdam]<br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br />It is abundantly clear with respect to domestic and foreign policy that both the rule of law and attornment to international treaties have been dispensed with in today&#39;s Russia in favor of a Byzantine form of tribute organised by the Kremlin to extort maximum benefit from foreign leaders and maximum control over any form of domestic opposition.  The prime example of this non-rule based system of exchange, demonstrated time and time again, has been the relationship between President Putin and erstwhile German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.  Harking back to the concert of Europe these two leaders, in their 40 or so recent direct meetings, have replaced transparency in foreign relations with the anarchy of personal diplomacy.  The result has been some of the most staggering departures from democratic values witnessed in Germany in 50 years.  In an example of what I call &quot;constitutional dumping&quot; the German Chancellor supported the illegal expropriation of Yukos as well as appearing to dismiss Russia&#39;s role in Chechnya in favor of German companies obtaining the pole position in acquiring Russian energy assets.  Schroeder was not alone, as Italy&#39;s Berlusconi and France&#39;s Chirac were not far behind.  In giving up both the rule of law and transparency, evidenced by German Trade Associations publicly instructing companies to clear acquisitions with the Kremlin, Germany has managed to both estrange European neighbours and damage US/German relations while breaching its WTO obligations.  <br /><br />This kind of personal proximity to power is a key aspect of the vertical of power which has been established in Russia over the last number of years without comment from the West.  In fact in many ways the attack on the press, NGOs, human rights defenders and even the very basis of Russian federalism post-Beslan has been accepted by Western states as a trade off for stability.  It is this logic that has been favored in explaining why Western states have remained silent concerning the illegal auction of Yukos assets and the Khodorkovsky show trial. But how long can the West stay invested in the promotion of autocracy in Russia without some possible backdraft on Western values?  <br /><br />One central aspect of the new vertical of power is the re-emergence of the big lie.  The Russian state is presently adopting the big lie as a central organising basis of its media outreach. From the submarine <em>Kursk</em> to the Nord-ost and Beslan hostage-takings to Khodorkovsky, the Kremlin has lied and lied and lied again.  Never has the West called out the Russians for this practice.  Never has the West combined the growing control of television in Russia with the growing penchant of the Kremlin to dissemble.  Never has the integrity of Western leaders themselves been so under attack. <br /> <br />The impunity around the use of the big lie grows exponential with each use.  The purchase for something like fair market value of Sibneft at the very time of the destruction of Yukos completely disconnects the attack on Khodorkovsky from both privatisation and tax abuse.  Sibneft was a far greater target under both headings.  This and the phoney tax audits of foreign companies which were aggressively covered by the press to mask the selective prosecution of Yukos and are now being resolved for pennies on the dollar further demonstrate the complete lawlessness, manipulation and improper purpose that are the hall marks of the present Kremlin. <br /> <br />The debasement of judicial independence as evidenced by the decisions in both Yukos and Khodorkovsky, involving grotesque violations of the right to counsel, right to liberty and right to a fair trial, has done enormous damage to Russian claims of judicial improvement.  The willingness of Western courts to enforce decisions of intellectually and morally bankrupt Russian courts as found by the Parliamentary Council of Europe in its recent report concerning Yukos executives serves as a high water mark with respect to western Europe collaborating with the worst tendencies of executive interference in the judiciary.  How Russia can use international treaties to enforce these decisions while thumbing its nose at the most basic principles of the European Convention on Human Rights leads the administration of justice in Europe into disrepute.<br />  <br />If the purchase of Sibneft stands for anything other than the selective prosecution of Yukos it stands for the big lie that somehow the Kremlin is intent on attacking either oligarchs or corruption.  The Kreml
in and the seven advisers closest to Putin control over one quarter trillion dollars of energy-related assets and seem intent on more.  The continued silence of the West in respect to the theft of Yukos is being rewarded by a further watering-down of the market economy - the clear intent of the Kremlin is to replace the transparency of Khodorkovsky and Yukos with the black hole of Gazprom and Sibneft.  While the West panders to a phoney Kremlin attack on alleged Yukos money laundering it fails to explore who are the partners of Abromovich in his sale of Sibneft assets to the Kremlin.<br /><br />&quot;Fuel diplomacy&quot; is a term presently used to describe the fairly brazen use by the Kremlin of energy as weapon to be deployed not only for state purposes, but for the very improper purpose of disciplining foreign countries such as the United States or Holland who dare to attack Kremlin policies or practices.  Beyond the use of poultry or flowers it is energy that has been used in the &quot;near abroad&quot; of the Ukraine, Baltics and Moldova to discipline neighbours whose policies or pricing is not seen as consistent with the Kremlin.  The recent intervention by Russia in the domestic politics of Germany in the staging of the Baltic pipeline signing (a deal that contains a substantial political component) and the pipeline itself demonstrate Europe&#39;s weak-kneed willingness to substitute Russia&#39;s interests for those of the Baltics or Poland.  Why the seizure of Yukos and restructuring of the oil industry by the Kremlin has not been reviewed by the competition authorities in Europe is beyond one&#39;s imagination, given the unlimited attack on US industries conducted time and time again by Brussels. <br /> <br />My expulsion and the attempt to disbar my Russian colleagues which commenced at 1 AM that September morning has represented to me just one small example of where Europe, sleeping on these fundamental issues, leaves human rights and the rule of law.  <br />    <br /><br /><em>Robert Amsterdam is international defense counsel for Mikhail Khodorkovsky</em><br />

She has never been a judge.  Is concern about this notable gap in her resume justified?  Yes, but mainly because it raises questions about whether she has a sufficient capacity for treachery.<br /><br />Chief Justice John Marshall, Justice Joseph Story, Justice Robert Jackson - this and similar lists of eminent Supreme Court Justices without prior judicial experience have become ubiquitous in recent days.  President Bush himself cited Justice Byron White (appointed by a Democratic President) and Chief Justice William Rehnquist as more recent exemplars of those whose judicial careers commenced on the highest court in the land.  The point is clear.  History demonstrates that prior judicial experience is not a necessary prerequisite for distinguished service on the United States Supreme Court.<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/miers.php">Harriet Miers</a> | Text: <a href="/gazette/2005/10/harriet-miers-george-w-bush-letters.php">Miers-Bush letters</a> | Video: <a  href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/monitor/2005/10/miers-us-supreme-court-nomination.php">Miers nomination</a><br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br />At some level, the claim seems unassailable.  The argument could be expanded by noting Justices with only brief service on the bench.  John Marshall Harlan II sat on the court of appeals for less than a year before his elevation.  For that matter, current Chief Justice John Roberts served for only two years on the court of appeals before his nomination to the Supreme Court.<br /><br />So is the clamor about Harriet Miers&#39; lack of judicial experience misplaced?  Yes and no.<br /><br />These historical arguments suggest the limited relevance of the past judicial service itself. Finding a good set of black robes is not difficult.  It does not take long to get used to sitting through oral arguments without unseemly grimaces (though some never learn the skill) or to figure out how best to use law clerks.<br /><br />Mastering the Chevron doctrine or the automobile exception to the warrant requirement takes more time, but that too is manageable.  Moreover, other legal jobs involve grappling with some of the complex matters that come before the Supreme Court.  The briefs also help.<br /><br />Service on the bench, though, does relate to arguably the most significant qualification for serving on the United States Supreme Court, a commitment to independence.<br /><br />The office of Justice of the United States Supreme Court is one of the most honored positions in our republic.  Only a person of colossal arrogance could fail to feel deeply, deeply grateful to the President who nominated her.  Yet the judicial role commands such ingratitude.<br /><br />One of the most important functions of the Supreme Court is to say &quot;no&quot; to the President.  The Court stands as a principal barrier against executive usurpation.<br /><br />The Court&#39;s docket changes over time.  Abortion or the Ten Commandments may or may not be central issues in the decades to come. The subject of executive power, however, has shown remarkable longevity.  From <em>Marbury v. Madison</em> in 1803 through the illegal combatant detention cases last year, the Supreme Court has played a critical role in reviewing assertions of Presidential prerogative.  Judicial scrutiny of the War on Terror stands as just the current variation on a longstanding theme.  Can a nominee reject the President&#39;s claim of necessity when the Constitution so requires?<br /><br />As Presidents change over time, rebuffing the pleas of successive executives may become easier.  But long after Presidents depart, their agenda may live on.  Indeed, at least since John Adams, Presidents have looked to the judiciary as a way to entrench their policies against the vagaries of electoral politics.<br /><br />Can a nominee be counted on to decide a case without reference to the views of her patron? Can a nominee be trusted to bite the hand that fed her?<br /><br />What evidence can one have about the answer to such a question?   Much of the work of practicing lawyers demands zealous advocacy of a client&#39;s position; loyalty, not independence, is the coin of the realm.  Good lawyers must retain their professional judgment, but attorneys seek to realize the goals of their clients.<br /><br />Prior service as a judge does not guarantee independence, but it helps.  Judges exist in a culture that prizes independence.  In other words, they pride themselves on betraying their friends.  Particular judicial decisions also may demonstrate a nominee&#39;s independence, or lack thereof.<br /><br /> Perhaps more significantly, the initial appointment to a lower court may itself indicate--or create--an independent status in the legal community that might conduce to an independent approach on the high court.  From this perspective, the fact of prior appointment, rather than the length of service, is key.  Well-connected friends are useful (aren&#39;t they always), but federal judges who owe their jobs to connections are more likely to be indebted to Senators, not Presidents.  Like their initial appointment, their further elevation to the Supreme Court generally reflects something other than closeness to the Chief Executive.<br /><br />Does prior judicial experience provide a perfect measure of independence?  Absolutely not.  The 1952 <em>Steel Seizure</em> case posed the question of how rigorously the Supreme Court would review President Truman&#39;s assertion of executive authority, justified in part by the claimed necessities of the Korean War.  Of President Truman&#39;s four nominees then sitting on the high court, the two appointed with prior judicial service (Chief Justice Vinson and Justice Minton) supported the President, while the two without such experience (Justices Burton and Clark) joined the majority in rejecting the President&#39;s actions.<br /><br />By the same token, some non-judicial positions can offer proof of independence.  Prosecutors and other government lawyers often have the opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to the rule of law in the face popular or political pressure.<br /><br />Judicial experience is not critical, but some indicator of independence is.<br /> <br />Justice Robert Jackson stands as the prime example of the independent Justice who came to the Court with governmental, but not judicial, experience.  Justice Jackson served as Solicitor Gen
eral and Attorney General in the Roosevelt Administration.  Five Justices participated in both the <em>Steel Seizure</em> case and in the infamous Korematsu decision in 1944, which affirmed the detention of United States citizens of Japanese ancestry.  Of these five, only Justice Jackson rebuffed the claims of executive power in both cases, thus biting the hand of President Roosevelt who appointed him and of President Truman, Roosevelt&#39;s Vice President.<br /><br />Seeking to cloak himself in this mantle of independence, John Roberts asserted that Justice Jackson was one of the Justices he most esteemed, and he cited Jackson&#39;s turning the tables on the executive as a prime justification for his admiration.  With Roberts&#39; extensive career in the Justice Department and his established role in the Supreme Court bar (in addition to his two years on the bench), he could lay a plausible claim to this Jacksonian tradition.  Roberts&#39; service as a &quot;grand clerk&quot; to Jackson provided symbolic resonance.  (Roberts clerked for Justice Rehnquist who clerked for Justice Jackson.)<br /><br />Can Harriet Miers make the same claim?  The White House Counsel generally functions as a more traditional advocate.  Further complicating matters for Miers, President Bush&#39;s allies have defended her nomination by citing her loyalty to the President.  Such personal loyalty is a political virtue, but not a judicial one. <br /><br />For his part, President Bush vouched for the type of jurist Harriet Miers would be.  He promised that she would be &quot;a good conservative judge&quot;.  If the law so requires, will she be willing to issue an opinion that would run contrary to at least some perceptions of what that phrase means?  Will she be capable of the Jacksonian double-cross?<br /><br />Perhaps, but the evidence for such a disloyal streak is not readily apparent.  Some sign of a treacherous heart would be reassuring.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Robert Schapiro is a law professor at Emory University School of Law, where he teaches constitutional law and federal courts.</em><br />

Foley</a> of Florida Coastal School of Law says that the less-than-rigorous procedural rules governing the tribunals and military commissions at Guantanamo Bay endanger us as surely as any terrorists...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/brianfoleyleft.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he prevailing belief that the procedures at Guantanamo Bay (GTMO) protect us because they make it easy to keep "enemy combatants" locked away is misguided.  When legal process is not rigorous and convictions are easy to win, the danger is not only to the accused.  Public safety is compromised: under the existing rules, cursory investigations are sufficient for convictions. This is far too likely to lead to false convictions that will lull us into the sense that we're reducing the threat of terrorism when we're not. <br /><br />It's beyond argument that the rules the tribunals at GTMO use are weak and that, as an epistemological matter, we can't trust their determinations.  The "Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRT)," which decide whether a prisoner is an "enemy combatant," use a low standard of proof -- a preponderance of the evidence, with a "rebuttable presumption" in favor of the government's evidence.  The government can use notoriously unreliable evidence: hearsay, evidence coerced out of prisoners, and "classified" evidence kept secret from the prisoner.  Access to lawyers is forbidden, and only one of the military "judges" is required to have a law degree.  <br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo</a> | Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/militarycommissions.php">Military Tribunals</a> | Text: <a href="/gazette/2005/08/military-commission-procedure-changes.php">Military commission procedure changes</a> | Video: <a  href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/monitor/2004/10/military-commissions-colonel-will-gunn.php">Military commissions</a><br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br />The "military commissions" that President Bush announced two months after 9/11 to try enemy combatants suspected of particular crimes are equally unreliable.  Although there is a presumption of innocence and the burden of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt and the prisoner can have a lawyer (with restrictions), only one of the "judges" has to be a lawyer, and convictions can be based on hearsay, coerced testimony, and secret evidence. <br /><br />One purpose of having rigorous rules of evidence, high burdens of proof, and trained counsel to help an accused mount a defense is to improve public safety.  Rigorous rules put the government to its proofs when it carries out its crime-fighting and national security duties.  Rigorous rules protect us all by helping ensure that the government is truly ferreting out crime and not just putting on a show. <br /><br />But when winning is easy, there's no incentive to conduct rigorous investigations.  Why sift through evidence or pound the pavement to chase down leads, when it's so much easier to pound a prisoner instead?  Why track down an important witness when you can just use what another prisoner says he heard that witness say, as hearsay? <br /><br />Forcing the government to meet a high burden of proof with reliable evidence would promote vigorous anti-terrorism action.  We would have to roll up our sleeves and thoroughly investigate suspects.  We would have to work with foreign intelligence and police. We would have to hunt down and investigate suspects' family, friends and acquaintances, which could lead to extensive knowledge about terrorists and their shadowy networks.  <br /><br />The rules at GTMO let us shirk these duties. <br /><br />Weak rules also make it hard to hold the government accountable.  We can't measure our progress in this war, because, logically, we can't tell if the CSRT determinations of enemy combatant status are accurate.  About 246 of the more than 751 prisoners have been released.  How do we know &#8212; given that there was no requirement to investigate thoroughly &#8212; these men pose no danger?  Dangerous prisoners may have been released as a reward for providing evidence (accurate or not) against other prisoners.  <br /><br />Take the example of Yasir Hamdi, a US-Saudi citizen jailed at GTMO who challenged his imprisonment all the way up to the US Supreme Court last year.  After the Court held that Hamdi must be given legal process to challenge his imprisonment as an "enemy combatant," the government released him, deporting him to Saudi Arabia and forcing him to renounce his US citizenship. Did it turn out, after all, that he wasn't dangerous &#8212; a conclusion that contradicts every government pronouncement about him up to then?  Did the government want to avoid the Court-ordered evidentiary hearing, which might have revealed that our politicians were lying about Hamdi's guilt? Or did the government release this man for some other reason, such as a backroom deal with the House of Saud? <br /><br />For all we know, actual terrorists are delivering innocent people to US authorities and convincing them that these people are "enemy combatants."  Under the existing GTMO rules, a real terrorist could easily provide enough information to make such a claim look plausible, if not dead-accurate.  The evidence that would lead to a conviction could be kept secret from the suspect.  <br /><br />Some people believe that the processes at GTMO keep us safe because they seem to err on the side of caution, by "casting a wide net." Each radical Muslim swept off the international street is one less possible terrorist, right?  Wrong. This "wide net" feeds the fires that motivate terrorism. A narrower, more accurate net would be less likely to feed these fires.  For example, if my brother were a terrorist and was captured and convicted, I would mourn his fate, but I probably would not feel it was unjust. But if my brother were not a terrorist and the US captured him, subjected him to a sham trial and locked him away incommunicado at GTMO, and I knew that he was actually innocent, I might declare my own war against the US.  The anger associated with rounding up the wrong people does not stop with their families.  I recall how, when I was a teenager (prime terrorist recruiting age), Iranian militants stormed the US embassy in Teheran and took Americans hostage.  I had no relatives among the hostages, but I wanted to invade Iran myself. I agreed with the widespread sentiment, "Bomb Iran." <br /><br />"Wide nets" and easy convictions don't make us safer. They actually increase our risk. The CSRTs should require more rigorous process. The military commissions should use the Uniform Code of Military Justice (which applies to POWs).  Better, we should try suspected terrorists in federal district courts, which provide more process. <br /><br />There's no rule of law that requires the US to de
ny rights at GTMO: it is a policy decision.  It was a bad decision.  The loose procedures do not protect national security, but political interests and ambitions.  <br /><br />Such procedures are a feel-good measure that we can't afford.  <br /><br /><br /><em>Brian J.

President Bush, seeking to deflect criticism of the federal response to the storm, noted as much, just before asserting that there was, and would be, no discrimination in governmental response.  But television images of thousands of African Americans stranded on rooftops in the flooded city belied that Presidential assurance, unmasking racial inequities with disturbing clarity.  Astonishingly, during evacuation, these residents were given no transportation out of a below-sea level city in the path of a Category 5 hurricane.  Compounding the horror, they were subsequently forced to endure the inhumane conditions of sweltering shelters, and were eventually driven to "looting" flooded grocery stores to find water, food, medicine and other necessities.  More disturbing still were the images we did not see but could readily imagine:  the bloated, rotting corpses of those who had perished.<br /><br />Commentators across the political spectrum began to flirt with the seemingly inescapable conclusion of racism.  But this alarming insight was quickly recast as merely a difference in perception between whites and blacks, an unfortunate misperception &#8212; by blacks &#8212; caused, perhaps, by an isolated incident of governmental ineptitude.  Alternatively, we were told that the abandonment of the residents was a function of class, not race, because middle class blacks were able to leave the city while poor white people remained.<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/katrinadisaster.php">Hurricane Katrina Disaster</a> | Video: <a href="/monitor/2005/10/beyond-katrina-georgetown-u-law-center.php">Beyond Katrina</a> | Video: <a  href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/monitor/2005/10/militarys-role-in-disasters-cato.php">The Military&#39;s Role in Disasters</a><br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br />That is a curious analysis indeed.  Labeling the matter as exclusively a class issue ignores the reality that people of color are poor in disproportionately large numbers, while overlooking the legacy of our overtly racist past and the likelihood that subtle forms of institutionalized racism persist.  The argument also seems to assume it is more acceptable to abandon people because they are poor than because they are black. As a matter of ethics, as well as sound policy, neither is acceptable. So strong is our impulse to avoid a conversation about race, however, that we are missing an important opportunity to think seriously and deeply about the intersection of race, class and lack of environmental protection.  <br /><br /> Katrina was not an isolated incident.  It was an exceptionally large echo of a socioeconomic political condition known popularly as environmental injustice, the longstanding pattern whereby people of color and the poor are exposed to greater environmental risk while receiving fewer environmental amenities.  Between the two, race has a statistically stronger link than class, and recent reports reveal that the association between race and environmental hazards is increasing.  If we examine the background policies and decisions that ultimately led to the devastation in the wake of Katrina, we begin to see the event as part of this larger pattern.<br /><br /> For example, planners anticipated that approximately 100,000 transit-dependent residents of New Orleans, mostly poor and black, would have no private transportation out of the city in an emergency.  The federal, state and local governments made no provision for them.  Instead, evacuation plans relied on private automobiles.  Environmental justice activists, citing Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and the 2005 release of chlorine gas from a train crash in South Carolina, note that this is not the first time people of color have been overlooked by emergency planners and then received slower assistance afterwards.<br /><br /> Such fend-for-yourself planning is all too common. For example, emergency plans for many citizens living and working in the shadows of refineries, chemical plants and other large facilities provide "shelter in place" alarms in the event of an accidental release.  Their protection against deadly gases: closed doors and shut windows.  In other risk-producing contexts, subsistence fishing populations &#8212; predominantly Asian, Native American, and black &#8212; are protected not by reductions in mercury emissions but by fish advisories, signs that tell them not to eat the fish.  Increasingly, these "risk avoidance' strategies are coming to replace the strategies of reducing or eliminating the risk itself.<br /><br /> Local leaders also point to the repeated failure of the Corp of Engineers to heed community concerns and close down the underutilized MRGO Canal.  Residents had long feared the Canal would act as a "hurricane alley," offering storm surge a path of least resistance toward the City.   Together with eroded wetlands, the Canal had come to be "a shotgun pointed straight at New Orleans."  Unfortunately, that prediction came true. This  is consistent with the consensus among environmental justice advocates that community concerns are routinely dismissed by public officials.<br /><br /> There have been other questionable decisions that are consistent with existing patterns, decisions that made Katrina's aftermath more deadly.  Environmental justice advocates have maintained, and studies have confirmed, that cleanups under environmental laws take longer and are less protective in people of color communities.  Remedies such as "capping" sites, i.e, placing asphalt or fill on top of the contamination instead of treatment, have been shown to be more common in communities of color.  In New Orleans, three Superfund sites were affected by the storm and flood waters.  One was the Agricultural Street Landfill, a 94-acre site that included a predominantly black, low-income community housing project and elementary school built on a municipal landfill containing liquid hazardous waste.  EPA chose to excavate and treat less than two-thirds of the site, instead placing  two feet of dirt on top of much of the hazardous waste. So concerned were the residents that they had filed a lawsuit seeking relocation, a suit pending at the time Katrina hit.  In addition to the obvious question &#8212; why one would cap a contaminated site located in an area prone to hurricanes and flooding? &#8212; we must also ask whet
her the cleanup remedies for the New Orleans sites fit this national pattern of unequal treatment, and consequently made environmental conditions worse.<br /><br />Serious questions remain about the role race and class might play in the cleanup and rebuilding of New Orleans.  Will there be protective cleanups in poor people of color neighborhoods?  Will these communities have an effective voice in planning and rebuilding decisions?  Will people who have been displaced be given fair-wage employment in the reconstruction?  Or instead, will environmental and labor laws be waived or inequitably applied, while the formerly stable communities of the working poor make way for a gentrified New Orleans &#8212;  a vision already voiced by some elite New Orleans families?<br /> <br /> The big question remains: will we have a serious inquiry into race, class and environmental protection in order to root out and eliminate inequities and provide safe environments for everyone?  Or will we continue to engage in collective denial about well-documented disparities, thus allowing decisions, policies, attitudes, skewed implementation of laws, and deeply embedded institutional dynamics to continue to keep race and class inequities on a robust trajectory upward?  <br />        <br /> Katrina has presented us this choice in the most unambiguous terms.<br /><br /><br /><em>Eileen Gauna is a Professor of Law at Southwestern University School of Law, a Visiting Professor at University of New Mexico and a member scholar of the Center for Progressive Reform.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.miami.edu/facadmin/faculty/svladeck.html">Stephen Vladeck</a> of the University Miami School of Law says that a narrow interpretation of the US Supreme Court&#39;s classic 1866 ruling against military tribunals in <em>Ex parte Milligan</em> might actually be in the best interest of suspected dirty bomber Jose Padilla as he again takes his challenge to indefinite detention under presidential order before the US Supreme Court...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/vladeck.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>C</strong></font>ivil libertarians love <em>Ex parte Milligan</em>. The celebrated ruling unanimously rejected the use of military tribunals to try Confederate sympathizers for printing anti-Union propaganda in Indiana newspapers, and stood, at least when handed down, as an emphatic reaffirmation of the rule of law in the aftermath of the Civil War. Even today, <em>Milligan</em> as an abstraction has powerful rhetorical force. For that, we need look no further than a 1999 episode of <em>Law &amp; Order</em> or the 1998 movie <em>The Siege</em>, both of which explicitly invoked the 1866 Supreme Court decision as the great bulwark against extrajudicial detention &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; executive imprisonment without charge.<br /><br /> It should come as no surprise, then, that allusions to <em>Milligan</em> are ubiquitous in the case of accused "dirty bomber" Jose Padilla. Padilla, a U.S. citizen, has been held in a South Carolina brig since June 2002 as an "enemy combatant," without charge and without trial. Yet, as Padilla's challenge to his detention makes its way to the Supreme Court for the second time in three Terms, the gravity of the constitutional question presented has been largely sidestepped in favor of the meaning of one decidedly ambiguous and open-ended statute &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) passed by Congress one week after September 11. Padilla's central contention is that the AUMF does not authorize his detention, and therefore does not satisfy the statutory mandate that "[n]o citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained except pursuant to an Act of Congress." Thus far, four federal courts have split on whether Padilla is correct, with the Fourth Circuit most recently answering "no" on September 9.<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/padilla.php">Jose Padilla</a> | Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/enemycombatants.php">Enemy Combatants</a> | Text: <a  href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/gazette/2005/09/padilla-indefinite-detention-ruling.php">Indefinite detention ruling</a> [4th Circuit]<br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /> The split in authority notwithstanding, even the most amateur Court watchers should have a fairly easy time forecasting the likely result in Padilla's return trip to Washington because of two atypical facts: First, the very same case was before the (almost) very same Court just two years ago. Although the majority in <em>Padilla I</em> reversed the Second Circuit on jurisdictional grounds, the four dissenting Justices &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; were unequivocal (albeit in a footnote) that they would hold Padilla's detention unauthorized by statute, and therefore unlawful.<br /><br /> At the same time Padilla first came before the Supreme Court, the Court also decided <em>Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</em>, a case raising largely similar issues on largely similar facts, and which explains why Court watchers needn't look far for a fifth vote. Although four Justices concluded that Hamdi's detention was authorized by the AUMF, Justice Scalia was not one of them. To the surprise of everyone who didn't listen to the oral argument, Scalia dissented, arguing, <em>inter alia</em>, that the Constitution allows extrajudicial detention only via legislative suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. Without reaching whether Congress had authorized Padilla's detention, Scalia relied on the uncontested point that no such suspension had occurred in Hamdi's case. Scalia was equally clear that the same argument applied to any U.S. citizen, including Padilla.<br /><br /> I do not mean to suggest that the result in <em>Padilla II</em> is a foregone conclusion. Anything but. But if the voting from <em>Padilla I</em> and <em>Hamdi</em> holds, Padilla appears to have at least five votes for reversing the Fourth Circuit, no matter who is ultimately confirmed to replace Justice O'Connor. The better question going forward, then, may not be whether Padilla will win, but how. Under well-established interpretive doctrines, there is no conflict between the two competing theories. The constitutional concerns emphasized by Justice Scalia only further bolster interpreting the AUMF as not authorizing Padilla's detention, and therefore as not satisfying the Non-Detention Act. Under this reading, the Court need not reach the deeper constitutional question.<br /><br /> Enter <em>Milligan</em>. Although most who remember Milligan emphasize that the rejection of the tribunals was unanimous, history has long-since forgotten that the Court split right down the middle, 5-4, as to why. Justice Davis's majority opinion held, in sweepingly broad language, that military tribunals were anathema to American democracy, and could never exist "where the courts are open and their process unobstructed." But four Justices, led by Chief Justice Chase, concurred on narrower grounds, maintaining that Congress could constitutionally authorize military tribunals; they just hadn't.<br /><br /> It was entirely because of the available narrower ground that <em>Milligan</em> came to be criticized as overreaching by a bloodthirsty Court weary of the civil liberties disaster that was the U.S. Civil War. And it was only the narrower opinion that was left intact by the 1942 case of the Nazi Saboteurs, <em>Ex parte Quirin</em>, in which the Court unanimously affirmed the use of military tribunals to try eight captured German infiltrators, one of whom was a U.S. citizen. Distinguishing <em>Milligan</em>, or at least Chief Justice Chase's <em>Milligan</em> concurrence, <em>Quirin</em> heavily relied on the extent to which Congress had authorized the tribunals in question.<br /><br /> <em>Milligan</em> therefore suggests a critical consideration about <em>Padilla</em>, and one that has thus far been overlooked: In cases like this, the "why" matters. A lot. Although Congress has not yet passed a "Detention of Enemy Combatants Act," there is no reason to think that, in the aftermath of a reversal of the Fourth Circuit in <em>Padilla II</em>, it wouldn't. As <em>Quirin</em> and the current challenges to military tribunals make clear, it doesn't take much from Congress for courts to find affirmative authorization, and to end their inquiry there. At the same time, although Justice Scalia's constitutional argument &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; t
hat Congress couldn't authorize Padilla's detention without suspending habeas corpus &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; would provide a more lasting and satisfying victory for civil libertarians, it would be open to nearly all of the same criticisms that eventually doomed <em>Milligan</em> as anything more than a history lesson.<br /> <br /> Practically, the only way to avoid the <em>Milligan</em> problem may be a holding that no one is arguing for &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; that the AUMF does authorize Padilla's detention, and that it is unconstitutional when so construed. Then, the restatement of the underlying principle, that the Constitution only countenances extrajudicial detention through suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, would be unfettered by a narrower ground for the result.<br /><br /> As <em>Padilla</em> returns to the Supreme Court this Term, it is an odd theory to argue for, to be sure. But for those who find <em>Padilla</em> to be the ultimate litmus test in the war on terrorism; for those who can't escape references to the infamous "loaded gun" from Justice Jackson's <em>Korematsu</em> dissent; for those who believe that at stake in <em>Padilla</em> is nothing less than the essence of a free society &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; for people like me, in other words &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; it may be our only shot at anything more than a pyrrhic victory.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Stephen I.

Rescue and relief operations were inexcusably slow, and communications and equipment shortfalls made matters even worse.  After several days of finger pointing by city, state, and federal officials, and the resignation of the FEMA administrator, President Bush suggested that he and Congress should consider whether to change federal law so that emergency response in significant natural disasters could be performed by the military.  In other words, if those now in charge can't get it right, let's give the job to the institution that can &#8212; the Department of Defense.  Senator John Warner, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, promised prompt committee review of any specific proposal that is shaped from the President's views.<br /><br />I hope that cooler heads prevail, for three reasons.  First, the DOD does not want the job.  Adding emergency response and police work to the military's responsibilities would undermine the combat training instilled in recruits, while the emergency response tasks would require new training and equipment.  In addition, force configuration and levels would be affected at a time when the military is stressed by its overseas commitments.<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/katrinadisaster.php">Hurricane Katrina Disaster</a> | Video: <a  href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/monitor/2005/10/militarys-role-in-disasters-cato.php">The Military&#39;s Role in Disasters</a><br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br />Second, putting the military in charge in a domestic natural disaster cuts against our cultural grain.  The United States has been proudly unique in entrusting law enforcement to civilian forces, managed and controlled by civilians.  Our federal system has helped cement control over and accountability for law enforcement activities and decisions at the lowest levels of government, closest to the operations being conducted.  Our revolutionary and constitutional heritage, fed by experiences in England and of the English military in the colonies, led to the creation of civilian and military spheres in government, and to the unequivocal subordination of the military to civilian authority.<br /><br />Although laws and traditions have made military presence in the homeland exceptional, the domestic use of troops has been a feature of government since President Washington called out the militia to put down the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794.  Since then, federal troops have been occasionally activated to help keep the peace, aid local governments in natural disasters, and enforce federal and state laws.  The Constitution contemplates that Congress may call for a military response to extraordinary events in the states (invasion, domestic violence, insurrection), and the President could deploy federal troops to defend the homeland in the event of terrorist attack or similar threat to national security.  <br /><br />In the years just before and after the Civil War, federal troops were sometimes deployed as part of civilian posses &#8212; to enforce the Fugitive Slave Law before the war, and to enforce Reconstruction laws and to assist federal marshals at the polls in the 1876 presidential election.  When it appeared that the eventual victor, Rutherford B. Hayes, won by one electoral vote over Democrat Samuel Tilden, disputes arose over votes in South Carolina, Louisiana, and Florida, where it was alleged that the military presence intimidated voters into voting for the Republican candidates.  When counting showed that Tilden had won the election in the popular vote, a political deal was made where Southern Democrats agreed to deliver electoral votes sufficient to hand the presidency to Hayes in return for a promise that federal troops would leave the southern states.  Less than two years later, the Posse Comitatus Act was enacted.  The PCA makes criminal military participation in executing the laws unless expressly authorized by the Constitution or by Congress.<br /><br />Third, the current structure for disaster response amply provides for a military role, in subordination to civilian authorities.  Although the PCA supplies a general statutory prohibition against domestic use of troops to enforce the law, the constitutional authority of the President and a number of statutory exceptions undercut or counter-balance the rule.  The minuet between President Bush and Governor Blanco that was played out as Katrina made landfall was framed in part by laws that give the President the authority, either on the request of a Governor or on his own initiative, to deploy federal troops to provide emergency response and to put down civil disorder, such as looting.  <br /><br />Following the tradition embedded in the PCA, DOD provides support to civil authorities, in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security (the overseer of FEMA), and only when local, state, and other federal resources are "overwhelmed."  In addition, the National Response Plan (NRP) provides for a "proactive federal response to catastrophic events" in anticipation of an event "that almost immediately exceeds resources normally available to State and local authorities."  If such a federal response is believed warranted by the Secretary of DHS, immediate deployments of federal assets may begin while standard procedures for notification and coordination with States and local governments are completed as time permits.  Although Katrina surely qualified as such an event, DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff did not declare Katrina an incident of national significance until the evening after the storm made landfall, too late for a proactive federal response.   <br /><br />The supposed restrictions of the PCA are a red herring in the post-Katrina discussion.  The law itself simply states a presumption against military involvement in law enforcement, not a rule.  The actual rules provide sufficient authority for any catastrophic contingency, from hurricanes to terrorist attacks with weapons of mass destruction.  That is not to say that the availability of troops will abate such a crisis.  Moreover, the PCA presumption applies to enforcing the laws, not to providing relief personnel and supplies, equipment, or even medical triage.  The NRP and its annexes and incident management system incorporate DOD participation in support of civ
ilian authorities, and equivalent DOD planning documents and doctrine articulate in a fair amount of detail just what DOD can do and how they would do it.<br /><br />DOD did not perform well during Katrina.  Part of the problem was the delay in the President's declaration of a federal emergency and in Secretary Chertoff's declaration of an incident of national significance, both of which had to trigger the military actions.  Beyond the politics or leadership failures, however, the storm itself slowed the deployments, and after the storm struck, military bases, roads, and ports were damaged and further slowed their progress.  <br /><br />What should be done to avert another Katrina-like response to a natural disaster?  The plans contemplate a "proactive" federal response, led by military assets.  However, the decisions that must be made by civilians who may be compromised by countervailing pressures in our federal system cut against a timely DOD deployment.  Due to DOD's traditional view that disaster relief is a secondary role, their leadership is more prone to being reactive than proactive.  Instead of requiring affirmative decisions by federal officials or a State governor that their assets are "overwhelmed" before requesting DOD assistance, some trusted group of persons outside the immediate crisis could be given the authority to trigger the proactive response and enhanced military participation.<br /><br />FEMA messed up.  Let's figure out why.  Maybe it was a leadership problem.  Perhaps burying FEMA inside DHS has imposed costs on effectiveness that could not be seen until a crisis like Katrina.  The NRP and its procedures and annexes are sound in concept, if not in execution, including the components that call for DOD support.  FEMA and DOD have worked effectively together in the past; they should be made to do so again.<br /><br />Finally, the central impediment to efficient emergency response in the event of natural disaster is our federal system.  Mayors and Governors are first line and foundational players in disaster decision making, even where local and State resources cannot mount an effective response.  The mechanisms for the President to assert federal control are spelled out roughly, in the Constitution and in some federal laws and planning documents.  Those written guides cannot, however, overcome the inevitable need for coordination and political agreement by leaders who each have a large stake in the decisions to be made.<br />    <br /><br /><em>William Banks is Director, Institute for National Security and Counter Terrorism, and Laura J. &amp; L.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.ubalt.edu/faculty/mcfarlane.html">Audrey McFarlane</a> of the University of Baltimore School of Law says that concern over the protection of &quot;property rights&quot; in the wake of the US Supreme Court ruling in <em>Kelo v. New London</em> has obscured larger questions relating to the allocation of public resources to large private enterprises, lack of public accountability in economic development decision-making, and land access and land tenure rights for low and moderate income people... <hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/mcfarlane.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=1></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>s one who labors in the relative popular obscurity of studying redevelopment and invisible economic development decision-making processes, I've been secretly pleased to see the <em>Kelo v. New London</em> ruling on eminent domain catapult into the headlines some very important development issues.  Because most coverage of the ruling has been framed in terms of "property rights", the threat to house and home featured in the headlines of every major newspaper and on the nightly news captured popular fears and anxieties about the impact of unchecked power of public-private partnerships on the lives of ordinary individuals who own or aspire to own real property.   Nevertheless, the "property rights" approach hides the reality: the real questions presented in Kelo relate to pressing issues of allocation of public resources towards large private enterprises, lack of public accountability in economic development decision-making as well as land access and land tenure rights for low and moderate income people. <br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/eminentdomain.php">Eminent Domain</a> | Text: <a href="/gazette/2005/06/eminent-domain-ruling-us-sc.php">Kelo v.

Most believe that the government should never be able to take one's home.  Others try to be more even handed and assert that eminent domain should not be used for economic development but rather only for public infrastructure or for "blighted" properties.  In light of the history of the difficulty of determining exactly what blight is (one person's blight is another person's community) the easiness of accepting blight elimination as a basis for the exercise of eminent domain is in effect a way of saying take someone else's properties, not mine.  Therefore, we are still faced with a need to answer fundamental questions about states' and cities' discretion to use land to effectuate social and economic policy choices.  Is revitalizing to ensure jobs and economic vitality really that much different than revitalizing, removing slums and building something new?  Does living in a blighted neighborhood mean one's property is any less personally less important to certain property owners who call that blighted place home?<br /><br /> The dispute over the use of eminent domain for redevelopment is particularly hard to resolve for a number of reasons.  First, the controversy focuses on the practice of taking the property and transferring it to developers, other private persons to put the property to another use consistent with the town's revitalization plans.  It seems a violation of all principles of property ownership to allow government to terminate one property rights for benefit of another.  Yet, would having government run reconstruction projects result in a better outcome? Second, what bright line limits can or should be read into the public use clause to limit government overreaching in the name of economic development and protect property owners. It&#39;s clear in everyone's minds and hearts but putting pen to paper and coming up with principled rules with broad application over a variety of circumstances and situations has proven elusive.   Third, is the possibly the most compelling property rights and personhood aspect of the eminent domain debate is the reality that possibly no justification can erase the impact of losing one's home along with its often deep associated sense of personal autonomy, history, and community.  <br /><br />  The Supreme Court was faced with a difficult decision and came up with an imperfect yet justifiable approach to the challenge.   Although those well-versed in the law understand that the decision reaffirmed a 50+ year old federal constitutional standard of deferential view of the public purposes behind an exercise of eminent domain, the headlines and public reaction reflect a popular understanding that the Supreme Court expanded governmental powers to take properties even though <em>Berman v. Parker</em> (1954) did not stand only for blight removal.   Both <em>Berman</em> and <em>Kelo</em> stand for the proposition that, the exercise of eminent domain for redevelopment or revitalization was generally a legitimate public use because it fulfilled a public purpose, synonymous with an exercise of the police power.  The Court refused to second guess a State's exercise of the police power and engage in a substantive due process-like review of the public purpose justifications of the validity, necessity, reasonable certainty or means end match of the economic development justifications behind the exercise of eminent domain.  Instead, the Court decided to take a hands off approach as a matter of federal constitutional law so long as the exercise of eminent domain was made pursuant to a "carefully considered revitalization plan" <br /><br /> Why such a hands off approach?  Not only was the Court horrified at the prospect of entering into the thicket of line drawing without any coherent or principled way to ensure principled consistency for the myriad of varying factual situations supporting or contradicting a city's justifications for engaging in economic development activities, the Court was also influenced by the economic justifications inherent in economic development.  Deciding that there was a fundamentally accepted tradition of states working to protect and promote industry and economy within a State, who was the Supreme Court to intervene in this hallowed process.<br /><br /> The decision's emphasis on the carefully considered revitalization plan raises two questions about how those plans are put together and whether they really do reflect a plan that adequately takes into account all important or relevant dimensions of the public interest.  First, reliance on the plans raises fundamental questions about the relationships between cities, business corporatio
ns and real estate developers.  Much of redevelopment takes place through some form of public-private partnership.  Cities, that are fixed in place geographically, work very closely with businesses that are mobile to do whatever it takes to make sure they provide a  business friendly environment or face losing that business to another jurisdiction.   They also work closely with real estate developers to facilitate development projects through subsidy, regulatory waivers and the use of eminent domain.  Therefore, the plan may only be a statement of a skewed conclusion about what's best for the public interest, influenced quite heavily by private entities and interests rather than the city acting independently.  The interests and efforts on behalf of the public good and private benefit are intertwined such that private probably does overly influence what we determine to be the public good while ignoring other values of what may also be in the public interest, like economic residential variety, unplanned organic community and local flavor.<br /><br /> Second, the Supreme Court strongly suggested that it was up to the States to decide what additional limits, if any, should be place on the exercise of eminent domain and there have been a flurry of bills that seek to limit the public uses for which eminent domain can be used.  This will be a difficult issue for States to address because it will require them to balance popular sentiment against the possibility of restrictions that could hamper economic development efforts.  Perhaps the most significant bills to watch will be the ones that focus on the revitalization plans and make the planning process more open, publicly accountable and inclusive.  This could serve as the most viable way to naturally limit the exercise of eminent domain by requiring consensus or buy-in, in advance, by a variety of ordinary people.  Such participation and its inevitable slowing of the process if not threatening to alter the course of redevelopment plans is likely to be anathema to cities that are anxious to meet the needs of business.  On the other hand, more citizen participation will do cities and States the ironic favor of forcing them to limit the role of big business in a way they are now relatively powerless to do.<br /><br />  <br /> <br /><em>Audrey McFarlane is an Associate Professor at the University of Baltimore Law School.</em><br />

Bush informed the nation on Thursday that he had &quot;reluctantly&quot; accepted Harriet Miers&#39;s decision to withdraw her nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States.  Miers had been nominated by the President on October 3rd to replace the retiring Sandra Day O&#39;Connor.  The president had said when announcing the nomination that &quot;one person&quot; - Miers - &quot;stood out as exceptionally well suited to sit on the Highest Court of our nation.&quot;<br /><br />Even President Bush&#39;s detractors have grudgingly acknowledged over the years how loyal the president is to those who have served him well.  The fact that Karl Rove didn&#39;t lose his job the instant the president learned that his chief political strategist had played a role in leaking the identity of a CIA operative who is married to a harsh critic of the president&#39;s war with Iraq is the most recent example of the president&#39;s loyalty.  (Note:  By the time you read this op-ed, Rove may have been indicted by a grand jury and may have resigned.  In short, the president stuck by Rove longer than he had earlier suggested he would do, and longer than he probably should have done.  That&#39;s what friends do.) <br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Text: <a href="/gazette/2005/10/miers-supreme-court-nomination.php">Miers nomination withdrawal letter</a> | Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/miers.php">Harriet Miers</a> | Video: <a href="/monitor/2005/10/miers-us-supreme-court-nomination.php">Miers nomination</a> [White House]<br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br />But Miers, whom no one ever suggested had done anything wrong, let alone illegal, was hung out to dry by the president, apparently because conservatives - that&#39;s right, conservatives, not liberals - demanded it in a political crusade that Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Arlen Specter (R-PA) correctly called &quot;disgraceful.&quot; (The explanation proffered by both the president and the nominee about wanting to avoid a potential showdown over White House documents is almost certainly a smokescreen, as the Administration&#39;s refusal to release documents relating to Vice President Dick Cheney&#39;s meetings with energy interests makes plain.)<br /><br />Bluntly stated, instead of going down in the history books as only the third woman ever to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, Harriet Miers will be forever linked as a footnote to the likes of Douglas Ginsburg, Abe Fortas, Caleb Cushing, and George Williams.  For readers not schooled in the <em>Trivial Pursuit</em> approach to Supreme Court history, here&#39;s a playing-card sized summary of these four infamous nominees:<ul><li>Douglas Ginsburg withdrew his name from consideration in 1987 to replace Justice Lewis F. Powell after it became known that he had smoked marijuana as a student and as a law professor.<br /><br /><li>Abe Fortas withdrew his name from consideration in 1968 to replace Chief Justice Earl Warren, and eventually resigned his seat as an associate justice of the Supreme Court, after it was revealed that, while on the bench, he had engaged in financial improprieties.<br /><br /><li>Caleb Cushing withdrew his name from consideration in 1874 to replace Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase because he was unable to overcome the perception that he was a political chameleon.<br /><br /><li>George Williams withdrew his name from consideration in 1874 to replace Chief Justice Chase because of the harsh criticism he had received about his legal acumen.</ul>A couple of other nominations also have been withdrawn for less embarrassing reasons during the Court&#39;s 216-year history - most notably, of course, John Roberts&#39;s nomination to replace Justice O&#39;Connor was withdrawn so that President Bush could nominate Roberts to replace Chief Justice William Rehnquist. But Miers almost certainly will be linked in history to Ginsburg, Fortas, Cushing, and Williams rather than to Roberts.<br /><br />And for what?  Because conservatives were unwilling to accept the president&#39;s repeated assurances that Miers was a conservative?  That sounds an awful lot like what happened to Caleb Cushing.  Or was it because conservatives didn&#39;t think Miers was smart enough?  (After all, her law degree is from Southern Methodist University, not Yale University.)  That sounds like what happened to George Williams.<br /><br />At least no one stooped so low as to accuse Miers of taking drugs or engaging in financial improprieties as Douglas Ginsburg and Abe Fortas had done, respectively...<br /><br />On a happier note, President Bush indicated in his statement &quot;reluctantly&quot; accepting Miers&#39;s decision to withdraw her nomination to the Supreme Court that he was &quot;honored&quot; that she &quot;will continue to serve our nation as White House counsel.&quot;<br /><br />If I were Harriet Miers, I would say thanks, but no thanks. As the saying goes, with friends like that, who needs enemies?<br /><br /><br /><em>Scott D. Gerber is a law professor at Ohio Northern University.

Such a trial would quiet the charges of partisanship. Such a trial could not be dismissed as a blatant exercise in nation-building.  And absent the possibility of capital punishment, such a trial would be free of the flavor of tribal vengeance. <br />   <br />Much as these might sound like the familiar criticisms of the trial of Saddam Hussein scheduled to begin October 19, they are, in fact, the arguments that were directed at the 1961 Israeli trial of Adolf Eichmann by none other than Telford Taylor, the famous Nuremberg prosecutor.<br /><br />The Eichmann trial aroused such controversy in part because it explicitly acknowledged its didactic purpose.  In his memoir, chief Eichmann prosecutor Gideon Hausner candidly admitted that the prosecution had aimed not merely to secure a conviction, but to tell a story that would capture the imagination and conscience of a domestic Israeli and world audience.  That the trial took place in a municipal theater hastily retrofitted to serve as a courtroom perhaps only underscores the complex ways in which an explicitly didactic logic informed the Eichmann trial's staging.  <br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/saddamtrial.php">Saddam Hussein Trial</a> | Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/iraqispecial.php">Iraqi Special Tribunal</a> | Text: <a href="/gazette/2005/10/saddam-tribunal-report-hrw.php">Saddam tribunal report</a> [Human Rights Watch]<br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br />Yet the Eichmann trial was not unique in this respect.  All the most famous war crimes trials &#8212; from Nuremberg to the Milosevic case &#8212; have served didactic ends.  Following in the wake of episodes of mass atrocity, these trials placed courts in the position both of exploring the larger sweep of history and of making visible the value of the law as a tool of such inquiry.  Staged to vindicate the rule of law, these trials also demanded that courts give voice to the narratives of victims and clarify the terms of a contested or suppressed history.  It is hardly a surprise, then, that war crimes trials have been pilloried as everything from acts of victor's justice to spectacles for public consumption.<br /><br />Indeed, the tensions between the need to make visible the rule of law and the desire to use the trial as a tool of teaching history have led some to insist that the <em>just didactic</em> trial is something of an oxymoron.  Hannah Arendt argued in her famous critique of the Eichmann trial that the &quot;purpose of a trial is to render justice, and nothing else.&quot;  We must be wary, Arendt insisted, of using the trial to didactic ends lest these pressures turn the trial into a legal sham, a show trial in the old Stalinist sense.<br />  <br />Clearly this concern is important, yet in my mind it is overstated.  No one, I believe, would deny that the <em>core</em> responsibility of a criminal trial is to resolve the question of guilt in a procedurally fair manner.  To insist, however, that the <em>sole</em> purpose of a trial is to render justice, and nothing else, defends a crabbed and untenable vision of these special proceedings.  In the case of spectacular war crimes trials, it is unrealistic to expect and silly to demand that the trial be conducted as an ordinary exercise of the criminal law.  The question, then, is not whether the trial should be used for these larger ends, but how to do so responsibly.<br /><br />This, of course, is the principal task now facing Iraqi jurists.  Unfortunately, there is no simple recipe that can steer them to success.  If experience teaches anything, it is that the problems posed by such prosecutions can only be surmounted by a delicate balancing act.  On the one hand, the prosecution and court must from the outset prevent the defense from taking history hostage.  Here the experience of the Milosevic trial offers a cautionary tale.  An ambitious indictment charged Milosevic with international crimes in three distinct theaters &#8212; Croatia, Bosnia, and Kosovo.  Such a strategy meant to do justice to the full sweep of crimes committed by the former Serbian president and his regime, but led to a bloated and unwieldy case that threatened to unravel altogether once the accused took over his own defense and demonstrated his gift for tendentious argument.  Clearly the lessons of the Milosevic trial have not been lost upon the Iraqis and their American tutors.  This summer the Iraqi National Assembly quietly amended the Charter of the Special Iraqi Tribunal (renaming it the Iraqi Higher Criminal Court) to eliminate any mention of a right to a pro se defense.  The very decision to focus the first trial on a relatively minor act &#8212; the reprisal murders of 143 Shiites in Dujayl in the wake of a failed assassination attempt on Hussein in 1982 &#8212; also displays a clear desire to present a judicially manageable case, one that will not offer Hussein or his defense team the opportunity to drag American conduct into the courtroom and turn history into an ally.<br /><br />Yet the very effort to render the trial manageable has its costs.  By barring any mention of a right to launch a pro se defense (and let's not forget Hussein's training in law), the tribunal invariably invites charges of muzzling the defendant &#8212; a danger in a trial meant, first and foremost, to demonstrate that the fledgling regime is committed to the rule of law.  The decision to televise the proceedings &#8212; a courageous and risky move &#8212; will only redouble the pressures on the Court to make visible the fairness of its procedure.  If the Court is to survive such scrutiny, it must strive to legitimate itself in the eyes not simply of its supporters, but more crucially, of those who continue to support the accused.  A bound and gagged Hussein will not serve this end.<br />  <br />Second, the effort to secure a narrow prosecutorial success may undermine the larger didactic purposes of trying Saddam in the first place.  It remains to be seen, of course, whether this trial is only a prelude to others that will reach Hussein's larger crimes.  If so, a focus on the Dujayl slayings makes perfect sense as a preparatory step.  If, however, the Dujayl trial ends in the former President's speedy execution, the legal process would have dramatically failed to serve as a means of educating the Iraqi nation of the horrific crimes committed b
y a reprobate regime.<br /><br />Finally, there are the questions regarding the quality of the jurists asked to preside over this historic trial.  I recently attended a talk given by Michael Newton, one of the principal legal advisors to the Iraqi High Criminal Court.  In speaking of the pending trial, Newton repeated one phrase time and again: "The Iraqis want to get things right."  No one could doubt Newton's sincerity, but the question remains whether the desire to do right suffices.  The Eichmann trial was fortunate to have Moshe Landau serve as the presiding judge.  His quiet dignity, his scrupulous fairness to the accused, his impatience with the prosecution's histrionic excesses, conferred gravitas and legitimacy upon the proceeding.  At Nuremberg, lead prosecutor Robert Jackson's stunning open address that frankly and eloquently addressed the charge of "victor's justice," also served to legitimate a deeply controversial and unorthodox prosecution.  The Milosevic trial, by contrast, has suffered under the stewardship of presiding judge Patrick Robinson, a jurist of limited imagination and abilities who has not proved himself equal to the task assigned to him by history. <br /> <br />How then will the Iraqis fare?  Many of the nation's leading jurists were barred from participating in the Special Tribunal by the terms of the Charter that excluded former Baathists.  In postwar Germany, many prosecutions of Nazi war criminals foundered because all too many judges were former members of the party.  In Iraq, the very effort to cleanse the judiciary of Baathist influence has had the effect of placing the proceeding into the hands of neophytes whose every step &#8212; and misstep &#8212; will be displayed on a world stage.<br /><br />No one can gainsay the courage of these jurists.  We can only hope that they will master the delicate balancing act &#8212; between defending the rule of law and serving the larger interests of teaching history &#8212; that lies at the heart of the didactic trial.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Lawrence Douglas is Professor of Law, Jurisprudence &amp; Social Thought at Amherst College</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.williamgeorgeross.com/">William G. Ross</a> of Cumberland Law School, Samford University, says that while the nomination of Harriet Miers to the US Supreme Court is not without its problems, the selection of close presidential associates for the high court is an historical commonplace, and several criticisms of Miers&#39; background and education are artificial and unfair...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/wgrossnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>C</strong></font>oncerns about cronyism and credentials are appropriately the focus of the controversy over Harriet Miers's nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. Miers, however, has more relevant and distinguished credentials than many of her critics have alleged, and her close connection with President Bush should not bar her confirmation if she can convince the Senate that she is professionally qualified and that her ties to Bush would not limit her independence.<br /> <br /> Although most scholars agree that the Framers of the Constitution expected the Senate to play an active role in the confirmation process, the Framers offered few insights into the criteria by which they expected the Senate to evaluate Supreme Court nominations. Records of the debates during the convention indicate that the Framers were primarily concerned that the Senate help to ensure the appointment of meritorious candidates rather than personal favorites. The Framers appear to have evaluated merit in terms of professional credentials and personal integrity.<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/miers.php">Harriet Miers</a> | Video: <a href="/monitor/2005/10/miers-us-supreme-court-nomination.php">Miers nomination</a> [White House]<br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br />During the debate on ratification, Alexander Hamilton explained in No. 76 of <em>The Federalist</em> that the requirement of senatorial advice and consent "would be an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in the President, and would tend greatly to prevent the appointment of unfit characters from State prejudice, from family connection, from personal attachment, or from a view to popularity." Hamilton contended that the President "would be both ashamed and afraid to bring forward...candidates who had no merit other than that of coming from the same State to which he particularly belonged, or of being in some way or other personally allied to him, or of possessing the necessary insignificance and pliancy to render them the obsequious instruments of his pleasure." <br /><br /> As Hamilton's comments suggest, the Framers may have opposed personal favoritism only to the extent that favorites were otherwise unqualified, a view to which senators generally appear to have subscribed throughout the past two centuries. <br /><br /> While Miers's critics complain that she has obtained the nomination as the result of who she knows rather than what she knows, Supreme Court nominations have never resulted from standardized tests, civil service examinations, or job applications. To paraphrase Max Lerner, Supreme Court nominees are not immaculate conceptions brought by presidential storks. Nearly every Justice has had some type of political connection which has brought him or her to the President's attention. For example, David Souter had close ties to John Sununu, President George Bush's chief of staff, and John G. Roberts, Jr. was well known in Republican political circles. At least Miers's connections, unlike those of the President himself and so many others in his Administration, are the product of her own efforts rather than those of her family.<br /><br /> A number of Supreme Court Justices have been personal friends of the President and many others have served in the President's Cabinet or in other prominent posts in his administration. The Senate usually has not raised the hue and cry of cronyism when the nominee has been reasonably well qualified.<br /><br /> David Davis, for example, was Lincoln's friend and executor and had served as manager of Lincoln's 1860 presidential campaign, but the Senate did not complain about cronyism when Lincoln nominated him to the Court in 1862, even though his experience as a provincial lawyer and state judge would be considered inadequate by many of Miers's critics. Likewise, the Senate was not troubled in 1925 that Calvin Coolidge nominated Harlan Fiske Stone, his friend, Amherst College classmate, and Attorney General. Since Stone had served as dean of the Columbia Law School and partner at a major Wall Street law firm, his credentials might be deemed sufficient by the critics of Miers. <br /><br /> Although Harry Truman often is criticized for appointing to the Court four personal friends who became mediocre Justices, this criticism is generally focused on mediocrity rather than favoritism. Often overlooked is the fact that Truman's predecessor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, appointed several Justices with whom he had close personal connections. Several had served in his Cabinet, and some were his poker buddies. Felix Frankfurter, who served as Roosevelt's unofficial advisor and confidant, cleverly curried favor with Roosevelt for years before his nomination, showering the President with sycophantic flattery and publicly supporting Roosevelt's Court-packing plan, which he privately loathed. Frankfurter, however, was far more than a mere crony of the President. Long before his nomination to the Court, he had distinguished himself as a pre-eminent constitutional scholar. Few persons in the nation's history have thought more profoundly about the Court's role in the American political system. <br /><br /> Similarly, John Kennedy escaped criticism for nominating Byron R. White, his old Navy buddy, Colorado presidential campaign manager, and deputy attorney general because White had distinguished himself in private practice and government service. Kennedy's appointment of Arthur Goldberg, his friend, advisor, and Secretary of Labor, likewise stirred little controversy because Goldberg was widely acknowledged as a bright legal mind. The brilliance of Abe Fortas similarly blunted charges of favoritism when Lyndon Johnson appointed his longtime personal attorney and political advisor to the Court in 1965, although senators questioned Fortas in detail about his close ties to Johnson. Senators were much more skeptical of Johnson's 1968 nomination of his Texas crony Homer Thornberry, whose professional attainments were thin.<br /><br /> This history suggests that complaints about cronyism are a function of concerns about lack of qualifications. There are at least two other reasons, however, for objecting to the nomination of a presidential crony. <br /><br /> The first reason is that the Justice may lack sufficient independence. Although life tenure removes incentives for a Justice to curry favor with the President by whom she was nominated, a  Justice naturally may feel a
lingering loyalty to the person to whom she owes her office. The most famous example are the three Truman appointees who were the only Justices to support Truman's weak constitutional arguments in favor of his seizure of the steel mills in order to avert a strike during the Korean War.  <br /><br /> A second and related reason is that a Justice who is a close friend or associate of a President may breach the separation of powers by continuing to act as a presidential adviser. Fortas, for example, remained in almost daily contact with Johnson during the three and a half years remaining in Johnson's term and helped to draft at least one of his State of the Union addresses. These contacts contributed to the Senate's refusal to confirm Johnson's nomination of Fortas to the chief justiceship in 1968. Since Fortas, no Justice has had any close connection with a president, and Fortas is often cited as an example of why presidents should not nominate close personal associates to the Court. <br /><br /> The danger that a crony will lack sufficient independence or maintain one foot in the executive branch of government is mitigated to the extent that a Justice is likely to continue to serve on the Court long after the President who has appointed her has left office. Even encounters between the Marble Palace and the White House during the duration of one presidential term, however, may diminish public respect for the Court as an independent branch of government.<br /><br /> These issues of judicial independence and separation of powers provide a valid ground for opposing the confirmation of a nominee who is otherwise well qualified. They are even more important when there are doubts about a nominee's qualifications since an intellectually weak Justice may be unduly inclined to permit personal or partisan allegiances to influence her judicial behavior. During the Senate Judiciary Committee's hearings on Miers, senators should question Miers closely about the type of relationship she anticipates having with Bush if she is confirmed.<br /><br /> Since cronyism presents more potential problems when a Justice lacks stellar qualifications, the Senate needs to closely examine Miers's qualifications, which are not clearly brilliant. In conducting this inquiry, however, the Senate should consider that a nominee may be well qualified for the Court even though her background is different from that of most of the other present Justices.  Many of Miers's critics are unfair in expecting her to conform to a rigid and in many ways artificial standard of excellence. <br /> <br /> Although many of Miers's critics complain that her lack of judicial experience is a significant disability, approximately one-third of the Justices never have served as judges. Although every Justice appointed during the past thirty years has served as a Court of Appeals judge, several have been on the bench for only a short period of time. Souter's tenure was so short that he had not even written an opinion, Thomas had served only one year, and Roberts only for two years.<br /> <br /> To a certain extent, Miers's lack of judicial experience is an advantage. The Supreme Court benefits from having Justices whose professional experiences are diverse. An ideal Court would contain men and women who had served as appellate and trial court judges, partners in both elite and non-elite law firms, government attorneys, elected state and federal officials, and law professors. The present Court does not have such diversity. O'Connor was the last nominee to have served in an elective office, and Miers and O'Connor are the only Supreme Court nominees during the past thirty years who have not served as judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals. Experience as a federal appellate judge increasingly has been viewed as a virtual prerequisite for a Supreme Court appointment.  Such a lockstep career path generates a narrowness of judicial vision.  <br /><br /> Critics of Miers's lack of judicial experience seem unimpressed by her significant experience as an attorney, including her partnership in a major Texas law firm, her presidency of the Texas Bar Association, and her prominence in the American Bar Association. Only thirty-four years ago, such credentials were regarded as quite sufficient when Nixon nominated Lewis Powell, whose principal credentials were his presidency of the American Bar Association and his distinguished record as a Richmond, Va. attorney. Miers probably has more practical experience as an attorney than any present member of the Court. Since the Court's decisions have such a profound impact on practicing lawyers, the Court surely would benefit from having at least one member who had extensive experience as a lawyer. The widespread denigration of Miers's practical legal experience is an example of the growing tendency of elites within the legal profession to distance themselves from the concerns of practicing attorneys and the realities of the day-to-day practice of law. <br /><br /> Opponents of the appointment of Hugo Black in 1937 sneered because Black's only previous judicial experience was as a part-time judge of Birmingham's lowly police court. It is ironic that many of Black's detractors were liberals, for Black's service at the judicial grassroots helped to mold Black's empathy for criminal defendants and racial minorities, which influenced landmark Supreme Court decisions promoting racial justice and fairness in criminal procedure. Similarly, Miers's broad grassroots experiences, including her legal practice and her term as a member of the Houston City Council, may provide her with insights lacking among Justices whose experiences are confined to the more rarified backgrounds of the federal bench, legal academia, and the U. S. Supreme Court bar.<br /><br /> It also is unfair for Miers's critics to complain that she has not written about legal issues, for few Supreme Court nominees have had substantial legal publications. John G. Roberts, Jr., for example, was widely hailed for his brilliance despite a paucity of published writings. Indeed, the absence of such publications has become an advantage to a nominee since it deprives her critics of fodder with which to oppose her nomination. Particularly since Robert Bork's massive "paper trail" helped to sink his nomination in 1987, Presidents have been loath to nominate persons whose statements about constitutional issues could provide grist for senators to oppose their nomination. This is a pity, for persons who have thought deeply about legal issues often also have spoken and published widely about their views. But one should not blame Miers for failing to have done what other nominees have not done.<br /><br /> A much more valid criticism of Miers is that her only published writings &#8212; the monthly columns she produced as president of the Texas Bar Association during 1992-93 &#8212; were often awkward and obtuse. Skeptical of various commentaries which have derided these columns, I read them for myself and came away shaking my head in dismay. Although most are not as excruciatingly illiterate as some commentators have suggested, they are rife with verbosity, mangled syntax, and grandiose generalities about such subjects as civility, diversity, efficiency, and public service. Some are so vague and meandering that a reader cannot easily identify any central theme. While state bar presidents hardly are expected to express Deep Thoughts in their columns for state bar journals, Miers's columns are fluffy even by the standards of the genre. Since Miers may have dictated these or dashed them off in a hurry, they do not necessarily represent the quality of her writing or her thinking. But they are one of the few present recorded clues to her intellectual abilities.<br /><br />Much of the opposition to Miers also is unfair insofar as it appears to be based on the fact that her undergraduate and law degrees are from Southern Methodist University. If confirmed, Miers would become the first Justice appointed since Warren E. Burger in 1969 who lacked a degree from an ultra-prestigious university. Of the twelve Justices appointed before Miers, eac
h one received a law degree from Harvard, Stanford, Yale, or Columbia. Harvard Law School alone was the <em>alma mater</em> of eight of these Justices. The undergraduate backgrounds of these dozen Justices are similarly elite. Four were Stanford alumni, four graduated from Harvard College, and another is a Cornell graduate. As a graduate of Stanford and the Harvard Law School, I am delighted that my colleges are so well represented among the Justices, but I must admit that many talented persons have graduated from other institutions, even ones which are not favored with high rankings. In this context it&#39;s ironic that some elite academic commentators who complain of cronyism seem to regard Miers as unqualified because, having been educated elsewhere and having travelled in different circles, they are not personally acquainted with her. &quot;If we haven&#39;t heard of her, she must not be any good!,&quot; they seem to be saying.<br /><br /> Critics of Miers also might consider that Miers, like O'Connor, encountered significant obstacles in her career because she came of age at a time when women attorneys still suffered from crippling discrimination. Although some critics of Miers's nomination have correctly argued that a woman nominee should not be evaluated by lower standards than a man, it is proper to consider that Miers's accomplishments are more impressive when one considers that she spent at least the early part of her career in a highly discriminatory environment.<br /><br /> Miers's record also seems more impressive when one considers that she is one of the few Supreme Court nominees who has not come from a particularly advantaged socio-economic background. Moreover, as an unmarried person, she has not had the benefits of a spouse who could have helped her perform many of life's mundane tasks and might have provided professional or social connections which would have eased her way in the world. <br /><br /> While Miers is much better qualified for the Court than many of her critics allege, this does not necessarily mean that her credentials rise to the level that senators and the public should require. Although there is little doubt that she could perform credible work,  Americans have a right to demand more than mediocrity in a Supreme Court Justice. The Senate therefore needs to conduct an extensive inquiry into her professional qualifications. It also should make certain that her record demonstrates that she has the personal integrity Americans demand of those who sit on their nation's highest bench. Finally, the Senate needs to consider carefully whether she could maintain sufficient independence from the Bush Administration.<br /><br /><br /><em>William G.

Subdivision D of Chapter 253 of the Code addresses this, and it essentially bars corporations from contributing to individual candidates' campaigns. In addition, corporations are barred from contributing to general purpose political committees except to establish or administer the committees.  They are also barred from contributing to political parties, except that up to 60 days before an election a corporation can contribute funds to be used for the party's administrative expenses. The Election Code creates a number of criminal offenses, many consisting of making or receiving contributions and making expenditures in a manner violating various provisions of the Code.  The provisions creating these offenses sometime appear to overlap.<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/delay.php">Tom DeLay</a> | Text: <a href="/gazette/2005/10/delay-money-laundering-indictment.php">Money laundering indictment</a> | Text: <a  href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/gazette/2005/09/delay-criminal-conspiracy-indictment.php">Criminal conspiracy indictment</a><br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><em>TRMPAC and the 2002 Elections</em><br /><br />In 2002, a number of corporations gave contributions to a general purpose political committee, Texans for a Republican Majority Political Action Committee (TRMPAC).  Mr. DeLay is widely regarded as having stimulated the formation and administration of this committee. It now appears that some of these contributions may have been made, accepted, and used under an impermissibly broad definition of permissible contributions for administration of the committee.  The purposes for which they were made, accepted and used probably means that they violated Subdivision D of Chapter 253 of the Election Code.<br /><br />As the November elections neared, TRMPAC gave $190,000 to the Republican National Committee (RNC), a national political party.  The check was dated September 13 and was from an account for money donated by corporations.  In early October, the RNC made a number of contributions to Republican candidates for the Texas legislature.  These contributions totaled $190,000. The successful Republican candidates, as members of the Texas Legislature, supported redistricting that increased Republican representation in the United States House of Representatives.  <br /><br />Ronnie Earle, the Democratic elected District Attorney of Travis County, Texas, began investigating fund raising for the 2002 elections soon after they were over.  He used Travis County grand juries in this process.  Texas grand juries sit for limited times, but generally no longer than six months.  A grand jury's may be extended but this seldom occurs.  In most metropolitan areas, including Austin (the county seat of Travis County), there are usually one or more grand juries sitting at any particular time. <br /><br />Mr. DeLay was widely regarded as among the persons Mr. Earle believed might have engaged in criminal activity related to the fund raising.<br /><br /><em>The Offenses at Issue</em><br /><br />Two provisions of the Texas Penal Code are involved in the results of this investigation and Mr. DeLay's prosecution in particular.  Title 4 of the Texas Penal Code concerns "Inchoate" or preparatory offenses.  Section 15.02 defines criminal conspiracy as committed when a person, with intent that a felony be committed, agrees one or more persons that one or more of them will engage in conduct that constitutes the offense.  In addition, one of the conspirators must commit an overt act in furtherance of the agreement.<br /><br />Money laundering is criminalized and defined by section 34.02.  As involved here, it consists of knowingly conducting or facilitating a "transaction" involving the proceeds of felony criminal activity.  In 2002, if the transaction involved funds of $100,000 or more the crime was a first degree felony, punishable by up to life imprisonment.  <br /><br />The general "limitations" rule in Texas is that felony prosecutions must be brought&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;an indictment must be returned&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;within three years of the commission of the offense.  This applies to money laundering and felonies under the Election Code.<br /><br /><em>The Investigation Before DeLay's Indictment</em><br /><br />In 2004, a Travis County grand jury returned a number of indictments related to the investigation.  Some charged corporations with donations in criminal violation of the Election Code.  Two individuals, John Colyandro, head of TRMPAC, and James Ellis, a Washington political operative, were charged with money laundering under the state's Penal Code. The Colyandro and Ellis indictments alleged as the money laundering transaction the delivery of the $190,000 check to the RNC.  $155,000 of this, they alleged, was proceeds of felony criminal activity consisting of the corporate donations to TRMPAC in violation of the Election Code.  The crime was alleged to have been committed on September 13, 2002, the date of TRMPAC's check to RNC.<br /><br />On September 12, 2005, as the three year anniversary of September 13, 2002 approached, Mr. DeLay executed a waiver of the period of limitations for certain potential charges.  Quite likely, this was in return for prosecutors' agreement to not immediately seek an indictment but rather to continue to consider whether Mr. DeLay's indictment was permissible and appropriate.<br /><br /><em>The First Indictment</em><br /><br />On September 28, 2005, a grand jury formed in March and apparently presented with considerable evidence regarding the 2002 events returned an indictment recharging Colyandro and Ellis and indicting Mr. DeLay.  The indictment was for conspiracy to commit the felony of making an improper corporate campaign contribution and doing so on September 13, 2002.  Specifically, this first indictment alleged that the defendants conspired to engage in the making of a corporate contr
ibution to a political party which was prohibited because it was to be made within sixty days of an election.  This contribution was the transfer of funds to RNC.  The State's theory was clearly that although these funds had been channeled through TRMPAC, the contribution was of the same money that had come to TRMPAC from the corporations.  The indictment was returned on the last day of the term of that specific grand jury.  It alleged a number of overt acts, but did not specify a date for any of them.  It did allege that Mr. DeLay had waived the period of limitations.  <br /><br /><em>Potential Problems With the First Indictment</em><br /><br />Almost immediately after being indictment, Mr. DeLay through new counsel notified the prosecutor that he was withdrawing his waiver of limitations.  He also raised several questions about the indictment.  DeLay specifically contended that in 2002, the Penal Code did not make criminal a conspiracy to engage in conduct that if completed would be a felony violation of the Election Code.  Thus, he argued, the indictment did not charge an offense.<br /><br />The Penal Code provision, on its face, appeared to make conspiracy to commit a felony violation of the Election Code a crime, since it required only that the accused agree to commit "a felony."  Several older cases, however, cast some doubt on this. In the 1970s, a state court had refused to permit prosecutions for conspiracy to engage in conduct made a felony by the Texas Controlled Substance Act.  The decisions might be read as indicating that despite the language of the Penal Code, conspiracy required an agreement to engage in conduct made a felony by the Penal Code or some other statute expressly providing that the conspiracy statute applied to it.  <br /><br />The 1970s decisions might alternatively be read as relying on the legislative intent in enacting the Controlled Substance Act.  So read, they stand for no general rule that would invalidate the charges against Mr. DeLay.  <br /><br />In 2005, the legislature amended the Election Code to explicitly provide that the conspiracy statute applied to it, but this amended provision does not apply to prosecutions based on conduct before the amendment was effective.  It may reflect legislative recognition that in 2002 conspiracy to violate the Election Code was not a Penal Code offense.  Or, it may reflect the legislature's desire to simply make clear and explicit what it intended by the original language.<br /><br /> Mr. DeLay also contended that his waiver of limitations was revocable.  Although the Texas courts have said that limitations is, as a general rule, waivable, they appear not to have specifically address the matter as raised by Mr. DeLay.<br /><br /> There was at least one additional potential problem with the indictment.  The intended violation of the Election Code was specified as a contribution of corporation funds to the RNC.  There is some question as to whether the Texas Election Code purports to cover donations to national entities such as the RNC.  There is further some question of whether, if it purports to cover such actions, this is permissible given what might be preemptive federal law.  <br /><br /><em>The Second Grand Jury Presentation</em><br /><br />Mr. Earle's office has acknowledged that "out of an abundance of caution," the office had presented some evidence of "other allegations" against DeLay to a second grand jury on Friday, September 30, the last day of that grand jury's term.  That grand jury declined to indict Mr. DeLay. The foreman later signed, and the presiding judge ordered filed, a document reporting that the body had inquired carefully into an unspecified "case against" Mr. DeLay.  The document concluded, "[W]e have failed to find a bill of indictment against him."  <br /><br /><em>The Third Grand Jury Presentation and the Second Indictment</em><br /><br />On Monday, October 3, another Travis County grand jury was convened.  Mr. Earle's office later stated that "additional information" regarding Mr. DeLay had come to the prosecutors' attention during the weekend of October 1st and 2nd.  This was presented to the newly convened "third" grand jury on October 3.  Later the same day this grand jury returned an indictment of Mr. DeLay for conspiracy and money laundering.<br /><br /> The new indictment was considerably more complex than the first.  Unlike the one court first indictment, the second contained two counts.  Whether the prosecution intends to seek conviction for both, or rather alleged them as essentially alternatives, is not clear from the document.  Under existing Texas law, this need not be clear.  <br /><br /><em>Count One - Conspiracy</em><br /><br />In the first count, the second indictment again alleged a conspiracy, but contained alleged two alternative theories.  One was again that the defendants conspired to violate the Election Code.  Now, however, it specified that the conspiracy was to violate the election code by making improper corporate contributions to candidates.  The target felony under the first conspiracy theory, then, was changed from the corporate contributions to RNC to a donation of the corporate funds to the candidates.  The new indictment alleged additional overt acts and&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;unlike the first--specified the dates on which the State claimed the overt acts occurred.  <br /><br />This first theory is subject to the same challenge as Mr. DeLay made to the first indictment, that is, that it alleges a 2002 conspiracy to violate the Election Code, which was not at the time a criminal offense.  The alternative conspiracy theory was that the defendants conspired to commit money laundering of funds in excess of $100,000.  Apparently the money laundering the defendants are alleged to have conspired to commit is the money laundering charged in the second count.<br /><br /> In either case, the second indictment alleged overt acts committed on October 4.  If Texas applies the general rule, this would mean that an indictment returned within three years of those overt acts would be within limitation.  Thus the prosecution would not have to rely on Mr. DeLay's waiver of limitations.<br /><br />The addition of money laundering as a target crime made the charged conspiracy a second degree felony.  Conspiracy to violate the Election Code, as charged in the initial indictment (and the first theory in the second), is a considerably less serious State jail felony.<br /><br /><em>Count Two - Money Laundering</em><br /><br />In the second count, the indictment alleged money laundering.  The "transaction" relied upon as constituting the offense was the transfer of funds from the RNC to specific candidates after October 3, 2002.  Thus the State's theory here as in the revised conspiracy count does not require reliance on Mr. DeLay's waiver of limitations.  <br /><br /> The money laundering allegations also specified that the transferred funds were proceeds of a felony because the transferred funds involved money that been contributed by corporations in violation of Subdivision D of Chapter 253 of the Election Code.  The allegations did not appear to commit the prosecutors to a specific theory, that is, whether the Election Code violation had been the transfer from the corporations to TRMPAC, the transfer of funds to the RNC, or perhaps some other aspects of the events.  <br /><br /><em>Texas Grand Jury Law and Practice</em><br /><br /> Mr. DeLay has now attacked the October 3 indictment on a number of grounds, among them that it is fatally tainted by misuse of the grand jury process by Mr. Earle's office.  <br /><br /> Under the Texas Constitution, felony defendants have a right to be put to trial only on indictment of a grand jury.  This right to indictment almost certainly means that an indicting grand jury must have acted free of at least outrageous pressures from prosecutors.  When prosecutorial conduct before a grand jury violates a defendant's right to a reasonably independent grand jury decision to indict is simply not addressed in either Texas statute or case law.<br /><br /> Texas statutory law does explicitly give a defen
dant the right to have an indictment dismissed upon proof that anyone not a member of an indicting grand jury&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;including a prosecutor&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;was present when the grand jury was "deliberating" or "voting."  This is apparently designed to provide rigorous assurance that grand juries are free from potentially improper influence by prosecutors at the time when the juries are most vulnerable&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;during deliberations and voting.<br /><br />The statutory and case law is, however, largely silent on a defendant's right to access to information to investigate concerns that this occurred. As a general rule, an indicted Texas defendant cannot attack an indictment on the basis of the nature, quality, or credibility of the evidence supporting the decision to indict.  Were a defendant to show in court that his indictment was based on no more than a prosecutor's oral statement to the grand jury of what the prosecutor believes were the events, that showing would not entitle the defendant to dismissal of the indictment.  <br /><br /> A prosecutor has a statutory right to access to grand juries.  Prosecutors may be present when a grand jury is taking evidence and of course often are not only present but develop the testimony or other information.  The critical question is when the grand jury process moves from the taking of evidence to "deliberating," because this defines the point at which no prosecutor can be present.  <br /><br /> Texas law is quite clear that, as a general matter, a grand jury's refusal to indict is no bar to a prosecutor's presentation of a mater to another grand jury.  Defendants are sometimes reindicted, perhaps by a different grand jury, often to eliminate defects in the original indictment.  Reindictments for different crimes arising out of the same fact situation than were charged in an initial indictment is less common.  Nothing in Texas law suggests that this is improper, as long as the newly charged offenses are charged within the period imposed by limitations.  <br /><br /> In a 1908 decision, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals addressed a situation in which a prosecutor returned to the indicting grand jury with a proposed new indictment "because he desired additional grounds in the indictment that were not in the old indictment."  He successfully asked them to approve the new indictment without hearing witnesses. The court found no problem with the resulting indictment.  "[T]he law of this state," the court stated, "is that the grand jury may take the advice of the district attorney."  It added that it would not even "consider" the allegation that the grand jury heard no testimony before approving the second indictment.<br /><br /> This case apparently involved reindictment by the same grand jury.  Whether the courts would give equally vigorous approval to reindictment by a subsequent grand jury simply on "the advice of the district attorney" is not clear.  The courts' repeated unwillingness to consider what testimony grand juries considered, or even whether the juries heard any at all, suggests that reindictment by a different grand jury would be treated the same.  <br /><br /> The Texas statutes reflect strong commitment to a policy of grand jury secrecy.  Grand jurors, prosecutors, and witnesses are all barred from revealing what occurred before a grand jury.  These bars to disclosure of matters occurring before grand juries has long been inapplicable at a court hearing on the validity of an indictment when the judge permits one of the parties to question a witness has to such matters.  It is unclear, however, when a defendant has the right to a hearing at which that defendant can call and examine grand jurors, prosecutors or grand jury witnesses under circumstances that permit the witnesses called to testify about otherwise secret matters.  Common sense suggests that a defendant should have to make some sort of preliminary showing of impropriety before becoming entitled to a hearing at which grand jury secrecy is out the window.  Whether a defendant has a right to a full hearing upon, and only upon, such a preliminary showing is unclear.  <br /><br /> In a number of early Texas cases, the appellate courts discussed at length the significance of various versions of grand jury proceedings developed by defense testimony from grand jurors.  Often it is unclear on what authority the defendants were permitted to call these witnesses and elicit from them the details of the grand jury proceedings.  Perhaps the trial courts erred in permitting this.  In any case, the decisions do not address when a criminal defendant has a right to a hearing at which the defendant can subpoena grand jurors and compel them to testify as to what specifically occurred during the grand jury process.<br /><br /> A defendant may now by statute ask the trial court to permit disclosure of secret grand jury matters upon the defendant's showing of "particularized need."  Particularized need is not defined.  Almost certainly it is met by a showing that grand jury testimony is necessary to impeach inconsistent testimony at trial and thus to a fair trial on guilt or innocence.  When if ever it is met by a showing that breaching grand jury secrecy may show a basis for challenging the indictment is less certain.  <br /><br /><em>DeLay's Grand Jury Procedure Attack on the Second Indictment</em><br /><br /> Mr. DeLay is seeking an in-court opportunity to develop facts as a basis for challenges to his indictment.  He urges, in effect, that the theories of the second indictment are less soundly based on the facts than the theory of the first charge.  The District Attorney, he has strongly suggested, pursued these factually weaker charges only after belatedly determining that the perhaps more easily-proved facts alleged in the first indictment do not constitute a crime under the law.  <br /><br /> Prosecutors were unsuccessful in attempting to persuade the second grand jury to summarily approve the second set of charges, the defense believes.  They then tried again&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;and more rigorously--with a third grand jury, which they did persuade to summarily approve the second indictment.  But, he contends, those more rigorous efforts constituted overreaching that fatally tainted the second indictment.  <br /><br /> Specifically, Mr. DeLay believes that prosecutors, after the first grand jury was discharged, interviewed some members of that grand jury and elicited from them that had they been asked to approve the second indictment they would have done so.  Prosecutors conveyed these views of the first grand jurors to members of the indicting grand jury.  They did not, however, inform the indicting grand jury that the second grand jury had considered the matter and had refused to approve the charges.  <br /><br /> In part, Mr. DeLay contends that by presenting this information prosecutors improperly were present during, and participated in, deliberations by the indicting grand jury. But more fundamentally, Mr. DeLay's implicit argument is that the prosecutors' actions impermissibly impacted the indicting grand jury and deprived it of the independence which the state constitutional right to grand jury indictment requires.  <br /><br /> At a minimum, Mr. DeLay contends, the available information sufficiently suggests improper participation in deliberations and unconstitutional overreaching to entitle him to a full hearing at which he can elicit testimony from grand jurors and prosecutors as to precisely what occurred.  <br /><br /> Part of the difficulty, of course, is that if a defendant is able to offer fairly specific support for a claim of impropriety in the grand jury process, this suggests a breach of grand jury secrecy in which the defendant or defense counsel was complicit. Mr. DeLay's lead attorney has acknowledged that the factual basis for his claim is limited to news reports that prosecutors presented to the third grand jury the results of their conversations with some members of the first grand jury.  These news reports apparently did not include the basis for the factual assertions made in the reports.  <
br /><br /> The defense team is in effect arguing that these news reports are as firm and specific a basis as the courts can realistically expect for a request for a hearing on a claim of improper prosecutorial actions in a grand jury.  Requiring more, they contend, would demand that an indicted defendant violate grand jury secrecy law to vindicate his constitutional and statutory rights.  <br /><br /> Resolving Mr. DeLay's challenges will require the Texas courts to face directly how far prosecutors can go in presenting information in summary form to grand juries and in expressing the prosecutors' views as to what action the grand jury should take.  Most significantly, the courts will have to address when grand jury proceedings cease to become merely taking of evidence and progress to deliberations.  If DeLay can prove that prosecutors urged the third grand jury to indict because members of the first grand jury heard extensive evidence and would have authorized the new charged had then been asked, this might constitute deliberation over whether to indict.  If so, the prosecutors' participation &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; and in fact their mere presence with the grand jury &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; would be fatal to the indictment. <br /><br /> The courts will at the same time have to address what sort of allegations and preliminary proof a defendant must offer in order for the defendant to be able to develop, on the record and from grand jurors and prosecutors, what specifically occurred during pre-indictment grand jury proceedings.  <br /><br /><em>More General Grand Jury Policy Considerations</em><br /><br /> If grand juries are to provide any worth while protection against zealous prosecutors, some judicial scrutiny of prosecutors' actions before grand juries is clearly necessary.  But courts cannot permit any defendant with hopes of developing evidence of misconduct to negate grand jury secrecy. <br /><br /> DeLay's challenge to his indictment may require the Texas courts to confront directly whether to take grand juries seriously enough to permit defendants to investigate and challenge prosecutors' attempts to influence the bodies' decisions to indict. The challenge has, however, been temporarily delayed.  On October 21, the trial judge referred Mr. DeLay's motion to recuse the trial judge to another judge for consideration.  Any action on the other pending matters was postponed until the recusal matter is resolved.<br /><br /><em>George Dix is Professor of Law at the University of Texas School of Law</em><br />

Although Saddam faces a litany of other charges for more widespread and severe crimes against humanity, war crimes, and genocide, the Iraqi Special Tribunal decided to move forward with the Dujail atrocity first, indicating that it is the best documented of his many crimes.  But as the first of what will be several trials, Saddam's defense team will try out some initial defenses that they believe could bring the trial to a standstill.<br /><br />Among the defenses that can be raised to prosecution for this crime - including lack of knowledge which, if successful, would destroy the prosecution's command responsibility line of criminal culpability - the most legally potent is the defense of sovereign immunity.  Saddam's attorneys have indicated their intention to raise this as a complete defense &#8212; or one that, if accepted, negates all criminal liability.  There are two strains of sovereign immunity which the defense will assert:  current head of state immunity and former head of state immunity.<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/saddamtrial.php">Saddam Hussein Trial</a> | Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/iraqispecial.php">Iraqi Special Tribunal</a> | Text: <a href="/gazette/2005/10/saddam-tribunal-report-hrw.php">Saddam tribunal report</a> [Human Rights Watch]<br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br />The first strain is the most audacious for Saddam's attorneys to assert because, to make current head of state immunity work, they must prove that Saddam is still the president of Iraq.  And to prove that, they must show that he was illegally deposed.  Thus, it is the argument lurking within the argument that is so potentially explosive, for, as Saddam's attorneys have acknowledged, this means nothing less than proving the American-led invasion of Iraq was illegal under international law, and therefore, by extension, Saddam Hussein is still legally the head of state.<br /><br />The strategy of putting the invasion of Iraq on trial is certainly a clever one which must be treated carefully by the 3-judge panel trying Saddam.  The Iraqi Special Tribunal (IST) is a creation of the Iraqi Governing Council, which in turn was appointed directly by L. Paul Bremmer and the U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority.  The IST's operating statute was written by Coalition military lawyers, it is funded by the Americans, it is being "advised" by American and other foreign international legal experts, and the U.S. Justice Department has spent $75 million helping the prosecution build its case against Saddam.  Consequently, the IST has serious surface legitimacy issues, and it cannot be seen as defending the U.S.-led invasion outright by quashing out of hand the claims of Saddam's attorneys to the contrary.<br /><br />Saddam's attorneys will co-opt into their argument both legal and political findings, including statements of the war's illegality by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, who noted that such unprovoked cross-border invasions absent Security Council authorization are technically illegal under Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter.  That said, it does not syllogistically follow that Saddam is still Iraq's legal head of state just because the method used to depose him was illegal, especially in the aftermath of Iraqi national elections approving the current government.<br /><br />While raising the defense of sovereign immunity based on Saddam's status as current head of state will infuse the proceedings with high drama, it will most certainly fail.  The IST cannot politically afford to allow a complete defense to preclude Saddam's prosecution, just as it cannot politically afford to truncate the defense from making its case as completely as possible.  Moreover, the second strain of sovereign immunity will also not likely succeed.<br /><br />Although Saddam is undeniably a former a head of state, he can only assert sovereign immunity over official acts that he undertook in his official capacity.  Can mass murder of civilians be considered "official acts" triggering such immunity?  Probably not.  Criminal acts that are so heinous as to be considered jus cogens (peremptory norms prohibited everywhere), such as genocide and crimes against humanity, are not typically considered to be "official acts" for sovereign immunity purposes, and the trend is clearly developing away from allowing political leaders off the hook for such conduct.  For example, the British House of Lords found in the 1999 Pinochet extradition case that torture should not be considered an official act for immunity purposes.<br /><br />Procedurally, to assert these defenses, Saddam's attorneys must couple them with claims of ex post facto application of law because the IST's statute strips sovereign immunity away as a defense.  Article 15(c) states:<br /><br />The official position of any accused person, whether as president, prime minister, member of the cabinet, chairman or a member of the Revolutionary Command Council, a member of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party Regional Command or Government (or an instrumentality of either) or as a responsible Iraqi Government official or member of the Ba'ath Party or in any other capacity, shall not relieve such person of criminal responsibility nor mitigate punishment.  No person is entitled to any immunity with respect to any of the crimes stipulated in Articles 11 to 14 [Genocide, War Crimes, Crimes Against Humanity, and Violations of Iraqi Law].<br /><br />Their <em>ex post facto</em> argument will rest on the fact that the IST's statute was adopted after the crimes in question were committed, when Saddam's immunity for the acts would have applied in full force.  <br /><br />This line of argument was also attempted by defense counsel for the Nazi co-conspirators at Nuremberg and soundly rejected by the International Military Tribunal on the grounds that the defendants' conduct amounted to such egregious violations of international law that knowledge of the illegality of those actions should be imputed to them and ex post facto application of the law of the Nuremberg Charter, which reflected international law and which likewise stripped away sovereign immunity, would not be unjust.  Thus, Saddam's assertions of sovereign immunity will avail him not.  His first trial will continue on its course for the Dujail massacre.  <br />   <br /><br

Ross</a>, a specialist in constitutional history and the appointment of U.S. Supreme Court justices teaching at Cumberland School of Law, Samford University, says that the US Supreme Court nomination of Judge Samuel Alito will be hard for Democrats or conservative Republicans to defeat...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/wgrossnew.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>O</strong></font>pponents of Samuel A. Alito&#39;s nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court face an uphill battle to prevent his confirmation. With excellent professional credentials and no apparent scandals in his past, Alito has only one ostensible liability -- his long &quot;paper trail&quot; of conservative judicial opinions. Early accounts of those opinions, however, do not suggest that they are so far out of the mainstream of judicial thought that his opponents can successfully taint him with the tar of radicalism. <br /><br /> No matter how vociferously Alito&#39;s opponents oppose his nomination, they are unlikely to persuade a majority of senators to reject it. The arithmetic is compelling. Unless at least six of the Senate&#39;s fifty-five Republicans desert the President and a substantial number of Democratic senators join the twenty-two Democrats who voted in opposition to John G. Roberts&#39;s nomination, Alito&#39;s appointment seems unstoppable.<br /><br /> The Senate rarely rejects Supreme Court nominations. No Senate controlled by the President&#39;s party has voted down a Supreme Court nominee since 1930, when the Senate narrowly defeated Herbert Hoover&#39;s nomination of John J. Parker. Although a predominately Democratic Senate in 1968 refused to confirm Lyndon Johnson&#39;s nominations of Abe Fortas to serve as chief justice and Homer Thornberry to become an associate justice, Johnson made those nominations shortly so near the end of his term that Republicans successfully obstructed the nominations in anticipation of a G.O.P. victory in the November election.<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/alito.php">Samuel Alito</a> | Video: <a href="/monitor/2005/10/alito-us-supreme-court-nomination.php">Alito nomination</a><br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /> Although both Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan suffered the rejection of two Supreme Court nominees in a row, there is no reason to suppose that there is any kind of a jinx on second-choice nominees. G. Harrold Carswell, whom Nixon nominated in 1970 after the Senate in 1969 rejected Clement Haynsworth, was defeated because he had weak professional credentials and had once publicly advocated racial segregation. Douglas Ginsburg, whom Reagan nominated in 1987 after the Senate voted down Robert Bork, withdrew his name after admitting that he smoked marijuana while a Harvard law professor. <br /><br /> There are only a few conceivable means by which Alito&#39;s opponents could derail the nomination.<br /><br /> One possibility would be some type of scandal which would call into question Alito&#39;s personal integrity &#8212; for example, some type of ethical lapse on the bench, financial irregularities, or illegal conduct. There is, however, no whiff of any such taint involving a man who by all present accounts has led an exemplary life. There is always, of course, the possibility that someone might find something that the administration overlooked in its presumably careful investigation of the nominee&#39;s background. An obscure radio reporter, for example, shook the Carswell nomination in 1970 by discovering a white supremacy speech that Carswell had delivered two decades earlier. Such surprises are less likely today, though, because background checks have become more thorough in the wake of a more politicized confirmation process.<br /><br /> Opponents of the nomination likewise are unlikely to succeed in portraying Alito as lacking in judicial temperament since even many of his critics praise his open-mindedness, fairness toward litigants, and courteous courtroom demeanor.<br /><br /> Similarly, ideological objections are unlikely to defeat the nomination. Although many liberals already have alleged that Alito is a dangerous radical who would run roughshod over fundamental constitutional rights, early reports about his judicial record belie this fear. Although Alito often has taken &quot;conservative&quot; positions in cases in which he has participated, he does not appear to have written any opinion that marks him as a fanatic, an ideologue, or an extremist. For example, his dissenting opinion in the Third Circuit&#39;s opinion in <em>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</em> in 1991, arguing in favor of the constitutionality of Pennsylvania&#39;s requirement that a woman notify her spouse of her intention to have an abortion, was essentially the same position that William Rehnquist, Byron White, Antonin Scalia, and Clarence Thomas adopted in dissent when the case later reached the Supreme Court. Although such a position naturally offends those who favor unfettered abortion rights, it is unrealistic to suppose that Bush would nominate any judge who had taken a broader view of abortion rights. Alito&#39;s belief that the state could impose such a  limitation on abortion, moreover, does not necessarily demonstrate that he rejects a constitutional right to abortion.  <br /><br /> Although Alito has dissented in at least two cases involving employee rights (involving the right to a hearing by a employee who was dismissed on a drug charge and the burden of presenting evidence in a gender discrimination case), his opinions in these cases do not appear to demonstrate any profound disregard of the rights of workers. Moreover, Alito has taken a &quot;liberal&quot; position in a number of cases. For example, he voted in favor of First Amendment claims in cases involving advertisements in a student newspaper and the retention of facial hair by Muslim police officers. <br /><br /> While Alito&#39;s critics will continue to scrutinize his judicial opinions, it is unlikely that they will be able to stigmatize the nominee as a radical right-winger.<br /><br /> Perhaps the most likely way in which Alito's nomination could fail is if it became entangled in a broader web of politics. As various historians and political scientists have pointed out, Supreme Court nominations generally fail only if there is some type of catalyst, usually hostility toward the President. Parker's nomination, for example, was defeated in part because of growing antagonism against Hoover in the wake of the growing Depression. Such a process magnifies infirmities that senators otherwise would forgive, with the nomination gradually unraveling in the face of what becomes a juggernaut. To a large extent, the withdrawal of Harriet Miers is an example of this phenomenon, for Bush's slumping popularity emboldened her critics, particularly conservatives who have become
increasingly disillusioned with Bush. Miers's nomination became the occasion for long-suffering conservatives finally to stand up against an administration which has so often frustrated their agenda. The nomination also was the last straw for Americans of many political views who have become fed up with the administration's chronic cronyism.<br /><br /> In contrast, there is nothing about Alito that seems to symbolize what is wrong with the Bush Administration. While Alito naturally wouldn't be the choice of most Democrats or liberal Republicans, Bush's political antagonists cannot reasonably expect the president to nominate anyone significantly more moderate. Indeed, there is little reason to suppose that Alito is farther to the right than is Roberts. Since Alito's professional credentials generally are as impressive as Roberts's, it is difficult to understand why Alito would attract more opposition than Roberts received.<br /><br />[<em>Revised Nov. 1</em>] Perhaps, however, liberals, who have remained virtually silent in the face of so many provocations by Bush, will use the nomination to vent long-pent up frustrations, just as Miers became a lightening rod for conservative disaffection with Bush. If this occurs and liberals mount a protracted fight against the nomination, there is a possibility that the nomination will fall victim to the growing disillusionment with Bush among persons of many political persuasions. Democrats might then derail the nomination with a filibuster, while some Republicans might desert Bush, fearing that voters will retaliate against them for supporting a judicial nominee the Democrats have succeeded in portraying as a dangerous radical. In 1987, for example, a number of Republican senators from heavily Democratic states voted to reject Bork. Similarly, Parker was defeated in 1930 because several Republican senators feared electoral retaliation from the labor and civil rights organizations that had opposed Parker. <br /><br />At the present time, however, Alito seems headed for confirmation, given his many strengths, his lack of apparent weaknesses, and Republican control of the Senate.    <br /><br /><em>William G.

"I have steadfastly maintained that the independence of the Executive Branch be preserved and its confidential documents and information not be released to further a confirmation process," she wrote. "Protection of the prerogatives of the Executive Branch and continued pursuit of my confirmation are in tension.  I have decided that seeking my confirmation must yield."<br /><br />Her stance certainly echoed that of the President himself, who days earlier had rejected the Senate Judiciary Committee's request for access to memoranda relating to Harriet Miers' service as White House counsel, asserting the constitutional principle of executive privilege.  &quot;It&#39;s a red line I&#39;m not willing to cross," he told reporters.

This was evident early on with his refusal to release to the GAO the names of non-government attendees of meetings of Vice President Cheney's Energy Task Force &#8212; a dispute eventually dropped by the GAO.  He also refused to release to the Judiciary Committee memos prepared by John Roberts when Roberts worked in the solicitor general's office.<br />  <br />Was the claim of executive privilege justified in the case of Ms. Miers? <br /> <br />The answer is complicated, but only because the way that executive privilege fits within our system of constitutional democracy is also complicated.  For starters, all Presidents do have a legitimate claim to confidentiality in order to ensure a free flow of candid advice.  In specific cases, Presidents have additional, stronger reasons they might assert the privilege as well, such as maintaining state secrets or preventing sources and methods of intelligence gathering or planned troop movements from being disclosed.  Even beyond these specific grounds of executive privilege, however, the Supreme Court has recognized &quot;the valid need for protection of communications between high Government officials and those who advise and assist them in the performance of their manifold duties.&quot; It reasoned that &quot;[h]uman experience teaches that those who expect public dissemination of their remarks may well temper candor with a concern for appearances and for their own interests to the detriment of the decision making process.&quot;<br /><br />Recognizing the President's legitimate interests in confidentiality is only the beginning of any serious effort to locate executive privilege within our system of government.  The privilege has never been the "red line" that President Bush thinks it is, especially when the President is asserting only a "generalized" interest in confidentiality, instead of basing the privilege claim on state secrets or the like.<br />  <br />The very same Supreme Court decision that recognized a President's generalized interest in confidentiality also concluded that this interest must give way in the face of a stronger competing constitutional interest.  The case was United States v. Nixon, and the competing interest was the criminal justice system's access to information pertinent to a criminal investigation.  Hence the Court ordered tapes of Oval Office conversations to be turned over to the district court.  Nixon complied, and then resigned four days later.<br /><br />In the Miers case, the competing constitutional interest would have been the Senate's access to information relevant to evaluating the nominee's judicial philosophy and her approach to constitutional interpretation.  Would that interest have outweighed the President's need for confidentiality? <br /> <br />Obviously, people can disagree about which of these interests "weighs" more than the other.  That is one reason that in the relatively few occasions that executive privilege disputes between the Congress and the President have reached the courts, the courts have insisted that those two constitutional actors first work diligently to try to accommodate each other's legitimate interests before the courts step in to weigh them.  These are the two branches of government best equipped to consider the legitimate arguments of the other and to negotiate a middle ground to avoid a constitutional impasse, should one be available. <br /> <br />One type of accommodation would have the Senate narrowing its request to certain key documents and the White House then providing limited access to them.  After nominating William Rehnquist to be chief justice, President Reagan agreed to permit Senator Charles Mathias of Maryland and a Senate staff attorney access to Rehnquist&#39;s records at the Office of Legal Counsel &#8212; even though President Nixon had refused a similar request thirteen years earlier when he first nominated Rehnquist to the Court.  Nixon had, however, offered an accommodation on his own dispute with the special prosecutor over the tapes, but Archibald Cox rejected the offer to permit Senator John Stennis &#8212; who was hard of hearing -- to listen to the tapes and prepare summaries. <br /> <br />So sometimes the accommodation process avoids impasse and sometimes it does not.  When a President erroneously concludes that executive privilege is a "red line," however, no accommodation is even attempted.  Had that accommodation process been undertaken in good faith on both sides, the Senate's need for some negotiated access to information relevant to Ms. Miers constitutional views might well have carried the day.  Anyone wh
o works in the White House or anywhere else in the Executive Branch has understood for years that executive privilege is not an absolute privilege and that there are in fact competing interests that will outweigh it.  That is the lesson of <em>United States v. Nixon</em>, as well as of a long history of accommodations that have resulted in some disclosure.  Candid advice giving would be chilled were disclosures to become routine, but that has not been the pattern of past practices, and a selective, narrowed disclosure of information here would not have changed the pattern.<br />  <br />In fact, President Bush's own belief that his refusal was essential to preserving the ability of Presidents to receive candid advice suggests as much.  The fact that his predecessors have accommodated similar requests in the past without, by President Bush's own admission, destroying candid advice giving seems to refute the idea that selected disclosure here would have destroyed that ability.  <br />  <br /><br /><em>Christopher H.

When the leak was disclosed two years ago I <a href="/forum/forumnew129.php">urged an independent investigation</a> in a previous JURIST <em>Forum</em> column. Now Special Counsel Patrick J. Fitzgerald has announced a five count indictment against I. Lewis Libby, including charges of false statements, perjury, and obstruction of justice, and   has vowed to continue his investigation into alleged wrongdoing.<br /><br />The Fitzgerald probe centers on the unauthorized release of the identity of Valerie Plame, wife of former ambassador Joseph Wilson.  Plame was an undercover operative, specializing in weapons of mass destruction, and had an extensive undercover career with the CIA.  The unauthorized release of her identity compromised both her safety and the safety of her family, associates and other CIA operatives here and across the globe.  Moreover, because of her special status as a non-official cover (one not attached to a state department and operating in very sensitive cases), her role within the CIA, her career, and the identity of other undercover operatives has been threatened.  At this point, the CIA has not yet evaluated or assessed the damage done by Plame's outing, but one can expect the impact to be great.<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/cialeak.php">CIA Leak Case</a> | Text: <a href="/gazette/2005/10/libby-cia-leak-indictment-us-doj.php">Libby indictment</a> | Audio: <a  href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/monitor/2005/10/fitzgerald-libby-indictment-press.php">DOJ indictment press conference</a><br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br />Libby is not charged as the source of the unauthorized leak of Plame's name. Instead, he is charged with lying about it repeatedly, both to government agents and to the federal grand jury. In doing so, he obstructed justice by intentionally impeding a federal investigation.  Using perjury, false statement, and obstruction of justice allows the prosecutor to bring serious federal criminal charges without involving the classification hurdles that might result if the case centered on classified information.<br /><br />Some view this case as much larger than the leak of classified information: an indictment of the war in Iraq and the flawed information that Bush offered in support of the use of military force.  Others see Fitzgerald's indictment as nothing more than a political action against a forgetful and busy public servant, focusing on the cover up crimes rather than the underlying criminal act of the release of classified information.  The truth lies somewhere in between.<br /><br />Fitzgerald did not charge Libby with knowingly disclosing the identity of a covert agent.  To do so, Fitzgerald would have to establish that Libby knowingly disclosed classified information at the time that he revealed it.  This is a more difficult level of proof, and government officials were obstructing the evidence gathering process.  Cover up crimes of the type brought in this indictment are very serious and are directed to an independent harm: the integrity of government investigations.  Federal obstruction of justice statutes, for example, criminalize efforts to interfere with official investigations and to obfuscate and mislead investigators.  Perjury requires a lie under oath, and Libby is charged with doing so on two occasions, both times to the federal grand jury investigating the matter.  False statement charges criminalize the making of a variety of sworn and unsworn statement in matters within the jurisdiction of the government. Libby is alleged to have lied to the FBI on two occasions.  Each of these offenses seeks to ensure that governmental functions are not disrupted or compromised and that an investigation can be resolved through truthful evidence gathering.<br /><br />Each of the crimes charged may be brought ancillary to a primary investigation or alone.  Here, the identity of the person or persons who initially disclosed the name of Valerie Plame has not yet been revealed.  It was obvious from Fitzgerald's announcement that this underlying unauthorized disclosure of classified information charge might be forthcoming. Whether it is or not is irrelevant to the present charges which stand alone. <br /><br />The grand jury is entitled to every person's evidence if it is to ferret out criminal activity. In this case their critical nature of the lies and obstruction is compounded because of the sensitivity of the information that was compromised.  With a typical perjury or false statement case, the lie must be material and central to the investigation.  Trivial lies, such as those concerning a sex partner, are not usually prosecuted as a federal offense.  By contrast, here, the lie is directly related to critical governmental function: the operation of the CIA and its undercover agents.  Plame's classified status was released by high ranking government officials and this signals to the world that our own government does not stand behind its agents and is willing to compromise operations around the globe. This disclosure gives hostile governments an inside look at the operation of the CIA, something the agency vigorously protected.  <br /><br />Because Plame is an ambassador's wife, this tells the world that that the CIA uses an ambassador's spouse as an investigative tool.  The fact that Plame's cover was protected for many years, even from her neighbors and family, puts into question the status of other spouses of ambassadors who might also be working for the CIA.   Moreover, the fact that this revelation came from our own government makes it that much more troubling.  The serious damage from this leak will be felt for years to come, and it is quite possible that we will never know the extent of the damage, given the fact that an internal CIA investigation into the leak will also be classified. These lies and attempts to prevent a full investigation are of the most serious type.<br /><br />The use of perjury, false statements, and obstruction of justice has become a frequent occurrence in difficult white collar investigations recently.  The reason is because the government can more easily prove these crimes rather than the difficult crimes revolving on the disclosure of classified information. In addition, the very ob
struction charge Libby faces suggests that he mislead investigators when they attempted to get to the heart of the matter of the leak. Proof of disclosure may be more difficult because it involves evidence that may itself be classified. In fact, if the evidence is not declassified for trial, then a prosecutor may have difficulty presenting a criminal case beyond a reasonable doubt.<br /><br />Proof difficulties here should not be understated.  The outing of Plame is public knowledge now, but the reasons for her classified status and her precise duties are not.  In order to prove the disclosure of classified information, the government must first establish its classified nature and other factors surrounding its classification. This information is not always declassified for use at trial, and the need to know or compromise this evidence is not necessarily warranted.  For example, if Fitzgerald had to make a choice to forego charges based on the classified information and instead focus on the serous felonies of falsification and obstruction, he made a wise choice indeed.  The basis of these prosecutorial decisions is rarely revealed. <br /><br />Prosecutions based on classified information can become compromised in many ways, as witnessed by the Iran/Contra investigation, which entailed a struggle between the executive and independent counsel over classified information.  Ultimately, the convictions were reversed because of the exposure of immunized evidence, and much of the evidence that was excluded at trial was not authorized for public use. <br /><br />Evidence in the case will invariably involve a detailed chronology of events in the Vice President's office and conversations between the VP and his staff, as well as between the president and his staff. Proof in the case will reveal just what was said in the president and vice president's office about Plame and her role in the CIA.  The chronological details will, perhaps, tell us much more than we should know. After all, in this day of terror alerts, don't we want CIA operatives who are acting in our best interests to be safe from harm?<br /><br /><br /><em>Sandra D.

The President has unveiled a multi-billion dollar plan to cope with bird flu.  This plan has been criticized by some as too little, too late, and by others as a giveaway to the drug industry and a strategy to divert attention from his failures in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.  There is some truth in all of these criticisms.  Most of what follows focuses on the narrow legal issues raised by bird flu control measures, not the larger policy question of whether bird flu merits its current attention from politicians.<br /><br /><strong>The President&#39;s Plan</strong><br /><br />The President&#39;s plan has five components: surveillance; vaccine development; stockpiling Tamiflu; immunization programs; and quarantine and other restrictions.<br /><br /><em>Surveillance</em><br /><br />There is already a global flu surveillance system, including cooperating hospitals and health care institutions in the United States.  Public health surveillance - reporting infected persons to the state, and investigating the source of the infection - raises personal privacy issues.  The United States Supreme Court upheld public health reporting in <em>Whalen v. Roe</em>, 429 US 589 (1977), which dealt with mandatory reporting of narcotics prescriptions.  Some physicians opposed disease reporting in the late 1800s and the early 1900s, but it was generally accepted until the 1980s, when civil libertarians mounted a public relations campaign to prevent reporting of HIV.  While this opposition to HIV reporting affected some other reporting systems, flu surveillance has not been controversial in the United States.  Surveillance has been controversial in China, where most flu strains originate, because it affects trade and travel.  The Chinese experience with SARS - which showed that fear of disease can be more disruptive than the disease - has made them more receptive to participating in the global flu surveillance system.  <br /><br />Flu surveillance could become controversial if being reported would result in individual sanctions or inconvenience. This could range from being under house arrest (home quarantine) to being put in a quarantine facility.   While this would be an acceptable use of the state&#39;s police power, it would be politically unpopular.  Since physicians tend to not bother with disease reporting in general, reporting rates could be expected to fall if there was patient resistance.<br /><br /><em>Vaccine Development</em><br /><br />The current system of producing vaccines is slow, but known to be safe.  Slow is mostly a problem because of Congressional incompetence, not because of the flu cycle.  Congress does not want to buy flu vaccine for the entire population on the long term contracts necessary to justify a major commitment by the drug industry.  Worse, Congress only wants to buy a minimum amount of vaccine.  In a good year, this means that supplies are tight and inevitable distribution bottlenecks result in shortages - there is a shortage of vaccine right now (Nov 2005), despite all the problems with vaccine shortages last year.  In a bad year, like 2004, one of the producers will have problems that make its vaccine unavailable, leading to huge shortfalls because there is no backup vaccine available.  Congress also forces vaccine makers to make one vaccine, guessing about the most likely strain to spread.  If you guess wrong, as happened in 2004, the vaccine is less effective. It would be better to hedge our bets with multiple vaccines.<br /><br />Rather than systematically reform the general flu vaccine system, which would have benefits every flu season, the current plan stresses the development and stockpiling of experimental vaccines based on the existing bird flu strain.  Approving and use of this vaccine will require waiving the regulations on experimental drugs, as well as assuring manufacturers that they would be protected against any legal liability.  This can be done through the BioShield Program authorized by Congress.  <br /><br /><em>Tamiflu</em><br /><br />Stockpiling Tamiflu is expensive and subject to real problems with distribution.  It is also not a magic bullet.  It can make an important difference in the course of flu for strains that are susceptible, and that would be essential if there were a large number of cases.  There is no assurance, however, the eventual strain of bird flu will be susceptible, and the more Tamiflu in circulation, the greater the chance that it will be ineffective.  The more the government focuses on Tamiflu, the more individuals stockpile the drug themselves and use it for every cold.  It may also be the wrong choice - secondary infections with bacteria cause many of the deaths from flu, and stockpiling only anti-viral drugs does nothing to deal with potential shortages of antibiotics.<br /><br /><em>Immunization Programs</em><br /><br />Many people will resist vaccination with an experimental vaccine, which raises the issue of mandatory vaccinations.  Current federal policy does not include mandatory vaccinations, and, outside of some laboratory workers, there are no mandatory vaccination laws for adults.  While it is expected that the United States Supreme Court would still uphold mandatory vaccination laws, most politicians are unwilling to support mandatory vaccinations.  The United States Supreme Court complicated the traditional vaccination laws by limiting the use of religious exceptions - if states allow religious objections (which are not required by the Court), they must also allow exemptions based on other beliefs.  Add in the experimental nature of the vaccine, and it is unlikely that Congress or the state and federal governments will pass mandatory vaccination laws, and that agencies will be reticent to order these through administrative orders or regulations.<br /><br />Many other persons would demand vaccine, which is expected to be rationed based on the individual&#39;s risk of contracting bird flu, the risk of spreading it to others, and chance that the flu will kill them.  There will be legal challenges to the rationing system, but these are unlikely to be successful because the courts will defer to agency.  More likely will be work actions based on access to vaccine.  For example, rationing plans often exclude risks to the worker&#39;s family, such as allow health care workers to be vaccinated, but not their families.  Since this puts the families at risk, many health care workers may refuse to come to work unless their families are also protected.<br /><br /><em>Quarantine</em><br /><br />Quarantine and other restrictions are the most troubling part of the plan.  Quarantine and travel restrictions are useful to keep isolated outbreaks from spreading.  SARS was such an outbreak.  It appeared in a limited number of locations and there were clear links between the outbreaks.  If a dangerous flu epidemic could be detected at its origin, probably in south China, it might be possible to contain it with quarantine while other control measures such as vaccines were ramped up.  This is not the usual pattern with flu.  In a pandemic the virus appears in  many places at about the same time.  <br /><br />Quarantining large numbers of persons in U.S. cities would require extensive social support, such as providing food and medical care to the quarantined in
dividuals, and assuring that they are paid for lost time at work.  There are no provisions for these social services in the federal plan, and no states or localities have the resources to provide them.  This would reduce voluntary compliance with quarantine, raising the issue of enforcement.  The federal government has no state rules of engagement for quarantine, and is unlikely to do so: what politician wants a guideline on when to shoot the soccer mom and her kids escaping in the minivan? <br /><br /><strong>Conclusion</strong><br /><br />Focusing on one strain of flu out of the large universe of possible candidates for a killer pandemic is the wrong strategy.  The focus should be on improving the response to the yearly epidemics.  This will make us better prepared if a deadly strain emerges, and will save thousands of lives and billions in economic losses every year.  There should be stable, long term funding for vaccine purchase, and it should include enough redundant vaccine to allow for manufacturing failures, bad guesses on the pandemic strain, and to avoid distribution bottlenecks.  <br /><br />The Congress and the President have ignored the problem of people who refuse to take the vaccine.  Stopping an epidemic of flu requires a higher percentage of the population to be vaccinated for flu than we have ever achieved.  This is because you have to start  over each year because each flu outbreak is a slightly different strain.  Even in health care, where unvaccinated workers are a threat to patients, there are no mandatory vaccination requirements and many health care workers refuse to be vaccinated.  Before worrying about the logistics of massive quarantine, Congress and the President need to face the difficult political problem of individual vaccinations.<br /><br />If concerns about bird flu are transformed into a rational approach to mitigating our yearly flu pandemics, they will serve a useful purpose.  If they are used to justify massive spending on drugs and hypothetical vaccines, without addressing the fundamental issues of flu control, they will merely repeat the mistakes of the swine flu campaign and leave the public worse off in the long run.<br />    <br /><br /><em><a href="http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/">Edward P.

The court's decision in the Quinlan case was the first from a state supreme court that recognized the right of a close family member (in that case, a parent) to direct that life-sustaining treatment (a ventilator) be removed from a patient in a persistent vegetative state.  <br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/schiavo.php">Schiavo Right-to-Die Case</a> | Video: <a href="/monitor/2005/04/terri-schiavo-saga-u-pennsylvania.php">The Terri Schiavo saga</a> [U.

State-by-state, legislatures and courts have worked out the basic ground-rules that guide medical decision making for patients who cannot make those decisions for themselves.  While differences exist as to the details, the broad contours in most states follow the general pattern set out in the New Jersey Supreme Court's 1976 opinion.  <br /><br />In our post-Quinlan world, unless the now-incompetent patient previously designated a different decision maker, a close family member (usually identified by statute in a list of next-of kin, in order of preference) may decide, with the attending physician, to withhold life-sustaining treatment (including, in most states, artificial nutrition and hydration) from a patient diagnosed to be in a terminal or irreversible condition.  Some states require a high level of proof as to the patient's prior wishes on the matter.  Some states require quite specific statements by the patient (when competent) as to the precise medical circumstances under which particular life-sustaining treatments should be withheld or withdrawn.  In all states, however, a patient's legally recognized surrogate decision maker may direct that life-sustaining treatment not be provided if the surrogate can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the patient would not want the treatment under present circumstances.  <br /><br />After March 31, 2005, it may be more accurate to say, as an ethics colleague of mine has suggested, that we are living in a "post-Schiavo world."  Just what this post-Schiavo world will look like, only time will tell, but the indications are unsettling.  Here are a few of the developments that will bear watching:<ul><li><em>Legislators Behaving Badly</em><br /><br />The intensity of the litigation concerning Terri Schiavo's treatment made that intrafamilial controversy remarkable.  What made the controversy  flabbergasting was the role played first by the Florida legislature and then by the United States Congress.  The Florida lawmakers authorized Governor Jeb Bush to take over the case, to overrule all judicial orders that were still extant, and to order the reinsertion of Ms. Schiavo's feeding tube after it had been removed in October 2003.  <br /><br />Then, as the case was winding down this year, the Florida legislature couldn't agree on another intervention strategy, so the Congress moved in.  Congressional committees called Terri Schiavo, her husband, and her caregivers to testify about the quality of care available to patients with chronic disabilities.  The extraordinary invitations in turn triggered the operation of a federal law that makes it a crime for anyone to interfere with the ability of an individual to testify before Congress.  The use of a tool that ordinarily is directed at the bosses of organized crime families speaks volumes about the mindset of the legislators behind this move.  In apparent recognition that their invitation to testify was not having the intended effect, Congress then passed a jurisdictional statute that allowed the parents of Terri Schiavo to go to federal court to get review of the voluminous Florida proceedings.  A few days later, Congressional committees sought to intervene as parties in the Florida litigation.<br /><br />The Harris Poll reported on <a href="http://harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PID=558">April 15</a> that 57 percent of the public disapproved of the Florida legislature's behavior and 58 percent disapproved of Congress' handling of the matter.  You might expect lawmakers to be somewhat chastened by the public's decidedly negative reaction to their involvement in what many regard to be a private matter.  But public criticism did not stop Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Tex.) from intervening in late April in another right-to-die case in Houston.<br /><br />The willingness of families who have lost their end-of-life court battles to appeal to legislators appears to be a new development, albeit an understandable one.  What is not understandable (at least to me) is the willingness of legislators to get involved in a most nonlegislative way in these cases.  <br /><br /><li><em>What Treatments are Optional?</em><br /><br />It apparently came as a surprise to a lot of members of Congress and the public that "artificial nutrition and hydration" ("ANH") is deemed to be "life-sustaining treatment" and therefore is an intervention that may be refused on behalf of an incompetent patient under Florida law.  In fact, most states regard ANH the same way.  This was not the case in 1976, but a majority of ethicists, clinicians, and courts have gradually accepted the notion that ANH may, at least under some circumstances, be just as "extraordinary" and just as optional as, say, a mechanical ventilator or dialysis.  As a result, in most jurisdictions ANH may be withheld or withdrawn on the same basis &#8212; including substituted judgment or, when applicable, the best interests of the patient &#8212; as any other life-sustaining treatment.<br /><br />These principles and pract
ices will change in a post-Schiavo world if groups like the National Right to Life Committee have their way.  Building on the public's interest in the Schiavo case, NRTL is promoting its "Model Starvation and Dehydration of Persons With Disabilities Prevention Act."  The Act would create a presumption against the withholding of ANH unless that outcome was explicitly contemplated in the patient's living will or if there is "clear and convincing evidence that the person . . . gave express and informed consent to [rejection of] nutrition or hydration in the applicable circumstances."   Iowa has a version (pending as House Study Bill 302), as does Florida (HB 701), and &#8212; according to news reports &#8212; Alabama, Hawaii, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Dakota (sometimes filed under a different name).<br /><br /><li><em>Mis- and Disinformation</em><br /><br />Throughout the media frenzy surrounding the last few weeks of Terri Shiavo's life, I kept wondering, "where are the neurologists (and gerontologists and palliative-care specialists)?"  If members of the lay public are now thoroughly confused about vegetative states, the minimally conscious state, coma, and brain death, as well as the physiological experience of end-of-life dehydration, they can hardly be blamed.  Wild theories with no scientific or medical basis had seemingly ready access to the airwaves.  Any future public debate on reforming our end-of-life laws will first require serious and sustained educational efforts to counter the misinformation that was pumped out through the media.<br /><br />All of us with a professional interest in this subject should be willing to play a part in the educational process.  For our own benefit, we would do well to prepare for the public discussion, perhaps by reading the careful and thoughtful articles in recent issues of JAMA and the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> by Larry Gostin, Tim Quill, and George Annas.</ul><br />  <br /> <br /><em>Tom Mayo is a professor of law at Dedman School of Law, Southern Methodist University, and Director of the Cary M.

Despite this, the White House is at it again.  Now it is manipulating facts to win support for an unlawful and immoral policy on interrogation.  Using confidential briefings to Congressmen and other tactics, Vice President Cheney, David Addington, and some in the White House Counsel's office are trying to make a case for the necessity of using cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment to gather intelligence.  <br /><br />There is no necessity to use such tactics.  In fact, they are counter-productive.  Even more importantly they are unlawful, and, most importantly, they are immoral.[<a href="#*">*</a>]  By now the White House pro-abuse group should have no credibility whatsoever.  Members of Congress should not believe their claims.  The public record is clear on the lawful, moral and effective way to conduct interrogation.   <br /><br />Senators John McCain, Lindsey Graham and John Warner are fully aware of that public record and have sponsored legislation to ensure that the America does interrogation right.  The Senate, by overwhelming majority (90-9), passed the McCain Amendment to the Defense Appropriation Bill on October 5.  The Amendment mandates that no individual under the physical control of the U.S. government may be subjected to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment and that persons in U.S. military detention will be interrogated according to the Army's Field Manual on Interrogation. <br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/torture.php">Torture</a> | Text: <a href="/gazette/2005/10/mccain-detainee-treatment-amendment-us.php">McCain detainee treatment amendment</a> | Video: <a  href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/monitor/2005/10/torture-and-war-on-terror-cwru.php">Torture and the War on Terror</a> [CWRU]<br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br />It is no surprise the Amendment received such overwhelming support:  It simply restates the already binding law forbidding cruel, inhuman or degrading interrogation techniques by anyone, anywhere.  The Bush Administration's infamous "torture memos," may have confused some interrogators about the law.  The Amendment ends the confusion.    <br /><br />The Amendment also ensures that all interrogations with a connection to the Department of Defense follow a uniform set of standards as set out in the Army Field Manual.  The Senators want to prevent future crises like the one at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq where a variety of military and civilian interrogators (as well as prison guards, translators, and other military and civilian personnel) were either unclear about the rules or followed different rules in interrogating the same people.  <br /><br />Professor John Yoo, an author of several of the torture memos, writing in an op-ed in <em>USA Today</em> (Nov. 2, 2005) states, however, that the McCain Amendment would not have prevented Abu Ghraib because the abuses "resulted from sadistic behavior on the 'night shift' and were illegal."  This is pure disinformation.  We now have thousands of pages of reports from the media, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and even Department of Defense investigators that abuse of detainees has been widespread, has occurred day and night, and has occurred most often pursuant to interrogation. Here is just one finding from the report by Generals Faye and Jones into the abuse of Abu Ghraib: "The CIA conducted unilateral and joint interrogation operations at Abu Ghraib.  The CIA's detention and interrogation practices contributed to a loss of accountability and abuse at Abu Ghraib.  No memorandum of understanding existed on the subject of interrogation operations between the CIA and CJTF-7, and local CIA officers convinced military leaders that they should be allowed to operate outside the established local rules and procedures." Executive Summary b. (4).<br /><br />The McCain Amendment will mandate that all interrogators with a connection to the Department of Defense use lawful and consistent techniques.  There is really nothing to object to in the Amendment and everything to applaud.  Yet the White House has threatened to veto it.  Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, apparently at the behest of Vice President Cheney, instead of fighting for his colleagues' Amendment in the Senate-House conference committee is talking about more flexibility for the CIA.  Why?  More flexibility for the CIA will not solve the problem of differing standards during interrogation.  Rather it will open the door for continued confusion over the intent of Congress and risk further abuse in violation of US and international law.<br /><br />In fact, the <em>Army Field Manual</em> as currently written is a sound guide to the existing law and, according to many experienced interrogators, the best practice on interrogation. The current Army techniques are time-tested as to both their legality and effectiveness.  Using them insulates interrogators from criminal and civil liability in this country and abroad, while providing them with the techniques they need to effectively perform their mission. (Professor Yoo also absurdly mischaracterizes Army interrogation techniques.) <br /><br />Diluting the McCain Amendment will not change the law, but it will send the wrong signal to CIA interrogators that they can flout the law.  Members of Congress who go along with the argument for different rules or more flexibility for the CIA are doing a serious disservice to the Agency's interrogators and to the U.S.  <br /><br />Since the beginning of the global war on terror, the administration in Washington has consistently engaged in interrogation and prisoner handling practices that have been at odds with the international legal norms to which it subscribes. It is a dark irony that these unlawful practices are also counterproductive to efforts to gain reliable intelligence on terrorist operations.  From a practical point of view, it is well understood among top interrogators that abusive interrogation techniques produce intelligence that must be considered unreliable.  In addition, these tactics have now led to the deaths of many in our custody.  <br /><br />In the words of a highly-experience and successful United State Army interrogator:<blockquote>Such behavior not only c
auses needless suffering for the victim and is criminal, it jeopardizes the intelligence collection effort.  Once a prisoner has been abused, gaining his or her willing cooperation is often impossible, even for a highly-skilled interrogator.  In addition, any information gained during such an interrogation cannot be regarded as dependable or reliable.</blockquote>The Administration has publicly claimed that it has gotten useful information using coercive and abusive tactics at Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo.  One of the FBI e-mails from Guant&Atilde;&iexcl;namo Bay, released in December 2004, however, states "These tactics have produced no intelligence of a threat neutralization nature to date."<br /><br />The more important it is to get information and the faster we need it, the better to use the most reliable methods.  Studies of effective interrogation show consistently that the best way to get information is to use highly trained and talented interrogators who can gain the trust of the interrogee.  It is unclear why the Vice President is so confident that abuse is effective.  But, then, the Vice President was confident that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction, and he was confident that we did not need as many troops in Iraq as his top generals said we did.  The Vice President has been tragically wrong and he is wrong again.  Every time we fail to get information through these counter-productive techniques, we endanger the lives and well being of American servicemen and women and our national security.  Daily we weaken our right to demand humane treatment at the international law standard for our own people if captured and on behalf of victims of abuse the worldover.  <br /><br />And then there is the larger problem of counter-productivity.  Not only is coercive interrogation unreliable, societies known to use torture, coercion and abuse have not resolved their problems with terrorism.  Societies that have abandoned such practices or never used them in the first place have had greater success.<br /><br />The McCain Amendment should put a stop to unlawful practices.  It is also an important step forward to re-establishing our reputation as a proud, moral nation that respects the rule of law.  As Senator McCain has said, this country is now known as a nation that tortures and abuses and no longer as a champion of human rights.  <br /><br />After passing the McCain Amendment, the next step on our road to redemption should  be the prosecution of high-ranking civilian and military personnel who have violated the law by ordering or authorizing unlawful interrogation tactics.  If Scooter Libby can be indicted for lying, others can and should be indicted for cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.    <br /><br />------------------<br /><br /><font SIZE=2 style='font-size: 8pt'><a name="*">*</a> This <em>Forum</em> is based on Mary Ellen O'Connell, &quot;Affirming the Ban on Coercive Interrogation,&quot; 66 <em>Ohio State Law Journal</em> (forthcoming 2005) available at http://ssrn.com/abstract=811046.)</font><br /><br /> <br /><em>Mary Ellen O'Connell holds the Robert &amp; Marion Short Chair in Law at Notre Dame University</em><br />

In addition to the jailing of <em>New York Times</em> reporter Judith Miller and the home confinement of a Rhode Island television reporter, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press lists at least nine other journalists who face sanctions for refusing to disclose the names of their confidential sources.<br /><br /> The latest bad news is the indictment of Scooter Libby, the Vice President&#39;s Chief of Staff, on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice.  The outcome of the investigation by special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald appears likely to undermine key arguments for a federal media shield law.  In particular, reports of conversations between Miller and Libby cast doubt on the value of according journalists an absolute privilege to protect the identities of their confidential sources.<br />  <br /> Even before the indictment, Fitzgerald&#39;s investigation into who leaked undercover CIA officer Valerie Plame&#39;s identity to news reporters had led to a crucial piece of bad news from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.  In February, the D.C. Circuit ruled against a First Amendment privilege to protect journalists from being compelled to reveal their confidential sources when called to testify before a grand jury.<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/cialeak.php">CIA Leak Case</a> | Text: <a href="/gazette/2005/10/libby-cia-leak-indictment-us-doj.php">Libby indictment</a> | Audio: <a  href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/monitor/2005/10/fitzgerald-libby-indictment-press.php">DOJ indictment press conference</a><br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /> The D.C. Circuit&#39;s decision underlined a significant reversal for the claim of a constitutional journalist&#39;s privilege.  True, the U.S. Supreme Court had decided in <em>Branzburg v. Hayes</em>, 408 U.S. 665 (1972), that a journalist could not rely on the First Amendment to refuse to testify when questioned by a grand jury.  Still, nearly every Circuit that considered the question in the next ten years had found a qualified journalist&#39;s privilege.  Reversing direction, by the late 1990s, the Fifth Circuit had joined the Sixth Circuit in reading Branzburg literally, and in 2001, the Fifth Circuit held that the First Amendment provided little or no protection for reporters in a grand jury investigation.  As of <em>In re Grand Jury Subpoena of Judith Miller</em>, 397 F.3d 964 (D.C. Cir. 2005), the D. C. Circuit agreed.<br /><br /> After that decision, First Amendment protection for a journalist's refusal to name sources seemed unlikely, but the outlook for the federal media shield statutes introduced in Congress seemed brighter.  Now, it appears that the ripples from the special prosecutor's investigation may sink the prospects for a federal statutory privilege as well.<br /><br /> The argument for a journalist's privilege rests on the First Amendment value of the media&#39;s role in gathering and reporting truthful information.  To justify an absolute privilege, the &quot;long run&quot; truth-seeking value of protecting the confidential source must be seen as always outweighing a prosecutor&#39;s short-term need to obtain truthful testimony from a reporter.  By obtaining Libby&#39;s indictment after gaining the testimony of the reporter who protected him, Fitzgerald added a hefty weight to the prosecutor&#39;s end of the balance.<br />  <br /> Some journalists argued from the beginning that the Valerie Plame story was the wrong one on which to stake a claim of a journalist&#39;s privilege.  In the Plame story, the confidential sources were not low-level or powerless individuals providing truthful information about wrongdoing by high government officials; instead, the sources were high government officials trying to undermine the credibility of a critic of government policy.  The now-revealed ground rules of the relationship between these government officials and reporters has made even long-time supporters of a federal media shield law feel queasy.  And no wonder.<br />  <br /> Rather than granting confidentiality to sources only when necessary, some reporters apparently assumed that an ongoing, unspoken pledge of blurred attribution was necessary to assure continued access to and relationships with powerful officials.  Rather than risking jail to protect someone who would suffer serious consequences if it were known by higher-ups that the source had revealed truthful information, some reporters risked jail to protect White House officials who were actively peddling information.  While reporters usually promise confidentiality to persuade a reluctant source to divulge information, it seems likely here that almost nothing could have dissuaded these sources from sharing what they knew.  In all these ways, the reporting of the Plame story supports the Branzburg court&#39;s observation that a constitutional privilege is unnecessary because &quot;the relationship of many informants to the press is a symbiotic one which is unlikely to be greatly inhibited by the threat of subpoena.&quot;<br /><br /> These reporter-source relationships seem far removed from those that arose in the early 1970s in a flurry of subpoenas issued by the Nixon Justice Department.  In Branzburg, the reporters claiming a privilege had declined to identify sources they used to investigate illegal drug operations in Kentucky and to report on various activities of the Black Panther Party in Massachusetts and California.  Although the argument that the First Amendment provided protection for newsgathering was rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court in Branzburg, the journalists there were able to present sources who clearly would not have come forward to talk with reporters absent a pledge of confidentiality.  In such cases, journalists can argue &#8212; with a straight face &#8212; that testifying or turning over names would turn an independent press into an investigative arm of the government and silence potential future sources.  Neither claim can be made here.<br />    <br /> How can supporters of a federal journalist's privilege salvage something from this?  First, editors and reporters at traditional news organizations must do a better job of living up to their own standards.  In 1999, the Committee of Concerned Journalists undertook a three-year study that culminated in the publication of <em>The Elements of Journalism</em>.  The book&#
39;s list of elements begins with journalism&#39;s obligation to pursue &quot;journalistic truth,&quot; followed by the obligation to pay its "first loyalty . . . to citizens," observe a "discipline of verification," maintain "independence from those they cover," and serve as "an independent monitor of power."  In reporting the story of the leaking of Valerie&#39;s Plame&#39;s identity, some news organizations forgot these requirements.<br /><br /> Second, supporters of a federal journalist's privilege should reconsider whether they can justify an absolute privilege to protect the identities of confidential sources.  The legislation now pending in both the House and Senate would provide an absolute privilege to refuse to disclose sources (except in the case of an imminent threat to national security) and a limited or qualified privilege to withhold other information.  Given the Fitzgerald investigation, a privilege that cannot be overcome under any circumstances seems unlikely to gain sufficient support. <br />  <br /> Finally, because being a well-known White House reporter may be irreconcilably different from being an independent monitor of power, mainstream journalists should support the extension of federal and state shield laws to those who are engaged in the process of journalism but who work in nontraditional media.  If nothing else, this year&#39;s revelations should remind established news organizations of A.J. Liebling&#39;s comment (a favorite of bloggers everywhere) that the only guarantee of a free press is to own one.<br /><br /><br /><em>Linda Berger is Professor of Law at Thomas Jefferson School of Law in San Diego, California where she teaches legal writing, media law and the First Amendment.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/staff/HovellD/">Devika Hovell</a> of the University of New South Wales Faculty of Law in Sydney, Australia, says that the trial of Australian Guantanamo detainee David Hicks by US military commission highlights his transformation from an alleged perpetrator of war crimes into a possible victim of one...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/devika.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he trial of David Hicks, the so-called &quot;Australian Taliban&quot;, before a United States Military Commission is scheduled to resume on November 18. Of the 500 detainees still imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay, Hicks is one of only four detainees formally charged with offences. The remaining detainees, many preparing to enter their fifth year of detention, have not yet been charged. In this sense, Hicks can be seen to be one of the 'lucky' ones, released from the limbo of detention in the absence of charge, trial or conviction. The paradox is that the treatment of David Hicks to date has transformed him from an alleged perpetrator of war crimes into a possible victim of one. This stems from his likely status as a prisoner of war. <br /><br />David Hicks was captured by Northern Alliance troops on 9 December 2001 during  armed conflict near Baghlan, Afghanistan. He was immediately handed over to the United States military. For two and a half years, David Hicks was then detained without charge at the United States military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. On 10 June 2004, the United States Department of Defense charged Mr. Hicks with war crimes subject to trial by Military Commission. His trial is scheduled to begin this month. Beyond the impact of a four year delay on the fairness of any criminal trial, the Military Commission, as presently constituted, violates international fair trial standards. The following aspects of the process are of primary concern:<ul><li><strong>Gravely limited rules of evidence:</strong> Military Commission Order No. 1 on Trial Procedure provides that evidence shall be admitted 'if, in the opinion of the Presiding Officer&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;, the evidence would have probative value to a reasonable person'. No further limitation is provided. Moreover, the US President's ruling can be overruled by a majority of the Commission. In a panel where only the President is required to be legally qualified, those making decisions on the admissibility of evidence may not even be aware of the rules of evidence, let alone apply them. This attracts greater concern in light of the power of the Commission to allow, in addition to live testimony from witnesses, 'any other evidence including, but not limited to, testimony from prior trials and proceedings, sworn or unsworn written statements, physical evidence, or scientific or other reports', the veracity of which would be unable to be tested by cross-examination. The negligible rules of evidence binding the Commission stand in stark contrast to the detailed rules of evidence contained in the United States Manual for Courts Martial.<br /><br /><li><strong>Diminished right of appeal:</strong> The appeal process is tightly controlled by the executive government of the United States, and accordingly lacks independence. Appeal against a decision of the Military Commission is to a Review Panel, consisting of three US military officers selected by the Secretary of Defense. The Panel may provide a recommendation to the Secretary of Defense, yet the President is to make the final decision as to whether this recommendation should be adopted. This should be contrasted with the thorough appeals process available to those subject to United States court martial. Court martial convictions are subject to an automatic appeal to a service Court of Criminal Appeals. If the conviction is affirmed by the service court, the appellant may request review by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, a civilian court composed of five civilian judges, and ultimately the US Supreme Court.</ul>Dissatisfaction with the military commission process has led a number of states to request the return of their citizens from Guantanamo Bay. The British Attorney-General described the military commission justice as 'not&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;the type of process which we would afford British nationals'. As of November 2005, 76 detainees had been transferred to the custody of other governments, including the United Kingdom, France, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Sudan, Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan. Interestingly, even the American government has exempted its nationals from the process.<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/hicks.php">David Hicks</a> | Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/militarycommissions.php">Military Tribunals</a> | Text: <a href="/gazette/2005/08/military-commission-procedure-changes.php">Military commission procedure changes</a> | Video: <a  href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/monitor/2005/11/military-commissions-prof-neal-katyal.php">Military commissions</a><br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br />Regrettably for David Hicks, the Australian government has been exceptional in this respect. The Australian Prime Minister confirmed in July 2005 that he was 'satisfied that the military commission process in relation to David Hicks&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;will provide a proper measure of justice'. It is perhaps unsurprising then (though somewhat curious) that one strategy employed by David Hicks' lawyers has been to attempt to obtain British citizenship for Mr. Hicks.<br /><br />The failure of the military commission process to provide David Hicks with a fair trial has significance beyond the violation of the rights of an individual detainee. Failure to provide a prisoner of war with a fair trial constitutes a war crime. Specifically, the Geneva Conventions require prisoners of war to be sentenced by the same courts according to the same procedure as in the case of members of the armed forces of the Detaining Power, in this case, United States court martial. As demonstrated above, the US military commission process falls well below this standard. The implications are significant. Failure to provide David Hicks with a fair trial would not merely implicate the present administration in future war crimes' allegations, but would threaten the reciprocal application of fundamental protections to US forces (and forces of other nationalities) in future armed conflicts. <br /><br />The President's 7 February 2002 blanket denial of prisoner of war status to all detainees captured in the war of Afghanistan indicated a dismissive approach to the significance of prisoner of war protections. In itself, this was in clear violation of the Article 5 of the Third Geneva Convention, which requires all persons falling into enemy hands to be presumed to be a prisoner of war until determined otherwise by a competent tribunal. <br /><br />Even beyond the entitlement to an initial presump
tion, sufficient doubt exists in the case of David Hicks to prompt any government wishing to preserve respect for the Geneva Conventions in future conflicts to recognize his status as a prisoner of war. Mr Hicks' moniker, the &quot;Australian Taliban&quot;, has legal implications distinguishing his case from the decision of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em> concerning the status of an Al Qaeda detainee (whatever the merits of that particular decision, or the result of the current Supreme Court appeal in that case). While David Hicks is alleged to have been associated with Al Qaeda, his involvement in the armed conflict in Afghanistan was also in support of the Taliban. In a letter to his father on 14 February 2000, he said 'I am now officially a Taliban member'. Even the Charge Sheet prepared by the United States Department of Defense acknowledges Mr Hicks' connection to the Taliban. Among the main conduct alleged against Mr Hicks to substantiate the charges is that he guarded a Taliban tank during the armed conflict in Afghanistan in 2001 and 'intentionally aided the enemy, to wit: al Qaida and the Taliban'.<br /><br />In his 7 February statement, the President failed to clarify why he labelled Taliban fighters as 'unlawful combatants' not entitled to prisoner of war status. The Third Geneva Convention clearly recognizes prisoners of war to include '[m]embers of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict as well as members of militias or volunteer corps forming part of such armed forces'. A memorandum from then-White House counsel and now US Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to the President suggests that the rationale was that the Taliban were 'militia' forces rather than the regular armed forces of Afghanistan. This classification would be unlikely to survive serious legal challenge. The Third Geneva Convention expressly provides that prisoner of war protections apply in relation to '[m]embers of regular armed forces who profess allegiance to a government or an authority not recognized by the Detaining Power'. Even if the Taliban armed forces included militia forces within its ranks, its members would still qualify as a prisoner of war under Article 4A(1) of the Convention, which expressly extends to 'members of militias or volunteer corps forming part of such armed forces'. <br /><br />The key issue that would need to be resolved by a competent tribunal established under Article 5 of the Third Geneva Convention is whether David Hicks distinguished himself from the civilian population. Even in the case of regular armed forces, combatants are expected to wear a uniform or a distinctive sign and must carry arms openly. Yet this does not require combatants to wear a uniform. Even the US Air Force Pamphlet acknowledges that 'less than a complete uniform will suffice provided it serves to distinguish clearly combatants from civilians'. If David Hicks carried his arms openly, and was clearly distinguishable from civilians, he should be recognized as a prisoner of war. Until this is determined by a competent tribunal, it is hard to resist drawing the conclusion from his capture by the Northern Alliance and detention at Guantanamo Bay that the forces capturing him were able to clearly identify him as a combatant. <br /><br />To suggest David Hicks may attract certain minimal protections under the law of armed conflict is not to legitimate his alleged conduct or the organizations he is alleged to have supported. The law of armed conflict is not concerned with legitimizing the causes of or participants in armed conflict, but with injecting a lowest common denominator of humanity into warfare. The Geneva Conventions were drafted in an attempt to rescue a modicum of humanity from a war which had exposed the perniciousness of uncompromising brutality, concentration camps and show trials. Attempts to circumvent the laws of war by labelling the armed forces of a party to the conflict a 'militia' and replacing the 'prisoner of war' status in the Geneva Conventions with a more flexible 'enemy combatant' status merely distorts these valuable legal standards, endangering their application in future conflicts. It is indisputable that, in the 'war against terrorism', the world is facing a monumental challenge. Yet if the trial against David Hicks continues in its present form, his accusers, rather than gracing the history pages as defenders of justice, may well themselves be judged for injustices perpetrated.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Devika Hovell is Director of the International Law Project at the Gilbert and Tobin Centre of Public Law at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, where she lectures on public international law, international humanitarian law and international dispute settlement.</em><br />

Dobie Langenkamp</a>, Director of the National Energy-Environment Law and Policy Institute at the University of Tulsa School of Law, says that for all the bad publicity surrounding the now-defunct UN Oil-for-Food program, the overall humanitarian effort was a success and the extent of any wrongdoing relatively minor...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/dobielangenkamp.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>D</strong></font>etractors of the UN have had a  field day in the press with the Oil-for-Food program with allegations of kickbacks, payoffs, influence peddling, nepotism and a corrupted Director &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; a Frenchman no less.<br /><br />The recently published Volcker Report on the program is impressive in its breadth, depth and balance.  It is a guide to improvement. It is not, however, much of a stick with which to beat the United Nations and Kofi Annan. After several years of lurid headlines the record of malfeasance is, frankly, underwhelming, if put in the proper perspective.<br /><br />Here are the facts. In the period from 1997 until the invasion in 2003, Iraq sold oil worth $64 billion pursuant to the program. In that period the combined total of Saddam's schemes -- kickbacks, illegal surcharges, overcharges for supplies, and undercharges for oil -- was 2.8% of the oil sales, about $1.8 billion   Thus 97.2% of the money collected went for its intended purpose.   <br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/oilforfood.php">Oil-for-Food</a> | Text: <a href="/gazette/2005/10/un-oil-for-food-manipulation-report.php">UN Oil-for Food manipulation report</a> | Video: <a  href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/monitor/2005/10/volcker-oil-for-food-final-report.php">Volcker Oil-for-Food final report briefing</a><br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br />The level of corruption would have been less had the UN not made an egregious error at the inception. For 5 years from 1990 Saddam obstinately refused to let the UN help feed Iraq's children with this program hoping that the misery would drive the UN into lifting the sanctions. In 1996 he reluctantly agreed to the outlines of the program and negotiations regarding its structure began. Iraq insisted on retaining the power to select, not only the purchasers of the oil, but the vendors of the humanitarian goods. After 50 meetings in the fall of 1995 and the spring of 1996 the UN gave in on these two crucial points thereby dooming any hope of complete transparency.  Saddam now was free to attempt to use the purchasing power and the sales power to attempt to enrich his friends and himself and to play international politics. That this blunder did not result in even greater problems can be attributed to a reasonably diligent UN.<br /><br /> The UN found itself confronted by a regime which was unparalled in its secrecy and deception.  This is a regime that concealed from the entire world the fact that it did NOT have weapons of mass destruction.  This is a society in which corruption and mendacity are so deeply imbedded that no program of this sort could be reasonably expected to attain complete transparency.<br /><br />What about Kofi Annan's son, Kojo, and the corrupt Frenchman, Benon Sevan, we have read about? Is this not rottenness at the core?  The report finds no evidence that Kojo's employer, Cotecna, a Swiss firm, ever received any special access to the Secretary General or other important decision makers for having employed him.  Benon Sevan, the French Director of the Program is a different case. Here we have alleged payments in the amount of $168,000 (vociferously denied by Sevan) in the form of oil allocations which could then be traded at a profit. Although no specific action taken by Sevan in breach of his duties was uncovered, he was by virtue of his position as Director in a position to do many favors for the Iraqi's and their friends. Volcker concludes that he "compromised his position by secretly soliciting and financially benefiting from oil allocations&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;" This stands as the only evidence of UN staff "corruption" in a $64 billion program. This was not for lack of trying on the Iraq's part. Early in the program millions of dollars were transmitted to middle men and fixers with the objective of corrupting Boutros-Boutros Ghali and others without success.<br /><br />This sanguine analysis, however, admittedly omits a significant problem - $8.3 billion of smuggled oil. This is Iraqi oil that was sold in excess of permitted amounts to unauthorized buyers. It did not consist of funds diverted from sales for humanitarian purposes as did the kickbacks and surcharges. It was occurring years before the program began and continued after the program commenced.  Approximately one-half of the "smuggled" oil went to Jordan pursuant to a long-standing trade protocol. The US and the UN knew of this trade and acquiesced in it. The oil sanctions imposed in 1990 "leaked" about 200,000 barrels a day from the beginning and continued to do so after the program commenced.<br /><br />It is important to distinguish this "illicit income" from corruption and mismanagement. If the smuggled oil had been totally interdicted it would not have increased the amount available for humanitarian purposes, but it would have decreased the funds available to Saddam. General Franks comment that it was an "Oil for Palaces Program" is not accurate. Most of Saddam&#39;s illicit cash came from the smuggled oil.<br /><br />At an earlier time I proposed the establishment of an Iraqi Peoples Trust that would take a portion Iraq's oil proceeds and distribute them directly to the people, similar to what is done in Alaska. This idea was considered impracticable because of the likelihood of corruption and inefficiency. "Do we even have a roll of the citizens? What's to prevent phony names and duplicate payments"? And so on. As has been said before "The perfect is the enemy of the good." It is important that Volker's excellent and needed investigation not lead to the wrong conclusions. In an era where the effectiveness of governmental action is measured against private action, this program should be evaluated in the context of the commercial world. Would any private international company deem a 2.8% cost for "middlemen' or "commission brokers" or "after sales service charges" an unacceptable result?  One estimate is that in selling arms to Saudi Arabia less than 50% of the funds actually go to acquire the weapons the rest going to middlemen, consultants and others. <br /><br />There is a bottom line here and Volcker stated it well: " [I]t is clear to the Committee that the Programme achieved considerable successes, notably in maintaining minimal standards of nutrition and health&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; the successes of the Programme...should not be buried by the allegations of corruption that have enjoyed so muc
h attention in the media and elsewhere."<br /><br />Before the program was instituted it has been estimated that over 500,000 Iraqi children had died from malnutrition and disease.  As a result of this effort tens, if not hundreds of thousands, of children and others were saved. The success of this program must not be overlooked because of  the inherent difficulties in dealing with a corrupt regime and flamboyant headlines.<br /> <br /><br /><em>R.

		<title>Why Feminists and Liberals Have Nothing to Fear from Judge Alito</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.hofstra.edu/Academics/Law/law_demleitner.cfm">Nora Demleitner</a>, former law clerk to Judge Samuel Alito and currently professor of law at Hofstra University School of Law, says that Judge Alito&#39;s judicial philosophy is driven by adherence to text, record, and precedent rather than dedication to a particular ideology...</p><hr size=1><br /> <font SIZE=3><strong>S</strong></font>ince having been nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court, Republicans and members of right-wing interest groups have hailed Judge Samuel Alito as one of their own.  They claim that as a Justice he would overturn <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, vote for states&#39; rights against the federal government, protect corporations against individual plaintiffs, restrict the federal government to its essential functions, and limit the rights of criminal defendants.  These assertions have stoked the flames of left-wing news media and advocacy groups.  They have embraced the notion that Justice Alito would prove to be to the right of Justice Scalia, and therefore is unsuitable to take the place of the so-called "moderate," Justice O'Connor.<br />  <br /> Both sides find support for their claims about Justice Alito's philosophy in his writings -- the hundreds of cases in which he has participated since joining the Third Circuit.  Individual cases may support one claim or another; there may even be a line of cases that supports the left's exaggerated fears about Judge Alito's supposed judicial philosophy.  He does have a judicial philosophy.  However, it has little to do with that of Justice Scalia or Judge Bork.<br /><br /> First, Judge Alito reads statutes closely, and attempts to ascertain their meaning from their text.  He will generally follow the language of a statute unless it is ambiguous or leads to an absurd result.  Second, he reads the lower court record.  His years as an appellate litigator have trained him to do that, and he has followed this practice faithfully during his time on the Third Circuit.  He refuses to ascribe arguments to an advocate, or base his decisions on statements not made at trial.  Third, he follows precedent &#8212; Supreme Court decisions as well as those of the Third Circuit.  In the last few decades the Supreme Court has frequently  made that difficult for lower courts.  And a few times Judge Alito, attempting to decipher the meaning of a precedent or predicting the outcome of a line of cases, has been reversed.  In each of these cases, though, he made an honest effort to reach the legally correct result, independent of his personal beliefs.<br /> <br /> How do we label this judicial philosophy? Conservative? Maybe. Boring? Perhaps.  With Judge Alito you get what you see, a first-rate legal analyst who, despite claims to the contrary, has judged every case on its own, has struggled with the law and the facts, and has attempted to explain his rationale to his fellow judges, the litigants, and the public.  His experience as a federal prosecutor has not led to automatic decisions for the government but rather to practically informed reasoned arguments that often take account of the pressures upon the men and women enforcing the law.<br /><br />Take two cases in point. In the first, an Iranian woman claiming asylum argued that deporting her back to Iran would lead to her persecution for membership in a social group consisting of upper-class, Western educated Iranian women who consider wearing the Muslim headscarf contrary to their personal beliefs.  In the second, the court was asked to decide a government forfeiture claim against a pharmacy from which the husband illegally dealt drugs but which he and his wife held as tenants by the entirety. <br /><br />How did Judge Alito rule? In the first case, he wrote, quite reluctantly, a decision that denied the woman's asylum claim even though he interpreted the law broadly.  He not only foreshadowed a later decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals which allowed for asylum in a gender-based case, but seemed to embrace the notion that gender alone could constitute a social group.  The lower court record, which he parsed carefully, forced him to find against the asylum applicant though in the process he made good law for asylum-seekers.  And I am sure that he was relieved to find out that the applicant found another avenue to stay in this country after the decision was issued. <br /> <br />In the second case Judge Alito was faced with a statute that provided no answer as to how to resolve the competing claims between the wife and the government.  He granted the government the right to forfeit fifty percent of the property but left the wife with the other fifty percent and a lifelong right to full possession of the property.  This was an attempt at a Solomonic decision which showed his respect for legislative intent as much as his practical side.<br /><br /> Both of these were unanimous rulings.  While Judge Alito's dissents have been discussed <em>ad nauseam</em> in the last few days, little has been said about his judicial demeanor on the bench.  He has been able to find common ground with all judges of the Third Circuit, independent of political affiliation.  And apparently not one has uttered a negative word about Judge Alito.  Perhaps they do not want to ruffle feathers, but more likely they&#39;ve come to appreciate his personal behavior as much as his intellect.  All of his dissents are deeply respectful, though obviously critical of the majority.  He engages the majority in argument but without any name-calling or the type of sarcastic criticism that has dominated many Supreme Court dissents in recent years.  He may bring some much needed affability and consensus building to the Supreme Court.  But law students beware, his opinions and dissent may lack some of Justice Scalia's raciness.<br /><br /> Feminists and liberals, expect more line-drawing from Justice Alito, but sleep well tonight in the belief that he will not threaten our liberties or the foundations of our country, though he may force Congress to write its statutes more clearly.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Nora Demleitner is professor of law at Hofstra University School of Law. She clerked for for Judge Alito from 1992-1993.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.chiefminister.act.gov.au/default.asp">Jon Stanhope</a>, Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and recently the sole dissenter among Australian state and territorial leaders against strict new anti-terrorism legislation proposed by Australian Prime Minister John Howard, says the anti-terror bill threatens to erode fundamental rights and liberties and even undermines what it means for Australia to be a society at peace...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/stanhope.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>n Australia, as elsewhere, governments are wrestling with the challenge of protecting their communities against terrorism. One of the peculiarities of this challenge is that with each step we take to strengthen our security response we edge closer to eroding the human rights and liberties that we keep insisting are the targets of the terrorists themselves. Unwittingly, we may be doing the work of the terrorists for them. Unconsciously, and in the absence of a declaration of war, we are altering our notions of what encroachments on our civil liberties we will tolerate in peacetime. We are changing our very definition of peace.<br /><br />In Australia, there is no national bill of rights against which proposed new anti-terrorism laws can be held up for scrutiny or measurement. The Australian Capital Territory, alone of Australia's six States and two Territories, has a bill of rights &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; the ACT Human Rights Act. Essentially, it incorporates into ACT law the rights set out in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/countries/australia.php">Australia</a> | Text: <a href="/gazette/2005/10/human-rights-implications-of-proposed.php">Human rights implications of proposed Australian anti-terrorism bill</a> [ANU / UNSW]<br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br />At the time of writing, Australia's new Anti-Terrorism Bill is before our Federal Parliament. Given that the Government has a majority in the Senate, or Upper House, its passage into law may be something of a formality. But its journey to the Parliament was perhaps not as smooth as the Prime Minister, John Howard, might have liked.<br /><br />On September 27, the Prime Minister asked the leaders of Australia's six states and two territories to agree to a package of new anti-terrorism measures. He proposed preventive detention of up to 14 days, and control orders &#8212; in which individuals who have trained with terrorist organisations or are otherwise regarded with suspicion could have restrictions placed on their movement, their employment, their abode, their associations and their recreational pursuits (up to and including house arrest or electronic monitoring) for up to a year. <br /><br />The laws that would come out of this meeting were of a peculiar kind. Because of the nature of the Australian Federation and the constitution, the Federal Government could not pass this package without the agreement of a majority of the States. The laws depend on State powers being referred to the Commonwealth. That is why the States and Territories were asked to sign off on what would normally be seen as draft Commonwealth legislation.<br /><br />I went to that meeting with grave concerns about the impact of these measures on human rights. The Prime Minister, however, gave assurances that the laws would be proportionate, would involve proper judicial review, and would meet all of Australia's obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. I agreed to the package. <br /><br />The draft laws were distributed to the Premiers and Chief Ministers, with a 28 October deadline for sign-off. From the outset, I was determined that I would not put my signature to something without consulting as widely as I believed necessary, and without ensuring that the Prime Minister's assurances had been delivered upon. I also believed that on a matter of such seriousness, going directly to the rule of law and human rights, I should solicit the opinions of my constituents &#8212; the people of the ACT, the ordinary Australians on whose behalf the State powers were being referred, the people these laws would directly affect. On Friday October 14 I posted the first draft of the new laws on my website.<br /><br />The laws are of a kind never before contemplated by this country in peacetime. They broaden the definition of a terrorist organisation and create new offences of sedition. In the earliest draft, detainees were accorded no right to know the reasons for that detention, no right to inform family of their predicament and no appeal on the merits. Later versions of the draft softened some of these harsh provisions, though not to the satisfaction of all critics.<br /><br />The lack of a national bill of rights has been felt acutely during the debate over these laws. As Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; home to Australia's capital city, Canberra &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; I felt it was vital to put human rights on the agenda in this national debate. Mine has been a lonely position, at least among my political peers. What agitation there has been in relation to the human-rights implications of the proposed anti-terrorism laws has mostly come from legal academics and civil libertarians. Politicians have not only been generally silent, they have been openly dismissive of the need to consider human rights. Their attitude has been summed up in the oft-repeated remark, "the only meaningful human right is the right not to be blown up by a terrorist."<br /><br />Once the laws were in the public domain, I commissioned expert opinions on the draft from a number of sources. Within days I had received a detailed analysis of the draft from a group of prominent Australian legal academics and specialists in international law &#8212; Professor Hilary Charlesworth and Gabrielle McKinnon, from the Australian National University, and Professor Andrew Byrne, from the University of NSW. They expressed grave concerns about the extent to which the draft complied with Australia's human-rights obligations, in areas such as the right to liberty and the right to a fair trial. I posted their opinion on my website, alongside the draft.<br /><br />I next received advice from the ACT Director of Public Prosecutions, Richard Refshauge, SC, alerting me to potential problems with the judicial-review aspects of the Bill. He asked how it was possible to have review on the merits if detainees were not told the reasons for their detention. He also queried provisions relating to communication between lawyers and detainees. His opinion too went up on my website.<br /><br />Advice from the ACT Human Rights Commissioner, Dr Helen Watchirs, added to my disquiet in relation to the human-rights protections of the Bill, while an analysis from Stephen Gageler, SC, added to emerg
ing eleventh-hour concerns that there were serious constitutional problems with the draft laws, amounting to a breach of the separation of powers between the judiciary and the executive.<br /><br />The final formal piece of advice I received was from two prominent criminal and human-rights barristers, Lex Lasry, QC, and Kate Eastman, who identified further gaps in the human-rights protections afforded by the Bill.<br /><br />All these analyses can be found at <a href="http://www.chiefminister.act.gov.au">www.chiefminister.act.gov.au</a>.<br /><br />The posting of the draft Bill also generated a large number of opinion pieces and scholarly analyses in Australian newspapers and journals and prompted the commissioning of legal opinions by others. For example, the national broadcaster, the Australian Broadcasting Commission, solicited expert advice on whether, under the proposed sedition laws, public statements made by prominent people including journalist John Pilger over the course of the terrorism debate could have resulted in charges being laid (the answer was 'yes').<br /><br />Concerns were also raised by a number of State Solicitors-General regarding the constitutionality of some of the provisions of the law and arguing that the legislation breached the separation of powers by requiring the judiciary to perform executive functions. Again, some amendments were made to lessen, though not eliminate, the risk of a constitutional challenge.   <br /><br />The Bill was ultimately signed off by every State and Territory except the ACT, with a number of last-minute concessions by the Commonwealth that ameliorated some of its worst excesses. The extent of the public debate over these laws has, I believe, played an important role in bringing those concessions about. Without the voices of dissent that arose once the detail of the legislation became known, the attempt to erode human rights &#8212; the rights enshrined in international law after the grave lessons of the Second World War &#8212; under Australian law might not have received the attention it deserved. <br /><br />Sadly, at the end of the process, I was still an essentially lone voice among my peers. There have been concessions, but they do not reach the heart of the issue: that while we rightly proclaim the need to protect our people from terrorism, the threat our efforts may pose to those same people's human rights has been too often pushed aside. As long as we allow this we will, I believe, continue to seriously misconstrue the very notion of peace. <br />     <br /><br /><em>Jon Stanhope is Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory</em><br />

US Army (Ret.) and former Special Assistant to the Judge Advocate General for Law of War Matters, now a professor at South Texas College of Law, says that the phenomenon of hyper-technical legal analysis detached from the moral and pragmatic considerations grounding the law of war in the Geneva Conventions and other humanitarian norms shows that that law has become "over-lawyered" in the hands of those who have never worn, nor probably even contemplated wearing a military uniform....<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/cornforum.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>I</strong></font>n recent editorials and media appearances, Professor John Yoo has again joined the debate over the appropriate treatment standards for individuals detained by our armed forces.  Yoo continues to profer a stoic defense for the administration policies of excluding such individuals from the protections of the most basic humanitarian standard reflected in the Geneva Conventions &#8212; the prohibition against cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment.  In so doing, Yoo reveals a dangerous failure to appreciate the critical importance of the fundamental principles underlying these and other law of war treaties - principles that are at the very core of a morally grounded military.<br /><br />Many academics have joined the debate in opposition to the interpretations of law Yoo is so obviously proud to have trailblazed.  In this regard, however, Yoo retains the upper hand, for treaties, like any codified source of law, are laced with ambiguities - ambiguities that have enabled Yoo and his supporters to interpret their way out of treaty application.  Thus, from a pure treaty interpretation perspective, this "Yoo approach" to determining the applicability (or inapplicability) of the Geneva Conventions, while clearly distasteful to so many other scholars, politicians, and military professionals, survives such critiques through creative interpretation.<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/warcrimes.php">War Crimes</a> | Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/detainees.php">Detainees</a> | Video: <a  href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/monitor/2005/05/human-rights-international-law-and-war.php">Human Rights, Internationl Law and the War on Terror</a> [UC Berkeley, including Yoo]<br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br />What Yoo does not - and in the opinion of this author cannot - understand, is that these treaties reflect fundamental principles that lie at the very core of the military profession - principles that reflect a delicate balance between the necessities of war and the dictates of humanity.  Unlike his chief antagonist, Senator John McCain, Yoo has never worn a uniform, and therefore has never been called upon to contemplate the immense moral challenge of taking life in the name of his country.  While Yoo and his following of high level civilian policy makers can without question tout impressive resumes filled with academic and professional successes, few if any are able to view these issues through such a lens.  <br /><br />What those who have, or do, serve in uniform on behalf of our nation intuitively understand is the implied covenant that exists between the armed forces and the nation under whose flag they fight, kill, destroy, and detain.  The essence of this covenant is a willingness to engage in such conduct based on a belief that doing so will be consistent with the inherent notion of morality.  Because members of the military profession have historically understood that preserving this sense of morality would be most severely stressed during armed conflict, they were at the forefront of developing non-negotiable principles to limit the brutality of conflict, and in so doing limit the corrosive moral consequence of conflict for those called upon to engage therein.  When Senator McCain reminds us that the conduct we endorse during armed conflict reflects more about us than it does our enemy, it reflects his intuitive appreciation of this truism.<br /><br />Professor Yoo has exposed a fundamental question related to this issue: have we allowed the laws of war to become more about law and less about war?  This is the true nature of the struggle that continues to rage within the US Department of Defense between certain career uniformed and civilian lawyers and many politically appointed civilian policy makers - a battle that will have profound consequences for the young men and women this nation asks to engage in the ugly business of war on its behalf.<br /><br />While there is no question that the insights of distinguished academics provide valuable contributions to the understanding and development of this body of law, these insights rarely reflect a genuine appreciation of the nature of the activities this law is intended to regulate.  While many such scholars actively seek opportunities to enhance their understanding of this aspect of the regulation of the battlefield through interaction with military professionals, Professor Yoo purports to speak with a degree of authority immune from the need for such considerations.<br /><br />In the opinion of this author, this hyper-technical legal analysis detached from the underlying moral and pragmatic considerations that have provided the foundation for the law of war exemplified by Professor Yoo is a consequence of the law of war become "over-lawyered", thus leading us to the untenable point where a distinguished legal scholar who has never worn, nor probably even contemplated wearing the uniform of his nation, can attain eminent status in enunciating how this law should apply to the battlefield.  <br /><br />In 1899, when the first major multilateral law of war treaty was drafted and adopted by nations of the world who clearly saw conflict on the horizon, a prescient participant to the drafting conference named Feodor Martens proposed a provision that is perhaps more relevant today than ever before.  That provision provided that whenever a situation of "war" fell outside the terms of the treaty, all individuals remained under the protection of the "dictates of humanity."  This "Marten's Clause" reflected a pragmatic recognition that no treaty was immune from ambiguity and creative interpretation, but under no circumstances could a nation condone the conduct of war without respect for fundamental dictates of humanity, for doing so would unleash the darkest instincts of an unrestrained force.  <br /><br />Our armed forces intuitively understand the continuing validity of this truism.  Professor Yoo does not.  Perhaps the time has come to consider a frightening but historically validated proposition - that these fundamental principles regulating the conduct of armed conflict are intended not only to protect the people we confront on the battlefield, but also to protect the armed forces fro
m the short term sense of <em>extremis</em> that is inevitably associated with war making policies.  Professor Yoo's approach to these issues provides compelling evidence of the importance of this purpose.  <br /><br /><br /><em>Geoffrey S.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.uwe.ac.uk/school/staff/profile.cfm?no=8">Richard Edwards</a>, Principal Lecturer in Law at the University of the West of England in Bristol, UK, says that the new Terrorism Bill presented to Parliament by the Blair government in the wake of the London bombings threatens the rule of law but promises little more security...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/londonforum.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he United Kingdom has sadly had long experience of dealing with violent terrorism. The withdrawal from Empire has been accompanied by vicious and bloody insurgencies. In the 1970s and 1980s the Irish Troubles made British citizens and politicians painfully aware of terrorism&#39;s dangers at home.<br /><br />Yet just as the problems of Northern Ireland seem to have been resolved through dialogue, a new and potentially more menacing threat has emerged in the form of Islamic terror. Although a large number of British citizens were killed on 9/11 and in the subsequent Bali bombings, Islamic terror had yet to occur within the UK prior to 2005. Some people thought that the UK itself would be safe. After all, 'Londonistan', as London has been recently been dubbed, was home to a large number of Islamic dissidents who operated under the so called &quot;Covenant of Security&quot;: as a guest of the British, you don't harm them. <br /><br />On 7th July 2005 our illusions were painfully shattered. During 'rush-hour' that morning a small group of fanatical Muslims entered London's Underground. Three of the party detonated bombs hidden in their rucksacks while travelling on the Tube. The fourth was prevented from boarding his intended target, and instead detonated his bomb on a packed London bus. In all fifty-two innocent people died and nearly one thousand were injured, many seriously. Quite apart from its scope, 7/7 was unlike any previous attack. All four of the terrorists were British-born Muslims, previously unknown to the police, who deliberately killed themselves with their intended targets. The terror which Israel faces on a daily basis had come to London. <br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/countries/uk.php">United Kingdom</a> | Video: <a href="/monitor/2005/10/counter-terrorism-and-human-rights-uk.php">Counter-terrorism and human rights</a> [Home Secretary] | Video: <a  href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/monitor/2005/10/uk-approach-to-terrorism-heritage.php">UK approach to terrorism</a><br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br />And it was not to be a unique attack. On 21/7, two weeks to the day after the first atrocity, a second group of Islamic terrorists attempted to launch a similar attack. Luckily the bombs failed to detonate, and the suspects were quickly arrested. But both attacks have, naturally enough, had significant political and legal repercussions. <br /><br />Traditionally, the British legal response to terrorism has been simple. Terrorists are ordinary criminals and will be treated by the law as such. In practice over the years, however, it became difficult to maintain that position. Consequently, in 1974 when the Irish Troubles once more flared up, Parliament responded with the <a href="http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/hmso/pta1974.htm">Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act</a>. The PTA made it an offence to belong to a proscribed organisation and contained special powers of arrest and detention. But it was viewed very much as a temporary departure from the normal standards of criminal justice, and as such it was subject to annual renewal by Parliament.<br /><br />In 2000 Parliament enacted a new permanent and very comprehensive <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/20000011.htm">Terrorism Act</a> that applied throughout the UK. The TA drew heavily on a report of then-Security Commissioner Lord Lloyd who had concluded that as there would be a continuing need for counter terrorism legislation for the foreseeable future, it should be placed on a permanent footing. The UK legal regime for dealing with terrorism formed by the interaction of the TA with prohibitions of the standing criminal law - such as murder and offences under the Explosive Substances Act 1883 or the Aviation and Maritime Security Act 1990 - was, in the <a href="http://www.coe.int/T/E/Commissioner_H.R/Communication_Unit/CommDH%282005%296_E.doc">words of the European Commissioner for Human Rights Professor Alvaro Gil-Robles</a>, 'amongst the toughest and most comprehensive' in Europe. <br /><br />After 9/11, however, the TA was hastily augmented by Parliament in the form of the <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2001/20010024.htm">Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001</a>. The ATCSA made further provision for dealing with terrorism by dealing more thoroughly with a range of issues such as terrorist owned property, disclosure of information, weapons of mass destruction, and enhanced police powers. The Act was debated for barely three hours on the floor of the House of Commons. <br /><br />Part IV of the ATCSA introduced internment for those suspected of being international terrorists. Foreign nationals whom the Home Secretary reasonably suspected of being international terrorists were placed in what was termed 'a prison with three walls'. The detainees were free to leave the UK if they could, but otherwise they were to be held in prison. The UK government could not deport them. As without exception the detainees faced the possibility of torture or the death penalty on their return home, the UK would have breached its obligations under Article 3 of the <a href="http://www.hrcr.org/docs/Eur_Convention/euroconv.html">European Convention on Human Rights</a> had it done so. British citizens could not be detained under its provisions. <br /><br />Not surprisingly, the ATCSA forced the UK to derogate from key provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights. In December 2004 the House of Lords held in <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldjudgmt/jd041216/a&oth-1.htm"><em>A v. Secretary of State for the Home Department</em></a>  that section 23 of the Act was a discriminatory and disproportionate response to the threat of international terrorism. As such it was incompatible with Articles 5(1) and 14 of the ECHR. Their Lordships consequently issued a declaration to that effect under section 4 of the HRA. Lord Hoffmann differed in his reasoning from the rest of the majority, holding that there was no emergency within the terms of Article 15 to justify the measures. During the course of his speech His Lordship observed: 'The real threat to the life of the nation, in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values, comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these.  That is the true measure of what terrorism may achieve.  It is for Parliament to decide whether to give the terrorists such a victory.' Although a section 4 HRA declarat
ion is a non coercive order of the court, and as such does nothing to alter the legal rights of the parties to the litigation, the moral and political pressure on the government to change the law was considerable.<br /><br />In response to the House of Lords ruling and after considerable debate Parliament replaced Part IV of ATCSA with a new regime of so-called &quot;Control Orders&quot; under the <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2005/20050002.htm">Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005</a>. Under this legislation the Home Secretary can, subject to judicial oversight, make orders which place a wide range of restrictions on the rights and freedoms of individuals he suspects of being involved in terrorist related activities. Any individual within the UK - including British citizens - can be subject to a Control Order. Control Orders can prohibit an individual using specified articles or substances, place restrictions on his work and activities, the people he associates with, his ability to communicate with others, and his freedom of movement. A Control Order can also require that a person reside at certain place, effectively under house arrest. As the potential for Control Orders that are incompatible with Article 5 of the ECHR is clear, the PTA allows the Secretary of State to make derogations from the UK's obligations under that treaty in such cases. Those international terrorists previous interned were made subject to Control Orders.<br /><br />Thus notwithstanding its defeat in <em>A v. Home Secretary</em> and the replacement of internment with Control Orders the government still has at its disposal a considerable arsenal of legal powers, many of them draconian, with which to combat all forms of terrorism. Indeed, it would be most surprising if the situation were otherwise. Since 2000, three considerable Acts of Parliament have been debated at length and enacted, with the principal law, the Terrorism Act, itself having been the product of a thorough report by an eminent judge, widespread consultation and Parliamentary debate. Yet none of those powers prevented the 7/7 attacks.<br /><br />Almost immediately after the events of July Prime Minister Tony Blair <a href="http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page7999.asp">announced</a> that a proposal for new and additional powers would be brought before Parliament for its consideration. In response to a reporter&#39;s about the possibility that the judiciary might follow the robust anti-governmental approach the Law Lords took in the December 2004 he commented 'I doubt those words that you were quoting from one of those judgements would be uttered now.' According to the Prime Minister, 'the rules of the game had changed.'<br /><br />In the aftermath of the July attacks three new issues came to the fore. The first was the ability of militant Islamic clerics resident in the UK to preach violent jihad and incite terrorism with seeming impunity. Second was the problem of 'terror-tourists', individuals who travel overseas to undertake terrorist training. The third was the alleged need of the police to detain suspects for up to ninety days in order to overcome the evidential difficulties associated with terrorist cases. It is to address these issues, amongst others, that the new Terrorism Bill has been drafted.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmbills/055/2006055.htm">Terrorism Bill</a> was presented to Parliament by Home Secretary Charles Clarke on 11th October 2005. The Bill contains much that is unobjectionable and eminently sensible. For example, Clause (5) criminalising preparatory terrorist acts has long been recommended, not least of all by Lord Lloyd in his report almost ten years ago. Quite why Parliament has failed to place that offence on the statute book before is not clear. Equally sensible is Clause 9 that criminalises the possession or manufacture of a radioactive device. Given the chilling prospect that either a 'dirty bomb&#39; or worse a small tactical nuclear device might be used by these utterly ruthless terrorists these proposals are overdue. But while much in the Bill was greeted with approval, there are draconian provisions that have met with understandable hostility.<br /><br />Clauses 1 and 2 are both sweeping and vague. Clause 1 seeks to criminalise the encouragement of terrorism, while Clause 2 prohibits the dissemination of terrorist publications. Without doubt they are badly drafted, and will if enacted inevitably be held incompatible with the Human Rights Act by the courts. Clause 1(1) will punish anyone who publishes a statement 'that members of the public to whom the statement is or is to be published are likely to understand it as a direct or indirect encouragement or other inducement to the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.' A terrorist act is one that falls within the scope of the broad definition of terrorism contained in <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/00011--b.htm#1">Section 1 of the Terrorism Act 2000</a>. Thus the Act will apply to not only Islamic militants who praise the 7/7 attacks but also to <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1841452,00.html">animal rights extremists</a>. Clause 1(2) goes on to state that the public will be taken to have understood any statement of glorification - elsewhere defined as including any praise or celebration - of either the commission of such acts or statements that seek to persuade others to commit such acts as indirect encouragement within Clause 1(1). It is irrelevant whether the statement is understood as encouragement or indeed whether anyone is encouraged. Without doubt this Clause is intended to have a considerable 'chilling effect' on free speech. The expression of repellent views is enough simply to commit a serious criminal offence punishable with up to seven years in prison. On the face of the Clause it is not clear whether intent is required to commit an offence, although no doubt the courts would apply the common law principle of legality and read it in. <br /><br />It is very doubtful whether this criminalisation of 'fighting words' is compatible with Article 10 of the ECHR. Of course the right to freedom of expression enshrined in Article 10 is not absolute and may be limited in accordance with the provisions of the Article 10(2). Clause 1 would not withstand scrutiny under Article 10(2). While the provision undoubtedly has a legitimate aim, namely the 'for the prevention of disorder or crime', it cannot be said to be 'necessary in a democratic society.' The type of speech that falls to be criminalised under Clause 1 will most often be political speech, albeit with a message that many find insulting. But freedom of expression under Article 10 encompasses views which are not only 'favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb the State or any sector of the population.' Moreover, political speech lies at the core of the Article 10 guarantee and any restrictions on it must be subject to the strictest scrutiny.  And even 'fighting words' enjoy constitutional protection. <br /><br />That is the nub of the issue. There is a difference between advocacy of repellent views on the one hand and the incitement to immediate violence on the other. In Brandenburg v. Ohio the Supreme Court of the United States concluded that the Constitution did 'not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.' The Terrorism Bill fails to make that important distinction. There is no temporal dimension at all. The fear of violence need not be imminent. Clause 1 is thus overbroad in that it will penalise speech which should enjoy constitutional protection. And for that reason alone fails to impair the right of freedom of expression as little as possible and is thus disproportionate. This might strike some as an odd conclusion. The speech that Clause 1 is directed at is a danger it might be a
rgued, especially in light of 7/7. However, the only circumstances when the advocacy of the ideas which fall within the scope of Clause could ever be justified is, as Rawls observed, when there is a crisis which threatens the very foundations of the democratic order, or to put in the terms of the ECHR 'the life of the nation.' Yet there is no constitutional crisis that prevents either democracy operating effectively in the UK or debate and discussion challenging the views of extremists. Just as the American anti-Syndicalist Statutes proved ineffective at preventing the propagating of ideas that supported a Communist revolution so will this with respect to the establishment of an Islamic Caliphate by violent means.<br /><br />It must also be said that a limit on free speech can only be one that is 'prescribed by law'. The concept of 'glorification' relied on by Clause 1 is arguably too vague and imprecise to meet the requirements of that criterion. Clause 1 is not drafted with sufficient precision to enable a citizen to regulate his conduct effectively. Equally, Clause 1 is liable to operate in an arbitrary manner. Individuals who call for the use of armed resistance against despotic regimes such as the old Bath Party in Iraq or the military dictatorship in Burma are unlikely to be treated in same way as an Islamic 'militant'. That no doubt is the intention. Yet all concerned will fall within the scope of Clause 1. This opens up the potential for the operation of the law to appear one sided and aimed at a particular community. The very community whose help we most need.<br /><br />Finally, with respect to Clause 1 it may be argued with conviction that there is little need for such a law, as existing law already covers the field of incitement well. It has long been an offence at common law to incite others to commit crimes. When used in conjunction with the Terrorism Act 2000 the law is already strong enough to deal with those who espouse support for terrorists. Moreover, in 2003 in <em>The Queen v. EL-Faisal</em> a defendant was convicted of soliciting murder contrary to section 4 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 and of using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to stir up racial hatred contrary to s.18(1) of the <a href="http://www.webtribe.net/~shg/Public%20Order%20Act%201986%20(1986%20c%2064)%20Sect%204A,%205,%206.htm">Public Order Act 1986</a>. In practice, prosecutions under this provision are more likely to strengthen the position of Islamic militants. Those prosecuted are likely to be lauded by their supporters. Moreover, prosecutions will provide the cause of radical Islam with the oxygen of publicity. Few within the UK had heard of the Omar Bakri Mohammed before 7/7. But following the widespread coverage of the man and his views since then we can be certain that many more people, including impressionable Muslims, know who he is. <br /><br />Similarly problematic is Clause 2. Clause 2 makes it an offence to disseminate terrorist publications, although this too is arguably already covered by existing law. Many of the vices that apply to Clause 1 apply again here. The offence is so broadly framed that a university academic is likely to be caught by its application. Assume for the sake of argument that the &quot;University of Penzance&quot; has an Islamic Studies Centre. Within the department are all shades of Islamic opinion, including those sympathetic to the Palestinian Intifada. Now imagine that person lends to a Muslim student Sayyid Qutb's Signposts on the Road with the recommendation that this is a 'seminal text which he should read &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;it will lead to a better understanding of the situation.' A concerned parent subsequently contacts the police. Qutb's tract provides the ideological bedrock for Al-Qaeda. Familiarity with this tract is vital for anyone wishing to understand the problem of militant Islam, just as a reading of Lenin's What is to be Done? assists in understanding the Communist mindset. Although Qutb did not advocate the use of violence directly in his tract the implication is nevertheless clearly there. On the face of Clause 2 the Penzance academic could be guilty of an offence. To be acquitted at trial he will need to make out one of the defences that the Clause provides. If he was on record, as some British Parliamentarians are, that suicide bombings in Israel were 'understandable' and that Qutb was 'a great Islamic scholar', then it is unlikely he would be acquitted. In essence the overbroad Clause 2 represents the worst sort of thought control worthy of a police state. In fact, it is likely to be largely ineffective in combating the dissemination of terrorist views, even when coupled with Clause 3 that attempts to extend the scope of the offences in Clause 1 and 2 to the Internet. As even someone with an elementary knowledge of the Internet knows once information is posted, particularly in newsgroups, it is virtually impossible to delete. For the determined copies of the Anarchists Cookbook, the Encyclopaedia of Jihad and Al Qaeda's notorious 'The Sword' website replete with its own virtual training camp will no doubt continue to be available, hosted beyond the reach of British law enforcement. The Bill might grant the police power to censor Internet publications on pain of punishment under Clauses 1 or 2, but 'hard core' terrorist publications are unlikely to be caught by it.  Indeed, this Bill is unlikely to have much impact on what is arguably the most important theatre of operations in the War against Terror. As such it represents a missed opportunity.<br /><br />Yet another problematic provision is Clause 8, making it an offence to attend any place used for the purposes of terrorist training. This clause is directed at preventing 'terror tourism' where young radical Muslims travel to terror 'boot camps' for basic training and further indoctrination. The old Al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan are perhaps the best example of this, although there is some evidence that members of the 7/7 cell travelled to Pakistan for such training in new camps operating in the 'bandit country' of the Hindu Kush. Criminalising such travel is sensible, although it is clearly an after the event measure. Several thousand young men travelled to these camps and received training before returning home to lie dormant amongst us. Their actions cannot be criminalised without offending the prohibition on ex post facto criminality contained in Article 7 ECHR. Nevertheless Clause 8 is problematic. Travel knowingly to a terrorist camp for whatever reason, whether or not to receive terrorist training, and you commit an offence. As framed, Clause 8 would catch an investigative journalist <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/binladen/who/interview.html">interviewing Osama bin Laden in his training camp</a> or reporting on such camps. The media are of course the eyes and ears of the public. This, as the Court of Appeal observed recently in <em>King v. Telegraph Group Ltd.</em>, 'is of especial importance in the &quot;war against terrorism&quot; where in a free society fearless reporting has often exposed information which it has been in the public interest to expose.' Clearly there is a strong case for amending Clause 8 to provide protection for journalists.<br /><br />Probably the most contentious part of the Bill is the proposed power to detain those suspected of terrorist offences for up to three months before charging them. As a concession to due process the Bill envisages periodic reviews by a District judge on the continuing necessity of the detention. The proposed Clauses 23 and 24 are a direct result of a request from the Police. The Police claim, not unreasonably, that the investigation of terrorist crime is complex and time consuming. The fourteen day period the law currently allows is 'often insufficient.' <br /><br />Under English law an individual accused of rape or murder can be held for a maximum of four days before they must be charged or released. This period is subject to continuing review, initially by a senior police office and then by a District judge.
 With respect to terrorist offences the period has been progressively extended. The TA initially allowed suspects to be detained for up to seven days. In 2003 this was extended to fourteen days after similar arguments from the police, and despite misgivings. It is worth pausing at this point to consider how the TA, including the extended period, has been used. As of September 2005 no suspect had been detained for the full fourteen days, although two had been held for thirteen. Moreover, of the eight hundred and ninety five people arrested under the TA since 2001, twenty three were charged under the Act, three hundred under with other non-terrorist offences and four hundred and ninety six were released without charge. In other words, over half the people arrested under the TA proved to be innocent. But if the Bill becomes law then all suspected of terrorist offences face the possibility of up to three months detention while the police investigate their case. To put this into context, three months detention is the equivalent of being sentenced to six months imprisonment under English law.<br /><br />The right to liberty has long been an important part of the English/British constitution. Eight hundred years ago Magna Carta declared that 'to no man will we deny or delay justice or right.' Coupled with the writ of Habeas Corpus the principle it contains became the bedrock of English liberty. Today that principle finds statutory expression in Article 5 of the ECHR. Indeed, Article 5 is little more than a summary of the common law principles of liberty developed down the ages by the English judiciary. There can be no doubting its importance in a free and democratic society: It is a right that lies at its very heart, guaranteeing the rule of law. 'Freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention,' is as Lord Hoffmann observed in A, 'a quintessentially British liberty.' Article 5(3) guarantees that everyone arrested on suspicion of an offence 'shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial.' Article 5(3) is intended to place limits on the period that an individual can be held before his detention is subject to judicial control in order to determine whether he should be charged or released. The European Court has held that four days is the maximum. The three-month period proposed by the Bill is thus a significant departure from both English law and the ECHR. Undoubtedly, it is incompatible with Article 5 ECHR. The effect of this Bill is such that an individual arrested on suspicion of having committed terrorist offences enjoys a lower level of legal protection than an individual accused of war crimes or crimes against humanity before the International Criminal Court. Therefore, the proposed period will no doubt be subject to derogation under Article 15. To pass muster under Article 15 the Clauses will need to be 'strictly required by the exigencies of the situation' (I assume for the purposes of this argument that there is an emergency threatening the life of the nation; like Lord Hoffmann I am not convinced). <br /><br />In themselves the justifications for extending the period are not convincing. One can readily accept that the police have real problems with the logistics of the evidence in these cases. But that is an argument for much greater resources to be put into policing by the Government, and not for the curtailment of an important liberty. Equally, it has become accepted that it is not possible to question a suspect after he has been charged. This is simply not the true position of English law. It is certainly the case that inferences can no longer be drawn from the accused's silence post charge in relation to that charge. But there is plenty of scope for a 'holding charge' while the police investigate other possible offences. Detention for such extended periods is also likely to produce unreliable evidence, particularly confessions. Bitter experience has taught us induced confessions lead to miscarriages of justice. Yet we plan to detain individuals for up to three months. It can only be a matter of time before someone who is psychologically suggestible confesses to a crime to escape their legal limbo. For a nation whose criminal justice system was rocked by a series of high profile miscarriages of justice only quite recently this is remarkable. The irony here is that a government which was adamantly opposed to internment in the context of Irish terrorism has since 9/11 enthusiastically adopted it. The lawfulness of the derogation for the ninety-day period will in all probability turn on the nature of the judicial supervision. If the control is in practice theoretical then it is likely to fall foul of Article 5, as arguably it is. Judicial oversight of the continuing need for detention is not the sort of hearing contemplated in Article 5(3) of the ECHR. The District judge is concerned with the ability of the police to gather further evidence and not the legality of the detention. The initial reasonable suspicion that the arrestee had committed an offence decays with time. For the detention to continue there must be other relevant and sufficient reasons for continuing the detention. The period of pre-charge detention is intended to be as short as possible. Article 5 contains a presumption in favour of liberty. Article 5(3) requires that an individual be charged and then given a trial within a reasonable time or bailed. The hearing contemplated by Article 5(3) is one which determines whether there is a charge to answer and not whether the police need more time to gather evidence. As the European Court of Human Rights has ruled 'the requirements of the investigation cannot absolve the authorities from the obligation to bring any person arrested in accordance with Article 5(1)(c) &quot;promptly&quot; before a judge, as required by Article 5(3).'<br /><br />Reconciling the tension between freedom and security is difficult. On the one hand every state has an obligation to protect the security of its citizens. But on the other hand the state cannot adopt such draconian measures that in effect democracy is hollowed out. As the European Court concluded in 1978 in <em>Klass v. Germany</em>, there is an inherent danger with security laws. Such laws can undermine or destroy democracy while purporting to defend it. And as the court warned, 'Contracting States may not, in the name of the struggle against espionage and terrorism, adopt whatever measures they deem appropriate.' In 2002 the Council of Europe issued specific guidelines to its member states on how terrorism should be tackled. Principle two states that 'all measures taken by States to fight terrorism must respect human rights and the principle of the rule of law, while excluding any form of arbitrariness, as well as any discriminatory or racist treatment, and must be subject to appropriate supervision.' As it currently stands the UK's Terrorism Bill fails to meet this standard. This vague Bill proposes to ride roughshod over human rights and run counter to the rule of law while promising little or no security benefit in return. <br />    <br /><br /><em>Richard Edwards is Principal Lecturer in Law at the University of the West of England in Bristol, UK, where he teaches European Human Rights.</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.fcsl.edu/faculty/bio2.cfm?instructID=1039">Brian J. Foley</a> of Florida Coastal School of Law says that Americans should start caring about the denial of legal process to prisoners held by the US at Guantanamo Bay (GTMO) not just out of sentimentality or because it&#39;s the &quot;right thing to do&quot;, but because it&#39;s in Americans&#39; own self-interest...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/brianfoleyleft.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>F</strong></font>or almost four years, Americans collectively have &quot;ho-hummed&quot; news about the prisoners caged at the US Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba (GTMO).  Torture? Big deal. Hunger strike? What hunger strike? -- most people don't even know about it. So it's no surprise that Americans don't care that the tribunals that determine whether the prisoners are "enemy combatants," and the tribunals that will try some of them for particular crimes, all deny prisoners the full set of procedural rights that US and international law offer.  <br /><br />Americans' indifference comes in large part because the arguments saying that denying process to "enemy combatants" is bad policy and illegal have failed to appeal to the public's self-interest.  <br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo</a> | Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/militarycommissions.php">Military Tribunals</a> | Text: <a href="/gazette/2005/08/military-commission-procedure-changes.php">Military commission procedure changes</a> | Video: <a  href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/monitor/2004/10/military-commissions-colonel-will-gunn.php">Military commissions</a><br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br />For example, most of the policy arguments against this lack of process have been the following:<ol><li>Giving process to these prisoners is just the right thing to do morally.  <br /><br /><li>Our failure to do so shows we're hypocritical. US leaders have been extolling American democracy over other forms of government because it purportedly preserves individual rights and freedoms; the separate-and-unequal justice system at GTMO undercuts such claims.  <br /><br /><li>Our denying process to these prisoners will cause other countries to deny process to our soldiers if they are captured. <br /><br /><li>We should accord process because one of us might be jailed by mistake, and we would like fair process to protect us.</ol>These arguments are all valid. However, the problem is that they are either sentimental or unrealistic &#8212; and most Americans sense that.  Americans like thinking they're the world's nicest, most democratic people, but they'll abandon that warm and fuzzy feeling if being nice and democratic will increase their risk of being blown up by terrorists.  Americans don't worry about being hypocrites, because "everything changed" after 9/11; we're fighting a "different kind of war," and history will judge us as prudent, they believe. Most Americans know that our soldiers probably won't be captured: enemies are barely able to kill our troops, much less capture them. And as we saw with Jessica Lynch, we can just go rescue them anyway.  Moreover, what country would dare mistreat US troops and incur our (perhaps nuclear-tipped) wrath? As for the classic argument that we need rigorous legal process in case we're arrested by mistake, well, most Americans know that it's highly unlikely they themselves will ever be caged at GTMO: most Americans aren't radical Muslims.<br /><br />The legal arguments against GTMO (that the US is violating US and/or international law) haven't interested the public, either.  The arguments are too technical, and the number and length of court opinions, of differing opinions by judges, and the number of scholarly articles and op eds on this issue let Americans think the arguments on both sides are plausible. There has been no sweeping, landmark Supreme Court decision thoroughly vindicating one side or the other.  Instead, courts are considering whether the US can, legally, deny a certain level of process in general; whether specific processes are permissible; and which procedural safeguards, if any, are required.  Every lower court ruling will be appealed to the Supreme Court, and the meaning of the Supreme Court's decisions will be debated in subsequent cases.  Settling this area of law will take years.  Ultimately, it's not clear to most Americans that the US isn't following the law at GTMO. Indeed, if torture seems justifiable, then denying various courtroom procedures can seem justifiable, too.<br /><br />The argument that the US should "follow the law" (and set an example for the rest of the world) is sentimental, too.  Our leaders can act with impunity.  No one can stop the US from doing whatever it wants to do, and why lead by example when we can force other countries to do what we want them to do?<br /><br />GTMO appears to reflect what most Americans want: to be safe from terrorism.  Most Americans believe that the lax rules for GTMO tribunals are necessary to convict terrorists.  If we used our regular court system, the terrorists would not be convicted, because the evidence we have against them doesn't meet the necessary high standards.  If a terrorist walks free, he's a ticking time bomb.<br /><br />The survival instinct trumps sentimentality. <br /><br />But the belief that lax court rules can protect the public from terrorism is wrong.  The most powerful argument for giving prisoners at GTMO more legal process is that the weak rules there now can't protect us from terrorism.  Weak standards cannot help us determine, reliably, if the people we've locked up or released are the right people, because the rules rely on notoriously unreliable forms of evidence: hearsay, coerced confessions, and evidence kept secret from the accused.  Garbage in, garbage out.  <br /><br />Also, the lax rules give no incentive to the FBI, CIA, military, and police to conduct serious investigations.  Why bother, when they can "win" a case at the tribunal by pounding a "confession" out of a prisoner?  In this way, we'll fail to develop the anti-terrorism investigative abilities we need to thwart terrorism.  As time goes by, we'll become weaker rather than stronger; like unused muscles, our skills will atrophy. In a few years, we might lack any meaningful anti-terror investigative abilities at all. We might merely have goon squads who beat "confessions" out of people. <br /><br />We can reverse this slide by requiring that terrorists be tried under rigorous rules of evidence and criminal procedure. That would cause our police and intelligence officials to work harder to investigate, to get solid evidence. Much more would be learned about terrorists and their networks. We could also be more confident that the people released were not dangerous.  (I discussed these benefits of rigorous process in a <a href="/forumy/2005/10/guantanamo-process-as
-public-danger.php">previous commentary</a> in JURIST&#39;s <em>Forum</em>.) <br /><br />GTMO is a public safety issue.  It's time for Congress to act.  We should try the GTMO prisoners under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which applies to POWs. Better, we should try the prisoners in our federal courts, where there is more process &#8212; and thus a better chance for accuracy in convictions.  <br /><br />When Americans understand that using stronger rules at GTMO is not about being good world citizens or being nice to prisoners, but about giving ourselves the strongest anti-terrorism tactic we can &#8212; vigorous, hard-nosed police and intelligence work &#8212; they will see the folly of maintaining our separate-and-unequal justice system.  Strong procedural rules at GTMO will require our government to work for us, and the increased transparency will make our government accountable to us.  <br /><br />GTMO is about our own survival &#8212; something Americans of all political stripes can agree on.  <br /><br /><br /><em>Brian J.

		<title>Dodging the Bullet: Tort Immunity for Gun Makers</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/rostron.htm">Allen Rostron</a> of the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law says that new federal legislation immunizing gun makers from tort liability might protect them, but not the innocent people who are so often victims of gun crime...</p>
<strong>A</strong></font>mericans have always cherished certain ideals about our justice system. You may win or you may lose, but you are entitled to have your day in court.<br /><br />Last week, President Bush created a significant exception to that principle when he signed the "Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act," a federal law that gives the gun industry a broad, nationwide immunity from legal responsibility for its actions.  If the legislation survives constitutional challenges, gun makers and dealers will enjoy a level of protection from tort liability shared by no other industry. <br /><br />The NRA, gun companies, and their allies have been pushing hard for this immunity law ever since Bush took office in 2001, and the only real surprise about its enactment is that it took so long.  Supporters of the legislation insist that imposing liability on gun makers is an absurd notion akin to saying that manufacturers of pens should be blamed when people write bad checks.</p>

<p>The statute generally bars claims brought against manufacturers, sellers, or trade associations concerning harm resulting from illegal misuse of a firearm or ammunition.  In other words, if Beretta carelessly distributes a firearm in a way that makes it easy for a criminal to obtain it, Beretta will have no liability to the victims of murders, assaults, robberies, or other crimes committed with the gun.<br /><br />The new law contains exceptions protecting several narrow categories of claims.  For example, a person may be held liable for knowingly selling a gun in violation of federal or state law or negligently entrusting a gun to someone the seller knows or reasonably should know is likely to use it in a harmful manner.  While those exceptions will preserve some tort claims against retail gun dealers, they have little relevance to the liability of manufacturers who sell their products through distributors and dealers rather than directly to the public.  None of the tort claims brought against gun manufacturers in recent years would fit within the exceptions. <br /><br />The immunity legislation forced many of its proponents to take positions contrary to their usual ideological inclinations.  Conservatives on Capitol Hill and in the White House supported the law despite the fact that it relies on a very broad view of Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause to impose nationwide regulations and to trump the public policy prerogatives of state governments. <br /> <br />The law's backers also emphasized that thirty-three states had already enacted statutes giving gun makers varying amounts of protection from tort liability.  Rather than seeing that state-by-state decision-making as an illustration of federalism's virtues, the new law's supporters insisted that a single federal resolution of the issue had to be forced on every state for the sake of nationwide uniformity.<br /><br />During the debates over the bill, members of Congress repeatedly declared that firearm manufacturers should not be held liable every time a violent criminal misuses a gun.  Public opinion polls indicate that the vast majority of Americans agree with that proposition.  I spent several years helping to bring lawsuits against gun makers and I agree completely that a gun manufacturer should not be liable every time someone gets shot.  The real issue, missed by those legislators and pollsters, is whether a gun manufacturer should be liable when it distributes or designs guns in unnecessarily and unreasonably dangerous ways and creates risks above and beyond those inherent in the sale of firearms.<br />  <br />The lawsuits brought in recent years have targeted what virtually anyone would regard as egregious negligence.  For example, in the lawsuit arising from the sniper shootings by John Allen Muhammad and John Lee Malvo that terrorized the Washington D.C. area in the fall of 2002, a manufacturer and dealer agreed to pay more than $2.5 million to settle claims brought by victims of the shooting and their families.  The dealer's store security was so inadequate that it enabled Malvo, a juvenile, to pick up a Bushmaster assault rifle and simply walk out the door without paying for it.  Audits of inventory, conducted by law enforcement both before and after Malvo's theft, revealed hundreds of other firearms missing from the store.  Despite being aware of the dealer's irresponsible behavior and appalling track record, the rifle manufacturer insisted that the dealer was a "good customer" through which it was happy to distribute its products.<br /><br />In another case, a Massachusetts gun maker, Kahr Arms, did not conduct background checks on its employees, did not test them for drug use, and had no metal detectors, x-ray machines, security cameras, or even security guards to prevent employee theft from its factory.  An employee with a criminal record and a long history of drug addiction took advantage of the absence of security measures, stealing guns from the factory and reselling them to criminals to support his drug habit.  One of the guns wound up being used in a shooting outside a night club and killing an innocent bystander.  Even some of the nation's most ardent gun rights activists have acknowledged that the new federal immunity legislation goes too far in exempting manufacturers from liability in this situation.<br /><br />Lawsuits have uncovered many other similarly disturbing stories, as well as striking revelations about attitudes within the gun industry.  Robert Ricker worked for nearly twenty years as a lawyer and lobbyist for the NRA and the largest gun industry trade association.  In a sworn statement obtained in litigation, he acknowledged that gun manufacturers' distribution systems encourage and reward illegal activity by corrupt dealers and distributors.  When was the last time you heard anyone say something like that about the pen industry?<br /><br />Ricker described how tort litigation might finally overcome the industry's resistance to reforms that would reduce illegal access to guns.  "Leaders in the industry have long known that greater industry action to prevent illegal transactions is possible," Ricker stated, but "until faced with a serious threat of civil liability for past conduct, leaders in the industry have consistently resisted taking constructive voluntary action to prevent firearms from ending up in the illegal gun market and have sought to silence others within the industry who have advocated reform."<br /><br />The immunity bestowed on the gun manufacturers and dealers by the new statute eliminates that valuable threat of civil liability.  Congress and President Bush have given the industry the special immunity it desperately wanted, but innocent people will bear the consequences of this misguided effort to reduce the gun industry's incentives to conduct business in safe, reasonable, and responsible ways.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Allen Rostron is an Associate Professor at the University of Missouri&#8212;Kansas City School of Law and a former staff attorney for the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Dr. <a href="http://www.nuigalway.ie/law/Staff/laurent_pech.html">Laurent Pech</a>, a native of Aix-en-Provence, France, and Jean Monnet Lecturer in European Union Law at the National University of Ireland, Galway, says that the recent rioting by French immigrant youths has complex roots and represents a political as much as a social failure...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/pechlarge.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>S</strong></font>adly but unavoidably, the French Government earlier this month officially proclaimed a state of emergency, invoking a 1955 law to quell widespread urban riots through the use of curfews and other extraordinary police powers. The 1955 law had only been implemented once before since the end of the war in Algeria (1954-1962), and that was in 1984 in the French Pacific territory of New Caledonia, to restore public order after a wave of politically inspired assassinations. Parliament has now agreed to prolong the state of emergency for a period of three more months. The irony of the situation has not been lost on observers: the 1955 law was aimed fifty years ago at the grandparents of some of the current rioters. <br /><br />Before challenging the argument that France is now paying the price of its allegedly authoritarian model of integration, let me insert a preliminary (and long) <em>caveat</em>. In too many cases, foreign commentators and media have tended to label the rioters as "Muslims." Examples of this thoughtless and implicitly xenophobic tendency could easily be multiplied (see e.g. Fox News). It must therefore be strongly emphasized that in no way do we know the religious beliefs or practices of the young persons involved in the recent unrest. <br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/countries/france.php">France</a> | Text: <a href="/gazette/2005/11/french-state-of-emergency-laws-french.php">French state of emergency laws</a><br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br />In any case, it does not matter. The riots have absolutely nothing to do with religious freedom or about the place of Islam in French society. Just as foolish is the temptation to present the rioters as some sort of revolutionary guard. The teenagers and young adults burning the properties of their neighbors are not guided by any apparent political agenda. They rather represent the nihilist elements of a generation of unemployed and discriminated-against young men of foreign descent. And they are no angels themselves, as demonstrated by their burning of synagogues only two to three years ago. In most cases, if the backgrounds of those so far arrested are representative, we are talking about French citizens of Arab or African descent with an already-extensive criminal records.<br /><br />In reality, most people living in those poor suburban neighborhoods generically called "banlieues" do not identify with the troubled young men, but are having to deal with the consequences of their actions thanks to a deficient criminal system where sentences are far from being always enforced. This is not to say that a lack of repression is the reason behind the current unrest or that repression is the answer. Yet, before offering a diagnosis, one should understand how France got to this point<br /><br />First of all, it has to be said that there is nothing surprising about the eruption of violence. Anyone familiar with the then-controversial movie <em>La Haine</em> (released in 1995 and directed by Matthieu Kassovitz) would tell you that what is most surprising is that the riots did not erupt earlier. In a way, on a smaller scale, disturbances have been a typical occurrence in the banlieues since the eighties. For instance, Strasbourg has now the sad privilege of being well known for its "New Year's Eve" tradition, that tradition consisting of burning more cars than the year before to draw media attention for a few minutes. <br /><br />The latest unrest was apparently initiated by the accidental death of two teenagers, one of Mauritanian origin, the other of Tunisian origin. They ran away from a police identity check and, fatally, sought refuge in an electrical substation. This led to rioting, which in turn led Nicholas Sarkozy, the infamous French Interior Minister, to use the word "scum" to describe the rioters. According to even the most well-intentioned commentators, this was outrageous and enough of an excuse to incite more violence. Yet, this very word is used daily by people living in the poor neighborhoods to describe the criminal youth. This is not to imply that the utterance was a smart and dignified move, but to accuse the Minister of racism is singularly misplaced as he has constantly advocated the cause of immigrants, most recently by defending affirmative action and by arguing in favor of granting immigrants the right to vote at the local level. <br /><br />Irrespective of the facts at the root of the riots, a now common diagnosis propagated by foreign journalists is that they represent the failure of the French republican model of integration (see e.g. <em>The Guardian</em>, Leader, "Integration has to be voluntary", November 6, 2005; <em>The New York Times</em>, Editorial, "While Paris Burns", November 8, 2005). This diagnosis is wrong.<br /><br />Article 1 of the French Constitution illustrates the substance of the so-called French model: "France shall be an indivisible, secular &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; Republic. It shall ensure the equality of all citizens before the law, without distinction of origin, race or religion&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;" Accordingly, from a formal and legal perspective, there are no "minorities" in France. Indeed, since 1789 the Republic has always envisioned the unity of its citizens as "without distinction of origin, race or religion." Consequently, the legislature has always refused to recognize rights for groups that are formed on the basis of a community of common origin, belief, culture, and language. In France, there is but one abstract community, that of its citizens.<br /><br />This conception has decisive practical consequences as, legally speaking, it forbids any policy of affirmative action as long as it is based on a criterion prohibited by the Constitution. It similarly excludes any data collection stressing the origin, race or religion of individuals. As a matter of principle, this author is profoundly attached to the premises upon which the French integrationist model is based. Understandably, the rigid features of the French approach often astonish foreign observers. One should concede that in practice, it has important shortcomings. It does not perfectly allow French society to understand the specific problems faced by immigrants or the generation of people born in France of foreign parents. Yet, I would argue that the fundamental problem is not the French model <em>per se</em> but rather the striking dissonance that French citizens of Arab or African descent experience between abstract
 principles officially proclaimed and what they endure in their daily lives. The huge body of anti-discrimination law too often appears toothless or not rigidly enforced. This is the crux of the matter and this is not the first time France has been faced with its own contradictions. During the days of our colonial empire, we used to teach the people that we subjugated by force the merits of the Declaration of Human Rights of 1789, while denying their humanity. a perfect recipe for bringing upon ourselves "wars of liberation". <br /><br />The French integrationist approach may not be the most relevant issue, however. On the contrary, I think these riots should be interpreted as manifest evidence that most of the frustrated young men feel French and that they simply want to be accepted by the Nation and to be, more prosaically, part of our consumerist society. Their frustration and anger is comprehensible when faced with the unfulfilled promises of social and economic integration. Let us repeat this important point: it is because most French of Arab or African origin have believed in the idea of integration or assimilation that some are now tempted by nihilist attitudes. Therefore, and contrary to what many "multiculturalists" have argued, most rioters do not express their hatred of France or demand "cultural" rights for their "communities"; rather, their frustration is huge because they felt efforts they may have made have not been answered. <br /><br />In any case, the United States and American media are in no position to lecture. More than 1 per cent of the US population is apparently behind bars, in comparison to approximately about 0.1 per cent of the French population. Washington is not burning because the American nation has been ready, morally and financially, to lock up a huge number of its criminals (blacks or of foreign origin) while at the same time creating a huge number of low-paid jobs, which do not exist in France for a certain number of structural and principled reasons. Hurricane Katrina has shown that both societies and many others have an important &quot;lumpenproletariat&quot;. But rather than locking them up, France has tried to buy peace by extensively subsidizing the poor neighborhoods. That policy worked until now or more exactly, it successfully kept the poor out of sight. The next and key question is therefore what to do next.<br /><br />The obvious long-term solution apart from "multiculturalism" would certainly be to create more jobs and to face the failures of our anti-discrimination policies. Even though this author cherishes the Republican model based on individual merit and abstract equality, more pragmatism and less ideology is needed today. More ambitious corrective measures should be taken in order to improve access to education and access to the civil service for those living in the banlieues. Another balance has also to be struck between prevention and repression. Police intervention has to be redefined and the harassing of youth through ID checks ought to be stopped. Yet, it is also critical that police forces do not see their work annihilated by a deficient criminal system, freeing the same juvenile delinquents over and over. Irrespective of their age, it is simply intolerable to see young men with more than ten criminal sentences on their r&Atilde;&copy;sum&Atilde;&copy; walking about freely while harassing their underprivileged neighbors. Political correctness and rigid republican ideology are still obstacles to a genuine debate on discrimination and/or criminality. Unfortunately, it is the extreme-right that has always benefited from the unwillingness of our unprincipled leaders and "embedded" journalists to address poverty and racism in French society as well as the overrepresentation of individuals of foreign origin in crime statistics. <br /><br />At the end it is important to reposition the riots in the larger context of a deeply frustrated and demoralized Nation, frustrated by the inability of our elites to successfully manage the economy and fearful of its destiny in our globalized world. In a famous study, <em>La soci&Atilde;&copy;t&Atilde;&copy; bloqu&Atilde;&copy;e</em> (1970) complemented with another powerful book, <em>La crise de l'intelligence</em> (1995), Michel Crozier offered what is still the best analysis of a country unable to reform itself. At whose door should we lay the blame? For all intents and purposes, the responsibility of our self-reproductive elite is tremendous. French society in its cultural and social diversity is simply not represented by Parliament. Worse, at the level of either the higher civil service or in the media, the only chance to make it in the country has more to do with your genes than your merits. The upper class has simply used the Republican model as a protective shield to preserve its "privileges" through hidden networks of power and influence. The unfortunate aspect of the most recent riots, however, is that rather than bringing closer the people suffering from dramatic socio-economic conditions, it incites sickening politicians to play a category of unemployed poor against another. What is ultimately needed is for the elite to accept to the necessity of abdicating a significant part of the "privileges" they have accumulated to the detriment of the public good. We should rediscover the spirit of 1789. If not, some may want to rediscover the letter of it, complete with bloody consequences.<br /><br /><hr size=1><br />Also by Laurent Pech:<br /><ul><li><a href="/forumy/2005/05/non-sense-frances-no-to-european.php">Non-sense: France&#39;s No to the European Constitution</a><li><a href="/forumy/2005/05/eu-constitution-and-french-referendum.php">The EU Constitution and French Referendum: Law v.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.miami.edu/facadmin/faculty/svladeck.html">Stephen Vladeck</a> of the University of Miami School of Law says that the US government&#39;s move to charge alleged &quot;dirty bomber&quot; Jose Padilla and potentially moot his pending appeal to the US Supreme Court against his status as uncharged enemy combatant may leave intact the problematic Fourth Circuit ruling broadly endorsing the President's authority to indefinitely detain US citizens - unless of course, the Court, perhaps invoking the jurisprudence of late Chief Justice William Rehnquist, decides that the charge does not necessarily moot the case...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/vladeck.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>1</strong></font>,259 days later, Jose Padilla is "free." Okay, not "free" in the literal sense of the word, but free to exercise the typical panoply of constitutional rights afforded to defendants in the American criminal justice system. Such is the world we find ourselves in the day after a criminal indictment filed against Padilla here in Miami was unsealed, and a Presidential Order transferring Padilla to the "civilian" custody of the Department of Justice was made public.<br /><br /> For all those who argued, all along, that the proper course of action in Padilla's case was to either charge him with a crime or release him (like, say, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit), this week's developments should be acknowledged for what they are: Victory. With its opposition to <em>certiorari</em> due next Monday, the Administration's attempt to moot the Supreme Court's near-guaranteed review of the Fourth Circuit's September opinion endorsing President Bush's authority to detain Padilla is hardly surprising, given that the Administration can count votes as well as (and, probably, better than) the rest of us. And if they don't even have Justice Scalia . . . . <br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/padilla.php">Jose Padilla</a> | Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/enemycombatants.php">Enemy Combatants</a> | Text: <a href="/gazette/2005/11/padilla-indictment-us-doj.php">Padilla indictment</a> | Text: <a  href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/gazette/2005/09/padilla-indefinite-detention-ruling.php">Padilla indefinite detention ruling</a> [4th Circuit]<br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /> But we can't lose sight of the big picture here. An American citizen was detained for three and a half years &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; for one-thousand, two-hundred, and fifty-nine days &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; as an "enemy combatant," even though now, the stated basis for doing so does not form any part of the criminal charges against him. As a new strategy in difficult criminal cases &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; detain the suspect without charge until the opposition to certiorari is due in the U.S. Supreme Court, then transfer and charge him &acirc;&#8364;&#8221; the government's position is simply brilliant. It may not even raise Speedy Trial Act issues, since the general rule under the Act is to count time from when the defendant was "arrested or served with a summons in connection with [the criminal] charges."<br /><br /> As a "heads I win, tails you lose" approach to constitutional litigation, however, this kind of forum-shopping should make even the staunchest defenders of the substantive policies behind the case uneasy. Assuming that the government's response to <em>certiorari</em> will argue that the case is now moot, and should therefore not be granted (a position that may be irreconcilable with the fact that, notwithstanding his transfer to civilian custody, Padilla has not been "un-designated" as an "enemy combatant"), there is a serious danger that the Fourth Circuit's broad endorsement of the President's authority to detain citizens like Padilla will remain on the books, and the obvious allusion to Justice Jackson's famous dissent in <em>Korematsu</em> is unavoidable:<blockquote>The principle then lies about like a loaded weapon ready for the hand of any authority that can bring forward a plausible claim of an urgent need.... A military commander may overstep the bounds of constitutionality, and it is an incident. But if we review and approve, that passing incident becomes the doctrine of the Constitution.</blockquote>Here, of course, the danger is not that the Court will "review and approve" such a potentially dangerous precedent, but that, because of the mootness concerns, it will find itself unable to consider the controversial constitutional issues, and therefore approve the Fourth Circuit's <em>ratio decidendi</em> simply by leaving it intact. In that context, is the danger any less significant?<br /><br /> The idealistic answer is "of course," because the Court has long recognized its authority, when the prevailing party below voluntarily moots an appeal, to grant certiorari, vacate the judgment below, and remand with instructions to dismiss. The so-called "Munsingwear" doctrine, named after the 1950 case from which it derives, was most recently discussed in depth in 1995, where the Court reaffirmed its utility in cases like Padilla's (albeit while rejecting its application to different facts there). But, quietly, a number of Court veterans have suggested that a "Munsingwear" order is hardly automatic, and that the Court may just as easily deny <em>certiorari</em> in Padilla's case, leaving the Fourth Circuit opinion intact. Whatever dangers this approach would have for historical purposes, the peril it would create for Padilla's criminal case would be legion, since collateral estoppel might well bar relitigation of issues "settled" by the Fourth Circuit's efforts, e.g., the lawfulness of Padilla's pre-indictment detention.<br /><br /> Which brings me, quasi-full-circle, to the one-time Jackson clerk, Chief Justice Rehnquist. Unlike many of my colleagues, I had thought, from early on in the <em>Padilla</em> litigation, that the former Chief Justice might not be such a sure vote for the government's position on the merits. After all, as much as Rehnquist was a well-known defender of executive power, he was equally well known for his vigorous defenses of judicial independence, if not judicial supremacy, in cases such as Dickerson. One small sign that Rehnquist might have had concerns about the limitlessness of the government's position on the merits in <em>Padilla</em> is the <em>Hamdi</em> case, where, rather than join Justice Thomas's dissent arguing for broad deference to the President, he joined Justice O'Connor's plurality opinion affirming the government's authority on the narrowest grounds available, and taking pains to distinguish the battlefield-specific facts of that case.<br /><br /> More important than Rehnquist's ultimate position on the merits of <em>Padilla</em>, however, which I would not dare presume to predict, is what his position might have been on the mootness question. For that, there's much to learn
from an otherwise seldom-invoked concurrence he wrote in 1988. In <em>Honig v. Doe</em>, a case concerning claims that the San Francisco Unified School District had violated the Education of the Handicapped Act, Rehnquist joined a 7-2 majority both on the merits and in holding that the case was not moot, even though all but one of the suing students had reached the age of 21 by the time the case was argued in the Supreme Court, the age at which the Act's protections terminate. (And the one student left in the case was, it appears, no longer subject to the alleged violations of the Act.)<br /><br /> Responding to a strong dissent by Justice Scalia, which Justice O'Connor joined,  Rehnquist concurred separately to emphasize that, in his view, the Court's mootness doctrine was not required by Article III. Although Rehnquist's opinion was limited to cases "where the events giving rise to the claim of mootness have occurred after our decision to grant <em>certiorari</em> or to note probable jurisdiction," he was unequivocal in his view that, in those circumstances, mootness could give way to compelling policy reasons for hearing the case:<blockquote>The logical conclusion to be drawn from...the historical development of the principle of mootness, is that while an unwillingness to decide moot cases may be connected to the case or controversy requirement of Art. III, it is an attenuated connection that may be overridden where there are strong reasons to override it. The "capable of repetition, yet evading review" exception is an example. So too is our refusal to dismiss as moot those cases in which the defendant voluntarily ceases, at some advanced stage of the appellate proceedings, whatever activity prompted the plaintiff to seek [relief].</blockquote>Whether the sixteenth Chief Justice would have been likely to extend his <em>Honig</em> concurrence to <em>Padilla</em> is, of course, impossible to know. But for a Chief Justice who so strongly believed in the independence of the judiciary and in the power (sometimes, the obligation) of the courts to decide even those cases it traditionally held itself without power to hear, and for a former law clerk to the Justice who so famously denounced the "loaded weapon" in <em>Korematsu</em>, the Administration's attempt to voluntary moot the most important individual liberty case of our time, for the transparently obvious (and ignoble) reason of avoiding the Supreme Court's review, might not have gone over very well at all.<br /><br /><hr size=1><br />Also by Stephen Vladeck:<br /><ul><li><a href="/forumy/2005/10/jose-padilla-and-milligan-problem.php">Jose Padilla and the Milligan Problem</a></ul><hr size=1><em>Stephen Vladeck is a professor at the University of Miami School of Law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.gonzaga.edu/Academics/Faculty+and+Staff/Faculty/DeWolf,+David.htm">David DeWolf</a> says that the <em>Kitzmiller</em> intelligent design case may settle whether the Pennsylvania school district that put &quot;intelligent design&quot; into its curriculum was acting under impermissible religious animus, but it may not settle whether teaching the origins controversy is actually unconstitutional...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/dewolf.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>O</strong></font>n Friday, November 4, the trial of <em>Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School Board</em> came to a close.  Barry Lynn, Executive Director of Americans for Separation of Church and State, has predicted that <em>Kitzmiller</em> &quot;will prove to be the death knell for intelligent design . . . it will put an end to intelligent design in public schools.&quot;  Is he right?<br /><br />To begin with, what is actually at stake in <em>Kitzmiller</em>?  The plaintiffs have made two basic claims.  The first is that the policy adopted by the school board resulted from religious animus.  One of the board members, Bill Buckingham, was quoted as having said, &quot;Two thousand years ago, someone died on a cross. Can&#39;t someone take a stand for him?&quot;  At trial Buckingham denied that this statement was made in reference to the policy regarding intelligent design, but Judge Jones will ultimately weigh the facts to determine whether the policy had a secular purpose.  Although both sides have predicted that the case could go all the way to the US Supreme Court, if the judgment is based on factual findings that are not clearly erroneous, a successful appeal is unlikely.  If the policy resulted from religious animus, it is unconstitutional.  But such a finding (if it were made) would say nothing about the nature of intelligent design itself.  By analogy, suppose the school board hired only Norwegians, and the judge found that this was a result of discriminatory animus; would anyone argue that it had been shown that it was unconstitutional to hire Norwegians?<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Video: <a href="/monitor/2005/10/should-schools-teach-intelligent.php">Should Schools Teach &quot;Intelligent Design&quot;?</a> [AEI] <br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /> But the plaintiffs have made a second, broader claim.  Their witnesses testified that intelligent design is not science; that it had &quot;evolved&quot; from creationism in order to evade the legal impact of <em>Edwards v. Aguillard</em>; and that it is an inherently religious belief that has no place in a science curriculum.  By contrast, the school board presented witnesses who explained the scientific basis of design theory (the application to biology of clearly established methods for detecting the action of an intelligent agent); the benefit to science of permitting minority views; and the benefit to students from developing critical thinking skills.  Fascinating as the trial testimony was, it is unclear that Judge Jones will answer the questions that formed the title of an article my co-authors and I published five years ago in the <em>Utah Law Review</em>, <a href="http://guweb2.gonzaga.edu/~dewolf/utah.pdf">Teaching the Origins Controversy:  Science, Or Religion, Or Speech?</a> [PDF].  If Judge Jones does answer these questions, then the losing party will likely appeal the decision, and the Supreme Court could revisit some of the questions that were first raised in <em>Edwards v. Aguillard</em>.<br /><br />If it does, we can predict one thing with confidence:  the court will not say, as it blithely did in <em>Edwards</em>, that the proffered secular purpose of the state&#39;s action--to protect the academic freedom of teachers -- was a &quot;sham&quot; because teachers already possess the flexibility &quot;to supplant the present science curriculum with the presentation of theories, besides evolution, about the origin of life.&quot;  In Dover the ACLU denied that even the school board had such freedom.  Defense of the right to teach evolution has devolved into what I sometimes refer to as &quot;compulsory chapel for Darwinism.&quot; Although this state of affairs appears not only acceptable but obligatory in the eyes of major science organizations, it continues to irritate the public, i.e. the voters.  When the state boards of education in Ohio and Kansas were presented with the &quot;teach-the-controversy&quot; alternative, despite massive lobbying they ultimately gave the people what they wanted.  And when Senator Rick Santorum introduced an amendment to the No Child Left Behind Act in support of teaching the controversy, it passed 91-8.<br /><br /> Meanwhile, a new battlefront has opened up:  higher education.  In the past, the proposals to present ID to high school students was criticized as premature until ID had established itself in the academic and scientific communities.  But now censorship is applied even to the few scientists who are brave enough to publicly promote ID.  Recently the president of the University of Idaho issued a letter instructing students, faculty and staff that &quot;[t]eaching of views that differ from evolution . . . is inappropriate in our life, earth, and physical science courses.&quot;  Similarly, Cornell University&#39;s Interim President devoted his 2005 &quot;State of the University&quot; Address to a condemnation of intelligent design,  claiming it is &quot;not valid as science&quot; and &quot;a religious belief masquerading as a secular idea.&quot;  He called on the Cornell community to study &quot;the background conditions that have put rational thought under attack.&quot; Instead of denouncing a clear assault on academic freedom, Jonathan Knight from the AAUP stated that whether something is scientifically grounded is determined &quot;by what the community of scholars determines by decades of testing.&quot;  In other words, you have academic freedom -- to teach what the majority thinks.  On the Animal Farm of academia, apparently, all pluralism is equal, but some pluralism is more equal than others.  Ironically, studies show that students actually learn evolution much better when they are taught using a &quot;teach the controversy&quot; approach (see, for example, a recent study in <em>Bioscience</em> reported at <a href="http://www.EurekAlert.org">www.EurekAlert.org</a>).  And by escalating the campaign to suppress the controversy, ID opponents have only strengthened the case for public intervention to protect the right to teach the controversy.  The stage is now set for a broad defense of academic freedom, one that the public heartily supports.  The ACLU will be hard put to show that such an approach is unconstitutional.<br /><br /> Five years ago when my co-authors and I published our law review article on &quot;teaching the origins controversy,&quot; we proposed a hypothetical &quot;John Spokes&quot;, a latter-day John Scopes of &quot
;Monkey Trial&quot; fame who wanted to teach the controversy but sought guidance from his school board as to whether he was on legally safe ground.  <em>Kitzmiller</em> is unlikely to answer his question; but sooner rather than later the answer is likely to be &quot;Yes.&quot;  <br /><br /><em>David DeWolf is a law professor at Gonzaga University School of Law and a Senior Fellow of the <a href="http://www.discovery.org/">Discovery Institute</a></em><br />

Behind this simple statement lies weeks of nonstop work by the Law School administration, faculty, and staff led by Dean Lawrence Ponoroff.<br /><br /> Like all the institutions affected by Hurricane Katrina, the Law School faced unique challenges in a disorienting environment.  All of us thought we would be out of our offices for a few days at most, but one of the worst hurricanes in this nation's history scattered us across the country.  This unprecedented catastrophe was followed by one of the brightest moments in the history of higher education in the United States.  Rising to the occasion, hundreds of colleges, universities and professional schools took in students and faculty affected by Katrina and gave them a fall semester they will always remember.  This wonderful act of enlightened generosity will stand forever as an example for the rest of the nation in responding to natural disasters.<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/katrinadisaster.php">Hurricane Katrina Disaster</a> | Text: <a href="/gazette/2005/11/katrina-victims-fema-lawsuit-us-dc.php">Katrina victims FEMA lawsuit</a> | Video: <a  href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/monitor/2005/10/race-and-reconstruction-after.php">Race and Reconstruction After Hurricane Katrina</a><br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /> As for the Law School, we are eternally grateful for the support shown to us by the law schools across the country who, for the most part, took our students in as one-semester visitors on condition only that they pay their Tulane tuition.  We now look forward to the return of all of our students in January.<br /><br />Katrina changed New Orleans along every dimension imaginable.  The Law School building itself was only lightly damaged and had no flooding, but our faculty and staff were not so lucky.  At least four Law School faculty and many staff lost their homes and almost all of their personal possessions.  Many more suffered damages amounting to tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Thousands of students were suddenly homeless and many lost their personal belongings as well.<br /><br /> Once the fall semester was cancelled, the Law School administration began searching for strategies that would provide the best spring semester possible for upper-class students and a full year's worth of courses for first year students.  The plan eventually worked out has a "normal" 14 week semester for upper-class students that uses every room and every possible time slot to squeeze in more than 100 courses in a single semester.  First year students who managed to visit away at other schools will also have a standard 14 week semester with our usual spring courses.  However, most of the first year class did not visit.  They will experience all of the normal required courses for both fall and spring compressed into two ten week semesters.  With vacation and exam breaks, the spring "semester" for these first year students will extend until the end of June.  This complex schedule has been made possible by the active cooperation of the faculty, many of whom will be teaching three courses over six months.<br /><br /> Clearly spring semester 2006 will be something special and not just because of the unusual shape of the schedule.  Law students returning to New Orleans will experience a completely unique legal environment.  There are a myriad of unusual legal problems in housing, criminal justice, insurance, and the environment, to name only the most obvious.  Tulane Law School is fortunate to have well established clinics that can assist in all of these areas.  In addition, the Law School has always had one of the leading programs in community service as a graduation requirement.  Pro bono legal work will surely be needed now more than ever.  Before his untimely death in September, David Gelfand, one of Tulane's leading constitutional law scholars, had been busy creating an innovative public service program called <a href="http://www.fromthelaketotheriver.org/">From the Lake to the River Foundation </a>(The New Orleans Coalition for Legal Aid and Disaster Relief).  This program summons the resources of lawyers and law students across the country in assisting with the legal problems involved in rebuilding New Orleans.  All Tulane Law students will have a chance to assist with the complex issues presented by rebuilding one of America's great cities.<br /><br /> Right now many in New Orleans and Louisiana doubt whether the federal government will follow through on the promises made in September and commit the resources necessary to rebuild.  The return of students to New Orleans in January will be a much needed boost.  Students bring energy, enthusiasm, and commitment.  I expect that these qualities will have a multiplier effect, allowing local citizens to see a way forward to address their problems.  Tulane University and the Law School know that they have key roles to play in the rebirth of New Orleans.<br /><br /> The key factor that has made restarting the Law School possible has been the commitment of both faculty and students.  The optimism and support of the faculty, along with the vast majority of students, has provided the spirit necessary to ensure that the Law School will come back from this setback stronger than ever.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Stephen M.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.fcsl.edu/faculty/bio2.cfm?instructID=1039">Brian Foley</a> of Florida Coastal School of Law says that the Senate compromise on the Graham Amendment limiting judicial review for Guantanamo detainees leaves the way open for grave mistakes and injustices that may further damage America&#39;s reputation in the &quot;war on terror&quot;...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/brianfoleyleft.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>fter four years of silence, the Senate on Tuesday voted 84-14 to limit federal court jurisdiction over cases filed by prisoners at Guantanamo Bay (GTMO).  We still have time, however, to try to steer Congress toward the smarter option, which is to increase federal courts' ability to review these cases, and to strengthen the legal process used at GTMO tribunals.<br /><br />The Senate proposal results from a compromise over a defense bill amendment that Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) introduced last week, and which the Senate approved Thursday. That amendment would have nullified the US Supreme Court's decision in <em>Rasul v. Bush</em>, 542 U.S. 466 (2004), which held that non-US citizen prisoners at GTMO may file habeas corpus petitions challenging their imprisonment as well as claims under federal law concerning  the conditions of their confinement; Graham's amendment would have stripped foreign "enemy combatants" of any right to federal court review of their convictions by military commissions, and would have allowed only limited federal appellate review of GTMO tribunal determinations that prisoners are "enemy combatants" who may be imprisoned indefinitely.  The compromise amendment passed Tuesday, brokered Monday night by Senator Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and backed by Graham, permits some, albeit limited, federal appellate review over GTMO tribunals and military commissions.  (There is no mention of prisoners held at CIA secret prisons in former Iron Curtain countries.)  But the court review is too limited to provide any real benefits. <br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo</a> | Text: <a href="/gazette/2005/11/graham-levin-amendment-on-detainee.php">Graham-Levin amendment on detainee judicial review</a> | Text: <a href="/gazette/2005/11/graham-amendment-on-detainee-judicial.php">Graham amendment</a><br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br />What 84 Senators apparently don't understand is that using rigorous legal process at GTMO to determine whether a prisoner is an "enemy combatant," or whether he is guilty of particular crimes, is an important weapon in the "war on terror." When our military and intelligence know that only solid evidence -- instead of hearsay, coerced confessions, and evidence kept secret from the accused -- can be used to support detentions, and that a federal judge will review the proceedings, they will investigate more thoroughly. We will be far more certain that we're holding the right people, instead of, for example, mere dupes that the real terrorists have handed over, or innocent people captured by mistake.  Imprisoning innocent people can spur others to violence against us.  Shoddy investigations and kangaroo courts merely endanger the public.<br /><br />On the other hand, requiring our officials to roll up their sleeves and ferret out reliable evidence would protect the public, by sharpening our investigators' skills and building knowledge about terrorists and their networks.  In the long run, such seasoned and nuanced intelligence will protect us far more than convictions based on beatings and hearsay.  Rigorous process also provides a check on Executive power. Without it, we can't know if our leaders are telling us the truth when they say they're making progress and capturing dangerous terrorists &#8212; our leaders can't even be certain themselves.<br /> <br />So the Senate made a grave mistake Tuesday. It did not strengthen GTMO procedures. It voted to limit the availability of court review of detentions that could have developed under <em>Rasul v. Bush</em>. The proposal limits court review to the D.C. Circuit (which limits fact-finding). All that can be appealed as of right is the Combatant Status Review Tribunal's rulings on whether a prisoner is an "enemy combatant," and a military commission's conviction of an enemy combatant for particular crime where the accused was sentenced to death, or for more than 10 years. Constitutional challenges to the processes are also permitted, but how sweeping they may be is unclear. <br /><br />Five major problems are apparent. First, the limited judicial review won't prevent the government from holding prisoners indefinitely; if "enemy combatant" status determinations for new prisoners are delayed indefinitely, there is nothing to review.  There is no right to a speedy trial at GTMO; even if there were, the Senate's proposal would not let a prisoner, languishing in his cage, pursue that right on habeas.  <br /><br />Second, there is no right to review of military commission sentences that are less than 10 years; any review of these cases is at the D.C. Circuit's discretion. Military commissions might regularly mete out sentences of just under ten years, to avoid review. In this way the Administration could protect convictions based on weak or unreliable evidence, or fraught with procedural error.  The more the Administration can stack the D.C. Circuit with "Executive-friendly" judges, the less likely there will be any discretionary reviews.<br /> <br />Third, the Senate proposal won't fix the problems of capturing and holding the wrong people (increasing the risk that real terrorists will slip away, and that the injustice will increase their ranks). A review limited to "Constitutional" problems will not reach evidentiary and procedural flaws that do not rise to that level but nonetheless cast doubt on the accuracy of a tribunal's verdict.  <br /><br />Fourth, the Senate's proposal will not fix the problem that, when convictions are easy, our investigators can shirk their duty to develop and sharpen their investigative skills.  The proposal, in fact, exacerbates this problem.<br /><br />Fifth, the proposal is also misguided in its effort to promote "GTMO tort reform": it bars prisoners' claims addressing their living conditions or treatment.  (One Senator called such cases "lawsuit abuse.")  The result? There will be no real deterrence against torture and other mistreatment.  The roundly applauded and overwhelmingly approved proposal by Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) to prohibit inhumane treatment of any person detained by the US will be reduced to an empty, feel-good gesture. It can't be enforced outside the courts. <br /><br />Limiting such "lawsuit abuse" might make Senators feel good, but it endangers the public.  Information &#8212; including baseless allegations &#8212; of torture and cruelty will slip through the bars of the GTMO cages, and travel to distan
t lands. Lacking a court as a forum, there will be no way for US officials to show that they aren't torturing captives. Our leaders' objections, promises and assurances to the world will fall flat. Resentment and anger against our country will rise.<br /><br />Perhaps most of all, the Senate's (and, for that matter, the Supreme Court's) distinction between US citizens and non-US citizens in the "war on terror" will ultimately collapse -- to the detriment of US citizens.   Why? Because it's an irrational distinction, based on the mere sentimentality of nationalism.  At some point, our leaders might decide that, if it's "necessary" in this "war" to deny the right to full judicial process and review for non-US citizens, it will be doubly necessary to deny these rights to US citizens suspected of terrorism. That's because American "enemy combatants" are much more dangerous than non-US citizens. Holding US passports, they can enter our country freely. They can blend in better than foreigners, and plot and plan undetected.   If there is, as 84 Senators seem to believe, a relationship between the level of danger a person poses and the amount of judicial process we should give him, then common sense says that US citizens who are "enemy combatants" should get the least process of all.  That's where the Senate's (and the Administration's) illogic is leading us, and it won't make us any safer.  <br /><br />We must recognize that using weak process, and preventing full and impartial review of GTMO tribunal decisions, is a wrongheaded plan that benefits no one but the politicians who are (all of a sudden) pushing it on us. Vigorous process is a powerful weapon for fighting elusive terrorists and their shadowy networks.  When it comes to protecting the public against terrorism, the Executive should not be left to its own flawed and dangerous devices.<br /><br />One of the most important pieces of legislation concerning our national security is now on its way to the House of Representatives.  Its members must step up and correct the Senate's mistake. <br /><br /><hr size=1><br />Also by Brian Foley:<br /><ul><li><a href="/forumy/2005/11/why-americans-dont-care-about-gtmo-and.php">Why Americans Don&#39;t Care About GTMO, and Why They Should</a><li><a href="/forumy/2005/10/guantanamo-process-as-public-danger.php">Guantanamo Process as a Public Danger</a></ul><hr size=1><em>Brian J.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.bancroftassociates.net/prof_wkeefer.htm">Wendy J. Keefer</a>, former senior counsel and chief of staff in the US Department of Justice Office of Legal Policy and now with Bancroft Associates in Washington DC, says that the US Senate should join the House in quickly approving reauthorization of the USA Patriot Act to secure both public safety and key civil liberties safeguards...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/wendykeefer.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>W</strong></font>ith the December 31st deadline looming, the time has come for Congress to approve legislation reauthorizing the critical provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act.  Both the House and Senate passed versions of a reauthorization package earlier this fall. Just recently the Conference Committee tasked with reconciling those bills announced its recommended legislation, entitled the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005.  The House Wednesday voted 251-174 to pass that recommended legislation.  But despite nine months of extensive debate about reauthorization, statements issued by many Senators suggest an intent to filibuster this important bill.  <br /><br />After four years with no verified abuses of its provisions and its proven effectiveness at preventing additional attacks in this country, it is time to stop playing politics with our national security. The legislation recommended by the Conference Committee strikes the right balance -- alleviating genuine, though in many cases unsubstantiated, fears about the original Act's impact on civil liberties while ensuring our law enforcement and intelligence agencies have the tools they need to combat terrorism.  <br /><br /> In October 2001, just six weeks after the September 11th attacks, Congress overwhelmingly, and with bipartisan support, passed the USA PATRIOT Act.  Undoubtedly, the quick passage of the Act may have seemed an exercise in legislative haste.  Yet at the heart of the Act was a paradigm shift that had been debated for years within the agencies impacted.  Great care was taken to craft legislation that would shift the paradigm within which law enforcement and intelligence agencies operated from one of prosecution to one of prevention.  That paradigm shift also required &#8212; and received &#8212; painstaking attention to ensuring any legal changes made preserved the very thing for which we are engaged in the war on terror and why we were attacked:  the preservation of civil liberties and freedom.<br /><br /> Recognizing the significance of the paradigm shift to be affected, in part, by this legislation, a decision was made to include for several provisions a four year sunset.  Though Congress has oversight even over laws with no sunset, sunsetting several provisions of the Act ensured a thorough review of the Executive Branch's use of those new tools and guaranteed a comprehensive public debate about our intervening experiences in this new kind of war.  Unless Congress &#8212; namely the Senate -- acts prior to December 31, these provisions automatically expire, making them unavailable tools for law enforcement and intelligence officers.  <br /><br /> The debate over these provisions has ensued since 2001.  This year alone &#8212; prompted by the reauthorization deadline &#8212; Congress has held 23 hearings and heard from over 60 witnesses.  This oversight confirms the good news about this legislation:  it has been critical to preventing terrorist attacks and there has been no verified abuse of its provisions.  Despite this successful record, the new legislation includes numerous additional privacy and civil liberties safeguards.  Whether these safeguards are actually required, they should provide the public with added comfort that the government is working to prevent terrorism without sacrificing our founding principles and privacy guarantees.<br /><br />No doubt the ensuing years between the Act's original passage and the current debate have identified provisions in need of clarification.  The present legislation provides the needed fix; there is no reason for further delay.<br /><br /> Several of the most controversial provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act are subject to new sunsets in the pending legislation.  An additional four-year sunset would be imposed on Section 206 &#8212; regarding roving wiretaps, Section 215 &#8212; often disappointingly referred to as the "library records" provision, and the "lone wolf" provision.  <br /><br />Amendments are expected in connection with Section 206.  In this age of disposable cell phones, satellite phones and constantly advancing communications technology, the original Act altered existing law to accommodate these new technologies.  Permitting "roving" wiretaps based on a description of the target but not specifically identifying the location or facilities to be targeted for surveillance, Section 206 gave investigators what was necessary to keep pace with the terrorists and the new technologies they use.  The primary concern with this section was the lack of specificity required in the identification of the individual to be targeted for surveillance.  The reauthorizing legislation, therefore, requires &#8212; where a positive identification cannot be provided &#8212; a description of the target that is sufficiently specific to ensure that only one person is indeed targeted.<br /><br />Similarly clarifications to Section 215 exist to clarify the scope of that provision.  Section 215, the business records provision, extended the authority of FISA courts to order production of business records to include any tangible item sought for an investigation to obtain foreign intelligence information.  Section 215 was limited in that it did not permit the issuance of such orders concerning U.S. persons or where the investigation was based solely on activities protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution.  <br /><br />Despite the safeguards included in the original provision, it is perhaps the most vilified part of the original Act.  For that reason, clarity has been sought as to the standard to be applied by the courts in determining whether to issue orders for the production of business records, which records may include but to date have never included actual library records.  The pending legislation provides the necessary clarity -- specifying that courts should only issue production orders where it is shown the documents or other tangible items sought are relevant to the foreign intelligence investigation.  <br /><br />In addition, as the original provision was intended to provide the same ability for intelligence investigators to gain information as has been held by grand juries in criminal investigations, the legislation would prohibit the issuance of court orders where the item sought could not be obtained by a grand jury subpoena.  Moreover, to alleviate the library concern, the sign-off of a high-level Justice Department official would be required before investigators could request a court order under this provision that would result in the production of certain sensitive records, including library records.<br /><br />The "lone wolf" provision permits the use of FISA surveillance, search and other authorities in the case of a foreign national &#8212; not a U.S. person &#8212; even where that individual may be engaging in international terrorist activities on behalf of a person or entity that does not constitute a "foreign power."  Prior to the 2001 change in this law, those such as al Qaeda members who sought to commit terrorist acts for that group rather than for a recognized foreign power could not be subjected to the same investigative techniques as state-sponsored terrorists.<br /><br />The types of changes that would be made to these and other provisions of the PATRIOT Act in the reauthorization legislation address concerns voiced about the Act since
its 2001 passage.  But none of these additional safeguards will be put in place without passage of the pending bill.  Perhaps more troubling, a failure to pass a reauthorization bill promises to halt and disrupt ongoing counter-terrorism activities and put the United States and her citizens at the same disadvantage in terms of technology and techniques that faced this country prior to September 11th.<br /><br />Delay is too dangerous a political maneuver in this stage of the political process.  The House has acted.  It is now time for the Senate to act to ensure no gap in America's safety and security.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Wendy J.

A number of separate developments seem to be converging toward that end.  Indeed, because the SCSL's funding expires at the end of 2005, he must be brought to trial soon if he is not to escape judgment for the crimes he committed in West Africa.<br /><br /><em>Background</em><br /><br />Created in January 2002 by a treaty between the United Nations and the government of Sierra Leone, the Special Court for Sierra Leone is charged with prosecuting "persons who bear the greatest responsibility for serious violations of international humanitarian law&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; committed in the territory of Sierra Leone since 30 November 1996, including those leaders who, in committing such crimes, have threatened the establishment of and implementation of the peace process in Sierra Leone." In March 2003, the SCSL Prosecutor indicted Charles Taylor for his role in arming and funding the Revolutionary United Front in the brutal decade-long conflict in Sierra Leone in which tens of thousands died and hundreds of thousands were violently abused and mutilated.<br /><br /><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 width=100%><tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" BGCOLOR=WHITE ALIGN=LEFT width=100%><tr><td><colspan=2 BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=1></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=3 BGCOLOR=345996><table CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=0><tr><td><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=4 HEIGHT=1><font SIZE=2 COLOR=WHITE FACE=Verdana style='font-size: 7pt'><strong>ALSO ON JURIST</strong></font></td><td ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=1%></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=30></td><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5><tr><td VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=EEEEEE><font SIZE=2 FACE=Arial style='font-size: 8pt'><img src="/s.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=1><br /><img src="/images/redarrow3gray.gif">&amp;nbsp;Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/warcrimes.php">War Crimes</a> | Topic: <a href="/currentawareness/sierraleone.php">Special Court for Sierra Leone</a> | Topic: <a  href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/countries/liberia.php">Liberia</a><br /></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td BGCOLOR=WHITE><img src="/images/s.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=100% VALIGN=LEFT></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br />As the Prosecutor stated in June 2004, shortly after the Special Court's Appeals Chamber ruled that head-of-state immunity does not bar proceedings against Taylor in an international criminal tribunal:<blockquote>Charles Taylor has been indicted for some of the worst criminal charges a human being can face, including terrorising the civilian population, unlawful killings, sexual violence, physical violence, forced conscription of child soldiers, abductions, forced labour, looting and burning, and attacks on peacekeeping personnel. The victims of this war, and all Sierra Leoneans who want a society governed by law, deserve to see Charles Taylor held to account... For the rule of law to take root around the world it must also apply to politically difficult and high profile cases.</blockquote>Since August 11, 2003, the day he resigned as President of Liberia, Taylor has been evading arrest in exile in Nigeria, where he was granted asylum by Nigeria's President and now lives in a villa on the southeastern coast. Although at the time, President Olusegun Obasanjo was acting in the interest of regional peace, in the view of observers such as <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/2005/sierraleone1105/">  Human Rights Watch</a>, "Nigeria's ongoing harboring of an indicted war criminal undermines the [Special Court's] ability to achieve its mandate."  <br /><br /><em>Developments in Liberia</em><br /><br />After fourteen years of civil war and a two-year period of transition, as of November, Liberia has elected a new President: Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, a Harvard-educated economist who has become the first woman elected head-of-state in Africa. Although she faces enormous challenges, her democratic election (guaranteed by UN peacekeepers) in early November has brought fresh hope to impoverished Liberia. One of her challenges is to move beyond the devastation &#8212; and the shadow cast by Taylor, who had once jailed Johnson-Sirleaf when she ran against him. In July, Liberia&#39;s transitional President Gyude Bryant, President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah of Sierra Leone and Guinean Prime Minister Cellou Diallo jointly alleged that Taylor was still haunting West Africa, including by attempting earlier in the year to assassinate Guinean head-of-state Lansana Cont&eacute; in revenge for backing the Liberian insurgency group, LURD. Indeed, the NGO Coalition for International Justice had reported that Taylor was spending some of the millions of dollars he had looted to interfere in Liberia&#39;s presidential election by backing some of the first-round candidates.<br /><br /> When asked about Taylor, Johnson-Sirleaf said this week: "Allow me to have consultations with West African leaders, whom I am visiting, to take guidance from them before we take a position on that."<br /><br /><em>Developments in the United States</em><br /><br /> In a <a href="http://usinfo.state.gov/af/Archive/2005/Dec/01-100513.html"> phone call congratulating Johnson-Sirleaf </a> on her election, President George W. Bush referred to the U.S. "commitment and support to help build a democratic, secure and prosperous Liberia" and conveyed his view of the importance of bringing former Liberian leader Charles Taylor to justice so that "he can no longer threaten the people of Liberia and the region of West Africa." This seems to reflect a change over previous Administration policy on Taylor, which had equivocated, at best, on hid surrender to the SCSL.<br /><br /> Meanwhile, U.S. Representative Ed Royce (R-CA-40), vice-chair (and former chair) of the House Subcommittee on Africa, also wrote President-Elect Johnson-Sirleaf, urging her to call for the Nigerian government to deliver Mr. Taylor immediately to the Special Court, "so that justice can be done and Liberia can enjoy better prospects for prosperity... as long as Mr. Taylor continues to enjoy safe harbor &#8212; while remaining active in Liberian politics from a distance &#8212; the livelihoods and democratic rights of millions of West Africans, and the post-war re-construction of Liberia and Sierra Leone, will remain at risk."  In the spring of 2005, a bipartisan letter from eight Senators (Leahy, Gregg, Specter, Feingold, DeWine, Reed, Chafee and Durbin) to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called for the U.S. to seek the transfer of Charles Taylor from Nigeria to the Court "as soon as possible."<br /><br />Shortly after the Liberian election, Congress adopted a <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_bills&docid=f:h3057enr.txt.pdf"> foreign operations appropriations</a> act, H.R. 3057, that contains language (section 59
0 on War Crimes in Africa) restricting certain foreign assistance to countries in which persons indicted by the SCSL, as well as the ICTR, are living but where the central government is not cooperating with the indictees' surrender. Moreover, it states that:<blockquote>the United States shall use its voice and vote in the United Nations Security Council to fully support efforts by [the ICTR and the] SCSL to bring to justice individuals indicted by such tribunals in a timely manner;</blockquote>and<blockquote>assistance may be made available for the central Government of Nigeria after 120 days following enactment of this Act only if the President submits a report to the Committees on Appropriations...on: (1) the steps taken...to obtain the cooperation of the Government of Nigeria in surrendering Charles Taylor to the SCSL; and (2) a strategy, including a timeline, for bringing Charles Taylor before the SCSL.</blockquote>The Act also contributes another $13 million to the budget of the Special Court.   <br /><br /><em>Developments in Nigeria</em><br /><br /> Perhaps the most interesting developments have occurred in the Nigerian judicial system. In early November, a Nigerian federal court dismissed procedural and political objections by the government, which had tried to stop a review of Taylor's political asylum. Two Nigerian businessmen, whose hands had been amputated by the Taylor-supported Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone, had filed the case seeking to quash Taylor's asylum. The court held that the plaintiffs had suffered irreparable injury by their amputations and that the sanctuary granted Taylor in Nigeria constituted a continuing harm to them.<br /> <br /> While the case is appealed, Taylor's future depends on Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, who has repeatedly said he will consider an extradition request if made by an elected Liberian government.<br /><br /><em>Developments in the United Nations</em><br /><br /> On the same day in November as the Liberian elections, the UN Security Council, acting under Chapter VII, expanded the mandate of UNMIL, the United Nations Mission in Liberia, to include apprehending and detaining Charles Taylor in the event he returns to Liberia and to facilitate his transfer to Sierra Leone for prosecution before the Special Court. While determining that his return to Liberia would constitute an impediment to stability and a threat to the peace of Liberia and the region, <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/unsc_resolutions05.htm">Resolution 1638</a> expressed its appreciation to Nigeria and President Obasanjo for their contributions to restoring stability in Liberia and West Africa but pointedly referred to Taylor's asylum as a "temporary stay" in Nigeria. This followed on Security Council concerns in October 2003  that Taylor was continuing from exile to destabilize Liberia, and an August 2004 travel ban that it imposed on certain Liberian officials for their alleged roles as couriers for Taylor.<br /><br /><em>What Should Happen Now</em><br /><br /> The dots are easily connected. In mid-January, Johnson-Sirleaf will take office as President of Liberia. Her first official act should be a request to Nigeria to extradite Taylor.  UNMIL, with the Security Council's blessing, could take custody of Taylor at the Monrovia Airport and immediately transfer him to the Special Court. The indicted warlord need never step foot again on Liberian soil.<br /><br /> The weak link in this short chain could be President Obasanjo of Nigeria, who so far has hesitated to surrender Taylor, despite international outreach to him. The Security Council should formally urge Nigeria to turn him over, emphasizing these points:<ol><li>International criminal law increasingly discourages impunity for indicted war criminals, including former heads of state;<br /><br /><li>While President Obasanjo's 2003 peace-seeking gesture to accept Taylor was appreciated but temporary, and international refugee law prohibits the granting of asylum to indicted war criminals; and<br /><br /><li>Allowing Charles Taylor to continue evading the jurisdiction of the SCSL would constitute impermissible impunity, would constitute a threat to the peace and security of West Africa, and undermine the new democratic government in Liberia.</ol>The victims of Sierra Leone's civil war are entitled to have justice done in the case of Charles Taylor by a fair trial before the SCSL.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Donna Arzt is Dean&#39;s Distinguished Research Scholar and Director of the Center for Global Law &amp; Practice at Syracuse University College of Law</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/main.asp?PID=34">Jordan Paust</a> of the University of Houston Law Center says that repeated protestations from President Bush, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and other US administration officials that &quot;we do not torture&quot; miss the point that the US has by any meaningful standard engaged in illegal cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of prisoners and needs to change course urgently...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT><tr><td><img src="/forumy/paust.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table><font SIZE=3><b>W</strong></font>hether or not they technically constitute "torture" or "violence to life and person" within the meaning of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, it is quite clear that what we saw in photos from Abu Ghraib were patently illegal forms of treatment of human beings detained during war.  For example, stripping persons naked, hooding them for interrogation purposes and using dogs to intimidate and even terrorize are among tactics and treatment of detainees of any status that are clearly proscribed.  Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions prohibits not merely torture, but also any cruel, inhuman, degrading, and humiliating treatment of a detainee "in all circumstances."  Such conduct during any armed conflict is a war crime regardless of purpose or feigned excuses on the basis of reciprocity, reprisals, or alleged necessity.  There are no exceptions and there is no immunity.  The same absolute prohibitions exist under human rights treaties that the United States has ratified and customary human rights law in time of war or relative peace. <br /><br />Recently, US Attorney General Gonzales claimed that what we saw in the photos was not approved, but we can't believe Alberto Gonzales.  Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld authorized the stripping of persons naked, use of dogs, and hooding as interrogation tactics in an action memo on December 2, 2002 and in another memo on April 16, 2003, adding that if additional interrogation techniques for a particular detainee were required he might approve them upon written request.  There is no indication that his 2003 illegal authorization has been withdrawn.  We can't trust Donald Rumsfeld.  Moreover, Brigadier General Janis Karpinski stated in August of this year that after Major General Miller was sent to Iraq to GITMOize interrogation tactics a Rumsfeld memo was posted on a pole outside at Abu Ghraib and that it authorized the use of dogs for interrogation.  <br /><br />Other malevolent memos abetting a common plan to deny rights under the laws of war and nonderogable human rights law made their appearance in the Department of Justice, the Office of the White House Counsel (by Gonzales), the Department of Defense, and some report, the Central Intelligence Agency.  "Water boarding" to produce a terrifying fear of drowning, CIA Director Goss opines, is not "torture" but merely an approved "professional interrogation technique."  We can't trust Porter Goss.  For more than two years, "torture" was redefined in the Bybee DOJ memo to require pain involving death, permanent organ failure, or loss of a significant body function.  The falsehood fooled no one when it finally came to light.<br /><br /> Among the illegal orders and authorizations of President Bush that have not been withdrawn is a February 7, 2002 memorandum authorizing the denial of legal rights and protections under the Geneva Conventions.  The presidential memo has ordered humane treatment of detainees merely "in a manner consistent with the principles of Geneva" as opposed to the well-known requirements of Geneva law and then only "to the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity," despite the fact it is not "appropriate" to deny absolute rights and protections required by Geneva law and alleged military necessity does not justify the denial of required treatment.  Necessarily, the 2002 memo authorized and ordered the denial of rights and treatment required by the Geneva Conventions and, therefore, necessarily authorized and ordered violations of the Conventions, and violations of the Conventions are war crimes.  After all of the revelations concerning illegal interrogation and treatment of detainees, we know of no corrective order by the President.<br />  <br /> Instead, we hear the President, Vice President, Attorney General, and most recently Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on her recent trip to Europe canting "We do not torture," as if that is all that is proscribed &#8212; even when pressed by savvy reporters who dare to ask, "But what about cruel, inhuman, degrading, or humiliating treatment?"  Secretary Rice also tried to get Europeans to focus merely on the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), with attempted U.S. reservations and understandings that are clearly inconsistent with the object and purpose of the treaty and, thus, void ab initio as a matter of law.  In any event, European countries are bound to refuse to be complicit in violations of the laws of war and various human rights treaties, including the European Convention.  While outside the reach of Cheney, Addington, Rumsfeld, and Gonzales and while pressed by Europeans, Secretary Rice announced that, "as a matter of U.S. policy," cruel and inhuman treatment under the CAT will no longer be allowed and that despite prior interpretive games the Executive branch interprets the law like the European countries.  But does Condi speak for the President?  Will she openly affirm that the same forms of illegal treatment are proscribed under Geneva law, several human rights treaties, and customary international law? <br />  <br /> Mr. President, we and much of the rest of humanity simply do not believe you or the Vice President, especially when both of you have openly resisted the McCain amendment that was approved by a 90 to 9 vote of the United States Senate to merely reaffirm the absolute ban on torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment of any detainee in U.S. custody or control and you tolerate stripping human beings naked and hooding them, use of dogs, "cold cells," and water boarding, among other illegal tactics.  By the way, your pardon power expressly applies only with respect to offenses against the United States as such and not to international crimes.<br /><br /> More generally, war crimes policies and authorizations are not merely a threat to constitutional government and our democracy.  They also degrade our military, place our soldiers and CIA personnel in harms way, thwart our mission, and deflate our authority abroad.  They can embolden an enemy, serve as a terrorist recruitment tool, and fulfill other terrorist ambitions.<br /> <br /><br /><em>Jordan Paust is the Mike &amp; Teresa Baker Law Center Professor at the University of Houston and a former Captain, U.S. Army JAGC and member of the faculty at the Judge Advocate General's School (1969-1973).

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://culaw2.creighton.edu/index.aspx?p=1201&sp=26">Michael Kelly</a> of Creighton University School of Law says that the International Court of Justice ruling in <em>Congo v. Uganda</em> is a victory for sovereignty doctrine coming just as recent reversals for involuntary sovereignty waiver theory point towards revitalization of the classic legal doctrine governing the law of nations...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/kellyupdated.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>T</strong></font>he International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled on December 19th that sovereignty still matters.  In a multi-layered opinion, the ICJ held that Uganda violated Congo's sovereignty by invading it, occupying territory in Ituri, and providing military, financial, and logistical support to anti-Kabila Congolese rebels within the country between 1998 and 2002.  The Court <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/ipresscom/ipress2005/ipresscom2005-26_co_20051219.htm">identified</a> the specific provisions of international law violated in this case as "the principle of non-use of force in international relations and the principle of non-intervention."  <br /><br />The Court also held that Uganda was responsible for the looting of resource-rich eastern Congo (gold, diamonds and silver) and for human rights abuses carried out by Ugandan armed forces (killings, torture and training child soldiers) during this period of conflict that claimed 4 million lives, and that Uganda was required to pay reparations to Congo.  However, the Court also held that Congo was responsible for attacks by Congolese armed forces on the Ugandan embassy and its diplomatic staff in Kinshasa and Ndjili Airport, and that Congo was required to pay reparations to Uganda for its conduct in violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.<br /><br />While the human rights and anti-looting aspects of the World Court's decision are important in their own right as restatements of international law in this area, it is the Court's endorsement of sovereignty's continued vitality in international law that comes at a most critical time.  Sovereignty is the foundation of the international legal system and, at least conceptually, is the fountainhead from which rights and duties like non-intervention, diplomatic immunity, and state equality spring.  Sovereignty's fusion with the state system harkens back to the 1648 Peace of Westphalia and those derivative Westphalian principles enjoy currency in various provisions of the Charter of the United Nations.<br /><br />During the latter 20th century, sovereignty began to seriously erode on several tracks with the gradual rise of new international law doctrines permitting non-U.N. authorized humanitarian intervention in the internal affairs of states and  prosecution of former heads of state for crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide.  The rise of multilateral trading regimes like the WTO, NAFTA and within the European Union even witnessed the voluntary waiver of sovereignty in exchange for the benefits of free trade.  But the post-9/11 impetus toward involuntary sovereignty waiver is the dynamic that the ICJ appears to be rejecting in <em>Democratic Republic of Congo v. Uganda</em>.<br /><br />Although it had been kicked around in the abstract for some years, the theory of involuntary sovereignty waiver found articulation in U.S. government policy when it was given life by Secretary of State Colin Powell's Director of Policy Planning, Richard N. Haass, in a <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/p/rem/2003/16648.htm">policy speech</a> at Georgetown University on January 14, 2003. Haass proposed that states effectively waive their sovereign rights against non-U.N. authorized intervention in their internal affairs by other states in three instances:  when they commit genocide within their borders, pursue weapons of mass destruction, or harbor terrorists.  <br /><br />Leading up to the invasion of Iraq later that year, acceptance of the U.S. government's new policy appeared to give Washington a trifecta of rationales allowing the invasion of Iraq to go forward, coupled with a resurrection of the old pre-emptive strike doctrine as a means to <a href="http://www.law.fsu.edu/journals/transnational/vol13_1/kelly.pdf">effectuate this new policy</a>.  Unable to secure the Security Council's authorization to intervene, the Bush Administration desperately needed to wedge open international law and insert new policy prerogatives and doctrines to justify what, according to the Charter, would be a technically illegal war.<br /><br />The world's resistance to this redirection of international law (including the resistance of many U.S. allies) perhaps foreshadowed the ICJ's opinion in <em>Congo v. Uganda</em> upholding sovereignty principles and buttressing against further erosion of border inviolability and non-intervention rules.  Dr. Haass is now president of the Council on Foreign Relations, and has, since returning to private life, made his qualms about invading Iraq well-known, which leads me to believe that his realist foreign policy theory might have been hijacked by neo-conservatives for use in Iraq.  Indeed, the central core of his policy outline provides perfect justification for moving neo-conservative foreign policy objectives down the field:<br /><br />"In all three of the situations . . . &#8212; stopping genocide, fighting terrorism, and preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction &#8212; the principle remains the same: With rights come obligations. Sovereignty is not absolute. It is conditional. When states violate minimum standards by committing, permitting, or threatening intolerable acts against their own people or other nations, then some of the privileges of sovereignty are forfeited."<br /><br />That said, due to the winnowing of neo-conservative voices within the second Bush Administration (perhaps due in turn to the massive failure of the Iraq occupation), Haass' theory may have died along with their influence.  That, in turn, could be the practical end of involuntary sovereignty waiver theory instead of the more formal pronouncement by the World Court.<br />   <br /><br /><em>Michael J. Kelly is Associate Professor of Law at Creighton University School of Law in Omaha, Nebraska.  He is author of the forthcoming article &quot;Pulling at the Threads of Westphalia:  Involuntary Sovereignty Waiver, Revolutionary International Legal Theory or Return to Rule by the Great Powers?,&quot; 10 <em>UCLA Journal of International Law &amp; Foreign Affairs</em> (Fall 2005), and the book <em>Nowhere to Hide:  Defeat of the Sovereign Immunity Defense for Crimes of Genocide &amp; the Trials of Slobodan Milosevic and Saddam Hussein</em> (Peter Lang Publishers 2005) with a foreword by Desmond Tutu. </em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.fsu.edu/faculty/profiles/sgey.html">Stephen Gey</a> of Florida State University College of Law says that the most important aspect of US District Judge John E. Jones III&#39;s <em>Kitzmiller</em> ruling on the teaching of &quot;intelligent design&quot; is not its constitutional analysis, but its meticulous demonstration that ID is sham science ...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/gey.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>L</strong></font>ast week the science community in the United States got an early Christmas present from federal district court Judge John E. Jones III.  In a comprehensive 139-page opinion in <em>Kitzmiller v. Dover School District</em>, Judge Jones held as a matter of law what scientists have been saying publicly for years:  that "Intelligent Design" is little more than a slightly disguised version of the old time religion of creationism, and that as such it may not be taught in public school classrooms.  <br /><br />This is not the first time that a court has had to explain why the religious doctrine of creationism does not belong in a science class.  During the last forty years the US Supreme Court and lower federal courts repeatedly have rejected attempts to insert religious creation stories into public school science classes.  In one sense, therefore, <em>Kitzmiller</em> is merely the latest in a long line of creationist losses in the courts.  But even if the result was predictable, Judge Jones' extraordinary opinion in <em>Kitzmiller</em> has three distinctive features that make it one of the most important of all the creationism decisions. <br /><br />The first distinctive aspect of Judge Jones' opinion is his willingness to go beyond the courts' usual narrow approach to creationism cases.  Most judicial opinions prohibiting the introduction of creationism into public school science curricula take the simplest approach by focusing on the unmistakably religious purpose behind such efforts.  By favoring this approach, the courts have followed the Supreme Court's lead.  In both <em>Epperson v. Arkansas</em> (1968) and <em>Edwards v. Aguillard</em> (1987), the Supreme Court struck down creationism mandates on the ground that the government officials imposing the mandates were motivated primarily by religious purposes.  <br /><br />The courts prefer to focus on the government's purpose because this approach allows them to avoid rendering a detailed description of why creationist ideas are inherently religious.  Unfortunately, by focusing on the government's purpose instead of the nature of the creationist ideas themselves, the courts have limited the scope of their opinions and invited creationism proponents to introduce new mandates backed by "clean" legislative records that are carefully constructed to avoid references to the government's religious purpose.  <br /><br />In <em>Kitzmiller</em>, Judge Jones based his decision that the Dover ID policy was unconstitutional partly on the usual ground that the board was motivated by religious purposes.  The defendants gave Judge Jones a great deal of material to support his ruling on this issue.  There was abundant evidence that the Dover school board's decision to introduce ID into the science curriculum was motivated by several board members' religious views, and additional evidence that board members disingenuously tried to deny their true intent.  As Judge Jones noted, several board members "would time and again lie to cover their tracks and disguise the real purpose behind the ID Policy."  <br /><br />The striking thing about Judge Jones' <em>Kitzmiller</em> opinion is that the judge did not stop with the determination that the Dover school board acted with an impermissible religious motive.  Judge Jones went on to hold that the inclusion of ID in the science curriculum had an impermissible religious effect and illegally conveyed the government's endorsement of religion.  These are daunting issues in ID cases because to decide these issues a judge has to assess whether in addition to its obvious religious components, ID has any independent validity as science.  Judge Jones undertook this task with relish, and his detailed findings on the scientific bona fides of ID are the second distinctive portion of his opinion.  The critique of ID and science is the most important part of the <em>Kitzmiller</em> opinion, because Judge Jones' analysis and ultimate conclusion probably drives a stake into the heart of the ID proponents' crusade to circumvent the Establishment Clause.<br /><br />The <em>Kitzmiller</em> trial featured weeks of expert testimony from some of the leading lights of the ID movement as well as leading mainstream scientists.  Ever since ID became the primary stalking horse for the introduction of creationism into science classrooms, the centerpiece of the ID project has been to pass the doctrine off as an equally plausible secular alternative to mainstream science.  ID proponents frequently try to conscript the likes of Thomas Kuhn in defense of their cause, arguing that ID is a revolutionary paradigm shift in the approach to biological sciences, analogous to the development of the big bang theory in cosmology.  <br /><br />The problem with this effort is that ID, by its own terms, rejects the fundamental structure of modern scientific practice and theory&acirc;&#8364;&#8221;a structure defined at every step by methodological naturalism.  In <em>Kitzmiller</em>, Judge Jones meticulously described the extent to which ID proponents reject the most basic premises of the modern scientific enterprise by insisting that supernatural explanations must now count for science alongside the naturalistic factual inquiries that Kuhn and other philosophers of science assert will periodically lead to radical shifts in the direction of scientific research.  Expanding the current conception of science to include unquestioned and untestable supernatural explanations for natural phenomena could be described as a "paradigm shift," but it is hardly the sort of shift that Thomas Kuhn had in mind.  In the end, Judge Jones summed up the expert testimony nicely:  "ID is at best 'fringe science' which has achieved no acceptance in the scientific community."  <br /><br />This conclusion will come as no surprise to members of the mainstream scientific community.  ID has produced no testable theories, no independent research, no significant discoveries, and nothing of importance to those outside the religious community that takes to heart ID's theological premises.  Judge Jones did everyone a great service by detailing the many reasons that ID fails as science.  After <em>Kitzmiller</em>, the ID effort to recast creationism as serious science is effectively dead.  The clear implication of this holding is that attempts to inject ID into public school curricula will always be unconstitutional, regardless of whether these attempts are accompanied by disingenuous assertions of a secular purpose by the relevant educational authorities.  <br /><br />The third distinctive part of Judge Jones' opinion is its tone.  Judge Jones' delivered some very harsh conclusions about the Dover school board's efforts to advance ID as science.  According to the judge, "The breathtaking inanity of the Board's decision is evident when considered against the factual backdrop which has now been fully revealed through this trial."  The school board's efforts resulted in an "utter waste of monetary and personal resources."  The same conclusions will apply to any other school board that buys into the ID project.  Although these statements by the judge have been criticized by ID proponents, the truth is that for the first time a judge has uttered in a formal capacity what the scientific community has known all along:  the ID claims for scientific legitimacy are not just a sham (as the Supreme Court once described an earli
er argument for creationism), but also a scam.  <br /><br />One of the most entertaining portions of the Kitzmiller trial was when ID stalwart Michael Behe explained under cross-examination that under the ID version of science astrology would count as science.  At this point in the testimony, the ID claim to be treated as an authentic scientific endeavor effectively collapsed.  If we learn nothing else from <em>Kitzmiller</em>, it is that we should stop taking arguments on behalf of ID and creationism seriously outside their theological context.  The earth is not flat, the moon is not made of green cheese, astrology is not science, ID does not belong in a science class, and we should stop pretending that any of these propositions are worthy of serious debate.  <br />    <br /><br /><em>Stephen G.

Bush and US Attorney General Alberto Gonzales claim that domestic spying in manifest violation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) was authorized by Congress in broad language in the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) regarding persons responsible for the 9/11 attacks.  Similar claims have been made in a December 22 letter from Assistant Attorney General William Moschella to the leaders of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees.  The claims are patently false.<br /><br /> First, there is no persuasive evidence that when passing the AUMF Congress intended to override either criminal or other provisions of the FISA requiring Executive compliance with the FISA process for foreign intelligence surveillance.  Second, the AUMF contains no express or implied authorization concerning intelligence surveillance either abroad or within the United States.  With respect to Executive action against certain persons, the purpose of the AUMF is clearly contained in the authorization to use merely "necessary and appropriate force" against those "nations, organizations, or persons" that "planned, authorized, committed, or aided" the 9/11 terrorist attacks as such or that "harbored such ... persons."  The authorization of appropriate "force" is not an authorization to torture or to use cruel, inhuman, degrading, or humiliating treatment against any human being; it is not an authorization to create military commissions that are otherwise without jurisdiction under constitutional and international law and violate due process; and it is certainly not an authorization to spy on persons within the United States.  Moreover, Congress has only authorized use of "appropriate" force.  The word "appropriate" creates a statutory limitation that necessarily requires Executive compliance with relevant constitutional, international, and other federal laws, especially since Supreme Court opinions have long recognized that relevant international law and prior federal statutes are a necessary background more generally for interpretation of newer federal statutes.<br />  <br /> Indeed, under  Article II, Section 3 of our Constitution the President has an express and unavoidable duty to faithfully execute the "Laws" and has no power to violate them.  As Richard Nixon learned, presidential authorizations to violate the law are, in the words of the House Judiciary Committee, "subversive of constitutional government."  Additionally, since 1800 Supreme Court opinions have recognized the power of Congress to limit certain Commander in Chief powers during actual war (see, e.g., 43 <em>Colum. J. Transnat'l L.</em> 811, 842 n.114 (2005)), such as the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, but the Commander in Chief power does not apply outside of an actual war and the United States cannot be at "war" with al Qaeda as such (see, e.g., 28 <em>Yale J. Int'l L.</em> 325, 326-28 (2003)).  In his letter Assistant Attorney General Moschella seriously misread the <em>Prize Cases</em> (1863) by ignoring the fact that the Supreme Court expressly referred to two early federal statutes that "authorized ... [and] bound" the President, demonstrating another instance of congressional power to regulate portions of the Commander-in-Chief power even during actual war.  Moreover, any so-called inherent presidential authority to spy on Americans at home (perhaps of the kind denounced in <em>Youngstown</em> (1952) and which no strict constructionist should pretend to recognize), has been clearly limited in the FISA in 18 U.S.C. &Acirc;&#167; 2511(2)(f) and 50 U.S.C. &Acirc;&#167; 1809(a)(1), as supplemented by the criminal provisions in 18 U.S.C. &Acirc;&#167; 2511(1).<br /><br /> Third, whatever authorizations exist in the AUMF to use force, it is evident that they are restricted in two important respects.  The first restriction is recognizable in language reflecting past events.  The words "planned, authorized, committed, or aided" refer to the past and more specifically merely to the events of 9/11.  The word "harbored" is also oriented in the past.  Congress may have neglected certain future dangers to the United States, but neither the President nor the courts have constitutional authority to rewrite congressional legislation.  The second restriction is more significant.  With respect to the persons against whom appropriate force can be directed, the authorization is expressly and unavoidably tied to those who "planned, authorized, committed, or aided" the 9/11 attacks as such or who "harbored such ... persons."  What is not covered by the language of the AUMF is use of appropriate force against those who merely have, in the President's words, "known links" with al Qaeda and in Assistant Attorney General Moschella's words, links with "an affiliated terrorist organization" (whatever the Orwellian limits of those phrases might imply).  Also not covered are misguided persons who merely sympathize with the 9/11 terrorists, all persons who pose "a threat of future terrorist attacks," or persons who simply communicate with them.<br />  <br /> The FISA provides an appropriate national security tool for spying on transnational communications with the 9/11 and other terrorists.  The AUMF does not do so and offers no aid for presidents and others who undertake domestic spying - or for that matter torture or unconstitutional military commissions - in violation of the laws of the United States:<blockquote>No man in this country is so high that he is above the law.  No officer of the law may set that law at defiance with impunity.  All the officers of the government, from the highest to the lowest, are creatures of the law, and are bound to obey it.  It is the only supreme power in our system of government....</blockquote><em>United States v. Lee</em> (1882).<br /><br /><br /><em>Jordan Paust is the Mike &amp; Teresa Baker Law Center Professor at the University of Houston and a former Captain, U.S. Army JAGC and member of the faculty at the Judge Advocate General's School (1969-1973).

		<title>Blind Ambition?  Civil Rights and Supreme Court Nominees</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.umaryland.edu/faculty_profile.asp?facultynum=069">Sherrilyn Ifill</a> of the University of Maryland School of Law says that US Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito has some serious explaining to do over positions on civil rights issues he took as a young and ambitious lawyer in the Reagan administration...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/ifill.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>W</strong></font>hen the draft records of President Bill Clinton were made public during his 1992 run for the presidency, a letter written during the Vietnam War by the then-twenty-something-year-old Arkansan to his draft board surfaced.  In it the future president explained that he didn't want to dodge the draft outright because to do so might imperil his "political viability."  To most Americans, there was something chilling and unsettling about hearing such a young man during the heady and free-spirited days of the 1960s, calculate how his position on the war (where no doubt many of his boyhood friends were fighting and dying) would affect his political future.  But the calculation in that letter demonstrated that as even as a young man Clinton had been what as a Presidential candidate he was showing himself to be &#8212; a committed, skilled and ambitious politician who kept his eye on the prize.  In this sense, voters could take Clinton's youthful display of ambition as confirmation that the soon-to-be President was hard-wired to be a master politician.<br />  <br />But when a nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court suggests that earlier, potentially problematic positions he advocated as a young lawyer reflected his desire to get ahead in his career, we should not be so sanguine.  We should be particularly concerned when the positions articulated earlier in the nominee's career suggest hostility to the promotion of civil rights or to the vigorous enforcement of civil rights laws.<br /><br />Judge Samuel Alito is the third consecutive Supreme Court nominee to try and explain away potentially troublesome positions on civil rights issues as reflecting either loyal support for the views of the Administration in which they served, or an embellishment designed to advance their political careers.  Fourteen years ago Judge Clarence Thomas assured members of the Judiciary Committee that they needn't worry about earlier positions he'd taken on civil rights and other matters as a member of the Reagan Administration.  As a judge, Thomas contended that he'd "stripped down like a runner," leaving behind earlier, more strident political views to take on the neutrality of a judge.<br /><br />This past summer nominee (now Chief Justice) John Roberts explained away a joke he'd made at the expense of Mexican Americans and comments he'd made about women working outside the home in internal memoranda he'd written while a Department of Justice lawyer, as part of his effort to ensure that memos he wrote were read and received positively by his superiors and colleagues.  If telling a joke (even an off-color one) would enliven the atmosphere of the office and help get his substantive points across, then why not?  Roberts also explained away his firmly articulated positions against an expansive interpretation of the 1982 amendments to the Voting Rights Act as merely reflective of the position of the Administration in which he served. <br /> <br />Now Judge Alito explains statements he made in a letter accompanying an application for a job as Deputy Attorney General in 1985 as the product of his ambition.  In the letter accompanying his application, Alito derided what he termed "racial quotas" and expressed "particular pride" in having taking positions as a Department of Justice lawyer calculated to undermine what he regarded as "disturbing" decisions of the Warren Court.  "I was trying to get a job, a political job," Alito reportedly told Sen. Dianne Feinstein several weeks ago.  Judge Alito's 1985 decision to keep his nominal membership in the organization Concerned Alumni of Princeton (CAP) on his resume, is presumably also covered by the "ambition" explanation.  CAP publicly denounced what its members regarded as the "lowering of standards" in Princeton's admissions policies, ostensibly designed to bring more women and racial minorities into the University.  The belief that racial minorities and women were changing Princeton (to the University's detriment) was apparently precisely what the alumni who belonged to this organization were most concerned about, a fact that reportedly would have been known by the conservative <em>cognoscenti</em> vetting resumes in the Reagan Administration.  <br /><br /> No issue has been important and more divisive in American law and life than civil rights.  For this reason the American public has a right to know that any nominee for our Supreme Court understands that the post-Civil war amendments to the Constitution and the passage of mid-20th century civil rights laws reflect this country's commitment to erasing the stain of slavery and the enduring power of racial discrimination in public life.  When a nominee's record suggests that he holds belief that would inhibit a robust interpretation of civil rights laws, then it is the obligation of the Judiciary Committee to subject that nominee to vigorous and pointed questioning to determine where the nominee stands on these issues.  More importantly, the American public must know whether the nominee understands the consequences for this nation of reversing the halting progress we've made towards fulfilling the promise of the 13th 14th, and 15th amendments to the Constitution.<br />  <br />That Judge Alito has cited his own ambition as the reason for the statements he made in his 1985 job application, should make the Committee even more vigorous in its questioning.   Why should we believe that Judge Alito is less inclined today to tailor his statements about civil rights to appeal to the hiring team on the Judiciary Committee, than he was to appeal to the vetting team in the Reagan White House in 1985?  Justice Thomas' record on the Court has given the Committee reason to be cynical.  Despite Thomas' confirmation hearing vow to "strip down like a runner," his hard-right jurisprudence on civil rights matters over the past 14 years has been alarmingly consistent with the positions advocated in his pre-judicial career in the Reagan Administration. <br />  <br />In the upcoming confirmation hearings, the Judiciary Committee must not give short shrift to civil rights questions.  Judge Alito has some explaining to do.  Neither platitudes about the purported magical powers of the black robe, nor self-serving nods to youth and ambition should satisfy the Committee.  Nor should the Committee be moved by Judge Alito's recent account of his father's 1935 stance against discrimination on a college basketball team.  How is this story responsive to the public's legitimate concerns about Judge Alito's interpretation of our civil rights laws?   Are we simply meant to believe that if the old adage is true and the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, we have no reason to be concerned about how Judge Alito will approach civil rights laws?  Certainly a 55 year-old lawyer and judge of Alito's stature should be able to point to something in his own professional record or life, rather than his father's, to demonstrate his commitment to non-discrimination and civil rights.  The American public has a right to know where this nominee stands on bedrock civil rights questions.  <br /><br /><br /><em>Sherrilyn Ifill is a civil rights lawyer and law professor at the University of Maryland School of Law</em><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.umaryland.edu/faculty_profile.asp?facultynum=415">Chandra Lekha Sriram</a>, Chair of Human Rights at the University of East London School of Law (UK) currently visiting at the University of Maryland School of Law, says that tensions between Europe and the US over American rendition policy and practice reveal a disturbing cultural chasm over the perceived significance of human rights obligations...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/chandra.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>W</strong></font>hen Louise Arbour, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, stated on International Human Rights Day that international human rights law was a <a href="http://webcast.un.org/ramgen/pressconference/pc051207am.rm">casualty of the so-called war on terrorism</a> [recorded video], one might have expected the United States, a self-styled "champion" of human rights and democracy globally, to take notice.  But since it was US policy at issue - specifically, attempts by US policymakers to redefine torture to make virtually any act permissible and to redefine and limit the range of persons protected by international humanitarian law - US criticism was turned not on the torturers, but on Arbour. US Ambassador to the UN John Bolton <a href="http://webcast.un.org/ramgen/sc/so051207am1.rm">immediately denounced Arbour's critique as illegitimate and inappropriate</a> [recorded video], notwithstanding her position as the senior international civil servant for human rights and a highly-respected jurist. <br /><br />The Bush Administration's attempts to redefine human rights and its own humanitarian obligations put it squarely on a collision course with European countries even before news of secret prisons in Europe and the use of European airports and airspace for the transfer of rendered persons emerged earlier this month.  US attempts at redefinition and obfuscation reveal a cultural chasm; European countries take their human rights obligations seriously, not as mere annoyances to be shelved when national security is at risk, but as serious constraints to be respected by law-abiding nations.  By contrast, the debate in the US suggests a view that human rights obligations constitute unjustified interference by lawyers into the important business of fighting terrorism.<br /> <br />The divide between Europe and the US concerns the interpretation and application of the 1984 <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/h_cat39.htm">Convention against Torture</a> [text], but it runs even deeper, as proscriptions against torture have become more legally entrenched and elaborated in Europe, thanks to the work of the European Court of Human Rights. In analyzing analogous language in the European Convention on Human Rights, the European Court has been quite clear: it is simply impermissible to deport or otherwise remove a person to a country where she might be tortured. The outrage of Europeans, ranging from the German and British leaders to EU members of Parliament, has forced US Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice to clarify US policy on torture: the United States, she said on her recent European trip, does not transport terrorism suspects &quot;for the purpose of interrogation using torture&quot; and &quot;will not transport anyone to a country when we believe he will be tortured.&quot;  She further indicated that the US sought reassurances from countries to which suspects have been rendered that these detainees will not be tortured.<br /><br />This is, however, insufficient to meet US obligations under the Torture Convention, or to guarantee that suspects will not actually be tortured.  Rice's pronouncements amount to sheer formalism designed to absolve the US of responsibility for torture. European countries, like the US, face a real dilemma: release terror suspects to comply with laws concerning reasonable detention and risk releasing someone who is a real danger to their countries, or continue detention in violation of international standards.  On the whole they have chosen the former option, although court intervention has been necessary in the UK,  to ensure that suspects cannot be detained indefinitely, and that evidence derived from interrogation involving torture cannot be presented in court. It is a genuine dilemma, but not one that can be resolved by Rice's simple redefinition of legal obligations. <br /><br />Let's consider the specific obligations under the Torture Convention: states parties are obliged not only to refrain from torture, but article 3.1 bars states from returning or extraditing individuals to countries where there are "substantial grounds for believing" that they might be tortured.  This assessment is made, under article 3.2, by examining a state's record, looking for the presence of a "consistent pattern of gross, flagrant or mass violations of human rights."  It is not enough, based upon the plain language of the convention, to ask for a promise that a suspect will not be tortured, not where all of the evidence makes clear that the suspect will likely face torture. Given the destinations of rendered persons, a promise simply cannot suffice. Indeed, the US is alleged to have rendered suspects to countries such as Egypt, Morocco, Syria, and Jordan, countries which the State Department's own annual human rights reports condemn for serious human rights violations.  Sending suspects to such countries virtually guarantees that suspects will indeed be tortured.<br /><br />There is, however, one disheartening sign that the divide between Europe and the US, or at least the US and the UK, may be narrowing.  The UK, unable to indefinitely detain terror suspects, torture them, or even expel them to their home countries, where torture is common, has reached agreements with Libya and Jordan this year in which those countries promise not to torture persons deported back to them. This brings the UK perilously close to the US policy on torture, although it is unlikely that such agreements will be considered sufficient guarantees if challenged before the European Court.<br /><br />Finally, the import and effect of Rice's "clarifications" itself remains unclear. Rice stated that the Torture Convention "extends to U.S. personnel wherever they are, whether they are in the U.S. or outside the U.S." But it is not obvious that this is, in fact, what many in the Administration believe.  Alberto Gonzales, the US Attorney General and author of the infamous "torture memos", said in his confirmation hearings that the Torture Convention's ban does not apply to US interrogations of foreigners abroad.  On this account the US must not torture its own citizens at home and abroad, and cannot torture foreigners on its own territory.  Everyone else is fair game. We may hope that it is Rice, not Gonzales, dictating rules regarding torture, but in the meantime there is great cause for concern. While publicly, at least, European leaders appeared placated by Rice's clarifications, reports indicate that European publics and journalists are not reassured. <br /><br />The Bush Administration's perpetual attempt to redefine the law, subjects, and scope of the obligation not to torture has convinced many that the primary casualty of the "war on terror" is the protection of human rights. Rice's comments seem unlikely to paper over real political and legal divides between the US and Europe regarding human rights and international obligations and institutions more generally, or the widening cultural chasm.<br />    <br /><br /><em>Chandra Lekha Sriram is Chair of Human Rights at the University of East London School of Law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.case.edu/grotian-moment-blog/bio.asp?id=1">Michael Scharf</a>, Director of the Frederick K. Cox International Law Center at Case Western Reserve University School of Law, says White House support of the McCain Amendment signals to the world that the US will no longer condone the use of torture in the &quot;global war on terror&quot;, but it is only a first step toward full prohibition...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/scharf.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>A</strong></font>fter 9/11, many Americans across the political spectrum began to feel that it would be appropriate for the United States to use &quot;unconventional methods&quot; in fighting the war on terrorism.  But in the context of multiple revelations - about the mistreatment of detainees at US detention centers in Guantanamo Bay, Iraq, and Afghanistan; about the practice of "irregular rendition" as a means of outsourcing torture; about the existence of US-created "black sites" where "ghost detainees" are interrogated abroad; and about the content of the leaked "White House torture memos" &#8212; torture and the war on terror have together become one of the most controversial legal issues of our time.<br /><br />In recent months, more and more Americans have begun to ask themselves: How do we combat terrorist threats to our society without destroying the core values of our society?  How do we ensure the survival of our country and at the same time make sure that we can live with what survives?  And in time of war, must the law be silent?<br /><br /> In October 2005 a group of some of the world's leading international law experts met at Case Western Reserve University School of Law to debate these issues (the Conference proceedings are available as <a href="http://www.law.case.edu/centers/cox/content.asp?content_id=77">recorded video</a>).  The experts produced "The Cleveland Principles of International Law on the Detention and Treatment of Persons in Connection with The Global War on Terror," a document endorsed by over 170 current and former high-ranking government, military, and international organization officials, prominent academics, and leading practitioners in the field representing all ends of the political spectrum. The Cleveland Principles were intended as a clear restatement, written in plain English, of the fundamental international legal rules that apply to the treatment of persons in connection with the so-called "Global War on Terror."  The goal was to produce a text that would be easy for the American public, members of the military, and members of Congress to understand &#8212;  a text that would unambiguously spell out that in the context of the Global War on Terror, there is no law-free zone; torture can never be justified under any circumstances; outsourcing torture to foreign governments or private contractors is unlawful; and that government personnel may be criminally liable for involvement in acts of torture.  The full text of the Cleveland Principles and the list of endorsements is <a href="http://www.law.case.edu/centers/cox/content.asp?content_id=85">available online</a>. <br /><br /> Copies of the Cleveland Principles were sent to each of the 535 members of Congress.  Last week, President Bush, under intense bipartisan pressure from both Houses of Congress, announced that he would sign the McCain Anti-Torture Amendment into law.  The McCain Amendment makes it unlawful for US. personnel to subject anyone in US custody to torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, whether in the United States or Abroad.  <br /><br />The McCain legislation establishes that the prohibition on torture is not just a matter of policy, but is now enshrined in federal law, enforceable in US courts and binding even on the President and his top advisors.  Those that violate the prohibition therefore face possible prosecution and civil suits.  In this way, the McCain Amendment will have an effect similar to the Bolan Amendment of which NSC officials Oliver North and John Poindexter ran afoul in the 1980s, leading to the Iran Contra prosecutions.  <br /><br />The White House had sought an exemption for the CIA, but backed down and accepted a text that covers all US personnel, including both military and intelligence. <br /><br />By establishing the Army Field Manual as the uniform standard for interrogation of detainees, the McCain amendment bans not just the worst forms of torture, but also tactics that have been labeled "torture light" such as lengthy sleep deprivation, the use of painful stress positions, removal of clothing, exposure to extremely uncomfortable cell temperatures, and the use of scenarios designed to convince the detainee that death or severely painful consequences are imminent.<br /><br />In a compromise with the White House, the McCain legislation extends to intelligence officers a protection now afforded to military personnel, who if accused of violating interrogation rules can defend themselves if a reasonable person could have concluded they were following a lawful order.  But because the legislation provides clarification of the limits of what is and is not acceptable in interrogating terrorists, it will be much harder for interrogators to take advantage of this potential defense.<br /><br />Moreover, the recognition of this limited obedience to orders defense triggers application of the doctrine of superior responsibility, under which a superior in the chain of command is liable for either ordering an unlawful action, or for failing to prevent or punish such action undertaken by his subordinates.   <br />     <br />The McCain legislation sends an important signal to the world that the United States will no longer condone the use of torture in its "Global War on Terror."  But the legislation is just a first step.  Since it applies only to persons "in US custody," it does not apply to the highly controversial practices of irregular rendition and outsourcing torture to foreign governments and private parties acting on behalf of our government.   This will be the next legal battleground.<br /><br /><br /><em><a href="http://law.case.edu/grotian-moment-blog/bio.asp?id=1">Michael Scharf</a> is Professor of Law and Director of the Frederick K.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.amherst.edu/~ljst/faculty.html#asarat">Austin Sarat</a>, William Nelson Cromwell Professor of Jurisprudence and Political Science at Amherst College, says that California Arnold Schwarzenegger&#39;s ruling denying clemency in ths case of Crips gang co-founder Stanley &quot;Tookie&quot; Williams disregarded the constitutional foundations of clemency practice...<br /><hr size=1><br /><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 ALIGN=LEFT> <tr><td><img src="/forumy/austinsarat.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=0 VSPACE=2></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=5></td></tr><tr><td COLSPAN=2><img src="/images/s.gif" HEIGHT=1 WIDTH=1></td></tr></table> <font SIZE=3><b>B</strong></font>y denying clemency to Stanley &quot;Tookie&quot; Williams Arnold Schwarzenegger did more than allow another execution to be carried out. He broke faith with the understandings of those who wrote our Constitution and damaged the intricate balance of our constitutional government. Casually dismissing Williams&#39;s contention that he had been &quot;reformed and...redeemed for his violent past,&quot; Governor Schwarzenegger&#39;s treated his own clemency power as a narrow and limited one. As he explained, the clemency power should not be used &quot;to nullify the jury&#39;s decision of guilt and sentence....&quot; except to prevent miscarriages of justice. This is not the way the clemency power was understood by those who made the power &quot;to grant pardons and reprieves&quot; part of our constitutional system, nor, throughout most of our history, by those charged with interpreting that power or with exercising it.  <br /><br />Although the original versions of the New York and Virginia Plans that provided the frameworks for debate at the Constitutional Convention included no provisions for pardon, revisions to both plans eventually did. The power that emerged from the convention was regarded by the Framers of the Constitution as necessary to a humane and effective scheme of government. Defending executive clemency Alexander Hamilton said, &quot;Humanity and good policy conspire to dictate, that the benign prerogative of pardoning should be as little fettered as possible.&quot;<br /><br />Hamilton thought that the pardon power would and should be used mercifully, otherwise &quot;justice would wear a countenance too sanguinary and cruel&quot; and, in its merciful use, would ennoble those who wielded it.<br /> <br />Hamilton&#39;s understanding of clemency has been reiterated throughout American history by judges and politicians alike. Writing in 1833, in the first clemency case to reach the United States Supreme Court, Chief Justice John Marshall called pardon &quot;an act of grace, proceeding from the power entrusted with the execution of the laws....&quot; Twenty years later, the Supreme Court again embraced a very broad view of the clemency power, saying &quot;Without such a power of clemency, to be exercised by some department or functionary of a government, it would be most imperfect and deficient in its political morality, and in that attribute of Deity whose judgments are always tempered with mercy.&quot; In 1866 Justice Field wrote approvingly of what he called the &quot;benign prerogative of mercy.&quot; <br /><br />Lest anyone think that this is an outmoded, old fashioned conception of clemency, from time-to-time a similar standard has been embraced by governors and judges in our own era. Terry Sanford, Governor of North Carolina from 1961-65, provides one example of such a view. &quot;The Executive,&quot; Sanford wrote &quot;is charged with the exercise in the name of the people of an ... important attitude of a healthy society - that of mercy beyond the strict framework of the law.... Executive clemency does not involve the changing of any judicial determination. It does not eliminate punishment; it does consider rehabilitation. To decide when and where such mercy should be extended is a decision which must be made by the Executive....It falls to the Governor to blend mercy with justice, as best he can, involving human as well as legal considerations, in the light of all circumstances after the passage of time, but before justice is allowed to overrun mercy in the name of the power of the state.&quot; <br /><br />Chief Justice William Rehnquist, in a 1993 Supreme Court decision, called clemency the sovereign&#39;s &quot;power to extend mercy, whenever he thinks it is deserved....&quot;, and five years later said it was &quot;a matter of grace.&quot; Rehnquist suggested that this power was designed to allow the executive &quot;to consider a wide range of factors not comprehensible by earlier judicial proceedings and sentencing determinations.&quot; <br /><br />Yet, at least in the context of capital cases, this broad understanding of clemency steadily has been losing favor along with clemency itself.<br /><br />From 1994-2004 (excluding former Illinois Gov. George Ryan&#39;s mass commutation of his state&#39;s death row) 25 clemencies were granted across the entire country; forty years earlier in the decade 1954-1964 there were 198 clemencies. As one commentator puts it, capital clemency has &quot;died its own death, the victim of a political lethal injection and a public that overwhelmingly supports the death penalty.&quot; Thus at the outset of his administration, then Texas Governor George Bush embraced a standard for clemency that all but ensured that few if any death sentences would be seriously examined. &quot;In every case,&quot; [Bush] wrote in <em>A Charge to Keep</em>, &quot;I would ask: Is there any doubt about this individual&#39;s guilt or innocence? And, have the courts had ample opportunity to review all the legal issues in this case?&quot; During his six years as governor 150 men and two women were executed in Texas; Bush allowed the execution to proceed in all cases but one. As the journalist Alan Berlow notes, &quot;This is an extraordinarily narrow notion of clemency review: it leaves little, if any, room to consider mental illness or incompetence, childhood physical or sexual abuse, remorse, rehabilitation, racial discrimination, the competence of the legal defense, or disparities in sentences between co-defendants or among defendants convicted of similar crimes.&quot; It leaves little room for the kind of claims made by, and on behalf of, Tookie Williams. It is this cramped conception that animated Schwarzenegger&#39;s decision to allow Williams&#39;s execution to proceed.<br /><br />Many governors today have turned crime fighting, tough-on-crime policy into a strategy for building political coalitions and strengthening their electoral prospects. Many are afraid that granting clemency to convicted murderers will leave them vulnerable to damaging charges that they are soft-on-crime. As a result, they have let the clemency power atrophy rather than courageously exercising their discretion to accord mercy to the condemned. In doing so they have departed from the original understanding of that power and historical practice. In the Williams case,  Governor Schwarzenegger missed an opportunity to reverse that trend and did a disservice not only to Tookie Williams, but to all of us.<br /><br /><br /><em>Austin Sarat is William Nelson Cromwell Professor of Jurisprudence and Political Science and Five College Fortieth Anniversary Professor at Amherst College and author of </em><a href="http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/titles/8018.html">Mercy on Trial: What It Means to Stop an Execution</a><em></em><br />
